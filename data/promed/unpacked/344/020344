SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY/BSE: WHO PANEL TO MEET NEXT WEEK; WHO FACT SHEET
==========================================================================
>From WHO server:
[1]
WHO Panel to meet next week:
In the light of the 10 human cases of a new variant of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease reported by the United Kingdom
on 20 March 1996, a WHO meeting of international experts in
neurology, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies,
epidemiology, veterinary science and public health is
being organized on 2-3 April 1996 to review the present
situation and to make further technical and public health
recommendations as required. In particular, the meeting will
identify those technical and scientific issues
which must be addressed in developing best practices
that will protect the consumer. WHO recommends that if
similar disease is identified in any other countries, the
national health authorities should be immediately notified.
The conclusions of the meeting will be published in the Weekly
Epidemiological Record.

WHO Fact sheet N113 March 1996
BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY (BSE)
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) first came to the attention of the
scientific community in November 1986 with the appearance in cattle of a
newly-recognized form of neurological disease in the United Kingdom. Between
November 1986 and May 1995 approximately 150 000 cases of this
newly-recognized cattle disease were confirmed from approximately 33500
herds of cattle in the UK. Epidemiological studies in the United Kingdom at
that time suggested that the source of disease was cattle feed prepared from
carcasses of dead cattle, and that changes in the process of preparing
cattle feed introduced in 1981-1982 may have been a risk factor. Speculation
as to the cause of the appearance of the disease in the food chain of cattle
has ranged from spontaneous occurrence in cattle, the carcasses of which
then entered the cattle food chain; to entry into the cattle food chain from
the carcasses of sheep with a similar disease.
BSE is associated with a transmissible agent, the nature of which is not yet
fully understood. The agent affects the brain and spinal cord of cattle and
is characterized by sponge-like changes visible with an ordinary microscope.
It is a highly stable agent, resisting heating to normal cooking
temperatures and even higher temperatures such as those used for
sterilization, freezing, and drying. The disease is fatal for cattle within
weeks to months of its onset.
By May 1995, BSE had been reported from 10 countries and areas outside the
United Kingdom. In one group of countries - France, Portugal, Republic of
Ireland and Switzerland - the disease occurred in native cattle, and this
was thought to be in part related to importation of cattle feed from the UK.
In another group - Falkland Islands (Las Malvinas), Oman Sultanate, Germany,
Canada, Italy and Denmark - cases were only identified in cattle imported
from the UK.
In July 1988 the UK banned the use of cattle carcasses in the preparation of
cattle feed, and in 1989 the UK banned the use of brain and spinal cord - as
well as tonsil, thymus, spleen and intestine - of cattle origin (known as
Specified Bovine Offals or SBOs) in foods for human consumption. Cattle are
continuously monitored for BSE in all affected countries, and BSE is
decreasing in the UK.
BSE is one of several different forms of transmissible brain disease of
animals. Others include scrapie, a disease common in sheep; a similar
neurological disease in animals such as the mink, mule deer and elk; and,
recently, neurological disease in household cats, the majority of which
appear to have been in the United Kingdom.
Diseases in humans with sponge-like findings in brain under the microscope,
and with severe and fatal neurological signs and symptoms, include kuru, a
disease which appears to be transmitted by human ritual handling of bodies
and brains of the dead; and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD occurs in a
form associated with a hereditary predisposition (approximately 10% of
cases); and in a more common, sporadic form that accounts for the remaining
90%. In recent years, it has been shown that CJD can be transmitted to
humans by treatment with natural human growth hormone or grafting of tissues
surrounding human brain, and these means of transmission have now been
controlled in the industrialized countries where these procedures were
practised. Another similar human disease is Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome
which appears to be familial, occurring in persons with an apparent
hereditary predisposition.
After the identification of BSE, and as a regular activity to continue the
study of the possible hazards of BSE for humans, WHO held three meetings on
the spongiform encephalopathies in 1991, 1993 and 1995; and one in
collaboration with the Office of International Epizootics in 1994. The
purpose of these meetings was to review the existing state of knowledge on
spongiform encephalopathies including BSE, to evaluate possible means of
transmission, and to identify risk factors for infection. An express purpose
of these meetings was to review the possible human public health
implications of animal spongiform encephalopathies, with special emphasis on
BSE.
The most recent WHO meeting compared the annual number of cases of CJD in
France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. This comparison
showed that rates were similar in all these countries (approximately 1 per
million), as was the age distribution and duration of illness prior to
death. Cases reported from the United Kingdom were those which were
identified through routine reporting and from an intensified surveillance
system for CJD-like illness which had been set up in 1990.
Conclusions of this meeting were that the epidemiological evidence in Europe
did not indicate a change in the incidence of CJD that could be attributed
to BSE; and that if the measures taken in the United Kingdom regarding
cattle feed and SBOs for human consumption, as well as other precautionary
measures at farm, slaughter and meat processing levels were being strictly
implemented, the risk of BSE transmission, and therefore of possible
transmission of BSE to humans, would be minimized. The meeting recommended
that WHO encourage research on BSE and its possible implications for human
public health, and that WHO continue to provide guidance to countries in
order to minimize the risk of transmission of BSE as described above, and of
transmission of human diseases such as CJD through medical procedures.
During the past ten months, 10 humans in the United Kingdom have been
identified with what appears to be a variant of CJD. The onset of the first
case appears to have been as early as February 1994, and 8 of the 10
patients have died to date. These ten cases are all under the age of 42
years and some have had behavioural changes at the onset. All 10 cases have
had a prolonged course of disease.
Results of patient interviews and medical history, genetic analysis and
testing for other possible causes of this disease were reviewed by the
United Kingdom Advisory Committee on Spongiform Encephalopathy which
concluded that "although there is no direct evidence of a link on current
data and in the absence of any credible alternative the most likely
explanation at present is that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE
before the introduction of the specified bovine offal ban in 1989". On 20
March 1996 the United Kingdom officially reported the cases and conclusions
of this Committee in a press conference.
In the light of the new information on the 10 human cases of variant CJD
reported by the United Kingdom on 20 March 1996, a WHO meeting of
international experts in neurology, transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies, epidemiology, veterinary science and public health is
being organized at WHO Headquarters in Geneva on 2-3 April 1996 to review
the present situation and to make further technical and public health
recommendations as required. In particular, the meeting will identify those
technical and scientific issues which must be addressed in developing best
practices that will protect the consumer. WHO recommends that if similar
disease is identified in any other countries, the national health
authorities should be immediately notified. An updated fact sheet will be
provided at the conclusion of the 2-3 April meeting. A press release will be
issued on Wednesday 3 April and a press conference held at 14 h.00 at the
Palais des Nations in Geneva.
