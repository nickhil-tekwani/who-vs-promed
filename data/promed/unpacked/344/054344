1st Report of Soybean Rust Caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ in Uruguay.

2005; published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0909C. Accepted for
publication 12 May 2005.
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ is a fairly new pathogen in South America and has
become a serious threat for soybean production in the region (3). During
May 2004, soybean (_Glycine max_) leaves with rust symptoms were observed
on an experimental trial at La Estanzuela, National Institute for
Agricultural Research in Colonia, southwestern Uruguay, on late-maturing
genotypes (R7 stage).
Small, necrotic, reddish brown lesions, suggestive of soybean rust, were
detected on the upper surface of leaves. Uredinia and urediniospores were
found on the underside of the leaves. The National Service of Plant Health
(DGSA) was informed immediately. There the genus _Phakopsora_ was confirmed
on the basis of urediniospore morphology.
These spores were minutely equinulated and measured 21 x 26.3 micrometers
(range 18 to 24 and 22 to 30 micrometers, respectively), which was within
the range described by Ono et al. (2). Leaf samples showing rust symptoms
were submitted to the Instituto Ewald A. Favret (Instituto Nacional de
Tecnologia Agropecuaria, Argentina) for polymerase chain reaction assay
using primer pairs Ppa1/Ppa2 (_P. pachyrhizi_) and Pme1/Pme2 (_P.
meibomiae_) (1).
Results showed _P. pachyrhizi_ as the causal agent of soybean rust, while
_P. meibomiae_ tests yielded negative results. Pathogenicity tests were
carried out on 10 V4 soybean plants, cv. Don Mario 5800, grown in the
greenhouse at 20 to 22 C and a 14-h photoperiod. Urediniospores were
collected with a cyclone spore collector into glass tubes, which were then
filled with nonphytotoxic light industrial oil. Spore suspension was
atomized onto 8 plants, while 2 plants were sprayed only with oil as
controls. Plants were placed in a dew chamber at 20 C and 100 percent
relative humidity for 20 h and then returned to prior conditions.
Symptoms of the disease were reproduced 10 days after inoculation. 2-3
sporulating uredinia were observed only on the inoculated plants.
Soybean rust caused by _P. pachyrhizi_ was officially recognized as present
in Uruguay in August 2004.

[Laura Karlen of Ag Advisory, an Algona, Iowa, crop consulting firm,
returned in early April after visiting Argentina and Uruguay. ASR had been
detected in a few spots in both countries before planting. ASR subsequently
blanketed Uruguay and central Argentina, where much of that nation's
soybean production occurs. Excellent preparation by farmers, agronomists,
plant pathologists and others has helped them weather ASR.
There are differences between the 2 countries. According to Karlen, "They
have a different climate and wind patterns and we can learn from them. The
growing climate of these countries more closely resembles that of the
United States than does the steamy tropical environment of Brazil. It's
more like Arkansas and Missouri, where frost occurs in the winter," says
Karlen.
Similarities also include spore arrival via wind. In the fall of 2004,
hurricanes blew ASR spores northward into the United States. It was the
opposite situation in Argentina and Uruguay, where northward winds blew
spores in from the ASR hotbed of Brazil. Once ASR was initially detected in
Uruguay and central Argentina, it quickly surfaced all over. Soybeans
double-cropped after wheat in Uruguay were the most prone to infection, as
they were in the R4 (full pod) and R5 (beginning seed) stages. These fields
were more likely to be infected and treated than early-planted soybeans
that were further along in the R6 (full seed) stage.
Farmers treat infected fields with curative fungicides or a mixture of
curative and preventive fungicides. These mixtures include fungicides from
both the triazole and strobilurin families, which also are approved for use
in the United States.
