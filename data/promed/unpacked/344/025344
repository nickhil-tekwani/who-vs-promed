A young lab technician in France developed a rare and fatal brain disease after she was accidentally exposed to prions, the infectious proteins that cause "mad cow disease," according to a new report of the case.

The accident happened in May 2010, when the technician was 24 years old and working in a prion research lab, according to the report, published Wed 1 Jul 2020 in The New England Journal of Medicine. She worked with samples of brain tissue from mice that had been infected with a form of mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

While she was using forceps to handle the samples, she accidentally stabbed her thumb through a double pair of latex gloves, enough to break the skin and cause bleeding, the report said. More than 7 years later, in November 2017, the woman began to experience a "burning pain" in her neck and right shoulder, which later spread to the right side of her body. One year later, in November 2018, doctors examined a sample of her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which appeared normal. But by January 2019, she began experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiousness, memory impairment, and visual hallucinations. In March 2019, samples of her CSF and blood tested positive for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a fatal brain condition that can take years to show up after exposure to "mad cow disease" prions. The woman died in June 2019, 19 months after her symptoms 1st appeared.

Only a few hundred cases of vCJD have ever been reported, and most were tied to consumption of contaminated beef (from cows infected with mad cow disease) in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and 1990s, Live Science previously reported. The disease results from prion proteins that fold abnormally, leading to lesions in a person's brain. There is strong evidence that the prions that cause mad cow disease also caused the U.K. outbreak of vCJD in the 1980s and 1990s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (It is important to note that "classic" Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a related but separate condition from vCJD. Classic CJD was 1st diagnosed in 1920, and can be inherited or occur sporadically, and is not linked to consumption of contaminated beef.)

Since the woman was born around the start of the BSE cattle outbreak, it is possible that she could have contracted vCJD through consumption of contaminated beef, but this scenario is unlikely, according to the report authors, from Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, the public hospital system in Paris.

On average, vCJD takes about 10 years to show up after exposure to contaminated food, and the last 2 patients with vCJD in France and the U.K. died in 2013 and 2014, the report said. So, it's possible that the woman developed the disease from exposure to lab materials contaminated with prions. Studies in animals have shown that injection into the skin is an effective route of transmission for these prions.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorder believed to be caused by an abnormal isoform of a cellular glycoprotein known as the prion protein. CJD occurs worldwide, and the estimated annual incidence in many countries, including the United States, has been reported to be about one case per million population.

CJD is not transmissible from person-to-person by normal contact or through environmental contamination. For example, it is not spread by airborne droplets as are tuberculosis (TB) and influenza or by blood or sexual contact as are hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). CJD transmission can occur during invasive medical procedures involving the central nervous system due to exposure to contaminated brain tissue. This accounts for less than one percent of all CJD cases. The majority of cases occur sporadically, but some individuals can also develop CJD because of an inherited mutation.

Classic CJD is a human prion disease. It is a neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic clinical and diagnostic features. This disease is rapidly progressive and always fatal. Infection with this disease leads to death, usually within one year of onset of illness.

The variant form of CJD should not be confused with the classic form of CJD that is endemic throughout the world, including the United States. There are several important differences between these 2 forms of the disease. The median age at death of patients with classic CJD in the United States, for example, is 68 years, and very few cases occur in persons under 30 years of age. In contrast, the median age at death of patients with vCJD in the United Kingdom is 28 years.

vCJD can be confirmed only through examination of brain tissue obtained by biopsy or at autopsy, but a "probable case" of vCJD can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria developed in the United Kingdom. The incubation period for vCJD is unknown because it is a new disease. However, it is likely that ultimately this incubation period will be measured in terms of many years or decades. In other words, whenever a person develops vCJD from consuming a BSE-contaminated product, he or she likely would have consumed that product many years or a decade or more earlier.

Whereas the majority of cases of CJD (about 85%) occur as sporadic disease, a smaller proportion of patients (5-15%) develop CJD because of inherited mutations of the prion protein gene. These inherited forms include Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia.

While the most efficient route for CNS prion propagation is by direct intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation, it is believed that the natural transmission of prion disease occurs principally by peripheral inoculation (15). After peripheral inoculation, both the nervous system and the lymphoreticular system may be involved in neuroinvasion of the CNS by prions.

In contrast to classic CJD, vCJD in the United Kingdom predominantly affects younger people, has atypical clinical features, with prominent psychiatric or sensory symptoms at the time of clinical presentation, and delayed onset of neurologic abnormalities, including ataxia within weeks or months, dementia and myoclonus late in the illness, a duration of illness of at least 6 months, and a diffusely abnormal non-diagnostic electroencephalogram.

The characteristic neuropathologic profile of variant CJD includes, in both the cerebellum and cerebrum, numerous kuru-type amyloid plaques surrounded by vacuoles and prion protein (PrP) accumulation at high concentration indicated by immunohistochemical analysis [https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cjd/classic-variant.html].

There is currently no cure for prion diseases. Instead, treatment focuses on providing supportive care and easing symptoms. - Mod.UBA
