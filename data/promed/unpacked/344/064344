[1] WHO SAGE meeting

WHO warns of 'alarming up-surge in Measles which has devastating impact -says linked to poor uptake of 2nd dose of vaccine.

Speaking after a 2-day meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, Kate O'Brien, the WHO's department director, said the world "is facing an alarming upsurge in measles cases in all regions".

"The impact of these outbreaks is really devastating," she said, "causing not only widespread loss of life, but also preventable disability that is affecting family livelihoods and national economies, and straining healthcare systems."

Latest WHO global data show that reported cases of measles - which is one of the world's most contagious diseases - rose by 300% globally in the 1st 3 months of this year [2019] compared to the same period in 2018. This follows consecutive increases over the past 2 years.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, but it can be prevented with 2 doses of vaccine. The vast majority of cases of infection are in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated people.

Outbreaks of the disease are causing tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, the Philippines, Sudan, Thailand and Ukraine, among other countries, the WHO said.

The SAGE experts said such outbreaks were clear indications of critical gaps in vaccination coverage and urged authorities to do more to raise rates of immunization.

Alejandro Cravioto, the group's chair, told reporters on a teleconference from the WHO's Geneva headquarters that this was "an alarming situation". He said latest global figures show about 86% coverage with a 1st measles vaccine dose, and less than 70% for a 2nd dose, "which is one of the root causes of the problem".

"The strategy needs to be reinforced," he said. "There is no reason why we cannot try to reach every child to enable them to be fully immunized and protected against this disease."

If you visited the Philadelphia International Airport earlier this month, you may have been exposed to measles. The Pennsylvania Department of Health warned the public on [Fri 11 Oct 2019] that anyone who visited the airport on [2 or 3 Oct 2019] could have contracted the viral infection.

"The Department of Health is working with the county and municipal health departments to notify Pennsylvanians who were on flights with the suspected case, but other individuals may have been exposed at the airport during the identified times," Secretary of Health Rachel Levin said in a statement, adding, "however, if you have been properly immunized against measles, your risk of getting the disease is minimal."

An individual who is suspected of having measles was at the airport on both days and may have exposed other people, Levine said.

So far this year [2019], there have been 15 confirmed cases of measles in Pennsylvania. In the US, there have been more than 1200 cases, marking the greatest number of cases reported in the country since 1992.

Pennsylvania health officials are warning residents who visited several locations in Allentown last week that they may have been exposed to the measles. A patient who has a confirmed case of the measles visited these locations between [Mon 7 Oct and Sat 12 Oct 2019] [see URL for location and times of possible exposure].

"A patient in Lehigh Valley Hospital has a confirmed case of measles, which can be highly contagious," Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said. "The Department of Health is working with the Allentown Health Bureau and Lehigh Valley Health Network to notify Pennsylvanians who were in these locations during the identified times and areas; however, if you have been properly immunized against measles, your risk of getting the disease is minimal."

There have been 16 confirmed measles cases in the state so far this year. [Note, report above states a total of 15 cases. - Mod.LK]

The Florida Department of Health has confirmed 1 case of measles in a child who was not vaccinated in Duval County.

Health officials told Action News Jax a local hospital reported the case and then they stepped in and started an investigation. "In doing that, we were able to kind of map out the steps the family went through and where the child may have visited, and we contacted those places directly to make them aware that folks that visited those facilities may have been exposed," said Dr. Pauline Rolle, the Department of Health Medical Director for Duval County.

"Children, particularly for measles, mumps, or rubella, need to be vaccinated between 12 months and 15 months of age and again at 4 to 6 years of age," said Dr. Rolle.

Measles can result in hospitalizations, pneumonia and skin infections, which is why Brenna and Cory said they take all necessary precautions including getting their children vaccinated.

HM and his wife, NM, were among the 1st parents to arrive for the measles vaccination at Nzombi Health Centre in Masi Manimba, a village 400 km [approx. 250 mi] south of Kinshasa.

They brought their 3-year-old triplet girls. The children had missed out on being vaccinated for measles at the designated age of 6 months and are in serious danger of infection.

HM and his wife are among the hundreds of thousands of parents across the Democratic Republic of the Congo who rushed to have their children vaccinated following the launch of a measles campaign by the Government, the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners.

A few streets from the health centre, community mobilizer Mundumusi Lipsa bellows through his megaphone, calling on parents to take children who are not vaccinated to the health centres offering the vaccination. His colleague, Lula Pwati, and a WHO epidemiologist are going from house to house to make sure no child is left behind.

According to preliminary reporting on coverage, the 9-day vaccination campaign that reached the triplets of HM and NM most likely will go beyond the targeted 825 000 children in what has become the world's largest and fastest-moving outbreak. To date, the number of suspected cases has gone beyond 203 000 (6276 confirmed), with more than 4000 deaths, nearly all of them children. This vaccination campaign is the 3rd emergency intervention targeting children aged 6--59 months.

"Measles is a disease that not only kills but also has very serious complications. Health workers must always remind parents to take the children for the shot on time," says Dr. Helene Chenge, a WHO epidemiologist.

The campaign is funded by the United Nations Humanitarian Pooled Fund, with contributions from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies and from the Measles and Rubella Initiative.

A 5-day follow-up immunization campaign in 7 provinces is slated to begin on [22 Oct 2019] to provide supplemental doses to children aged 9-59 months and thus reach those who were not vaccinated through the routine immunization programme.

The mother of a 1-year-old has told media in Samoa that her son who was highly suspected of having measles has died. The boy had been confined for a week at the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital at Motootua isolation unit for patients suspected of having measles, and died on White Sunday [13 Oct 2019].

The mother told the Samoa Observer that her son was 1st admitted last [Mon 14 Oct 2019].

The Ministry of Health Assistant Chief Executive Officer, Tagaloa Robert Thomsen, said the Ministry could not confirm the cause of the child's death, or even if the child was infected with measles until conclusive testing had been completed.

Dr. Helen Aspasia Petousis-Harris, a vaccinologist and senior lecturer at the University of Auckland, said there were too many variables and possible coincidental conditions to draw conclusions about the boy's cause of death until further testing.

But Samoan authorities have feared the possible arrival of the disease - often described as the most contagious of any virus - from New Zealand, which has recently been struck by a record outbreak of more than 1800 cases, mostly in Auckland.

Last week, the ministry's director-general Leauasa Dr. Take Naseri told media that 38 samples of suspected measles have been dispatched to Melbourne for testing.

The Ministry of Health held a news conference in Apia on [Wed 9 Oct 2019] and said if lab results sent to Melbourne were positive, an outbreak would be declared.

Our correspondent in Samoa, Autagavaia Tipi Autagavaia, said the sick adult came into contact with an Aucklander who travelled to Samoa for a conference at the end of August 2019.

The Aucklander was diagnosed with the highly contagious viral illness after returning to New Zealand, Autagavaia said.

"A total of 6 people who were the contacts of that person were checked and followed up by the Ministry of Health here. And 1 out of those 6 is likely to be positive," Autagavaia said. "The sample from that person has been sent overseas for a test to confirm whether it's a measles case."

As many as 38 samples from other suspected measles cases in Samoa have also been sent to Australia for testing, Autagavaia said; 25 samples were sent last week and 13 this week, mostly from unwell children under the age of 4 who live in Apia.

New Zealand has had 1731 confirmed cases of measles notified so far this year [2019]. More than 1400 of those are in Auckland, where the worst outbreak in 20 years is concentrated. - Mod.LK]

Measles epidemic declared in Samoa

Samoa's government has confirmed a measles epidemic. 7 cases had been confirmed, and it said the death of a 1-year-old last week was also likely to be because of measles. In a statement, Samoa's government said test results back from Australia showed 2 adults and 5 children had measles. They have been treated and discharged.

But it also said the death of a baby last week was "highly suspected" to be because of the highly contagious virus, but tests were still being carried out. None of them were vaccinated.

The Health Ministry said it anticipated more cases, and a measles epidemic had officially been declared in Samoa.
It urged people to get vaccinated in clinics across the country, and to avoid crowded areas.
