[1] Guinea: state of emergency

Guinean President Alpha Conde late on Wednesday [13 Aug 2014] declared a national health emergency over the Ebola virus disease outbreak, according to Agence France-Presse. "The World Health Organisation has declared a global health emergency over Ebola [virus disease]. Considering that Guinea is a signatory to the WHO constitution I declare Ebola [virus disease] a national health emergency in Guinea," Conde said in a statement.

[2] Temperature screening
Date: Thu 14 Aug 2014
Source: Liberian Observer [edited]
http://www.liberianobserver.com/news/nurses-use-3-thermometers-thousands


The Government of Liberia has begun testing citizens of 8 counties [districts] for the deadly Ebola disease. This testing of individuals is meant to control the spread from counties believed to be highly infected with the killer disease. Several counties, including Bomi, Lofa, Grand Cape Mount, Grand Bassa, Margibi Montserrado and Grand Gedeh, have been controlled to regulate the movement of people going in and out of those areas.

The Daily Observer recently discovered that the ... temperatures of those leaving from one area to another were tested by nurses assigned at various checkpoints using only 3 [clinical] thermometers. The testing process has been questioned by some segments of the Liberian society, including foreign nationals who visited Bomi over the weekend. Bomi County is among 8 counties quarantined by the Liberian government.

In an interview with the Daily Observer over the weekend [9-10 Aug 2014], Mr. Shang Guan, a Chinese national, said the intention of the government is good but is also dangerous to the health of citizens and foreigners alike. Mr. Guan refused to be tested with any of the 3 thermometers used by the county health team at the Bomi checkpoint. He said the use of manual thermometers to check the temperature of travelers as a means of containing the spread of the deadly virus was not the right thing to do. Experts have said that one way the deadly Ebola virus is spread is through contact with bodily fluids. Thermometers are either inserted in the mouth or under the arm, both of which involve the transfer of saliva and sweat respectively.

According to him, ... it would be prudent for authorities at the Health Ministry to use advanced rather than standard thermometers that do not involve physical contact with individuals. "I was worried about taking the test because even if you have malaria your temperature will be high and even if that person has EVD, it might spread to the others just by the use of so few thermometers," Mr. Guan said. He disclosed that what was even more scary to him was that all those who were being tested used the same 3 thermometers, with nurses having physical contact with travelers. Such a situation is highly risky for the people of Liberia. The Chinese national hailed Liberians as well as foreigners alike who have cooperated with the testing, but suggested that the limited thermometers being used must be well sanitized to avoid endangering the lives of others.

Another Liberian, Oscar Dolo, who was seen at the checkpoint, said the process was poorly coordinated by the county health authorities. He added that the process was hampering their free movement from one area to another. "I came since this morning and spent over 2 hours at this checkpoint. Those health workers who were to come early were the last to arrive, keeping us here for hours."

The government of Nepal has organized a medical desk at Nepal's only international airport, Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, to identify travelers who might have EVD for evaluation and referral. They are also setting up posts at important border points with India. Please see the above media link.

[4] Ebola virus disease compendium
Date: Thu 14 Aug 2014
From: <butenop@medbox.org> [edited]


The Ebola Toolbox offers a comprehensive knowledge repository aimed at improving the effectiveness of interventions aimed at tackling EVD in emergencies. With over 90 documents relating to practical, hands-on field work relating to Ebola, it is by now the largest collection of documents on EVD on the internet: http://www.medbox.org/ebola-toolbox/listing.

MEDBOX (http://www.medbox.org) is a new and innovative online library aimed at improving the quality of health care in humanitarian action worldwide. Based on the assumption that humanitarian health workers around the world can act effectively if they have access to the necessary tools, MEDBOX collates the increasing number of professional guidelines, textbooks and practical documents on health action available online and brings these into the hands of aid workers: when they need it, where they need it. Whilst already comprising of over 1700 documents, MEDBOX is still under development and thrives to increase partnerships and collaboration to complete its library. Do you know of more open-access tools and documents for EVD, such as IEC [information, education and communication] materials/posters, flip charts, videos, PowerPoint presentations? Please contact us at the email below and share.

MEDBOX is a free-of-charge, open-source online library supported by funding from the German Foreign Ministry, the Humanitarian Innovation Fund and currently 20 international organisations and institutions. With a 3-step, free-of-charge registration, users can set up their own library of favourites within MEDBOX. MEDBOX has currently over 1000 visitors per week, the majority of whom use the Ebola Toolbox.

MEDBOX is brought to you by the Medical Mission Institute, the Catholic Advisory Group for International Health.

[5] Media reports


Nigeria: 16 000 doctors sacked
------------------------------
President Jonathan Sacks 16 000 Nigerian Resident Doctors. The President has ordered the sack of all resident doctors in Nigerian hospitals. The sack was contained in a directive by Mr. Jonathan to the Federal Ministry of Health to suspend all residency training programme for Nigerian doctors.
http://saharareporters.com/2014/08/14/president-jonathan-sacks-16000-nigerian-resident-doctors

[This is in response to a long, ongoing doctors' strike. This could affect the country's response to the EVD crisis. - Mod.JW]

Liberia: dead bodies in open
----------------------------
14 Aug 2014: 1st West Point EVD body removed Wednesday [13 Aug 2014], other suspected cases there may include some Guineans. The body of an EVD victim in West Point, Monrovia's largest slum [in the capital], was yesterday [13 Aug 2014] removed after 2 nights in the open. The West Point Commissioner, Madam Haja Flowers, told the Daily Observer, the individual, a male, dropped dead on Monday [11 Aug 2014] and repeated calls were made for his removal, but response was delayed. However, on Wednesday morning government people came and picked up the body for transport to the crematorium.... Observers said West Point inhabitants were very worried about the body tarrying for a long period in the township, fearing that its exposure to the general population might have provoked a further spread of the deadly ebolavirus....

[It is very doubtful anybody touched the body for fear of contamination, and the ebolavirus cannot spread through the air to a passerby. - Mod.JW]

Singapore prevention exercise
-----------------------------
14 Aug 2014: Today, in a drill to respond to the potential arrival of a suspected EVD patient from abroad, Singapore conducted a patient isolation exercise at Changi International airport. Responders practiced placing a "patient" in a mobile isolation unit, and transporting the patient to the designated EVD-management hospital, Tan Tock Seng. Tan Tock Seng gained experience (and global admiration) for its care of SARS patients in 2003.... Singapore is not over-reacting, or paranoid, or hysterical. Singapore officials are facing what might happen, while reassuring people that it hasn't happened yet -- this time.

The company said it would determine whether to resume the flights based on a change in conditions. It did not elaborate.
