China: 200 000 chickens culled
-----------------------------------
Nearly 200 000 chickens have been culled in northern China after the
world's most populous nation reported its 1st outbreak of bird flu in
nearly a month, said the government officials on Wednesday [8 Feb
2006].
The agriculture ministry said that the outbreak took place in a large
poultry farm in northern China's Shanxi province, with 15 000
chickens dying from the virus in 2 days last week.
The ministry said local authorities immediately started culling
poultry within a 3-km radius of the affected farm and had so far
destroyed 187 745 fowl.
China has now reported 34 outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 strain of the
virus among poultry since the beginning of last year [2005], with
most appearing since October [2005]. The virus has infected 10
people, killing 7 of them. It has also had a major impact on the
nation's poultry industry, which was the world's largest with an
annual production of 14 billion birds.
The government said in November last year [2005] that 21.1 million
poultry had been culled because of the bird flu virus, while the
government had attempted to vaccinate every chicken in the country.
The previous outbreak was reported on 10 Jan 2006 in the southern
province of Guizhou, although human fatalities have since been
recorded in areas where the virus was not detected.
The latest outbreak, in Yangquan city of Shanxi province, took place
during China's week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which officially
ended on Saturday [4 Feb 2006]. United Nations experts had warned
that the widespread movement of people and poultry during such
festivals could fuel the spread of the virus.
Chicken consumption skyrocketed at this time in China and many Asian
countries. People also had a habit of giving poultry as gifts to
their relatives or friends and slaughtering chicken at home to ensure
freshness, raising the chances of spreading the virus.
In Hong Kong, a chicken infected with bird flu was smuggled across
the border with mainland China's southern Guangdong province and
given to a local family as a gift, sparking a health scare in the
territory.
However, it was unclear what caused the latest outbreak in Shanxi.
The agriculture ministry didn't release information on the cause.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization's representative in China,
Noureddin Mona, said: "Transportation is one of the factors; the
movement of animals and poultry ... migratory birds could be one
reason. I doubt someone can figure out very quickly what's the cause.
The most important thing for us is [that] the virus is still
circulating and jumping from one area to another."
Mona urged China and other countries to remain on high alert, as the
ongoing winter continued to provide ideal conditions for the virus to
survive.

High bird flu risk in Africa after outbreak in Nigeria
-----------------------------------------------
The outbreak of the deadly highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
(H5N1) in Nigeria confirms the fears expressed by FAO for quite some
time that African countries are facing a high risk of becoming
infected by the virus, FAO said today [8 Feb 2006].
"The outbreak in Kaduna state in Northern Nigeria proves that no
country is risk-free and that we are facing a serious international
crisis," said Samuel Jutzi, Director of FAO's Animal Production and
Health Division.
"If the situation in Nigeria gets out of control, it will have a
devastating impact on the poultry population in the region; it will
seriously damage the livelihoods of millions of people, and it will
increase the exposure of humans to the virus," Jutzi said.
"It is important that local and national authorities within other
countries in the region remain vigilant for possible outbreaks of
suspected avian influenza in poultry and other birds. It is vital
that all instances of multiple bird deaths are reported to
authorities and investigated promptly," Jutzi added.
FAO said that people should avoid any contact with obviously diseased
or dead birds, maintain personal hygiene (hand washing) after
handling poultry or poultry meat and should cook chicken meat and
eggs properly.
"It remains unclear if the outbreak has been triggered by migratory
birds or by the trade and movement of poultry or poultry products,"
said Joseph Domenech, FAO Chief Veterinary Officer.
FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) will send
veterinary experts to Nigeria to assess the situation and examine how
the virus has been introduced.
FAO urged veterinary services in Nigeria to eliminate the outbreaks
through immediate humane culling and to strictly control the movement
of people and animals from and to bird flu infected spots. FAO will
also send 2 local experts to the affected region to advise local
authorities on control measures.
Transparency, rapid interventions and close collaboration with the
international community are crucial to stop the spread of the virus,
FAO said. "We are aware that veterinary services in Nigeria are in
need of international support. The animal health infrastructure in
the country is facing a big challenge and will require outside
assistance," Domenech said. Laboratory materials for diagnosis and
protective equipment for veterinarians undertaking investigation are
urgently required.
Nigeria is member of the West African network on avian influenza
surveillance and diagnostics. The recently launched network is
managed by FAO in close collaboration with the Inter-African Bureau
for Animal Resources of the African Union.
Nigeria has an important commercial poultry sector and millions of
backyard poultry farmers. The poultry population is estimated at 140
million.

Avian Influenza outbreak in Nigeria
---------------------------------------
Today Nigerian Authorities have officially notified the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of the occurrence of an outbreak
of avian influenza in poultry on their territory. The notification
report is available on the OIE website
<http://www.oie.int>.
According to this report, the outbreak affected a commercial layers
unit kept in battery cages in the Kaduna state (Jaji village) in the
northern part of the country.
Stamping out, quarantine, animal movement control inside the country,
and disinfection of the infected premises are the control measures
undertaken by the Nigerian Authorities so far.
The OIE/FAO reference laboratory for avian influenza in Padova
(Italy) has characterized the isolate as a highly pathogenic H5N1 and
has further analyzed its genetic composition. Investigations are
being carried out in order to define the degree of genetic homology
with the currently known H5N1 strains.
The OIE, together with the FAO, will take immediate action and
coordinate a common response to this event. A team of experts will be
sent to the affected area in order to assess the situation and
provide technical advice to the national authorities.
The OIE will be updating regularly the evolution of this situation.

Nigeria: 1st confirmed cases of killer bird flu in Africa
-----------------------------------------------
Tens of thousands of chickens have died of the killer bird flu virus
in northern Nigeria, the 1st confirmed cases of H5N1 in Africa, the
International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Wednesday
[8 Feb 2006].
Tests revealed that 40 000 birds had died of the H5N1 virus at a
poultry farm in a village in the northern state of Kaduna, Maria
Zampaglione of the Paris-based OIE told IRIN by telephone.
"An outbreak has been detected," Zampaglione said. "A local poultry
farm keeping 46 000 birds was affected, of which 42 000 were
infected, and 40 000 of those, died."
Though Nigerian authorities have only confirmed bird flu in Kaduna
State, neighboring Kano State has also reported high numbers of
poultry deaths.
The infected Kaduna birds were kept in battery cages in Jaji village,
and so far no human cases of bird flu have been reported in Nigeria.
Bird flu was 1st diagnosed in Asia in 2003, prompting a massive
slaughter of commercial poultry before fatal cases began appearing in
humans. So far, most of the human deaths have been in Asia, but
recently, the H5N1 virus has killed in Iraq and Turkey.
West Africa lies on the migratory path of birds that may already be
infected with avian influenza. And the region is littered with
ecologically important reserves where birds flock to seek warmth
during the northern hemisphere winter.
Late last month [January 2006], as migratory birds flew to Africa,
experts from 18 West African countries gathered in the Malian capital
Bamako to draw up an action plan to deal with the threat of bird flu,
putting USD 120 million into the pot for surveillance of commercial
and wild birds.
Experts are fearful of an outbreak in Africa, because of the lack of
veterinary services and a poor state capacity to deal with such
outbreaks. Poultry, meanwhile, is an important and cheap source of
protein for many people in Africa, where chickens typically roam
freely around compounds in towns and villages.
The OIE, which confirmed the Nigeria outbreak, together with the UN's
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), promised an immediate and
coordinated response in a statement issued on Wednesday [8 Feb 2006].
Nigerian authorities have already imposed a quarantine, restricted
animal movement inside the country, and begun to disinfect the
affected farm, said the OIE statement.
Nigeria is West Africa's most populous nation, with an estimated
population of 110 million people. It is also a regional center for
trade and commerce, with some of the region's largest ports and
markets.
"If the situation in Nigeria gets out of control, it will have a
devastating impact on the poultry population in the region," warned
Samuel Jutzi, Director of FAO's Animal Production and Health
Division, in a Wednesday [8 Feb 2006] press release; "it will
seriously damage the livelihoods of millions of people, and it will
increase the exposure of humans to the virus."

Nigeria: Sick chickens on sale despite bird flu fear
-----------------------------------------------
Market sellers in northern Nigeria are doing a roaring trade in
chickens that died from a mystery infection, despite fears of a
deadly strain of bird flu, traders said on Wednesday [8 Feb 2006].
As Nigeria confirmed Africa's 1st outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza,
which has already killed 88 people in Europe and Asia, officials said
they were putting strict quarantine measures in place to protect
consumers.
But an AFP reporter found that birds that had died in another,
similar disease outbreak were being auctioned off cheaply in the
northern city of Kano.
"The poultry farmers bring their chickens, which they kill as soon
they realize they are infected, to us to sell for them, and customers
rush to buy them because they are cheap," said trader Musa Rabiu in
Kano's Taurani market.
According to Rabiu, chickens that used to sell at 1000 naira (5
euros) [USD 7] now go for 300 naira [USD 2].
"Business is booming because we make so many sales that customers
book the auctioned chickens, which are bought as soon as they are
brought to market," grinned Salisu Kabir, another trader, sitting
behind 3 cages of chickens.
On Monday [6 Feb 2006], Kano State agricultural officials said they
were testing poultry for "bird cholera" -- a bacterial infection that
causes diarrhea and dehydration -- after 60 000 died suddenly in
farms in the region.
But when Agriculture Minister Amadu Bello said Wednesday [8 Feb 2006]
that bird flu had been detected among 40 000 birds that died 150 km
(80 miles) further south in Kaduna State, he said it had at first
been mistaken for cholera.
"Initial results indicated cholera ... We decided to send the sample
to the laboratory in Rome, where it was confirmed to us that it is
avian influenza," he explained.
In Kano, agricultural officials said that tests were still ongoing on
samples taken from their mystery outbreak, but poultry farmers said
further cases had been reported across Nigeria's densely populated
north.
"Poultry farmers whose farms have been infected with an outbreak --
which for now is identified as fowl cholera -- have been killing and
selling their infected chickens at a very low price," Auwalu Haruna,
secretary of the Kano chapter of the poultry farmers association,
told AFP.
"We, as an association, do not have the legal powers to stop the
poultry farmers from selling the infected chickens, and we don't have
the means to compensate them for their loss," he said.
"The fear is that the results of the laboratory tests are
inconclusive, and it is not clear whether eating the infected
chickens will cause harm to humans, which makes their consumption
risky," he added.
The World Health Organization has expressed concerns about African
countries' ability to cope if bird flu becomes established in their
farms.
