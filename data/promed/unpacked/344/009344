According to recent reports from all veterinary departments country-wide, the total number of deaths due to FMD is 17 375, most of them young animals. There seems to be a decline of new cases; the cure rate of 85 percent. [FMD-"cured" animals return, in considerable percentage of cases, to full production only after a protracted rehabilitation period.-Mod. AS].

The veterinary committees all over the country are engaged in an effort to explain and convince animal holders about the importance of vaccination. The vaccination is planned to start on Tuesday [17 Apr 2012], initially in uninfected farms situated within the following less-affected 11 governorates: Aswan, Qena, Luxor, Sohag, Assiut, North Sinai, South Sinai, Red Sea, Ismailia, New Valley and Marsa Matruch.

The vaccine has been produced locally by the serum and vaccine laboratory in Abbassiya from the new FMD SAT2 strain.

All these operations will be provided to all breeders and farmers free of charge.

[If the above information about due vaccination with a newly produced FMDV SAT2 vaccine is accurate, the rapidity of the manufacture of the vaccine is a most remarkable achievement, even if based upon a reference vaccine strain (Eritrea?) and not upon the new isolate. Details on the techniques applied and on safety/efficacy tests performed, will be helpful.

We are informed that with the new strain, the Egyptian Veterinary Serum & Vaccine Research Institute (VRI) was planning to make first a monovalent SAT2 vaccine and later a tri-valent product for the Egypt market, including Type A, O and (new) SAT2. The notable feature of this institution is the construction of a BSL3 laboratory. The new structure appears to be about 80 percent complete. The Instituteâ€™s current livestock stable can only house animals being tested for monovalent products, so upgrading the facility would be needed to support the trivalent product testing.

The web-site address of VRI is http://vsvri-eg.com/index.html . -Mod.AS].

[2] Minia governorate: not yet peaked

Foot and mouth disease - a time bomb
------------------------------------
FMD continues to spread in Minia Governorate, causing mounting concern among farmers and livestock keepers.

According to reports received by the Directorate of Veterinary Medicine, the number of deaths has increased to 1250 head of cattle and 1850 animals are being currently treated in various centers of the province. Farmers and livestock keepers are in panic, in fear of the emergence of the disease in livestock, which is their only source of livelihood.

Published atatements about the payment of compensation were regarded by public as "laughable": no donations have been received so far.

The report is available at http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/an383e/an383e00.pdf.

Though the sequencing of the Egyptian FMDV SAT2 strain (batch WRLFMD/2012/00011, sent to WRLFMD 12 Mar 2012) has long been accomplished, the results are not yet available on the web-site of WRLFMD; see Egypt's page at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/egy.htm.- Mod.AS.
