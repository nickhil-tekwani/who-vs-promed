A mysterious disease affecting the indigenous Kogi people, who inhabit the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, has resulted in 11 fatalities, raising serious concerns among health authorities in the departments of Magdalena and César.

The disease causes symptoms similar to those of Zika and chikungunya viruses and has an evolution time of 6-8 days.

This health emergency has come to light with the reopening of the Tayrona National Park, which closed at the beginning of this year [2017] for a month of environmental regeneration.

Over 30 people have fallen sick in recent weeks, describing feelings of nausea, severe chest pains, coughing, headaches and even flu-like symptoms that include chills and a fever. Although health officials have yet to confirm what is causing these afflictions, they believe the disease could be an aggressive strand of acute respiratory infection (IRA).

According to the César department's Secretary of Health, Carmen Daza Orozco, several youngsters of the Kogi are also being treated for malnutrition, which is linked to IRA.

The disease is believed to be targeting mostly the weak and those with little access to medical services or clean water. Those among the Kogi with an advanced state of malnutrition are more susceptible to immunological complications that can be fatal if left untreated.

Last weekend, the Colombian Army began medical missions along the Badillo river, where 3 indigenous settlements have been impacted by the virus.

After several failed attempts to reach the mountainous area due to poor weather conditions, helicopters transporting almost 8 tons of food and medicines landed near Zinkaka, Tusimake and Bunkuana and began airlifting children out of the danger zone so they could reach hospitals in Valledupar.

According to local health authorities, the spread of the virus appears to have been contained within the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, and they are advising outsiders to stay away from indigenous communities to protect the population from contamination [infection? - Mod.TY] and prevent the virus from potentially spreading to nearby urban areas.

Military doctors have entered the area in an attempt to identify the cause of the mysterious virus and have so far treated some 40 people with acute respiratory problems. Blood samples from the Kogi have been sent to the National Institute of Health to discard a mutation [?] of mosquito-borne viruses prevalent in the tropics, such as chikungunya, Zika and yellow-fever.

[This is a follow up communication on the earlier report of the 11 fatalities and the situation of the outbreak of this disease.

The above report indicated that there are an additional 30 non-fatal cases. The report states that the etiological agent is a virus and that the disease is complicated by malnutrition, but it provides no information about how that diagnosis was reached. Samples have been sent to the National Institute of Health laboratory in Bogota for testing. The results will be of interest. Fortunately, the medical teams were able to reach the affected area, and treatment of cases was provided.
