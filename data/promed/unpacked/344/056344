Anthrax - Haiti report
----------------------
First human death of anthrax ("charbon" in French) is confirmed in Leogane.

[This reflects more the invasion of health personnel lately than a
change in the anthrax status of Haiti. Anthrax is hyperendemic in
this western part of Hispaniola -- Santo Domingo manages to be
essentially free. Reports during the past decade have been sparse.
They merely informed OIE that the disease was present in livestock
and humans. However during the 1900's there were significant numbers
of human cases reported most years: 1993 (more than 180), 1994 (622),
1995 (768), 1998 (183 human cases and 220 cattle cases), 1999 (176)
-- and remember the population of Haiti is not large so these
numerator numbers are significant. - Mod.MHJ]
