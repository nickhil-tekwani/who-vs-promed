FDA investigating recalled Duncan Hines cake mixes potentially linked to _Salmonella_ agbeni illnesses
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the problem and what is being done?
- The FDA is investigating the manufacturing facility that made recalled Duncan Hines cake mixes. The FDA and the CDC informed Conagra Brands that a sample of Duncan Hines Classic White Cake Mix that contained _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agbeni matched the _Salmonella_ collected from ill persons reported to the CDC. This was determined through whole genome sequencing, a type of DNA analysis.

- Conagra Brands is working with FDA to proactively conduct a voluntary recall of Duncan Hines cake mixes from the market. The FDA is conducting an inspection at the Conagra Brands-owned manufacturing facility that produced the cake mixes. The FDA is also collecting environmental and product samples.

What products are recalled?
Conagra Brands reports that the products covered by this recall were distributed for retail sale in the US and limited international exports; the specific product information is listed below. These products may be available in grocery stores around the US, and consumers should check their labels carefully. The firm reports that currently, no other Duncan Hines products or Conagra Brands' products are impacted by this recall.

What are the symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection?
Most people infected with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. Most people infected with _Salmonella_ develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. In some people, the diarrhea may be so severe that they need to be hospitalized. In these patients, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.

Who is at risk?
Children are the most likely to get salmonellosis. The rate of diagnosed infections in children less than 5 years old is higher than the rate in all other people. Children younger than 5, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe infections. It is estimated that approximately 400 persons in the USA die each year with acute salmonellosis.

What do restaurants and retailers need to do?
Retailers should not sell and should discard all recalled products.
Retailers, restaurants, and other food service operators should always practice safe food handling and preparation measures. It is recommended that they wash hands, utensils, and surfaces with hot, soapy water before and after handling food.
- Wash and sanitize display cases and refrigerators regularly.
- Wash and sanitize cutting boards, surfaces, and utensils used to prepare, serve, or store food.
- Wash hands with hot water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process.
- Regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of food contact surfaces and utensils used in food preparation may help to minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination.

What do consumers need to do?
The FDA is advising consumers not to bake with or eat any recalled cake mix. If already purchased, consumers should throw it away or return to the place of purchase for a refund.
Consumers should always practice safe food handling and preparation measures. It is recommended that they wash hands, utensils, and surfaces with hot, soapy water before and after handling food.
FDA offers these tips for safe food handling to keep you and your family healthy:
- Do not eat any raw cake mix, batter, or any other raw dough or batter product that is supposed to be cooked or baked.
- Wash hands, work surfaces, and utensils thoroughly after contact with flour and raw batter or dough products.
- Keep raw foods separate from other foods while preparing them to prevent any contamination that may be present from spreading. Be aware that flour or cake mix may spread easily due to its powdery nature.
