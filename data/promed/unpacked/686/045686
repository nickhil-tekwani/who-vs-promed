Advice to member states
-----------------------
The COVID-19 pandemic is placing immense pressure on health care and management systems worldwide. Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, there is a crucial need to sustain efforts to address dengue and other arboviral diseases in the framework of the Integrated Management Strategy for prevention and control of arboviral diseases (IMS- arbovirus), which includes management, epidemiology, patient care, laboratory, integrated vector management, and environment.

Member states are urged to make effective use of available resources, as staff, equipment, and supplies are likely to be diverted to provide response to the COVID-19 epidemic within countries. With this in mind, arboviral disease programs should aim to reduce the transmission and strive to identify early predictors of severe dengue disease at the primary healthcare level. Early identification and management of cases with warning signs will reduce the number of dengue cases requiring hospitalization, alleviating additional strain to more complex levels of care which will be providing care to severe cases of COVID-19 infection.

Integrated surveillance
-----------------------
Countries are encouraged to continue the epidemiological surveillance and provide reports of suspected and confirmed dengue cases. Since clustering of cases is common in both diseases (dengue and COVID-19), efforts must be made to analyze the spatial distribution of cases to enable a rapid local-level response of most affected areas. Prior information of hotspots of dengue should be targeted for intensive vector control. Sentinel entomological surveillance will help to assess the changes in the risk of vector-borne diseases, and impact of vector control measures.

Diagnostics
-----------
Many COVID-19 and dengue diagnostic tests are based on PCR, but they use different reagents and samples (oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 and blood for dengue).

Regarding serological tests, the viruses are not antigenically related (that is, they belong to different and distant viral families), therefore cross reaction is not expected.

Since laboratory services are a key component of epidemiological surveillance of dengue, in countries with simultaneous outbreaks of dengue and COVID-19, dengue virus detection and characterization should be maintained.

Case management
---------------
Measures to guarantee the adequate clinical management of suspected dengue cases must be a priority.

Capabilities at the primary health care level must be strengthened. Healthcare workers should focus on early clinical diagnosis and recognition of warning signs of severity in dengue (such as abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleed, lethargy, restlessness, liver enlargement greater than 2 cm [0.8 in], and increase in hematocrit). In cases where dengue is suspected, healthcare workers should provide clear guidance to patients and/or families to monitor for warning signs and severe illness in and to seek immediate healthcare should these emerge. These measures will help to prevent the progression of illness to severe dengue and deaths, which in turn will also help to reduce the number of patients that need to be referred to hospitals, thus avoiding saturation of these facilities as well as the intensive care units.

At the same time, all secondary and tertiary level hospitals should be prepared to manage severe dengue cases.

Vector control
--------------
Source reduction of mosquito breeding sites and adult control measures should be implemented in areas affected by or at risk of dengue.

While social distancing measures are in place, households should be encouraged to work together in and around their homes to get rid of stagnant water, reduce and dispose of solid waste, and to ensure proper covering of all water storage containers. These measures can be done as a family activity.

In areas not observing strict social distancing measures, vector control measures targeting the larvae and the adult mosquitoes could be implemented while ensuring appropriate infection prevention measures (such as the use of personal protective equipment) for staff carrying out community-based control measures.

Vulnerable groups (elderly, pregnant women, infants, and the sick) should be encouraged to personal protective measures including the use of insect repellents.

Additional vector control measures such as larviciding, targeted indoor residual spraying, and indoor space spraying can be used to control dengue outbreaks depending on the resources, capacity, and action plans developed at the local level.

Spatial application of insecticides (ULV) is necessary with the aim of rapidly eliminating the adult mosquito population and reducing dengue transmission, and WHO prequalified insecticides are recommended (https://www.who.int/pq-vector-control/prequalified-lists/en/), and preferably based on evidence of susceptibility of the local population of aedes mosquitoes to the applied products.

The intradomicile application or targeted indoor residual spraying should be selectively directed at resting places of the _Aedes aegypti_, such as under furniture and on dark, wet surfaces. Precautions must be taken not to treat storage tanks for drinking and cooking water. This intervention in treated areas is effective for period of up to 4 months; and can be used in health centers, schools, and places of worship. More details on this activity can be found in the document Control of _Aedes aegypti_ in the scenario of simultaneous transmission of COVID-19, available at https://bit.ly/2UupY1R.

Community involvement
---------------------
All efforts should be made to get community support for the prevention of both COVID-19 and dengue.

Simple Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials can be disseminated through various media outlets (including social media) for both diseases where possible, in light of social distancing measures.

Since people are recommended to stay at homes as part of social distancing practices, households should be encouraged to eliminate mosquito breeding sources, both at home and near their homes.

Highly productive mosquito breeding sites such as water storage containers (drums, overhead tanks, mud pots, etc) should be targeted for prevention of breeding. Other breeding sites such as roof gutters and other water holding containers should also be cleaned periodically.

Local teams regularly know how to make this information more effective, and sometimes national campaigns and messages are not as effective as local initiatives.

In areas where schools and colleges have resumed classes, special sessions should be devoted for awareness campaigns for COVID-19 and dengue prevention. Media campaigns can continue for dengue prevention and control of aedes mosquito breeding.
