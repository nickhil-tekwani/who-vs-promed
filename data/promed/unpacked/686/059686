Huanglongbing (greening disease) of citrus has been detected for the 1st
time in Timor-Leste (East Timor) and Papua New Guinea [PNG].
Identifications were confirmed using a polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-restriction enzyme digest procedure.

Huanglongbing (HLB), formerly known as citrus greening, is a lethal disease
of citrus in Asia caused by a phloem-limited, uncultivated bacterium
designated as '_Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_'. The bacterium is
spread by the Asian psyllid, _Diaphorina citri_ [Dc] and by infected
planting material. Dc has been recorded in West Timor, in several districts
of Timor-Leste and in the north of the Indonesian province of Papua
(formerly Irian Jaya) on the island of New Guinea. HLB was recently found
at Sorong and Jayapura in northern Papua.

Surveys of Timor-Leste were conducted in July 2000, May 2002 and April
2003. HLB and Dc were detected in 2000 in the districts of Dili and
Liquica, and in 2002 in the districts of Aileu, Ainaro, Bobonaro, Cova Lima
and Liquica. In September 2002, HLB and Dc were recorded at Vanimo, PNG,
during a regular, biennial survey of the PNG/Papua border by plant health
scientists from Australia, PNG and Papua. In November 2002, a delimiting
survey was conducted in and near the towns of Wewak and Vanimo in
north-east PNG by scientists from PNG and the Secretariat of the Pacific
Community (SPC).

20 of 36 citrus samples tested positive for HLB in the western half of
Timor-Leste. They were obtained from the towns of Dili, Ermera, Liquica,
Ailieu, Maubisse, Suai, Hera and Maliana. Dc was present at each location.
No HLB was detected at Mehera, Lospalos, Lautem, Baucau, and Manatuto in
the eastern part of the country. Dc was present in each of these locations.
Dc was not detected in 16 samples collected from symptomatic trees from
locations at Mehara, Lospalos, Lautem, Baucau, and Manatuto in the east of
the country. No published data are available on the distribution of HLB in
West Timor. HLB was confined to a small area in Sandaun Province in the
north western part of the country. This region of PNG, 100 km from
Jayapura, is the closest location in Papua where both HLB and Dc are
established. HLB was confirmed in 2 locations in Vanimo and in a nearby
village.

All HLB-positive samples were collected from citrus species. 69 other
samples from a 2nd survey (11 at Wewak and 58 in or near Vanimo) tested
negative. Dc was found throughout Vanimo and in nearby villages along the
coast. The large number of healthy trees, widespread distribution of Dc and
spatial distribution of disease foci suggest that the introduction is
recent and may have occurred on more than 1 occasion.

HLB in Timor-Leste threatens citrus culture there and on Timor island as a
whole. It is an important, but minor, crop. Citrus in PNG is also of
nutritional importance to back yard and subsistence growers. A campaign to
confine LB to the Vanimo area is being implemented by the PNG government
with assistance from the SPC. HLB threatens Australian citriculture,
particularly from cuttings or budwood illegally imported into the country.

74 symptomatic citrus trees across northern Australia from north
Queensland, the Torres Strait islands, the Northern Territory and the far
north of Western Australia were indexed for HLB but none tested positive
for HLB.

[There is no treatment for the disease. Presumably, the symptomatic trees
described in this report were infected by pathogens other than HLB. Disease
management will depend upon preventing illegal introduction of budwood and
cuttings, rigorous surveying for HLB and destruction of infected trees.
Budwood and cuttings free of HLB will be needed for production of nursery
stock.
