The Cafe Fuerte website reported 2 more people have died in Cuba as a result of cholera, this time in the eastern provincial capital of Holguin. According to the note, the victims are women (42 and 79 years of age), who had apparently participated in a quinceanera (children's "sweet-sixteen" party) in which several attendees became ill with diarrhea, initially thought to be from simple indigestion, and taken to local hospitals.

Currently there are more than 100 cases of suspected cholera affecting adults and around 50 among children in different Holguin neighborhoods, according to Cafe Fuerte's sources within the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology of the province.

A little more than a week ago, authorities in neighboring Granma Province also confirmed the reappearance of cholera in the provincial capital of Bayamo. Cases have also been reported in Guantanamo Province.

The source of the cholera, appearing on the island for the 1st time in 100 years, is considered by experts to be from Cuban medical personnel who served in Haiti, where thousands have died from the disease since the 2010 earthquake there.

[Cases and deaths from cholera continue to be reported by non-government sources. Most of the cases appear to be occurring in the eastern provinces of Holguin, Guantanamo, and Granma, although some have occurred in the western capital of Havana. Granma province is the site of the original cluster of cases beginning in June 2012. - Mod.LL
