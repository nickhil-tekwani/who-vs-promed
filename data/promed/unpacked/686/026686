AEDES AEGYPTI & AEDES ALBOPICTUS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION
============================================================
[The first two items below are reposted from the "MOSQUITO-L" electronic
list <mosquito-l@iastate.edu>. Aedes aegypti is generally considered
to have been eliminated from the Mediterranean region. There has been
recent discussion on the MOSQUITO-L list concerning the current
status of Aedes spp.in this region (it was agreed by respondents
in that discussion that Aedes aegypti has not been identified
in this region for some time). We thought the two reposted
items below might serve to summarize the discussion for ProMED
list subscribers. The last item in this posting is a comment
by Jack Woodall. - Mod.]

I don't know about the rest of the Mediterranean area but
Aedes aegypti has been gone from Egypt, the country it was
named after, for at least that long, probably longer.

Thanks for your comment. I am glad that the mosquito is absent.
The used tire trade, which has resulted in the dissemination of the Asian
species Aedes albopictus to many countries of the Americas and to Africa,
gives us warning that this species and Aedes aegypti could well return to
its old haunts.
Do you know of anyone in Egypt who has looked for aegypti in recent years?
What about other countries of the Mediterranean. Albopictus is well
established in Albania and Italy, the tire trade continues unabated, so
aegypti may not be far behind.

To add one comment:
Nobody was looking for Ae.aegypti in Brazil in the 1960's,
long after eradication, so when it was found (by accident, in
Belem, by a clinician studying entomology who collected mosquitoes in his
own house and keyed them out in the handbook) it had probably already been
around for years!
