In the departure hall of Nigeria's busiest airport, Murtala Muhammed International in Lagos, passengers get their travel documents ready for check-in. In addition to a passport, ticket, and visa, travelers to many destinations need a yellow fever vaccination card, as Nigeria struggles with an ongoing outbreak. The cards are automatically issued following immunization at a government hospital and are validated with a signature and stamp from the port health authority.

But although 1 in 5 people who contract yellow fever in Nigeria die from it, not everyone gets immunized, and some are finding ways to bypass the travel requirements, increasing the risk of the epidemic-prone disease spreading to other countries.

One way to do it is to buy a falsified vaccination card, readily available at the airport for those who either don't want to be immunized or don't have enough time before they travel.

The Nigerian government told Devex the cards are fake, while evidence at the airport suggests they are authentic but fraudulently obtained. Airport staff and travelers said the cards had been bought at the port health authority's store, duly stamped and signed as a way of generating underhand revenue for staff. Devex was able to buy one for 3000 Nigerian naira [USD 8.50] with no evidence of immunization.

The port health authority denied the involvement of their staff and said that banners at the airport warn travelers of the dangers of fake cards.

"I don't think we are doing a bad thing," an airport worker told Devex. "Without the card, you might miss your flight and that will be [a] waste of money over an ordinary card."

Desperate travelers continue to request them. "Some will even call you to get one for them on their way to the airport. We also have friends and relatives that want to travel and know that we have access to the cards," she said.

One traveler who has used such a card on trips to South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia said none of the embassies had flagged the card as falsified, nor denied him a visa. He suggested the lengthy process of obtaining the card legally -- which means scheduling a hospital appointment and then waiting 10 days after immunization for the card to become valid -- means many travelers are not able to get it on time.

"I see it as an outcome of a systemic failure. Why will I be going from one office to another and be intentionally delayed because I want to do the right thing when I can get the same card within 2 minutes at the airport for less amount?" he said.

But as the situation at the airport shows, even those who have ready access to vaccines are failing to get them.

At the end of last year [2018], the Nigerian health ministry took steps to introduce electronic verification into the vaccination card system. "The introduction of an electronic version of the yellow card stemmed from the ubiquitous fake versions of the card that are notoriously being issued by unauthorized personnel for years," a health ministry spokesperson told Devex.

Although the new system was expected to kick in from 1 Apr [2019], the deadline has been extended to the end of June 2019 to give people more time to sign up.

Dr. Lawal Bakare, founder of EpidAlert, a Nigerian nonprofit working on disease prevention, said it will be more easily available, affordable, and verifiable, with registration and payment made online.

To prevent health authority staff selling falsified documents, cash has been removed from the system. "You cannot pay cash. Money goes directly to government wallet. A reference code is generated and is linked to a traveler's passport number which can be checked against [a] database which those that are selling the fake cards will not have access to," Bakare explained.

Despite the government's investment in the new portal, adoption has been limited. "People were not aware of the new card and we advocated for the shift of the deadline," Bakare said, adding that the distraction of the Nigerian election at the start of the year "did not allow the new yellow cards to get much attention."

His organization is now planning awareness sessions for frequent travelers, multinational companies, universities, and embassies to drive adoption. "We have a duty as a country to protect the global health system," he said.

But he added that the new system does not directly tackle the underlying problem behind the emergence of a market for fake vaccine cards, the hesitancy among travelers to be immunized.

To tackle that, Bakare said travelers need to know the dangers of falsifying vaccine cards and be encouraged to apply for legitimate cards earlier. "There is no excuse for not receiving necessary immunization and we need a sense of patriotism, doing the right thing and not putting others at risk," he said.

Wonodi advocated for good, regular data and strong coordinating platforms to ensure vaccination programs are reaching the right areas, and that work is happening to engage communities.

She expressed optimism about the future of vaccination in Nigeria and across Africa but added that hesitancy remains a risk with the rise of technologies that can spread false information [about vaccine risk] fast.

"The good news is that this same technology ... can also be used to coordinate a response fast. It can also be used to train health workers and community volunteers to deliver services better. It can be used to remind parents to vaccinate their children. It can be used to educate community leaders to support immunization and religious leaders to preach immunization," Wonodi said.

[Fake yellow fever (YF) vaccination cards have been a recurring problem in several African countries in the recent past, including in Nigeria. The above report indicates that the problem of sale of fake YF vaccination cards persists in Nigeria up to the present time. The sale of fake yellow fever vaccination cards to individuals who did not receive the vaccine presents a serious public health risk inside Nigeria and outside of it. Susceptible, unvaccinated individuals can contribute to a YF outbreak within the country.

YF virus is endemic in Nigeria, and transmission is active this year (2019). From 1 Jan to 3 Mar 2019, there have been 364 suspected YF cases reported in 177 local government areas. An unvaccinated, viremic individual with a fake card who becomes infected in Nigeria could carry YF virus to localities where vector mosquitoes are present and initiate an outbreak of this serious disease in countries where YF does not occur and the population is unvaccinated, such as tropical South and South East Asia. One wonders whether these countries will deny visas to or admittance of individuals coming from Nigeria unless they can prove that their cards are legitimate. Fortunately, the Nigerian government authorities are initiating an electronic system for card issuance that should assure that vaccination has been accomplished that would put a stop to these false practices. - Mod.TY
