Bali Animal Health Officials have again recorded a new outbreak of bird flu among Bali's poultry populations. Officials warn that Bali, as an area endemic to the avian H5N1 influenza virus, can expect the disease to sporadically present itself at any location around the island from time to time.

Quoted by Beritabali.com [All About Bali], the head of the Livestock and Animal Health Department for Bali, Putu Sumantra, blamed the appearance of bird flu in Bali over the past year on low levels of bio-security, particularly at bird and traditional markets where traders place little importance on following guidelines to eliminate the disease. The implementation of bio-security measures, by both traders and consumers, is little considered. Because of this, the disease is sporadically appearing, with 12 cases identified to date, explained Sumantra. Another factor making Bali vulnerable to the disease is the widespread tendency to allow poultry to roam freely in areas of human populations. As many as 230 fighting cocks were rounded up and destroyed by officials at the Satria Bird Market in downtown Denpasar on Thu 26 Apr 2012. The slaughter followed the death of an 8-year-old child from Kintamani identified by preliminary laboratory tests as a victim of avian A/H5N1 virus infection [see: Avian influenza, human (47): Indonesia (BA) child 20120426.1114894] and the sudden death of a chicken purchased from the Satria Bird market.

Dr (veterinarian) Wayan Sukandi of the laboratory of the Livestock and Animal Health Department said: "The destruction of hundreds of chickens was done to interrupt the cycle of contamination by the H5N1 virus." The mass culling of birds took place after a rapid test confirmed that the virus was present in the market's bird population. The birds, originating from Probolinggo and Jember in East Java, were euthanized through fatal injections before having their remains burned.

In 2012, Bali has recorded 2 [human] deaths linked to [avian] A/H5N1 virus infection. In February 2012, a resident of Tabanan died from bird flu. The latest death of the child from Bangli, Kintanani on 24 Apr 2012 was tied to the virus, but subsequent confirmatory tests carried out in Jakarta reportedly proved negative for the H5N1 virus.

[The death of the 8-year-old child from Bangli, Kintanani on the Indonesian island of Bali was suspected initially to be the result of avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection [See ProMED: Avian influenza, human (47): Indonesia (BA) child 20120426.1114894], and the report may have contributed to the destruction of fighting cocks at the Satria Bird Market in downtown Denpasar described in the preceding report. However, according to the current report, the diagnosis of avian influenza virus infection has not been confirmed by subsequent investigation, and this child's death is probably unrelated to the extensive outbreak of avian influenza in poultry on the island. Further information clarifying the cause of death of the child is awaited.

[Since the onset of the HPAI H5N1 panzootic in Eastern Asia in 2004, fighting cocks, often illegally traded nationally and internationally, have been incriminated many times as the vector of the virus. Such suspicions have been reported in not less than 84 of ProMED-mail's postings throughout the years from several countries, including Thailand, Viet Nam, Malaysia and Indonesia. For instance, smuggled fighting cocks from Thailand were found by the Malaysians to be the mode of the H5N1 avian influenza virus introduction in August 2004. Similarly, Indonesia reported that the virus was introduced by smuggled fighting cocks. - Mod.AS]
