Nearly 23 500 suspected cases of cholera have been registered in war-ravaged Yemen in the past 3 weeks, the World Health Organization said, as the death toll of the outbreak climbed to at least 242. "The speed of the resurgence of this cholera epidemic is unprecedented," Nevio Zagaria, WHO country representative for Yemen, told reporters in a conference call on [Fri 19 May 2017]. Zagaria warned that there could be as many as 250 000 cases in the country within 6 months.

On [Sun 14 May 2017], a state of emergency was declared in Yemen's opposition-held capital, Sanaa, after the outbreak killed scores of people over a 2-week period. The health ministry of the Houthi government announced the measure, saying that "the number of casualties surpassed the normal rates, exceeding the capacity of the health system, which has become unable to contain this unprecedented health and environmental disaster".

This is the 2nd outbreak of cholera in less than a year in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country in the grip of a war between government forces, which are backed by an Arab coalition, and Houthi fighters. Only a few medical facilities are still functioning and two-thirds of the population is without access to safe drinking water, the UN has said.

"What is happening today exceeds the capabilities of any healthy health system, so how can we [cope] when we are in these difficult and complicated conditions," Saba news agency quoted Mohammed Salem bin Hafeedh, Yemen's health minister, as saying.

The healthy ministry - after holding talks in Sanaa with Jamie McGoldrick, the UN humanitarian coordinator, and other international officials last week - called on humanitarian organisations and aid donors to help it avert an "unprecedented disaster".

A cholera epidemic late last year [2016] petered out but outbreaks are becoming more frequent.

Sanaa has been worst hit, followed by the surrounding province of Amanat al-Semah, WHO data has shown. Cases have also been reported in other major cities including Hodeidah, Taiz and Aden. About 17 million of Yemen's 26 million people lack sufficient food and at least 3 million malnourished children are in "grave peril", according to the UN.

[Cholera follows floods, droughts, wars and natural disasters. What is happening in Yemen now, like what occurred (and is still occurring) in Haiti shows how this classical infection can behave when introduced into a vulnerable population.

The increasing numbers are as follows:

Date [2017] / Cases / Deaths
8 May / 1360 / 25
11 May / 2752 / 51
13 May / 8595 / 115
14 May / 11 000 / 180
17 May / 17 200 / 209
19 May / 23 500 / 242
