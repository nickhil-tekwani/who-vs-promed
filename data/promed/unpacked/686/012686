According to the ITAR-TASS report, schoolchildren in Noviy Urengoy
[in the Yamalo-Nenetsky autonomous district of western Siberia -
Mod.LL] have become infected with pseudotuberculosis [_Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis_ - Mod.LL]. Galina Cenevoy, from the Institute of
Epidemiology and Microbiology in Saint Petersburg commented regarding
the laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis and the quick
recognition of infection by local physicians.
This infection can be transmitted by eating raw vegetables,
especially possible when the technology of processing is not up to
date and the expiration date is not followed.
The outbreak of pseudotuberculosis was detected on 18 Sep 2007 in the
settlement of Noviy Urengoy when 20 schoolchildren were admitted to
the hospital and 77 received out patient care. A preliminary analysis
suggested that fresh vegetables for salad were a possible cause of
infection. The overall number of affected people has increased to 121
with 38 of them admitted to hospital. An investigation has been
launched to assess the outbreak.

[The manifestations of illness in these cases are not stated.
Infection with _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ is a zoonosis with
reservoirs in many animals, including rodents, rabbits, deer, and
various birds.
Most individuals affected are children or young adults. The most
common presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis,
with fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be
confused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also
occur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late
complications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.
Although many associations had been previously made, one of the
strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and
food was published in 2004 from Finland (1). The editorial commentary
(2) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of
infections associated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection
with this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from
lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but
cross-reactions are found between yersiniae and other enteric
organisms, including some salmonellae.
