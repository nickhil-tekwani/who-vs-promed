Global COVID cases rise as BA.4 and BA.5 expand
-----------------------------------------------
COVID-19 cases jumped 18% last week and are at their highest levels since April [2022], and the increase comes as the more transmissible omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants cause most infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [29 Jun 2022] in its latest update. [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---29-june-2022]

BA.4, BA.5 make up 55% of global samples
----------------------------------------
Four of the 6 WHO regions saw rises last week: the Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. Globally, deaths stayed level, but were up in the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asian, and Americas regions.

About 4.1 million cases were reported to the WHO last week, likely an undercount given reduced testing in many countries. The United States, Germany, Brazil, Italy, and China reported the most cases.

At a briefing today [29 Jun 2022] of the WHO's Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), officials said cases rose in all 4 subregions in the Americas, with a jump of 24.6% in South America. Cases in North America rose 7.7% last week, mainly due to rises in the United States and Mexico. [https://www.paho.org/en/news/29-6-2022-covid-19-cases-continue-rise-americas-many-are-risk-developing-post-covid-condition]

The WHO said BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants continue to make up an increasing proportion of sequenced samples. Both share a mutation linked to greater transmissibility, and early indications suggest that evolutionary changes increase immune escape following infection or vaccination.

Combined, BA.4 and BA.5 made up 55% of sequenced samples. For the week ending [19 Jun 2022], BA.5 represented 43% of samples, up from 28% the week before. And BA.4 represented 12% of sequenced samples, up from 9% the previous week.

Pandemic changing 'but it's not over'
-------------------------------------
At a WHO briefing today [29 Jun 2022], Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said cases are rising in 110 countries, fueled by BA.4 and BA.5 in many countries. "This pandemic is changing but it's not over. We have made progress, but it's not over." He reiterated his concerns about reduced testing and genetic sequencing, which reduces the world's ability to track outbreak and virus changes. [https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing---29-june-2022]

Taking stock of the world's vaccination status, Tedros said only 58 countries have reached the mid-year [2022] target of vaccinating at least 70% of their population, with the average rate in low-income countries at 13%. He urged countries to vaccinate 100% of their health workers and people over 60 as soon as possible, noting that 75% of the group is now vaccinated.

For the general population, Tedros said it's important to keep strengthening immunity, which helps reduce severity and longer-term impacts from the disease. "Even relatively 'mild' cases are disruptive and damaging, keeping children out of school and adults from work, which causes further economic and supply chain disruption," he said.

Critical need for next-generation vaccines
------------------------------------------
Tedros said though it makes sense to update vaccines to cover evolving variants, the pace of mutation means the world continues to play catch-up. Second-generation vaccines that stop or reduce infection would be a major step forward, but ideally, the solution is a pan-coronavirus vaccine that covers current and future variants, he said.

In a related development, BioNTech said today [29 Jun 2022] that it and Pfizer would begin human trials of a pan-coronavirus vaccine in the 2nd half of the year [2022], according to Reuters, which cited slides from the company's investor day. [https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biontech-pfizer-starting-testing-universal-coronavirus-vaccine-h2-2022-06-29/]

US booster uptake lags
----------------------
Booster uptake is lukewarm in some US age groups, according to an ABC News report that looked at federal data. Less than 10% of eligible children ages 5 to 11 have received a booster dose, and just 28.7% of adolescents ages 12 to 17 have gotten an extra dose. And less than 40% of eligible adults ages 18 to 49 have received a 3rd dose. [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/millions-remain-unboosted-scientists-3rd-covid-shot-significant/story?id=85856828]

The 7-day average for new daily cases is 113 849, with daily deaths averaging 385, according to the Washington Post tracker. Cases are up 21% in the past week, with deaths up by 41% and hospitalizations rising by 8%. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic_gfx/&state=US]

In other US developments, Eli Lilly said today [29 Jun 2022] that it would supply an additional 150 000 doses of bebtelovimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment under emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections in people ages 12 and older.

The drug continues to show neutralization activity against emerging omicron variants, including BA.4 and BA.5. The purchase is worth USD 275 million and is expected to meet demand through late August [2022].

[2] Women: maternal deaths, minority women, impact
Date: Wed 29 Jun 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/06/maternal-deaths-climbed-33-during-covid-19


Maternal deaths in the 1st months of the COVID-19 pandemic increased 33% -- and even higher in Black and Hispanic women -- according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) published yesterday [28 Jun 2022] in a study in JAMA Network Open. [Marie E. Thoma, Eugene R. Declercq. All-Cause Maternal Mortality in the US Before vs During the COVID-19 Pandemic.JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(6):e2219133. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.19133]

That rate compares with an overall 22% COVID-related excess death rate during the study period, according to 2 researchers from the University of Maryland (UMD) and Boston University (BU), who conducted the study. They defined maternal mortality as deaths during pregnancy or just after birth.

Rates rise 40% to 78% in minority women
---------------------------------------
The investigators used NCHS data from 2018 through 2020 to compare pre-pandemic with pandemic death rates.

They found that 1588 deaths occurred before the pandemic, or 18.8 per 100 000 births, compared with 648 from March through December 2020 (the pandemic period), or 25.1 per 100 000 births, for an overall increase of 33.3%. And they found that late maternal mortality (42 days to 1 year after birth) increased 41%.

Maternal mortality increased the most in Hispanic women (78.0%, or an increase of 8.9 per 100 000 births) and Black women (40.2%; 16.8), compared with 17.2% in White women (2.9).

A secondary diagnostic code for COVID-19 was listed in 14.9% of maternal deaths in quarters 2 to 4 of 2020, with 0% in quarter 1. This percentage was highest among Hispanic women (32.1%), followed by Black (12.9%) and White (7.3%) women.

For underlying cause-of-death codes, the authors determined that the largest relative increase was among indirect causes (56.9%), specifically other viral diseases (2374.7%), diseases of the respiratory system (117.7%), and diseases of the circulatory system (72.1%). Relative increases in direct causes (27.7%) were mostly associated with diabetes in pregnancy (95.9%), high blood pressure (39.0%), and other pregnancy-related conditions (48.0%).

COVID-19 was commonly listed as a secondary condition with other viral diseases and diseases of the respiratory system.

COVID impact on childbearing women
----------------------------------
The authors write, "Change in maternal deaths during the pandemic may involve conditions directly related to COVID-19 (respiratory or viral infection) or conditions exacerbated by COVID-19 or other health care disruptions (diabetes or cardiovascular disease) but could not be discerned from the data."

"The increase was really driven by deaths after the start of the pandemic, which are higher than what we see for overall excess mortality in 2020," said 1st author Marie Thoma, PhD, an assistant professor of family science at UMD, in a university press release.

The other study author, Eugene Declercq, PhD, a professor of community health sciences at BU, said, "For the 1st time in more than a decade, the maternal mortality rate for Hispanic women during the pandemic was higher than that for non-Hispanic white women, a shift that may be related to COVID and deserves greater attention moving forward."

Thoma added, "We need more detailed data on the specific causes of maternal deaths overall and those associated with COVID-19. Potentially we could see improvements in 2021 due to the rollout of vaccines, as well as the extension of postpartum care provided for Medicaid recipients as part of the American Rescue Act of 2021 in some states.

"We're going to continue to examine this."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Clinical testing of children in schools is challenging, with economic implications limiting its frequent use as a monitoring tool of the risks assumed by children and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, a wastewater-based epidemiology approach has been used to monitor 16 schools (10 primary, 5 secondary and 1 post-16 and further education) in England. A total of 296 samples over 9 weeks have been analysed for N1 and E genes using qPCR methods. Of the samples returned, 47.3% were positive for one or both genes with a detection frequency in line with the respective local community. WBE [wastewater-based epidemiology] offers a low cost, non-invasive approach for supplementing clinical testing and can provide longitudinal insights that are impractical with traditional clinical testing.

["Here, as part of a government-funded epidemiological surveillance pilot program, a wastewater-based epidemiology approach was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from schools in England. The current paper posits that appropriate frequency monitoring of school wastewater will enable detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a cross-section of education settings (primary, secondary, economic and social strata) and this will be effective as part of a broader public health surveillance system. To test this, wastewater was collected daily across 16 schools within England (UK). Wastewater testing for fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in schools occurred during the initial stages of the pandemic and during the emergence of the alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Kent, southern England. Here, we report on a case study that explored the WBE approach to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in primary and secondary school wastewater in England (UK). ...

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising non-invasive tool that can support the COVID-19 response as part of an early-warning system, providing data at a local community level proactively to inform public health care strategies and mitigate escalating demands on health care providers [12-14]. SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in adult and child faeces and urine at different stages of the infection [15]. Although most viral shedding which features within wastewater will be derived from faeces. A recent meta-analysis has estimated the mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in stools to be 17.2 days (95% Confidence Interval 14.4-20.1), longer in duration than in any other body fluid [16]. Another meta-analysis suggested significantly shorter shedding duration in children of 9.9 days (95% Confidence Interval 8.1-12.2) [17] indicating that the window for detection using wastewater in children may be shorter than in the adult population. Wastewater is now widely used as a SARS-CoV-2 surveillance tool at the sewer catchment level via collecting grab and composite samples at wastewater treatment plant inlets [13]. In addition, Near Source Tracking (NST) [18] is conducted at a small sub-catchment scale (i.e., a building), permitting detection of small clusters or even individual COVID-19 cases in locations such as care homes [19], hospitals [20], universities and student dormitories [21, 22], aircraft [12, 23] and cruise ships [12]. Transitions to school environments have not been readily and widely reported to date although illustrations exist for kindergartens [24] and some elementary schools [25] suggesting that WBE/NST may be able to be part of a surveillance system for infectious diseases in schools."

UK study shows long COVID more common in women, adults 50 to 60
---------------------------------------------------------------
Symptoms of long COVID are more frequently reported by women, those with poor overall health before the pandemic, and those aged 50 to 60, according to a new UK-based study in Nature Communications.

The study was based on results gathered from 6907 people with self-reported COVID-19 from 10 population-based longitudinal health surveys in the United Kingdom that had been in place prior to the pandemic.

The proportion of participants reporting symptoms for longer than 12 weeks post-acute infection ranged from 7.8% to 17.0%, with 1.2% to 4.8% reporting debilitating symptoms.

Women were more likely to report long COVID symptoms compared to men, as were those with poorer pre-pandemic mental health and overall health. Participants who were obese or had asthma were also identified as more at risk for long COVID.

The authors compared these responses with electronic health records of 1.1 million UK residents in the spring of 2021, which showed that only 4189 people also had a recorded long COVID code, constituting 0.4% of COVID-19 cases.

"While just 0.3% of COVID-19 cases had long COVID codes in primary care, up to 17% of adult COVID-19 cases in midlife reported symptoms attributed to COVID-19 for more than 12 weeks in longitudinal studies," the authors concluded. "Our findings justify further investigations into the role of sex difference, age related change, and/or immunity and respiratory health in development of long COVID. Older working individuals, with high levels of comorbidity, may particularly require support."

"Implications: The stark variability in proportions of COVID-19 cases with persistent symptoms is clear from our comparison of methods of ascertaining long COVID. Representative population-based studies will need to provide ongoing estimates across the spectrum of functional limitation to help plan appropriate provision of healthcare. Our data suggest that revisions of diagnostic criteria within primary care may be appropriate, particularly for demographic groups which are less in touch with healthcare services.

Although causal inferences cannot be drawn from these data, our findings justify further investigations into the role of sex difference, age related change, and/or immunity and respiratory health in development of long COVID. Older working individuals, with high levels of comorbidity, may particularly require support." - Mod.LK]

More than 1 in 4 children hospitalized with acute COVID-19 or COVID-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) experienced persistent symptoms or problems with daily activity for at least 2 months, a study across 25 US pediatric hospitals finds. It was published today [29 Jun 2022] in Pediatrics.

The study included 358 patients younger than 21 years who were hospitalized from May 2020 to May 2021. Of those, survey data collected 2 to 4 months after admission was available for 119 of 155 who had acute COVID-19 and 160 of 203 with MIS-C, for a total of 279 patients. Thirteen patients (11%) with acute COVID-19 and 12 (8%) with MIS-C required hospital readmission.

The researchers found that 32 patients (26.9%) with acute COVID-19 had persistent symptoms (22.7%) or activity impairment (14.3%) and 48 patients (30.0%) with MIS-C had persistent symptoms (20.0%) or activity impairment (21.3%). For patients with acute COVID-19, having more symptoms involved raised the risk of persistent symptoms 29% and the risk of activity impairment 37%. Patients with MIS-C and pre-existing respiratory conditions -- mostly asthma -- had triple the rate of persistent symptoms (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 3.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 6.14) and obese patients with MIS-C more frequently had activity impairment (aRR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.35 to 4.69).

Fatigue or weakness were the most common symptoms in both the COVID-19 and MIS-C groups, followed by cough and shortness of breath in the COVID-19 group and headache in the MIS-C group.

The authors conclude, "Our study highlights that, while most children recover, many children with both acute COVID-19 and MIS-C have persistent sequelae, and further follow-up to determine if these sequelae persist is warranted."

"Objective: To evaluate risk factors for post-discharge sequelae in children and adolescents after hospitalization for acute COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

Methods: Multicenter prospective observational cohort study conducted in 25 US pediatric hospitals. Patients < 21-years-old, hospitalized May 2020 to May 2021 for acute COVID-19 or MIS-C with follow-up 2-4 months after admission. We assessed readmissions, caregiver-reported persistent symptoms or activity impairment, and new morbidities identified by the Functional Status Scale. Multivariable regression was used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (aRR).

Conclusions: Over 1 in 4 children hospitalized with acute COVID-19 or MIS-C experienced persistent symptoms or activity impairment for at least 2 months. Patients with MIS-C and respiratory conditions or obesity are at higher risk of prolonged recovery." - Mod.LK]
