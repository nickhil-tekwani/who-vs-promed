According to El Comercio (3/20) 12 cases of cholera have been reported in
the coastal areas of Ecuador. These cases are attributed to climatic
events related to El Nino. Sixty six teams of health workers are involved
in prevention in the five coastal provinces and on the border with Peru a
country that has reported
8,000 cases. There is no source given for this last statement.
