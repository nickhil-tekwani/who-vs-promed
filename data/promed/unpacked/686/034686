Coffee farmers have been dismayed by a new disease affecting their crops in Gandaki Province [Pradesh 4]. Coffee is cultivated in 9 out of 11 districts in the province. Farmers have reported symptoms such as wilting of leaves, untimely shedding of fruits and, ultimately, wilting of the total plant.

In Gandaki Province, Kaski is the 2nd largest coffee-producing district. Last year [2019], Kaski produced 200 000 kg [440 924 lbs] coffee. This year [2020], however, as per the National Tea and Coffee Development Board's estimate, the production will be limited to 75 000 kg [165 346 lbs] only due to the disease.

[A] coffee farmer described the outbreak as a challenge, accusing the government of doing little by way of research. Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperative Ministry said the provincial minister will provide some relief to the affected farmers.

[The symptoms described above are not sufficient for diagnosis and may be due to a number of root rot fungi or other pathogens known to occur in the region. Similarly, coffee leaf rust (CLR) caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_ has long been a problem for arabica coffee production in the region, including Nepal (see ProMED-mail post 20160119.3947313). CLR associated defoliation and the strong carbohydrate sink of the berries cause shoots and roots to starve and consequently to die off. (For more information on CLR see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)

These pathogens are usually spread with soil, contaminated tools and human activities. Environmental factors may also affect the plants. Reliable diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems reported above is needed before any management strategies can be designed.
