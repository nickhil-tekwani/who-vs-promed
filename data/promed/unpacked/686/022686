Highlights
----------
-A total of 391 persons infected with the outbreak strains of Salmonella have been reported from 40 states and the District of Columbia.

-29 percent of ill persons have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

-71 percent of ill persons are children 10 years of age or younger, and 33% of ill persons are children 1 year of age or younger.

-45 percent of ill persons are of Hispanic ethnicity.

-Results of the epidemiologic and environmental investigations indicate exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat) is the cause of these outbreaks.

-70 percent of ill persons reported exposure to turtles prior to their illness.

-89 percent of ill persons with turtle exposure specifically reported exposure to small turtles (shell length less than 4 inches).

-30 percent of ill persons with small turtles reported purchasing the turtles from street vendors, and 13 percent reported purchasing small turtles from pet stores.

-4 of the outbreaks remain under active investigation. However, turtles are an important cause of human salmonellosis in the USA.

-The FDA has banned the sale and distribution of turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches in size as pets since 1975. These small turtles should not be purchased as pets or given as gifts.

Investigation Overview
----------------------
4 of the 8 multistate outbreaks remain under active investigation and updates for these outbreaks are listed below. The outbreaks are numbered in the order in which they were identified.

Outbreak 1: _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Sandiego, Strain A &_S._ Newport, Strain A
-----------------------------
Case Count Update:
A total of 100 individuals infected with _S._ Sandiego, strain A and _S._ Newport, strain A have been reported from 18 states. 7 new ill persons have been reported from Arizona (1), California (3), Illinois (1), Massachusetts (1), and Ohio (1).

Illness onset dates range from 3 Aug 2011 to 6 May 2013. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 86 years, with a median age of 6 years. 63 percent of ill persons are female. Ethnicity was reported for 38 ill persons, and of these, 27 (71 percent) were Hispanic. Among 60 persons with available information, 13 (22 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Outbreak 2: _S._ Pomona, Strain A
---------------------------------
Final Case Count Update:
A total of 19 individuals infected with _S._ Pomona, strain A were reported from 11 states.

Illness onset dates ranged from 9 Dec 2011 to 22 Jan 2013. Ill persons ranged in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 4 years. 63 percent of ill persons were female. Ethnicity information was available for 8 ill persons; of these, 5 (63 percent) were Hispanic. Among 15 persons with available information, 4 (27 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths were reported. This outbreak appears to be over.

Outbreak 3: _S._Poona, Strain A and _S._ Sandiego, Strain C
-----------------------------------------------------------
Case Count Update:
A total of 55 individuals infected with _S._ Poona, strain A and _S._ Sandiego, strain C have been reported from 22 states. Illness onset dates range from 20 Oct 2011 to 28 Jan 2013. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 84 years, with a median age of 3 years. 66 percent of ill persons are female. Ethnicity information is currently available for 18 ill persons; of these, 3 (17 percent) are Hispanic. Among 35 persons with available information, 12 (34 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation Update:
---------------------
Traceback investigations of turtles purchased from Florida souvenir shops identified 2 turtle farms in Louisiana as the source of the turtles. The Florida Department of Health and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have collaborated to stop the sale of turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches from these shops. The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry issued cease and desist orders in March 2013 for the source farms; therefore, turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches from these farms are no longer being sold domestically.

No new ill persons in Outbreak 3 have been reported since February 2013; however, this outbreak investigation remains open because investigations of the Louisiana turtle farms are ongoing.
