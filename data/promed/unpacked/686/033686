[2] Vaccine
Date: Wed 17 Apr 2019
Source: Drug Development Technology [edited]
https://www.drugdevelopment-technology.com/news/emergent-chikungunya-vaccine-results/


Emergent BioSolutions has reported positive findings from the interim analysis of a phase II clinical trial being conducted to assess its chikungunya virus-like particle (CHIKV-VLP) vaccine candidate.

According to the data, around 98% of the trial subjects who received a single dose of the vaccine generated a neutralising antibody response against the virus by day 7.

The response was observed to be sustained through the 6-month visit.

"The phase II trial assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the CHIKV-VLP vaccine candidate in multiple dosing regimens. "Emergent BioSolutions licensed the CHIKV-VLP chikungunya virus vaccine candidate from the US National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."

Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are multi-protein products with organisation and conformation similar to that of natural viruses. However, VLP vaccines lack the viral genome and are intended to stimulate a strong immune response and improve antibody generation.

Prior research demonstrated that VLP vaccines are highly immunogenic, safe and usually induce high titer neutralising antibodies to protect against the virus.

The parallel-group, randomised, double-blind, dose-finding phase II trial assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the CHIKV-VLP vaccine candidate in multiple dosing regimens.

It was performed in a total of 415 healthy adults at 3 sites in the US. Subjects received a one or 2-dose series of the investigational vaccine with or without an adjuvant over 4 weeks.

Following one dose, 74%-98% of the participants had seroconversion within 7 days. All subjects experienced seroconversion by 28 days after the last dose.

The vaccine candidate was found to be well-tolerated without any significant vaccine-related safety concerns.

[This vaccine is very promising. One hopes that the phase III trials are equally successful and that it can reach the market at a price that can be afforded in the tropical countries where chikungunya virus circulates. - Mod.TY]

[3] Chikungunya and malaria co-infection
Date: Thu 18 Apr 2019
Source: Medical Xpress [edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-04-malaria-infections-masking-extent-emerging.html


Chikungunya virus is rapidly spreading around the world and encroaching into areas already plagued by malaria, which means that more people are falling ill with cases of both mosquito-borne infections. That might sound dire, but according to a new study by A*STAR scientists, prior exposure to malaria may help protect against complications of chikungunya [virus infection].

That is the good news. The downside, according to Lisa Ng, a viral immunologist at the A*STAR Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN) who co-led the study, is that the protective benefit is probably masking the true scale of the global chikungunya epidemic, and as public health campaigns continue to aggressively target malaria without consideration of chikungunya, there could be unintended consequences.

"In co-endemic regions," Ng says, "a reduction in malaria cases could indirectly result in an increase in clinical cases of chikungunya fever."

To explore the health effects of co-contagion, Ng teamed up with SIgN executive director Laurent Renia to infect mice with both the chikungunya virus, which causes fever and severe joint pain, and 2 forms of rodent _Plasmodium_ parasite responsible for malaria, one of the world's deadliest diseases. In a previous paper, the researchers had shown that co-infection with chikungunya protected the mice from the worst ravages of malaria. In this study, they considered the impact that malaria has on the extent of chikungunya-associated joint swelling.

Reporting in Nature Communications, the A*STAR team found that mice pre-infected with _Plasmodium_ and then exposed to chikungunya virus 4 days later did not exhibit joint inflammation -- and this was true whether the malaria parasite was an aggressive species that caused fatal brain swelling or a milder species that causes a non-lethal form of the disease. Furthermore, these mice also showed reduced levels of the chikungunya virus in the blood.

The protective effects were less pronounced among mice infected with both malaria and chikungunya at the same time. In that case, peak joint swelling declined, but the amount of chikungunya virus in the bloodstream was the same as in mice exposed to chikungunya virus alone. No beneficial effects were seen in mice that had completely recovered from a malarial infection, or when malaria was introduced 4 days after the chikungunya virus when the latter infection was already in full swing.

To explain their observations, the researchers looked closely at the immune mechanisms by which prior or concurrent exposure to malaria parasites safeguards against chikungunya virus-induced joint damage. They found that _Plasmodium_ infection stimulated the production of a critical immune-modulating molecule called interferon-gamma that primed joint cells to be on the alert for viruses like chikungunya. The prior _Plasmodium_ exposure also limited the number of pro-inflammatory T cells that normally infiltrate joint tissue and drive swelling in response to the virus.

Malaria's impact on the immune system was not all favourable for fighting chikungunya [virus infection], though. Co-infection with _Plasmodium_ also restricted the maturation of B-cells that are needed to make chikungunya [virus]-fighting antibodies. The team speculates that this could harm the immune system's ability to mount an adequate response should the body face a 2nd infection with the virus.

To recreate only the immunological benefits of co-infection, without the negative consequences for B-cells (or having to expose people to dangerous viruses), Ng proposes a new drug strategy. Based on her team's finding that a cell signaling receptor protein called CXCR3 mediates the migration of pro-inflammatory T cells to the joints following chikungunya virus infection -- and also to the brain following _Plasmodium_ infection -- she suggests targeting this receptor with drugs.

"Currently, there are several small molecules that could antagonize CXCR3 in patients," Ng says. "Perhaps the use of CXCR3-targeted therapies could be considered in regions where the diseases are co-endemic."

[It should be stressed that this study was performed in a mouse model. It would be interesting to see if people who have malaria parasitemia and a subsequent chikungunya virus infection suffer less joint pain from that viral infection. Joint pain from chikungunya virus infections can persist for months or years. If _Plasmodium_-infected individuals who had their virus infection 2 or less years ago had little or no joint pain, the reduction in arthralgia may have been due to their prior malaria infection. - Mod.TY]
