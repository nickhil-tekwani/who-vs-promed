State Department of Health officials are examining what may be the 1st case of potentially deadly hantavirus found in New York this year [2012], believed to have resulted from a mouse bite in an Adirondack High Peaks lean-to in August [2012] "The department is looking into the issue," DOH spokesman Jeffrey Hammond said.

Additionally, medical personnel at Stony Brook University Hospital have tentatively set a news conference Friday [12 Oct 2012] with the Long Island resident who contracted and then recovered from the viral illness, which is typically transmitted by inhaling dust or particles tainted with rodent droppings.

"They confirmed it today," said the man, 72, of Stony Brook, who came down with the illness in September [2012] and was hospitalized in intensive care for 4 days. He was referring to blood tests that had been sent out to verify the existence of the virus.

A research geophysicist at Stony Brook University, the man was camping in a lean-to, a primitive 3-sided wood-hewn shelter, in the High Peaks wilderness not far from mounts Skylight and Gray. While sleeping with his arms and hands outside of a sleeping bag, a mouse bit his finger during the night. "It wasn't a mean bite," he said, adding he believed the mammal was foraging and may have smelled some food residue under his fingernails. "People don't normally get bitten by mice," he said.
He didn't think much of it until September [2012] when he became ill and doctors said they believed it was [a] hantavirus [infection], which can take a month or more to incubate.

With no anti-viral medications for the illness, treatment consisted of "good nursing care" and plenty of hydration in the hospital, the man said.

Word of the virus emerged earlier in the week when the man described his experience on an Internet forum about the High Peaks. He was back in the Adirondacks over the Columbus Day weekend [2-8 Oct 2012] and other hikers there said he should tell forest rangers about his illness, so he did. "A lot of people said, tell DEC," the man remarked, referring to the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

The state Department of Health listed one verified case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in 2011, in Suffolk County, Long Island.

News of the Adirondack case follows reports that at least 9 visitors to California's Yosemite Park contracted the [Sin Nombre] virus during the summer. At least 3 of the victims died.

Researchers in California were trying to determine if this was the same strain of rodent-borne virus 1st discovered in the United States in 1993 in the Four Corners region of the Southwest. At the time, Navajo elders in the Southwest believed the outbreak came after there was an abundance of pine nuts that year, which caused the mouse population to spike.

The man said his wife, who was with him in the lean-to, swept out the dwelling during their August visit [which might have been the source of virus exposure]. There have been reports, though, that this year's unusually dry summer led to less food for mice, meaning they were more apt to venture into places that might contain food such as lean-tos.

Named for the Hantan River in South Korea where it was 1st identified, hantavirus[es] can kill as many as one out of 3 people who have their lungs infected.

[Unfortunately, reports of hantavirus infections often imply, as the one above does, that there is just one hantavirus responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (PHS). That is not the case. If confirmed, the hantavirus in this New York case is likely to be either Monongahela or New York hantaviruses. Both can cause HPS, occur in New York state and have the white-footed mouse, _Peromyscus leucopus_, as reservoir hosts. Hantaan hantavirus mentioned in the above report is only found in Asia, not in North America. The virus responsible for the HPS cases this summer in California and initially in the southwestern USA is also a different virus, Sin Nombre virus, with the deer mouse _Peromyscus maniculatus_, as its reservoir host. Infection via bite is much less common than through inhalation of aerosolized mouse excrement and secretions. It is not clear if a hantavirus infection was confirmed or if clinical HPS was confirmed on 12 Oct 2012, as the patient stated. ProMED would appreciate confirmation of laboratory results as they become available.
