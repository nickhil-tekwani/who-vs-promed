[Re: "...in view of the fact that the symptoms of
the autopsied horse and its trainer [sic] were
apparently severe enough (respiratory symptoms?)
that Hendra infection was suspected, we would
still be interested to know if anybody has
information about the final diagnosis of those
cases. - Mod.JW in ProMED post 20070903.2896]
I am unable to answer these questions
definitively without the name of the vet allegedly exposed.
However our public health laboratory, which
receives all requests for Hendra testing in
humans in Queensland, notes that the only request
for Hendra testing that fits the bill was one
received in August at around the time the Horse
[magazine] article came out, on a vet who had
been exposed to an ill horse. The Population
Health Unit investigating this case advises that
the vet was not ill but was getting precautionary
testing, the horse did not fit the clinical
criteria for Hendra illness, both horse and vet
tested negative for Hendra, and no autopsy was performed.
If this is what the Horse article and ProMED
posting refer to, there are numerous blatant
errors of fact. In any case the posting is
obviously incorrect and should be withdrawn.

[ProMED regrets the fact that we have
disseminated incorrect information, and this
moderator especially regrets confusing the issue
further by saying a trainer was the suspect case,
when the person involved was a veterinarian.
So let's get this straight. There was sick horse
that was not autopsied. Its vet was not
hospitalized as a suspected case, but he was
tested for Hendra infection as a precaution. And
there was one confirmed horse case, not 2, of
Hendra infection in July 2007 -- see ProMED post
Hendra virus, human, equine - Australia (QLD)
(03): corr. 20070903.2896 -- which had nothing to do with that horse and vet.
It is ProMED policy to issue corrections, not to
withdraw posts. ProMED depends upon its readers
to send followup information on our reports. In
view of the outstanding cooperation from Dr Frank
Beard of Queensland Health & Dr Eva-Maria
Bernoth, Australian Chief Veterinary Officer, we
will have no hesitation checking with them before
posting any such news report from Australia in
future. Thank you both. - Mod.JW]
