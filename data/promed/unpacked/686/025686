A patient in Hanoi who died late [in August 2005] has just been confirmed to
have been infected with avian influenza virus strain H5, the local newspaper
Young People reported on Thu 1 Sep 2005, quoting the national anti-bird flu
committee. The patient from the rural district of Soc Son died of acute
pneumonia on 28 Aug 2005, the committee said.
Since the 1st bird flu patient was detected in Viet Nam in late 2003, up to 92
human cases of infections, including 42 fatalities, have been reported in 31
cities and provinces. Viet Nam's Health Ministry has yet to confirm [several
recent] cases.
Late in August [2005], the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development confirmed [that] specimens from 3 rare civets born in captivity in
the Cuc Phuong National Park in northern Ninh Binh province which died in late
June [2005] were infected with avian influenza virus strain H5N1. This is the
1st time the virus has been found in civets, it said.
According to local veterinary agencies, up to 70 percent of waterfowl in the
southern Mekong delta have recently tested positive to H5N1 virus. Viet Nam
has culled over 1300 fowl in 8 localities of Dong Thap, Ben Tre, Can Tho, Tra
Vinh, Yen Bai, Ha Giang, Bac Ninh and Hanoi since early April 2005. The
country is conducting bird flu vaccination for [domestic] fowl, mainly
chickens and ducks, in 47 out of 64 cities and provinces. The total fund for
vaccinating over 200 million fowl in the 2005-2006 period is estimated at 700
billion Vietnamese dong (44.3 million US dollars).

Avian influenza virus, now feared heading for Europe, has killed a Vietnamese
[citizen], taking the number of deaths in Asia from the disease to 63, a
senior official said on Thursday 1 Sep 2005. The victim, whose gender was not
disclosed, died from acute pneumonia on Sun 28 Aug 2005, and tests detected
the H5 component of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in the body, reported the
Tuoi Tre newspaper quoting Deputy Health Minister Trinh Quan Huan. The victim
was from Soc Son, a district on the outskirts of Hanoi, but the government had
not spotted any outbreaks in poultry during August, Huan said.
The death was announced as Agriculture and Health Ministry officials said they
were finalizing details of an emergency plan to tackle a flu pandemic, which
international health officials fear could erupt if the H5N1 virus mutates.
Now, it cannot pass easily from human to human, but the World Health
Organization has been saying loudly for more than a year the virus could
mutate into a form which could do so. If that happened, millions of people
without immunity could die, it says. The WHO has urged governments to prepare
for such an eventuality. Viet Nam, which has had more human deaths from the
H5N1 virus than anywhere else, has been preparing plans for various scenarios,
the state-run Tien Phong newspaper reported.
"Vietnam is vaccinating poultry, [as] there is a great infection risk
involving the H5N1 virus jumping from poultry to humans," the newspaper quoted
the Health Ministry as saying. There have been no reports so far of people
contracting the virus from vaccinated poultry. Animal health officials said
they [are] meeting on Thursday [1 Sep 2005] to review the vaccination campaign
using Chinese and Dutch vaccines in the provinces of Nam Dinh and Tien Giang.
This month, the government will expand the vaccination campaign to target 60
million fowl at small-scale farms nationwide, said Anton Rychener, the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization representative in Viet Nam. The government
aims to complete vaccinations by 15 Nov 2005, before the onset of winter when
the virus seems to thrive best.
The latest human death took Viet Nam's bird flu toll to 44, with 23 of the
victims dying since the virus returned in Dec 2004, after sweeping through
much of Asia in late 2003. It has also killed at least 12 people in Thailand,
4 in Cambodia, 3 in Indonesia and has struck 6 Russian regions and Kazakhstan,
causing the deaths of nearly 14 000 fowl. The FAO said on Wed 31 Aug 2005 that
migrating birds posed a serious risk of spreading avian influenza around the
world, including Western Europe. The spread into central Asia and towards
Eastern Europe has fuelled fears about the mobility of the highly pathogenic
H5N1 strain.

[The numbers of cases and deaths in the above reports exceed those listed by
WHO, even if this new fatal case is taken into account. As of 1 Sep 2005,
the cumulative number of WHO laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in Viet Nam remains unchanged from the
figures published on 5 Aug 2005; namely 63 cases including 20 deaths (23 in
the above reports) since 16 Dec 2004, and overall 90 cases including 40 deaths
(92 and 42 or 44 in the above reports) since 26 Dec 2003. With time these
figures should come into closer agreement when confirmatory testing has been
completed. - Mod.CP]
