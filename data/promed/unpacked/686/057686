In reference to comments about the likelihood FMD infection in wild deer
populations would 'burn out' quickly, it was assumed until 1995 that
free-ranging wild deer populations would be unable to sustain
_Mycobacterium bovis_ (bovine tuberculosis) infections.
The commonly-held view prior to this time was that the habits of wild deer
made deer-to-deer transmission unlikely, and that sporadic cases of bovine
TB in deer were spillover cases from livestock or farmed cervids. However,
in the northeastern portion of the state of Michigan, the wild white-tail
deer population has what is now believed to be endemic bovine TB, and cases
of spillover to other wildlife species (e.g., coyote, raccoon, opossum,
black bear) and cattle have been documented.
It is believed the original infection in deer may have been spillover from
livestock that occurred before the state had 'eradicated' TB from the
cattle population (in the 1970s), and that the region's deer population was
capable of sustaining the infection for decades. While the routes of
infection, progress of the disease, and levels of infectiousness are not
similar between TB and FMD, it may be prudent for animal industries
and government agencies to re-assess the potential of specific wildlife
species as possible reservoirs of disease.

[Ms. Miller is right in stating that TB and FMD are very different;
however, the establishment of FMD in both wild deer and wild pigs is a
concern for all agencies formulating plans for a potential FMD outbreak.
The FMD situation provides experience that should be carried forward to
planning for other disease outbreaks. The approach seems to vary depending
upon the population of wild deer/pigs within a state. There is no easy
answer as to how to handle this issue where wildlife and domestic animal
populations are likely to come into contact. ­ Mod.TG
