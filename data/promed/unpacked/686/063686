The government will continue to fight foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
eastern Mongolia by vaccinating millions of livestock, officials said
Tuesday [6 Jul 2010].

Efforts to fight the disease in eastern Mongolia were continuing, and
the vaccination of the country's livestock would also continue,
Enkhbold Miegombo, deputy premier and chairman of the national
emergency commission, said during a commission meeting.

The commission said the government has spent 326 million Tugrig [USD
239 000] on the vaccination of cattle herds. So far, 1400 infected
cattle have been slaughtered and buried in Dornod province.

Meanwhile, the ministry of food, agriculture and light industry has
proposed to vaccinate all 7.1 million livestock in Khentii,
Sukhbaatar, Umnugobi, and Dornogobi provinces [all are Eastern
provinces/Aimags; see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mongolia_aimags_2007.png>].

Emergency officials were also attempting to monitor the movement of
about 10 000 whitetail gazelle herds in eastern Dornod province [For
background and a picture of the Mongolian white-tailed gazelle
_Procapra gutturosa_ or "Zeren," see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_gazelle>.].

The 1st symptoms of FMD were detected on 22 Apr 2010 in cattle herds
in Dornod province. Since then, a quarantine has been imposed in the
province. The disease, however, has broken out 5 times in the
villages of Matad, Bayantumen, Khalkhgol, and Bulgan since 14 May
2010.

[The outbreak in Eastern Mongolia was prevented from spreading by an
FMD control policy combining biosecurity measures and vaccination.
However, it seems not to have been completely eradicated so far. The
study into possible involvement of wildlife is interesting; any
available findings will be appreciated.

The following request for information, initially posted on 22 Jun
2010, is hereby repeated: "Since, reportedly, gene sequencing has
already been applied by ARRIAH (Federal Centre for Animal Health, OIE
Regional Reference Laboratory for FMD for Eastern Europe, Central
Asia and Transcaucasia in Vladimir, Russia), it may be possible to
define the relationship of the Mongolian FMDV serotype O strain to
the one currently circulating in China, South Korea, and Japan
(topotype SEA, strain Mya-98). Such information, probably provided
cooperatively by ARRIAH and WRL-FMD, IAH, Pirbright, UK, is
anticipated with great interest." - Mod.AS]
