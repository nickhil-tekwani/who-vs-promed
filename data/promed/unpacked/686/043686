A 2nd horse in the past month has been euthanized in Oneida County
after testing positive for eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, the
county health department announced.

Two other horses have been euthanized after exhibiting neurological
disorders, which could be EEE, West Nile virus or something else, said
Oneida County Heath Department spokesman Ken Fanelli. Test results on
those horses are due back Tuesday [6 Sep 2011].

All 3 were in the northwestern part of the county, near the Oswego
County border. The confirmed case was from the Camden area; the 2
horses whose condition is under evaluation were from the Oneida Lake
area, Fanelli said.

A Westmoreland horse was euthanized in July 2011 after contracting
EEE. Both EEE and West Nile virus are carried by mosquitoes.

The 1st positive tests for West Nile in Oneida County came back this
week, Fanelli said.

EEE, while rare in humans, can be fatal. An Oswego County girl died
earlier this summer [2011] from the disease.

Oswego County has been spraying to kill mosquitoes infected with EEE.

[It is so sad that people cannot remember from year to year to
vaccinate their horses. This is a preventable disease, as there are
vaccines. The vaccine is effective, and often combined with West Nile
virus, another disease transmitted by mosquitoes which can be fatal to
horses.

When the vaccine to prevent EEE is used in horses, it is recommended
to be given every 6 months in areas that are prone to the disease,
such as the eastern states of the US or those that border the gulf. -
