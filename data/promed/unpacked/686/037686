Dengue has now caused a death and the number of cases registered in
10 months, with 2 months to go before summer [2009], is up 213
percent from the total recorded in all last year [2008] in Campo
Grande. The statistics of ESAU (Municipal Secretariat of Health)
reinforces the alert issued by the prefect of the capital, Nelsinho
Trad, that, after swine influenza [A H1N1], the population must
redouble its concern for the disease caused [virus transmitted] by
the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.

From January [2009] up until this week, the municipality has
confirmed that 661 patients contracted dengue in Campo Grande. In
relation to last year [2008], when there were 211 cases, there has
been an increase [in the number of dengue cases] of 213 percent. Last
year's numbers included the rainy and hot season, which begins in
November. The number of people with DHF, the most serious and lethal
form, has exploded. There were 20 reported [DHF cases] this year
[2009], versus just one in 2008. Of these, 11 were confirmed. More
serious, one person died of dengue in May [2009], against no deaths
[in that period] last year.

Statistics now represent 50 percent of those [dengue cases]
registered in 2007, when there was an epidemic, with 2 deaths among
45 600 cases. This is to say that the disease is more lethal this
year, now that there has been one death among 213 confirmed cases.
[With just one death and a much small number of cases so far, it is
too early to conclude that the case fatality rate is higher, but
bears watching over the coming weeks. - Mod. TY]

[Considering] September -- the increase is much more significant if
one considers only the month of September [2009]. There were 36
confirmed [dengue] cases, an increase of 1700 percent over the 2
positive [cases] for the same period last year [2008].

Since June [2009], there was a decrease in cases of DHF. Only one
suspect [case] was reported in August. But the Health Department is
warning about the occurrence of the worst kind [of dengue disease],
especially in people who have contracted dengue fever before or have
some kind of disease such as diabetes, AIDS, heart problems, among others.

The reported dengue cases have increased 483 percent this year
[2009], compared to the same period last year [2008], according to
the bulletin of the Epidemiological Surveillance Nucleus. From
January up to this week, 1006 people sought [attention at] health
facilities with symptoms of the disease. So far, at least 70 percent
of suspected cases have been confirmed, leaving Dourados as a
municipality with a high incidence of dengue. Another 45 cases are
still awaiting results of laboratory tests.

Most of the cases are classical dengue [fever], a less serious type
of disease. Meanwhile, public health has recorded 8 cases of dengue
with complications, including 3 children of less than 10 years.

According to the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit, the technical
evaluation of the cases shows that dengue affects mainly women (57
percent of confirmed cases) and is concentrated in the age group 10-49 years.

Despite the increase of almost 500 percent in relation to last year
[2008], public health verified the decline in the number of reports
in the last 2 months. The greatest period of the outbreak occurred in
the period March-August, with 939 suspected cases reported.

A detailed dengue survey showed that 19 neighborhoods in Dourados had
half of the [dengue] reports made this year [2009]. These same
neighborhoods have 62 percent of the confirmed cases.

The seasonality of the disease [dengue] is proven again. After an
outbreak of dengue in 2005, this year [2009] Rondonopolis is again
presenting very high levels of disease. Since the beginning of the
year [1 Jan 2009] through last Friday [16 Oct 2009], 837 dengue cases
of all types have been recorded, compared with 42 confirmed cases
during the whole of 2008.

From the beginning of the year [1 Jan 2009] up to last Friday (16
[Oct 2009]), 807 cases of classical dengue have been registered, 9 of
dengue with complications and 21 of DHF. In addition, this year 2
dengue deaths from DHF have occurred. According to the data from
SINAN [the national notifiable diseases information system], 760
cases were discarded [as dengue infections] and 28 were inconclusive
after the examination, that is, it was not possible to specify
whether or not there really was dengue [virus infection].

According to the coordinator of the municipal Public Health
Collective, Alencar Lebano de Paula, numbers are high because cases
were verified by virus isolation; the virus that circulated in the
city was [dengue virus] type 3 and earlier this year [2009] the
presence of types 1 and 2 [dengue] viruses was confirmed. Alencar
says that type 2 is more aggressive [virulent] and can lead to DHF.
"In April [2009] we verified that [dengue] virus types 1 and 2 were
circulating in the city. These same virus types were detected first
in Cuiaba and Varzea Grande, and since there is no physical barrier
between these cities, it [the viruses] arrived in Rondonopolis. There
will be a time when the people will be resistant [immune] to [dengue
virus] type 2 and we will not have so many cases of dengue," he explained.

In 2005, the municipality also registered a dengue outbreak, which
motivated the population to mount cleanup campaigns as well as
prevention measures, which has been done this year [2009] as well.

When professionals from the Municipal Health check a new case of
dengue they carry out the isolation of 14 blocks near the patient's
home, to prevent infected mosquitoes from passing along the disease
[virus] to other residents. The Secretariat works in accordance with
the National Dengue Control Program, according to regulations issued
by the Ministry of Health.

A [health] brigade of 120 people was charged with reducing the
presence of mosquitoes by 98 percent in the urban zone of the central
area of Silao.

The state Secretariat of Health this [Thu 15 Oct 2009] detected the
1st outbreak of classical dengue in the central area of Silao
municipality, announced the secretary of health, Armando Aguirre
Torres. The locally acquired cases include 6 women and a man [whose
samples] were submitted to the Guanajuato Regional Laboratory and
[the patients] were under medical treatment, said the official. These
patients are added to the 18 Guanajuato residents who were attacked
this year [2008] by _Aedes aegypti_ [transmitting dengue virus],
indicated the health official.

The mosquito vector of the disease [virus] is present in 28
municipalities of the state, with greatest incidence in the
industrial zone, among these Silao, Leon, Irapuato, Celaya, and
Salamanca. The official signaled that a health alert has been issued
in 46 municipalities of the state, with emphasis on localities where
the mosquito proliferates.

Aguirre Torres pointed out that actions have been intensified in
Silao with the formation of citizen networks for prevention and
health promotion based on the strategy of "clean patios" and
attention to [mosquito breeding in] stored water, with fogging using
heavy machines in public streets, portable equipment for use in
houses, backpack [equipment], and [mosquito] larva control through
house-to-house visits.

The official stressed that the ongoing epidemiological alert is due
to the proliferation of the vector, hence the importance of
maintaining the fight against _Aedes_ and cleanup measures,
elimination of trash and monitoring of stored water.

Dr Maritza Cuan, director of the Health Department reported today [17
Oct 2009] that Nicaraguan health authorities have increased their
preventive measures for the elimination of the causes of an increase
in [the number of] people affected by dengue. Now the fight is not
just centered on the mosquito vector, but also on the areas that
serve as reproduction [sites], pointed out Cuan. She added that
activities against the vector include not only abate [larvicide]
application and fumigation, but also collection of trash, which the
population discards in yards and waste places.

In the capital department [state or province equivalent] 853
classical dengue cases have been registered, 14 more than in the
previous day, 25 DHF [cases], and 5 deaths.

At a national level there are 1777 confirmed cases with 8 deaths,
with Managua heading the affected areas, followed by Masaya, Carazo,
Leon, Chinandega, Boaco, Chontales, Matagalpa, the South Atlantic
Autonomous Region, and Rio San Juan.

Venezuela has had a dengue epidemic for 11 weeks. Fumigation
campaigns have not given the results hoped for. Venezuela's dengue
epidemic has been going on for 11 weeks, as reflected by the Ministry
of Health in its epidemiological bulletin no. 38 of this year [2009]
(for 20-26 Sep 2009), which counts a total of 33 899 cases so far
this year, 2.7 percent less than those registered in 2008 for the
same dates (34 879 [cases]).

This official document, which came from the health office, indicates
that although there is a decline [in cases], this could be temporary,
due to the constant increase in the number of ill people reported in
the past 10 weeks. 736 cases registered from 12-18 Jul 2009 (week 38)
increasing to 1827 cases registered from 20-26 Sep 2009 ([week] 38).

The states with the greatest number of cases are Aragua
(3.948[cases]), Lara (3263), Barinas (3011), Zulia (2550), and
Monagas (2197). Other data that call attention are the deaths. The
regional epidemiological reports for the current year [2009] have
noted 7 dengue deaths: 3 in Lara, 3 in Aragua, and 2 in Carabobo. In
2008 the Ministry of Health did not register any deaths.

Up to 26 Sep [2009], the national administration has confirmed 2731
DHF cases, which represents 8.1 percent of the total [dengue]
illnesses. The incidence [ratio] between dengue fever/DHF is 18:1.

The 639 classical dengue cases registered up to this past Tuesday [20
Oct 2009] in Chiriqui province practically constitute an epidemic, as
indicated by Pablo Acosta, regional chief of epidemiology of the
Ministry of Health.

He warned that people should take this problem seriously in order to
prevent larger ones. The circulation of several types of dengue virus
in the region increases the likelihood of reported new cases of DHF.

The Secretariat of Public Health admitted that every day hospital and
private clinic admissions for dengue increase, but denied that an
epidemic exists, while just in the Robert Reid Hospital this Monday
[19 Oct 2009], 30 children were admitted for this disease. The dengue
admissions in assistance centers are increasing, which worries the
secretary of health Bautista Rojas Gomez.

However, the official denies that a dengue epidemic exists in the
country, despite that more than 3400 cases and 26 deaths from this
disease have been reported.

Meanwhile the Hospital Robert Reid's demand for assistance for dengue
is increasing and this Monday [19 Oct 2009] they had admitted 30
children, as the director of this health center, Emilio Mena Castro,
reported. Ill people continue to arrive from San Cristobal, Bani, and
neighborhoods in the capital, while many mothers agree that it is
necessary to eliminate mosquito breeding sites.

What most worries experts in dengue management is that the disease is
complicated by other viruses, which increases the risk of death in
the country [Which other viruses? Other dengue virus serotypes? - Mod.TY]

It is estimated that in the months of November and December, as has
occurred in previous years, the [number] of dengue cases will
increase even more.

Dengue fever is expected to have reached a 10-year peak and to stay
at that level until the end of November [2009], according to Ha Noi
Preventive Medicine Centre spokeswoman Nguyen Nhat Cam. The fever
[cases are] said to have reached a 10-year peak and to stay at that
level until the end of November.

The epidemic often had a cycle of 3-5 years or 5-10 years, said Cam,
who is head of the centre's Infectious Diseases Control Department.
The fever broke out on a large scale in 1998, thus this year [2009]
was the peak of cycle, he said.

In July [2009], 783 people were hospitalised with dengue fever. Since
early September [2009], the number of cases has topped 2800, 14.5
times higher than the same period last year [2008].

Cam said many people were still not cooperating in the prevention and
treatment to control the epidemic. "They don't let health-care staff
enter and spray anti-mosquito chemicals because they are afraid it
will harm their health," she said. "In fact, these chemicals do not
have a long-term effect and only kill mosquitoes carrying the fever
virus to avoid the epidemic spreading," Cam said.

National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology director Nguyen Tran
Hien said those who were affected could suffer a relapse in the same
epidemic season. "It can even get more serious if one relapses
because of getting another type of dengue fever virus," he said. He
advised patients to watch complication symptoms from the 4th to the
7th day after getting the fever, including tiredness, vomiting,
stomach ache, difficulty in breathing, and hypodermic (beneath the
skin) bleeding. If these symptoms occur, patients should definitely
see a doctor. [It is not clear what the director means by "relapse".
Symptoms can persist for many days. Infection with another dengue
virus serotype can occur after any limited cross protection from the
previous dengue virus infection wanes. - Mod.TY]

Hien called on the public to raise their awareness of dengue fever as
a preventive measure.

Late and prolonged monsoon in the country has led to a sudden rise in
the number of dengue patients, prompting fears of an outbreak of the
disease in the capital.

Dengue fever, transmitted by the _Aedes_ mosquito, is associated with
monsoon rains, usually from July to September. However, officials
said they had seen more cases in hospitals and clinics this year
[2009] compared to the previous years.

Symptoms of dengue include fever, joint pain, nausea and piercing
headaches. Dengue haemorrhagic fever, a potentially fatal form that
causes internal bleeding and circulatory failure, is most common in
children under 15, but it also occurs in adults. No vaccine is
available yet and there is no specific treatment. So dengue control
is primarily dependent on control of the _Aedes_ mosquito.

Shah Monir Hossain, director-general of the Directorate General of
Health Services (DGHS) told the reporters that the number of dengue
patients has suddenly gone up. "We don't have any figure of the exact
number of patients, but reports from the public and private hospitals
and clinics suggest that number of dengue patients has been on the
rise since Eid," he said. [EID is a Muslim holiday that marks the end
of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. - Mod.TY]

Meanwhile, Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) mayor, Sadeq Hossain Khoka,
said that as of 1 Oct 2009, a total of 405 dengue patients had been
admitted to hospitals and clinics in Dhaka.

Health officials have urged people not to panic, citing the capacity
of the health service to deal with the disease. However, city
dwellers have criticised the DCC for clogged sewers and poor mosquito
control, prompting the mayor to announce a massive city cleanliness
and awareness raising campaign on 3 Oct [2009]. [Clogged sewers,
although a public health risk for other reasons, are not the problem
contributing to _Aedes_ dengue virus vector mosquito populations --
water catchments in houses and building are, something that the
residents of these buildings can do something about to eliminate, if
informed. - Mod.TY]

Health workers have reported 5 or 6 new cases daily at each of the
hospitals and clinics, but NGO workers warned that the number of
people with dengue would be much higher in the city's congested
slums. The situation might worsen in the next few days, as the hot,
humid conditions will help breed more mosquitoes, medical sources said.

A dengue outbreak in Bangladesh in 2000 infected over 5000 people and
93 died, while over 6000 were infected and 58 died in 2002, according
to WHO figures.
