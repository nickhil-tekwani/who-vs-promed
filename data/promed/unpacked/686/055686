State Continues to Warn Residents of Salmonella Outbreak
New Case Brings Total to 22, ABQ Beef Jerky Plant Remains Closed
--------------------------------------------------
The New Mexico Departments of Health and Environment continue to urge
residents not to consume beef jerky products made by Old Santa Fe Trail
Food Products and Route 66 Food Products of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The
state joined the city of Albuquerque's Environmental Health Department
earlier this week in a recall after a salmonella outbreak was linked to
these products.
The state Scientific Laboratory Division has confirmed that the salmonella
is a rare form known as _Salmonella kiambu_. In addition, the state has
also confirmed another case of the illness, bringing the total of those
infected to 22. Several other individuals have called the state complaining
of illness after eating beef jerky. These individuals are not confirmed and
are being investigated.
New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) is concerned that some consumers
and store owners may not be aware of the recall. NMED field staff is
inspecting stores and contacting owners around the state to ensure the beef
jerky products have been pulled from shelves. Consumers with this beef
jerky product in their homes are advised to return it to the place of
purchase for a refund.
Old Santa Fe Trail Beef Jerky and Route 66 Beef Jerky were distributed in
New Mexico through grocery stores, convenience stores, at the New Mexico
State Fair and by mail order. The beef jerky product is packaged in plastic
and cellophane clear bags or paper bags with a label and seal stating the
name of the company:
Old Santa Fe Trail Beef Jerky, Red Chili, Green Chili, Peppered or Natural
Size: Net Wt ___ oz.
General Store, Route 66 Beef Jerky, Red Chili, Green Chili, Peppered or
Natural Size: Net Wt ____ oz.
Albuquerque Environmental Health Department, the state Department of Health
and the state Environment Department required the recall after several
cases of salmonella were linked to the company's Albuquerque processing
plant, specifically in its beef jerky products. The plant was closed after
investigators found unsanitary conditions.
20 of the 22 infected people reported consuming beef jerky. Cases have been
confirmed in the following counties: Los Alamos 1, Taos 1, Santa Fe 2, Rio
Arriba 2, Bernalillo 15, and one whose location has not been identified.

We would like to respond to the statement in the last posting that New
Mexico had 8 outbreaks related to beef jerky in 2002. We believe the
writer was referring to the article: Eidson M, Sewell CM, Graves G, and
Olson R. Beef jerky gastroenteritis outbreaks. Environmental Health
2000;Jan/Feb:9-15. That article discusses the 8 documented outbreaks of
gastrointestinal illness due to beef jerky consumption in New Mexico from
1967 to 1995. 6 of these outbreaks were due to beef jerky contamination
with various _Salmonella spp._ while 2 were due to _Staphylococcus aureus_
contamination.
Based on this series of outbreaks, the New Mexico Environment Department
developed extensive regulations for the production of beef jerky. These
regulations have slowed -- but obviously not stopped -- outbreaks related
to beef jerky. In most outbreak situations, the New Mexico Department of
Health and the New Mexico Environment Department have discovered gross food
sanitation violations, inadequate time-temperature processes, inadequate
product labelling, and lack of distribution records.
