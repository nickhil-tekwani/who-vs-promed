[The outbreak has become so large partly because of the volume of
bear meat involved, and since more than 100 people consumed the meat,
we can expect more cases. Last year in 2007, there were 171 cases of
trichinellosis registered in 34 places, and in 2006, 201 cases were
registered. The majority of the cases are registered in the Siberian
federal district of Russia. See

[The report probably is an update on the outbreak reported on 22 Jun
2008 from Zabaykalye, Tomsk. _Trichinella_ is endemic in bear, and
infection can only be avoided by not eating bear meat or by
thoroughly cooking bear meat before it is consumed. - Mod.EP]
