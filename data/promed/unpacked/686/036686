The Welsh Government says it has identified the body of a cow with mad cow disease.

A statement from Rebecca Evans, deputy farming and food minister, said: "The Welsh Government and the Animal and Plant Health Agency have confirmed a case of classical BSE in a single deceased bovine on a farm in Wales. The case was identified as a result of the strict control measures we have in place. It did not enter the human food chain, and the Food Standards Agency and Public Health Wales have confirmed there is no risk to human health as a result of this isolated case. There have been a number of sporadic cases of BSE identified across the UK in recent years. The last case recorded in Wales was in 2013."

Ms Evans said her officials were working with the UK Government department DEFRA and the Animal Plant Health Agency to investigate the circumstances of the case. "Identification of this case demonstrates that the controls we have in place are working well," Ms Evans added.

Llyr Gruffydd AM, Plaid Cymru's shadow minister for rural affairs said: "This is an isolated case, and there is absolutely no risk to human health. We can be reassured by the fact that this case was identified, as it demonstrates that the systems in place are working effectively."

The English Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs [DEFRA] has a comprehensive guide on BSE. It lays out the restrictions on movement for livestock that come into play if a case is suspected. In essence, livestock is not moved off a farm if a case of BSE is suspected.

DEFRA says, in its guide to farmers, that: "If one of your animals is showing signs of BSE, you must report this to your local APHA office. An APHA vet will visit your farm and carry out a veterinary assessment on the animal as soon as possible. If the APHA vet suspects your animal has BSE, they'll issue a notice restricting the movement of the animal (movement restriction). They'll either cull the animal on your premises or transport it to an APHA laboratory for slaughter depending on the animal's condition. They'll put a herd restriction in place prohibiting the movement of cattle on and off your farm (whole herd restriction) and test your animal to find out if it has BSE. Once cohort and offspring animals are identified, they'll issue notices restricting the movements of these animals, and the whole herd restrictions are lifted. If BSE is suspected in a female cow, the APHA will trace any of its offspring that were born up to 2 years before or after the mother showed signs of the disease. They'll put movement restrictions in place, and they'll slaughter the offspring if BSE is confirmed in the mother."

There has been just one death from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in the last 3 years.

The location of the farm where the latest case was found hasn't been identified, and it's not known what measures were put in place on the farm as a result.
