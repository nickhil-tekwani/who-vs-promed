Around 20 000 people in Stockholm stayed home this evening [23 Dec
2008] with sickness and vomiting. An unusually significant outbreak
of norovirus disease has already affected about 10 care units. Now,
hospital staff fear that the number of beds will not be enough this
Christmas [2008].

"We urge people who have norovirus illness to stay at home and
instead make contact with the medical information service by
telephone," said Svante Baehrendtz, head doctor at Karolinska
University Hospital.

This aggressive virus has, during the last couple of weeks, spread to
several hospitals in Stockholm County. At Karolinska University
Hospital in Solna, 7 care units have been affected, and 3 have had to
be closed. Since the weekend, 2 units at Stockholm South General
Hospital and one at Sodertalje Hospital have been closed.

The epidemic norovirus disease arrived unusually early this year
[2008], and lab tests have shown that this year's epidemic is
unusually widespread.

Yesterday [22 Dec 2008], head doctors at Stockholm's hospitals held a
telephone conference about the situation with regard to the
availability of hospital beds during the holiday period. Capacity
over the holidays is reduced, but Svante Baehrendtz gave assurances
that emergency medical care would work as usual. However, the lack of
hospital beds may make it necessary to move patients between the
hospitals.

[With the onset of outbreaks of norovirus infection, individual
hospitals are often put under stress. The extent of this outbreak in
Stockholm affecting hospitals citywide is unusual and comes early in
the season, perhaps a forewarning of worse to come.
