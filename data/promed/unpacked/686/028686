Minister's word of advice on dropsy
Delhi's Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Dr Harsh Vardhan asked
people not to panic if they found themselves or their family members
developing symptoms of dropsy following consumption of mustard oil.
Normally, dropsy is a non-fatal and self-limiting disease, the Minister
said while advising people to immediately contact the nearest doctor on the
slightest apprehension of suspected symptom. The minister visited several
hospitals to inspect the treatment being given to patients who fell ill
after consuming adulterated mustard oil during the past few days. He
informed that they were progressing satisfactorily and no problem had
arisen in their treatment.
