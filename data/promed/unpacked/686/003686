15 cases of botulism have been reported in Rostov. 2 women have died
from botulism in Sholohovo rayon [district - Mod.LL]. The main
recommendation of specialists is to be more attentive in the
consumption of food products. Botulism is a serious intoxication
generally associated with ingestion of food products that are
contaminated with the serotype of _Clostridium botulinum_ that produces
toxin.
The oblast [province - Mod.LL] sanitary epidemiological surveillance
center is currently checking sale points and the food industry.
Physicians are recommending not to eat food from cans that have swollen
and recommends greater care during the process of food canning.

[Rostov is located in the eastern part of European Russia, on Lake
Nero. It is a road and rail junction and has food-processing and
flax-spinning plants. One of Russia's oldest cities, Rostov was
founded in 862. The city was also known as Rostov-Veliki (Great
Rostov) and Rostov-Yaroslavski. - Mod.NR]
[Most of the cases of botulism related to canned food are due to
improper home canning, but commercially canned food has been
implicated on occasion. Spores of _C. botulinum_ are quite
ubiquitous in the environment and may cause botulism through in situ
growth and toxin formation, as occurs in the intestinal tract of
infants (infant botulism) or adults (adult colonization botulism) or
a contaminated wound (wound botulism).
Additionally, botulism is a category A bioterrorism disease, and the toxin can
even be aerosolized. A recent on-line publication examined the theoretical
effects of contamination of a milk-processing plant in the USA with the toxin.

Abstract:
--------
We developed a mathematical model of a cows-to-consumers supply chain
associated with a single milk-processing facility that is the victim
of a deliberate release of botulinum toxin. Because centralized
storage and processing lead to substantial dilution of the toxin, a
minimum amount of toxin is required for the release to do damage.
Irreducible uncertainties regarding the dose-response curve prevent
us from quantifying the minimum effective release. However, if
terrorists can obtain enough toxin, and this may well be possible,
then rapid distribution and consumption result in several hundred
thousand poisoned individuals if detection from early symptomatics is
not timely. Timely and specific in-process testing has the potential
to eliminate the threat of this scenario at a cost of less than 1 cent per
gallon and should be pursued aggressively. Investigation of improving
the toxin inactivation rate of heat pasteurization without
sacrificing taste or nutrition is warranted.
