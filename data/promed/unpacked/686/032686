[In September 2015, Croatia reported an outbreak of bluetongue serotype 4 to the OIE located on the island of Vis in the Adriatic Sea about 40 km (25 mi) off Croatia's coastline. The event was reported as resolved on 15 Dec 2015. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=18764.

The municipality of Viljevo in the county of Osijek-Baranja (see map at http://tinyurl.com/z8erdu7) where the current outbreak was reported, is located close to the Hungarian border. According to information submitted to the OIE, in 2014/15 Hungary reported 2 events of BTV. The 1st event started on 14 Oct 2014 where BTV-4 was identified and reported as resolved on 10 Jan 2015 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=16314. The 2nd event started on 9 Sep 2015, and although it was considered resolved on 13 Dec 2015, the serotyping is still pending (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=18625).

For a general overview of the BTV situation in the area, please refer to the "disease outbreak maps" for the dates 1 Jan 2015 to 19 Jan 2016 at http://tinyurl.com/z343yyn. - Mod.CRD

Fresh BTV infections this time of the year are rather unusual, raising several questions. It would be helpful to note why this serological test, on bovine(s) without clinical signs, has been performed. Is it part of active surveillance? In case affirmative, have all animals on the premises been tested? Or only several of them, according to a prescribed sampling policy? In case the latter, what is the size of the sample and has the surveillance included other holdings/regional/countrywide? In case it is not part of active surveillance, what has led to the performance of the sampling/testing? Are there unvaccinated sheep in the area? Lots of questions... - Mod.AS
