An elderly patient has died following an outbreak of listeriosis in two Northern Ireland hospitals. The pensioner was one of two patients in the Antrim Area Hospital who contracted the food-borne bacteria. Another acquired the bug in the Causeway Hospital on the region's north coast. The patient who died was already ill but listeriosis has been confirmed as a contributory cause of death.

Both hospitals are managed by the Northern Trust, which has declared an outbreak. The Trust's director of nursing Olive MacLeod said: "The person who died was a frail, elderly patient who had other illnesses but this _Listeria_ infection did contribute to their death."

Listeriosis is usually associated with refrigerated food stuffs. Chilled meats, soft cheeses, cold cuts of meat, pates and smoked fish are all potential sources. Ms MacLeod said a full investigation was under way but said the hospitals were satisfied with how cold food was managed. She said listeriosis was "uncommon" in a hospital setting. "Normally there would be between three to five cases of listeriosis per annum in Northern Ireland," she added. "Because these three cases have occurred within a short period of time, we are declaring an outbreak."

A series of measures have been introduced in response to the outbreak with visitors to the hospitals being told not to bring food in from the outside.

[Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis, caused by _Listeria monocytogenes_, that is transmitted from the intestinal tract of farm animals to humans by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur annually in the USA), but the disease has an overall mortality rate of 20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as, HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.

The organism can be killed by pasteurization, but contamination may occur after pasteurization. Although cooking can kill the organism, contaminated surfaces in food preparation areas can recontaminate previously cooked food that requires no further cooking prior to eating. The organism can then continue to grow in the refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat product, since _L. monocytogenes_ grows at refrigerator temperatures. Its presence in food does not alter the taste or smell of the food.

Food implicated in outbreaks has included raw milk and pasteurized milk, soft cheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie, and Camembert, ice cream, raw vegetables, delicatessen salads such as coleslaw, cold cuts, turkey franks and other hot dogs, raw and smoked fish, shellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken.

A detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail post 20071230.4186. Nosocomial listeriosis has been described before related to food service in health care facilities, but is quite uncommon. Since listeriosis is more severe in newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses, food such as refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat products, e.g., cold cut meats, should not be part of a menu in health care settings.
