FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN VIETNAM
See also: <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_17.HTM#Sec6> 25 May 2006
Information received on 20 and 24 May 2006 from Dr Bui Quang Anh,
Director, Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development, Hanoi:
Report date: 19 May 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: a sudden and unexpected increase
in the incidence of a listed disease prevalent within a country or
zone/compartment.
Identification of agent: foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype O.
Date of start of the event: 2 Jan 2006.
Description of the outbreak: [I have summarized this extensive OIE
report below. - Mod.PC]
The outbreaks have been widespread involving 330 communes and 114
districts in 32 provinces. The earliest reports occurred on 2 Jan
and there were also 2 in February; March had 4 outbreaks and then
multiple outbreaks occurred in April and May of 2006. Overall,
there have been 30 724 cases resulting 10 708 deaths, with swine
accounting for much of the mortality with 15 877 cases resulting 10
541 deaths resulting in a high case fatality rate of approximately 66
percent. The case fatality rate in cattle and buffaloes, on the
other hand, is just around 1 percent.

FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN VIETNAM: Virus type Asia 1
See also: <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_17.HTM#Sec7> 25 May 2006
Immediate notification report
Information received on 20 and 24 May 2006 from Dr Bui Quang Anh,
Director, Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development, Hanoi:
Report date: 24 May 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: first occurrence of a new strain
of a pathogen associated with a listed disease in a country.
Identification of agent: foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype Asia 1.
Date of start of the event: 5 May 2006.
Details of the outbreak: The outbreak occurred in Ha Giang province
in 19 communes located in 6 districts affecting 497 cattle and
buffaloes as well as 7 pigs.
[The World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease at
Pirbright in the U.K. types samples submitted annually. Since 2001,
they report the Asia 1 strain from Afghanistan, Georgia, Iran and
Turkey in 2001; Bhutan, Pakistan, Iran and Myanmar in 2002, Pakistan
in 2003, Iran and Pakistan in 2004 and China, Pakistan and Iran in
2005.
The January - March 2006 OIE/FAO FMD Laboratory quarterly report
(<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/aphthovirus/index.html>)
compares the Asia 1 virus isolated from Viet Nam with the previous
submitted samples and concludes that the virus resembles those found
in Thailand and Myanmar and not those found in China, Russia and
Mongolia. FMD serotype O has been reported in Viet Nam every year
since 2002.
This report confirms the presence of serotype Asia 1 in the country
but the vast majority of cases and deaths appears to be associated
with serotype O in pigs. So far, serotype Asia 1 appears to be
associated with only 7 pigs with 3 of those dying, not quite as high
as the case fatality rate for serotype O given above. It is an axiom
of epidemiology that new strains generally have higher mortality and
morbidity than strains that have circulated in the population for a
while. We will have to wait until more data and details from the
laboratory test results come in to determine the comparative case
fatality and mortality rates for the 2 strains in pigs.
Ha Giang province is in the Northern mountainous region of Viet Nam
and is home to many ethnic minorities. A map and brief overview of
Ha Giang can be found at
