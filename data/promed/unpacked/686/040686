Comparing deaths from pandemic and seasonal influenza
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 -- briefing note 20
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Efforts to assess the severity of the H1N1 influenza pandemic
sometimes compare numbers of confirmed deaths with those estimated
for seasonal influenza, either nationally or worldwide. Such
comparisons are not reliable for several reasons and can be
misleading. Numbers of deaths for seasonal influenza are estimates.
They use statistical models designed to calculate so-called excess
mortality that occurs during the period when influenza viruses are
circulating widely in a given population.

Estimates using all-cause mortality
-----------------------------------
The models use data, as recorded in death certificates and medical
records, indicating mortality from all causes, and compare the number
of deaths during epidemics of seasonal influenza with baseline data
on deaths during the rest of the year. The assumption is that
infections with influenza viruses contribute to the "excess
mortality" observed during the influenza season.

During epidemics of seasonal influenza, around 90 percent of deaths
occur in the frail elderly, who often suffer from one or more chronic
medical conditions. Although influenza can worsen these conditions
and contribute to death, testing for influenza viruses is not done in
most cases, and deaths are usually attributed to an underlying
medical condition.

Methods for estimating excess mortality were introduced in the 19th
century to capture these influenza-associated deaths that would
otherwise be missed. Such estimates have helped counter assumptions
that influenza is a mild illness that rarely kills.

Laboratory-confirmed deaths
---------------------------
In contrast, numbers of deaths from pandemic influenza, as notified
by national authorities and tabulated by WHO, are
laboratory-confirmed deaths, not estimates. For several reasons,
these numbers do not give a true picture of mortality during the
pandemic, which is unquestionably higher than indicated by
laboratory-confirmed cases.

As pandemic influenza mimics the signs and symptoms of many common
infectious diseases, doctors often do not suspect H1N1 infection and
do not test. This is especially true in developing countries, where
deaths from respiratory diseases, including pneumonia, are common
occurrences. Moreover, routine testing for pandemic influenza is
costly and demanding, and beyond the reach of most countries.

When testing confirms H1N1 infection in patients with underlying
medical conditions, many doctors record these deaths as due to the
medical condition, and not to the pandemic virus. These cases are
also missed in official statistics.

As recent studies have shown, some tests for H1N1 infection are not
entirely reliable, and false-negative results are a frequent problem.
Accurate test results further depend on how and when samples were
taken. Even in the best-equipped hospitals, doctors have reported
seeing patients with distinctive and virtually identical disease
profiles, yet only some have positive test results.

Moreover, in a large number of developing countries, systems for
vital registration are either weak or non-existent, meaning that most
deaths are neither investigated nor certified in terms of the cause.

Younger age groups
------------------
Comparisons of deaths from pandemic and seasonal influenza do not
accurately measure the impact of the pandemic for another reason.
Compared with seasonal influenza, the H1N1 virus affects a much
younger age group in all categories -- those most frequently
infected, hospitalized, requiring intensive care, and dying.

WHO continues to assess the impact of the influenza pandemic as
moderate. Accurate assessments of mortality and mortality rates will
likely be possible only 1 to 2 years after the pandemic has peaked,
and will rely on methods similar to those used to calculate excess
mortality during seasonal influenza epidemics.

[Recently there has been much discussion regarding the relative
severity of the current outbreak of pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009
virus infection, and in particular the appropriateness (or
inappropriateness) of the term 'mild' in this context. This WHO
briefing note advises caution and argues that it is premature to
reach a conclusion at this time. - Mod.CP]
