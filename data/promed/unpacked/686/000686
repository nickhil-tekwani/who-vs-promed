New York State agriculture commissioner Richard A Ball today warned consumers not to eat "dry bream-lesh (fish)" sold by Tatuka, Inc, located at 393 Ave P in Brooklyn, New York 11223 and distributed by Royal Sweet Bakery, located at 119 49th Street in Brooklyn, New York 11232, because the product was found to be uneviscerated.

The "dry bream-lesh (fish)" was sold from retail stores to consumers in the NYC Metro area. The product was packaged in a clear, vacuum-packed, flexible plastic pouch and offered for sale at refrigerated temperatures. The product is coded with a "best before: 01:08:2015" date and is a product of Russia.

Uneviscerated processed fish is prohibited under New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets' regulations because _Clostridium botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any other portion of the fish.

The "dry bream-lesh (fish)" was found by New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets food inspectors during a routine inspection of the retail firm. Subsequent analysis by New York State Food Laboratory personnel confirmed the product to be uneviscerated.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with the product. Consumers who have this product are advised not to eat it.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could -- but do not necessarily -- result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
