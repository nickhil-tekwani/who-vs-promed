I have no information nor experience on the possible role of interferon in
allergic reactions to serum and vaccine against rabies. But serum alone
(especially ERIG) is responsible for allergic reactions (Quincke edema,
urticaria, serum sickness...). I have seen too, urticaria in patients given
Suckling Mouse Brain vaccine, especially after several repeated doses of the
vaccine. In the case of your patient, the best way would be to use a cell
culture vaccine (Verorab, or PCEC) and HRIG, if available. Otherwise, I
would give him the full PET as usual, but with antihistamine drugs, and test
his rabies antibody titer, [to avoid giving him too many repeated injections.

There is no indication of whether the cat was rabid. If rabies was
disgnosed, Brazil's Ministry of Health norms coincide with recommendations
of the WHO Expert Committee on Rabies.
Heterologous serum, which is most likely used in Estado do Acre, Brazil, by
itself could cause urticariform reactions.

The questions asked by Dr. Voorham are interesting and probably can not be
answered with any scientific certainty. However, rabies is an invariably
fatal disease (the few survivors ended up as vegetables or near so). Delay
in postexposure treatment while this kind of question is being asked is
inappropriate and might even lead to a legal encounter should the patient
develop rabies due to delay of starting PET.
We have seen this situation at least twice in pregnancy where the doctor
delayed or did not start PET (rabies vaccine and RIG are safe in pregnancy
see our paper in Clin Infect Dis 1995; 20: 818-20). The rare allergic
reactions seen due to vaccine or the 1-6% (depending how purified) of serum
sickness that is seen with ERIG are AND MUST BE acceptable in the event of a
rabies exposure. Delay is dangerous and so is deviation from the WHO
protocol (see Clin Inf Dis 1996;22:228-32). Please get a copy of the last
WHO expert committee on rabies Document 824, WHO Geneva.
I would strongly urge you to start this patient on the best regimen now
available which is: inject wound with ERIG or HRIG then start with a 5
injection course (day 0,3,7,14,28 of any quality tissue or avian culture
vaccine (HDCV, PVRV, PCEC or PDEV-Berna) immediately if you have not done so
already. The discussions which you [raised about interferon can then be
[addressed in good time.
We have not had any experience with rabies exposure in Hep C or B patients
on interferon but have treated many with chronic Hep B and C, alcoholic
cirrhosis, SLE, AIDS and have found no problems though patients with AIDS
and low CD4 counts have low antibody responses.

Dr. Maria Da Silva has forwarded the question about hepatitis C [and
interferon administration to Dr. Tsiang of the rabies list. A quick
response is expected.

[Since one of Dr. Tsiang colleague comments above, we will not wait for his
posting. We have found it advantageous to titer personnel working at the
veterinary school to avoid unnecessary repeated vaccinations. - Mod.PC
