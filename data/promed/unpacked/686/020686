Cause of suspected hemorrhagic fever still unresolved
-----------------------------------------------------
HAMILTON: The [32 year old Congolese woman at the center of a tropical
disease mystery, [remained on life support in an isolated hospital room
last night after her condition deteriorated.
Public health officials say [that almost 70 people, including staff at 3
hospital locations, paramedics, and 2 people in the community, have now
been told to be alert for symptoms of illness after contact with the
patient. Two of those people are considered to be at high risk because they
came in direct contact with her bodily fluids. About 23 laboratory workers
at St Joseph's Hospital who analyzed samples from the ill woman, 40 health
care staff at Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, and 5 paramedics are
included. Chuck Fallis, spokesperson at the Centers for Disease Control
[and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, said samples from Hamilton [had arrived
yesterday morning and testing had begun in an attempt to identify her
mysterious ailment. The Winnipeg laboratory that handles infectious
diseases in Canada has ruled out Ebola and Marburg viruses [as causes of
the patient's illness.
The patient was visiting friends in Hamilton when she fell violently ill
last weekend. [The patient was well on Saturday, when she landed at
Pearson International Airport, via Kinshasa, Addis Ababa, Rome, and Newark,
New Jersey. She cleared customs and immigration and made her way with a
friend to Hamilton [Ontario. But on Sunday afternoon she started
experiencing severe flu-like symptoms while at a friend's house. By evening
[she was ill with fever. [Later in the evening she was taken by paramedics
to Henderson Hospital Emergency Room. In total 5 paramedics had contact
with the patient. Yesterday, at the hospital news conference, doctors said
the 5 paramedics are under medical surveillance.
Though Ebola and Marburg viruses have been [excluded, other viruses
causing virulent hemorrhagic fevers, such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
fever, yellow fever, and Lassa fever viruses have not. The Winnipeg
Category 4 virus laboratory and Atlanta's CDC have made the analysis of the
woman's blood samples top priority, said Dr Douglas MacPherson, an
infectious disease specialist from Health Canada. Dr Mark Loeb, one of the
patient's physicians, said that even though health workers have been
exposed to the mysterious illness, they are at minimal risk. None of the
individuals has any signs of infection. However, 2 of the Henderson staff
are considered to be at high risk because they came in direct contact with
her bodily fluids before the possibility that she had a hemorrhagic fever
was raised. Some workers were not wearing full protective gear needed to
handle biohazardous material. None of the hospital staff has been told to
stay home from work.
