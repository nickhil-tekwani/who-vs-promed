Although the current (7th) pandemic originated in Indonesia (Sulawesi), I
could find no reports for 1995 to April 1997. GIDEON notes that the disease
had been reported from East Nusa Tenggara, Lampung and North Sulawese;
however, these provinces were removed from the "infected areas list" as of
January, 1996. Indonesia reported 6,202 cases (55 fatal) in 1991; 25 (0
fatal) in 1992; 3,564 (1 fatal) in 1993; 47 (0 fatal) in 1994.
