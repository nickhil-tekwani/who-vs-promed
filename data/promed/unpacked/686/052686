French Probing Mad Cow Control
------------------------------
French police are investigating how a cow showing clear signs of mad cow
disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) was not spotted before it
arrived at a slaughterhouse for possible human consumption.
The milk cow arrived last week at the Gallais slaughterhouse. It was killed
along with its herd last Thursday as a precautionary measure after
authorities confirmed it had "distinct signs" of BSE.
Louis Rossignol, the head of the slaughterhouse, said Sunday the cow
appeared to be in good health when purchased along with 27 others at a
cattle market last week in Finistere, northwestern France.
"While being transported, the person in charge of receiving the animals
noted a cow wasn't in a normal condition," Rossignol told France-2
television. "But it had appeared well when leaving the market."
The cow did not have a mandatory health certificate. Rossignol said he
didn't know what could have happened.
Tests were being done on the cows carcass to determine if it had the
disease. Results were expected later in the week. If confirmed, it would be
the sixth case of mad cow in France this year and the 87th since the onset
of the disease.
Scientists have established a link between BSE and a fatal human brain
disease. Authorities say new cases of BSE will break out in France until
2001. It has an average 5-year incubation period, and precautions were not
taken until 1996.
