Beaumont Hospital: winter vomiting disease outbreak curtails admissions
------------------------------------------
The Eastern Regional Health Board is understood to be considering asking
hospitals in the Dublin area to free up beds for patients normally treated
at Beaumont Hospital as the winter vomiting virus [a Norwalk-like virus]
continues to cause serious difficulties. The winter vomiting [disease]
outbreak at Dublin's Beaumont Hospital worsened today. There are now 24
confirmed cases and 74 patients and staff are displaying symptoms.
The hospital has cancelled all elective and non-emergency admissions and
the hospital's accident and emergency department is operating at reduced
capacity. Out of every 3 ambulances with emergency cases, 2 are being
diverted to other hospitals. The virus has now spread to 16 of the
Hospital's 19 wards and 8 members of staff, mainly nurses, have also
contracted the bug. The symptoms include vomiting and dehydration. Beaumont
Hospital has urged the public [not] to visit unless absolutely necessary
and said that children would not be admitted under any circumstances.

Mater Hospital cancels operations to cope with winter vomiting outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
The Mater Hospital has cancelled non-elective surgery as it tries to cope
with an overflow of patients from Beaumont Hospital, which has been hit by
[an outbreak of winter vomiting disease]. The Eastern Regional Health
Authority asked the Mater Hospital to cancel booked admissions to ease the
pressure on Beaumont hospital, which last week cancelled all non-emergency
admissions. Beaumont Hospital repeated its warning on Friday for the public
to stay away unless absolutely necessary. Children are not being admitted
to the hospital as its Accident and Emergency department operates at
reduced capacity.
Of Beaumont's 19 wards, 16 have been affected by the virus [a Norwalk-like
virus], forcing it to quarantine some 76 beds and divert ambulances to
other hospitals in the city. Symptoms of the virus infection include
vomiting and dehydration. Onset of the illness can come as quickly as 6
hours. The condition rarely proves fatal, and sufferers usually recover
within 48 hours.

[Outbreaks of "winter vomiting disease", caused by Norwalk-like viruses,
have continued throughout the summer in the United Kingdom in hospital and
institutional care settings. The name of the condition is becoming a
misnomer. On the other hand, it may be that this is either the tail-end of
the past winter epidemic or the beginning of the next winter epidemic. Some
information on the molecular epidemiology of Norwalk-like virus infection
in the UK and Ireland would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
