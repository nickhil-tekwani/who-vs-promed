The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (May 30) received notification from the National Health Commission on a human case of avian influenza A(H3N8) in Hunan Province, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case involves a 5-year-old boy living in Changsha, Hunan Province, who had visited a live poultry market before onset. He developed symptoms on [9 May 2022] and recovered.

So far, 2 human cases of avian influenza A(H3N8) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.

"All novel influenza A infections, including H3N8, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said.

Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets, or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention, and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food, and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:
- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals, or their droppings;
- when buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
- eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
- wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels, or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
- wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page [https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html], the weekly avian influenza report [https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/resources/29/332.html], global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza [https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf, the Facebook Page [https://www.facebook.com/CentreforHealthProtection, and the YouTube Channel [https://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel].

On [26 Apr 2022], we saw the 1st known human case of H3N8 avian influenza reported in Henan Province, China.

Now the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention retrospectively reports [19 May 2022] on an additional case in Changsa City.

The patient is a 5-year-old boy from Kaifu District. He presented with fever and chills on [9 May 2022] and recovered the next day with symptomatic treatment.

Experts believe this is a bird-to-human cross species transmission.

[The report above is the 2nd human case of avian influenza A/H3N8 in Hunan, China, also reported in a child. The 1st human case was reported in a 4-year-old in Henan province in April 2022.

H3N8 is a strain of avian influenza, or bird flu, which as the name suggests is a virus that spreads naturally through bird populations, especially wild aquatic birds around the world.

Domestic poultry can also get infected, as well as other bird and animal species. H3N8 has been known to infect horses, dogs, and seals, and is also known as equine flu or canine flu.

The H3N8 influenza virus has been reported to be the possible cause of the "Russian flu" during the 1889-1890 season, as the last pandemic of the 19th century (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17488968/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2889325/).

This 2nd human case approximately a month after the 1st indicates that this virus subtype must be in circulation in poultry; the report above mentions a visit to a live bird market, so apparently bird-human transmission events are happening.

Another avian influenza virus trying to breach the species barrier, as previously seen with H5N1, H9N2, and H7N9 avian influenza subtypes that have resulted in sporadic cases and limited transmission events over the last few years. Continued surveillance on this critical animal-human interface is vital for the early detection of similar events for early response and control. - Mod.UBA
