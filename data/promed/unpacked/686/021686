[C] Update 73 - No new deaths, but vigilance needed for imported
cases 4 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_04/en/>
[ProMED-mail would like to thank Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com
for continued monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]
As of today, a cumulative total of 8402 probable SARS cases with 772
deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an
increase of 10 new cases compared with yesterday. The new cases were
reported in Canada (5), Hong Kong (1), Taiwan (2), Germany (1), and
the USA (1).
No new deaths were reported today. This marks the first day with no
new SARS deaths since 28 Mar 2003, when the cumulative totals stood
at 1485 cases and 53 deaths.
The peak numbers of deaths occurred during the second week of March
2003, when as many as 20 new deaths were being reported on some days.
With outbreaks at all the initial "hot zones" either contained or
coming under control, SARS is clearly in decline, indicating that
recommended control measures are effective when combined with
political commitment and determination.
The fact that the chain of transmission has been broken in Viet Nam
and Singapore underscores the WHO position that SARS can be
contained, despite the absence of a vaccine, robust diagnostic test,
and specific treatment. Control currently depends on prompt detection
and isolation of cases, good infection control in hospitals, and the
tracing and quarantine of contacts.
Viet Nam has remained free of new SARS cases since 8 Apr 2003. In
Singapore, the last locally acquired probable case was isolated on 11
May 2003. No new cases have since been detected in either country
despite a high level of alert and aggressive investigation of all
rumoured cases.
The experience in Toronto, where more than 70 new cases have been
reported since 26 May 2003, underscores the risk of a resurgence of
cases and the constant need for vigilance. A single imported case can
reignite an outbreak or bring cases to a new area, if preparedness
measures are weak.
The new case reported today in Germany, in a man recently returned
from Taiwan, has resulted in the quarantine of around 50 contacts.
The man has been hospitalized in isolation.

A 60-year-old male engineer returning from Taiwan was admitted to a
hospital in Hamburg with a suspicion of SARS. As a result, 50
contacts were placed in quarantine. This was announced by the Robert
Koch Institute on 4 Jun 2003. This is the 11th case of SARS reported
