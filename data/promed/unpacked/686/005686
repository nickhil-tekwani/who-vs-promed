FOODBORNE BOTULISM - TEXAS, USA
===============================
Two cases of adult foodborne botulism have been identified in Texas.
The patients, a 65-year-old female and her 60-year-old brother, had
onset of symptoms on 1/12/96 and 1/10/96, respectively. The
patients were hospitalized at different hospitals in
Victoria, Texas. Both had respiratory impairment in addition to
difficulty swallowing, voice changes, and double vision. Botulism
was suspected on 1/18/96 by the pulmonologist who saw both patients.
Serum collected from both patients on 1/18/96 is negative for
botulinal toxin by the mouse assay. Stool collected 1/18/96 from the
brother is negative for toxin but is culture positive for Clostridium
botulinium. Stool has not be collected from the sister.
Both patients have a history of consuming home-canned asparagus. The
sister was given 12 jars of asparagus by a relative. She gave 1 jar
to her brother. The brother consumed one spear the evening of
1/9/96, the asparagus tasted bad, the jar contents were discarded.
The sister tasted asparagus from another jar on the evening of
1/10/96, this asparagus also tasted bad. Contents of her 11 jars
were discarded. The jars were not washed after the contents were
discarded. A pooled washing of these 11 jars was culture
positive for Clostridium botulinium. Botulinal toxin was also
detected in this washing. The relative who canned the asparagus
resides in Washington state. Home-canned asparagus in her possession
also have been positive for botulinal toxin. All remaining jars
(35) of asparagus have been destroyed.
Both patients are recovering. These are the first foodborne botulism
cases reported in Texas since April 1994.
