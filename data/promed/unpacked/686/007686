Jon Eisenback and Paulo Viera, Virginia Polytechnic Institute [USA], conducted nematode surveys on rice in the south of [Cambodia]. They found that the rice fields they surveyed showed a significant loss of production caused by the rice root nematode.

"Every root we looked at had lesions," Eisenback said. The culprit was a parasitic nematode called _Hirschmanniella mucronata_. "Rice roots should be creamy white. These were speckled with brown and orange lesions."

He expects that these nematodes could cause a 20 to 30 per cent crop loss. Half the fields should be treated with nematicide to measure the effect. He also hopes to see what other nematodes are there. "I would suspect that there are fields with other nematode problems."

[A number of nematode pathogens are known to affect rice, including the rice root nematodes (RRN) _Hirschmanniella oryzae_ and other species in the genus. Infested roots show discolouration and are partially hollow and nematode feeding adversely affects absorption of water and nutrients. Plants are yellow and stunted, with reduced tillers. Serious crop losses due to rice root nematodes have been reported, for example from Asia.

The pathogens may be spread with soil, water, and with contaminated equipment. Once soil nematodes have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures (crop rotation), chemical nematicides, or biocontrol agents. Cultivars with reduced sensitivity may be used to keep populations below economically significant thresholds.
