A man from Thai Binh Province has been killed by a swine bacteria infection after eating 'tiet canh' (blood pudding) after doctors and scientists issued many warnings against the danger posed by the traditional dish made from uncooked pig blood.

According to his family, they slaughtered a "healthy" pig they bred at home to celebrate Tet, Viet Nam's biggest holiday, on [28 Jan 2014], and made tiet canh with its blood.

One day after eating the dish, the 48-year-old man had high fever, shivers, and digestive problems but did not go to the hospital. The next day, he was exhausted, his blood pressure dropped and he went into shock, prompting his family to bring him to a local health facility, they said. He was transferred to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases the next morning (Lunar New Year's Day, [31 Jan 2014]) and died later that day.

Dr Nguyen Trung Cap, deputy director of the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases' Emergency Department said on [7 Feb 2014] that the victim tested positive for the _Streptococcus suis_ bacterium, a pathogen found in pigs. Doctors tried to use several treatments and medicines to increase his blood pressure but failed to save him. Cap said the case progressed very fast as blood pressure fell and he went into shock only one day after he had a fever, even though he had yet to develop the typical signs of a bacterial infection at that time.

He told news website Dan Tri that 5 people in the deceased man's family ate tiet canh, but only he was infected with the bacteria. He said that although they all ate the same dish, an infection depends on how each person reacts to the bacteria and on the number of bacteria that are able to penetrate the body. He told Thanh Nien that the hospital had admitted nearly 10 patients infected with and suspected of having the _Streptococcus suis_ bacterial [infection]. All of them had eaten tiet canh, he said. He said most of them ate the dish made from their own pigs, Dan Tri reported. Dr Do Duy Cuong of Bach Mai Hospital's Contagions Department, told Vietnam News Agency on [7 Feb 2014] that his hospital also received many similar cases over the last 10 days as the patients had been eating tiet canh for the Tet holiday.

A common belief among Vietnamese people is that eating the red blood pudding in the beginning of the year will drive away their bad luck from the previous year and bring them luck good for the new year.

Cap said many families often butcher pigs bred at their home and eat tiet canh on Tet as they think homebred pigs cannot be infectious, news website VnExpress reported.

But all pigs pose the risk of carrying the bacteria, and it is highly possible that the bacteria be transmitted from the [infected] pigs to people who eat their [undercooked] meat or tiet canh. He said people should not butcher ill or dead pigs.

They should not process raw pork with bare hands, especially when having injuries on their hands, adding that they should wash their hands carefully before and after processing the meat. They should not eat undercooked pig meat and organs and tiet canh, especially from ill or dead pigs. Those who have direct contact with the ill or dead pigs should wear protective clothing.

Delitescence lasts from a few hours to 3 days, and it is recommended that those who have a high fever of 40 to 41 deg C [104-105.8 deg F], bleeding under the skin, diarrhea, stiff neck, and breathing difficulties should be brought to the hospital immediately to prevent death.

The bacteria can cause complications such as septicemia or blood poisoning and meningitis, which can lead to death or other severe complications, and amputation of the hands or legs due to necrosis.

[The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Streptococcus suis - Viet Nam: (QM, QG) human 20130123.1510728:

_Streptococcus suis_ is sub-divided into at least 34 serotypes that vary in pathogenicity. Serotype 2 is the most frequently isolated serotype from diseased animals. _S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; but virulent strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling pigs (polyarthritis, meningitis, and septicemia) and in recently weaned and growing pigs (meningitis).

_S. suis_ can cause potentially fatal zoonotic infection in humans, namely meningitis, septicemia, and endocarditis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC97186/). Toxic shock may also occur if the strain produces the appropriate toxins.

Human _S. suis_ infection occurs mainly among those who slaughter infected pigs. Eating appropriately cooked meat or organs from infected pigs is said to pose no risk of _S. suis_ infection. However, people who eat raw infected pork and cooks who prepare food from infected pork meat and organs would also be at risk of infection. Person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201).

The viral infection porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_.

Thai Bình, with a population of 1.78 million people (2006), is a coastal province in the Red River Delta region of northern Vietnam, It is 70 km (43 miles) from Haiphong and 110 km (68 miles) from Hanoi. Thai Bình is also the capital city of Thai Bình Province. A map of the provinces of Viet Nam can be seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Vietnam. - Mod.ML
