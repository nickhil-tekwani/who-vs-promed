Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: final data on the 2nd BSE case notified in December [2014; see commentary]. During the last 2 months, the cohort for the infected bovine with atypical BSE (RO1550001082014), coming from the holding with the code R O063535008, in Covasna locality, Covasna County was established. The bovine had only one descendant, with the number code RO500003453657, born in 10 Mar 2014, and which grew up together with the infected bovine, in the same holding, since it was born. This last bovine was slaughtered on 16 Feb 2015 in the slaughterhouse SC. TORO IMPEX SRL in Covasna County. The bovine head was sampled and sent to the Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health (national reference laboratory), and the carcass was sent for destroying to the rendering plant SC PROTAN SA Codlea, Brasov County. Decontamination was performed in the holding of origin, and also to the transport vehicle and to spaces used for bovine slaughtering within the SC. TORO IMPEX SRL slaughterhouse. The animal registration was removed from the national database on 17 Feb 2015, when the case was also closed. Update 04.03.2016 Knowing that the case is still under investigation, the release of any information is currently impossible due to Prosecutor restrictions. Whilst there have been no further cases reported the event should remain open.

[Romania's 1st BSE case was reported to the OIE in an immediate notification dated 20 Jun 2014, addressing an infected cow from Deusu, Chinteni, Cluj. The causal agent was reported as "Prion (atypical BSE L-type)."

Follow-up no. 1, dated 20 Oct 2014, said: "The investigation is closed, all data are available. Measures in accordance with the European Union Regulation 999/2001 are applied."

Follow-up no 2, dated 27 Oct 2014, said: "The investigations were finalized, the identification and the traceability of the bovine with atypical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) were established. The bovines from the cohort of atypical BSE positive bovine were identified. Currently, Romania is taking the measures established by the Regulation 999/2001 for the animals from cohort (killing and destruction)."

Romania's 2nd case of BSE was notified to the OIE in follow-up report no. 3, submitted 23 Dec 2014 (see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=16819). The case involved a single cow reportedly "slaughtered at SC Neval Pietrosita, Dambovita county. No clinical signs." The origin of the cow was given as Reci, Covasna. The causal agent was reported as "prion".

The epidemiological comments were: "One bovine without clinical signs with identification number RO155000108204 slaughtered in a slaughter house in Dambovita County. Follow up to identify the cohort will be done. Control measures in accordance with the EU regulation (CE) 999/2001". The diagnosis was established, by Romania's Institute for Diagnostic and Animal Health (national laboratory), following the obtained positive "rapid tests" and Western blot test.

The next update was included in follow-up report no 4, submitted 3 Mar 2015. It reported the absence of additional BSE cases, and included the following epidemiological comment:
"Final data on the second BSE case notified in December [2014]: During the last 2 months [Jan-Feb 2015], the cohort for the infected bovine with atypical BSE (RO1550001082014), coming from the holding with the code R O063535008, in Covasna locality, Covasna County was established. The bovine had only one descendant, with the number code RO500003453657, born in 10 March 2014, and which grew up together with the infected bovine, in the same holding, since it was born. This last bovine was slaughtered on 16 Feb 2015 in the slaughterhouse SC. TORO IMPEX SRL in Covasna County. The bovine head was sampled and sent to the Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health (National Reference Laboratory), and the carcass was sent for destroying to the rendering plant SC PROTAN SA Codlea, Brasov County. Decontamination was performed in the holding of origin, and also to the transport vehicle and to spaces used for bovine slaughtering within the SC. TORO IMPEX SRL slaughterhouse. The animal registration was removed from the national database on 17 Feb 2015, when the case was also closed."

The current update (follow-up 5 dated 4 Mar 2016) adds one sentence to the epidemiological comment above: "Knowing that the case is still under investigation, the release of any information is currently impossible due to Prosecutor restrictions. Whilst there have been no further cases reported the event should remain open."

This statement, as well as the identity of the causal agent involved in case no. 2, whether "classical" or "atypical", are in need of clarification.
