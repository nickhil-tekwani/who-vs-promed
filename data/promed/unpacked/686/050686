A team of 4 faculty members from the College of Veterinary Science,
Guwahati (Assam) went to Nameri National Park on 19 Aug 2001 to investigate
the cause of mortality in elephants there and returned on 21 Aug 2001.
Combing operations carried out in the past few days by Forest Department
officials led to the discovery, on 15 August, of one more elephant carcass,
bringing the death toll to 9 (earlier posting mentioned 8 carcasses). The
carcass is believed to be a week old and was therefore decomposed. The
absence of vultures in the Park has made early detection of carcasses
difficult.
The combing team of the Forest Department also looked for signs of sickness
in the resident elephant population of the park but found them to be
apparently healthy. Below are the mortality details in this order:
Carcass no. / Date detected / Sex / Height at shoulder (age estimate)
1 / 2 Jul 2001 / Male / 1.2 meters (calf)
2 / 16 Jul 2001 / Male / 1.9 m (sub adult)
3 / 30 Jul 2001 / Male / 2.45 m (adult)
4 / 5 Aug 2001 / Female / 1.9 m (sub adult)
5 / 6 Aug 2001 / Female / 2.4 m (adult)
6 / 7 Aug 2001 / Male / 1.05 m (sub adult)
7 / 7 Aug 2001 / Female / 1.7 m (sub adult)
8 / 13 Aug 2001 / Male / 1.75 m (sub adult)
9 / 15 Aug 2001 / Female / 1.1 m (sub adult)
All the carcasses were found in the vicinity of areas where people have
encroached. Crop depredation by elephants in these areas is well documented
and the villagers are compensated only when there is human casualty, not
for crop damage. Since mortality in other herbivore species (domestic and
free-ranging) due to diseases (anthrax, HS) have not been reported recently
from that area, the college team members have therefore not ruled out
malicious poisoning as the cause of death. The stomach contents of one
elephant (the one found on 15 August) were collected (rest were too
decomposed and washed away) and sent to the State Forensic Laboratory for
analysis.
Biological samples sent earlier by the Veterinarian of Nameri to the
college laboratory showed growth of only saprophytic organisms. 13 working
elephants of Nameri NP whose health was checked by the college team were in
fine fettle. Prophylactic deworming and vaccination were carried out on all
these elephants.
The college team is on call and ready to move at short notice as soon as
the Forest Department detects a new carcass or sees a sick elephant/animal.
Nameri National Park is about 300km/5 hours journey by road from the
college. The cause of death has not been established; meanwhile, we hope
that no more mortality occurs.
