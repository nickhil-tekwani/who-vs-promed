NY Rules Out West Nile Virus in Man's Death
---------------------------------------------

A man whose death raised concerns that he might have been infected with the
mosquito-borne [West Nile virus that killed seven people in the New York
area last year did not have the virus after all, officials said on
Thursday. New York City Health Commissioner Neal Cohen said at a news
conference that blood tests on the man were negative for the brain-swelling
West Nile virus, which had never been detected in the Western Hemisphere
until last year and has returned to the region this year in
mosquitoes and birds.

"Tests were done [for a variety of viruses and for West Nile virus, two
blood samples taken on two separate days, and they turned up absolutely
negative," stated Cohen, who said the definitive cause of the man's death
was not yet known.
Cohen said the 71-year-old man, who was visiting the city borough of Staten
Island from South Carolina when he died Wednesday morning, had other serious
health conditions. His death coincided with the discovery on Staten Island
of two dead birds infected with the West Nile Virus, prompting health
authorities to do precautionary testing. The birds were found in early July
and in further evidence that the virus survived the winter, mosquitoes in
the northern and eastern suburbs were also found to have been infected. The
virus is spread to humans by mosquitoes that have fed off infected birds. At
its worst, it can cause potentially deadly brain diseases such as
encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or meningitis (inflammation of the
lining of the brain and spinal cord).

The elderly and children are particularly vulnerable. Last year, seven
people died and 62 others were sickened by the virus in the New York region.
US health authorities still do not know how the virus, named after the
region in Uganda where it was first detected in 1937, was introduced to the
New York area. It could have been from an infected bird that was imported or
an infected person returning from a country in Africa, southwestern Asia or
the Middle East, where the virus is common.

Spraying Set for Staten Island and Queens After Discovery of More Dead Birds
-----------------------------------------
The city's battle against West Nile Virus heated up on two fronts Friday.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Friday that the city will embark on another
round of ground spraying after three more dead birds tested positive for the
virus: two on Staten Island and the other in the Little Neck/Douglaston
areas of Queens.
Spraying in Little Neck and Douglaston and virtually all of Staten Island is
set for Monday. However, the mayor says state and federal agencies are
restricting the city's ability to spray all the affected areas. The agencies
are not allowing the city to spray in the wetlands. Even though city
officials admit chemicals would kill some plants and wildlife, they say
people's lives should come first. "We're facing the risk of an outbreak of
West Nile Virus which has potential to end life, particularly in vulnerable
people, so we feel that we would like the state and federal government to
give a reconsideration to the balance in order to stem the tide of what
could be a very unacceptable outbreak," says Health Commissioner Neal Cohen.
Mayor Giuliani says he plans to speak with Governor George Pataki in the
hopes of winning his support.
The National Park Service says it isn't against the city spraying on Staten
Island, but it says the salt marshes at Jamaica Bay in Queens [are
off-limits
because it isn't a natural breeding ground for the virus-carrying mosquitos.
The state says it is trying to work with the city, but adds federal law
prohibits spraying pesticides that kill adult mosquitos in wetland areas.
The West Nile Virus killed seven people in the city last summer.

Deadly new mosquito discovered in Massachusetts
-----------------------------------------------
A new species of an Asian mosquito that can carry the dreaded West Nile
virus has been discovered for the first time in Massachusetts.
Entomologists found the mosquito, scientifically known as _Aedes
japonicus_, in a special trap set in Fitchburg, an industrial city
northwest of Boston. Near the trap they also uncovered a pool of the
mosquito larvae in standing water.

The discovery of a third type of mosquito capable of infecting people has
raised fears in the state as swarms of the tenacious insects have invaded
New England communities in reportedly greater numbers than in the past. Some
residents have given up sitting on their decks at night for fear of being
bitten. And towns wrestle with whether to spray or not to spray.Although the
Fitchburg mosquito was this week pronounced free of the virus, health
officials are taking no chances. They have stepped up their testing of
mosquitoes and dead birds that have succumbed to insect bites. They are also
alerting doctors throughout the state to the potential menace in their midst
and beseeching them to be vigilant in reporting adverse symptoms among their
patients, such as severe headache, stiff neck, seizures. The virus can cause
encephalitis, an acute inflammation in the brain, and lead to death.
The West Nile virus first appeared in the United States last year, infecting
68 people in New York, seven of whom died. The killer then was a common
species of mosquito, the _Culex pipiens_,which is typically a night flyer. A
second species, _Aedes vixens_, capable of carrying the virus, also prefers
night life. What makes the newly discovered _Aedes japonicus_ more
threatening is its preference for daytime activity, making it more difficult
to control. Experts believe the species entered the United States from Asia
in used tires shipments. State officials ear more species of mosquitoes
could soon be carrying the virus."This is only a precursor for more
mosquitoes to become vectors" to transmit the disease, Kenneth R.
Courtemanche, superintendent of the Central Massachusetts Mosquito Control
Project, told Thursday's Worcester Telegram.The control unit is advising
residents to refrain from hanging containers in their back yards and to make
sure house gutters are clean. Following last year's outbreak, Massachusetts
was one of 21 states along the East Coast that initiated a wide-scale effort
to destroy the insects. It put larvicide and briquettes in catch basins and
drains and ground sprayed parks and areas where mosquitoes hatched. It
expects to continue such activities and will respond to requests from cities
and towns seeking further aid.

Orange County discovers a mosquito with West Nile virus
--------------------------------------------------------
A mosquito carrying the West Nile virus has been found in Orange County,
officials said. The county now plans to drop larvicide to kill mosquito
[larvae in all of the county's 20 000 municipal storm drains as soon as
next week and to distribute about 30 000 containers of free insect
repellent through local pharmacies.
The mosquito was one of 11 captured July 11 by a trap in the town of
Minisink. Results of the test on a type of mosquito, the day-flying _Aedes
japonicus_, came back late Wednesday. Finding the disease in the less
numerous and rural _Aedes japonicus_ means there is a good chance West Nile
virus will show up in the much more common _Culex pipiens_ house mosquito,
said county Health Commissioner Dr. Maxcy Smith. For now, County Executive
Joseph Rampe doesn't favor spraying the rural habitat of _Aedes japonicus_
with pesticides.

Comment on the potential of _Aedes japonicus_ to transmit West Nile virus
---------------------------------------------------
The recent detection of West Nile (WN) virus in _Aedes japonicus_ mosquitoes
from New York raised the question of the potential of this species to
transmit WN virus by bite. As part of our evaluation of potential vectors of
WN virus we tested both _Aedes japonicus_ and _Culex pipiens_. _Aedes
japonicus_ was a significantly more efficient laboratory vector of WN virus
than was _Culex pipiens_, with transmission rates of 64 and 21%,
respectively, for the two species after feeding on a chicken with a viremia
of about 10^7 plaque-forming units of virus per ml of blood. HOWEVER, the
ability to transmit a virus in the laboratory is just one factor in
determining its vectorial capacity. Of greater importance are host-feeding
preference, population density, and survival relative to the extrinsic
incubation period. Unfortunately, too little is known about this potentially
important vector, and studies need to be conducted to determine these
important parameters.
A manuscript describing the results of our vector competence studies on
these and other potential vectors of WN virus has been submitted for
publication to the Journal of Medical Entomology.
