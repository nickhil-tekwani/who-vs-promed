_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ Beijing outbreak in a school in Marseille, France, 2012
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Golesi F, Brignatz J, Bellenfant M, Raoult D, Drancourt M

Between January and September 2012, a teacher and 4 students at a technical college in Marseille, France, developed pulmonary tuberculosis. All _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolates from these cases were identical and belonged to the Beijing strain family, multispacer sequence type 72, a rare genotype identified only once in our laboratory in the previous 2 years. This report highlights once more the potential for _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing strains to cause outbreaks, this time in a school setting.

Among the different genotypes of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ pathogenic to humans, the Beijing strains -- 1st described 20 years ago in the Chinese capital -- are now known to have a global distribution [1,2]. The Beijing strain family is characterised by its potential to cause epidemics and its association with drug resistance [3,4]. Several outbreaks of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing have been reported in congregate settings such as homeless shelters [5] and prisons [6]. We report on a recent outbreak of pulmonary TB cases attributed to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype in a school.

Outbreak description
---------------------------
In January 2012, a 20-year-old male (Case 1) attending a technical school in Marseille, in southern France, was diagnosed with pulmonary TB and mediastinal lymph node involvement. Direct microscopy examination of 3 sputum specimens did not detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) but _M. tuberculosis_ was cultured from the sputa and broncho-alveolar fluid. The strains were susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid and the patient was successfully treated using a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. In mid-June 2012, a 42-year-old teacher at the same school (Case 2) was also diagnosed with pulmonary TB. He presented with fever and weight loss as well as a cough that had lasted for the previous 6 months. Radiology showed extensive lesions in both lungs with multiple cavitations. 3 sputum samples yielded an average of 100 AFB per microscopy field and _M. tuberculosis_ susceptible to 1st-line anti-tuberculosis drugs was cultured.

Response to 1st-line drug combination therapy was favourable and no AFB were detectable on sputum microscopy after 2 months. In early July 2012, as part of the investigation of these 2 cases by the local public health authorities for TB control, pulmonary TB was diagnosed in a 2nd student in the same school (Case 3) who presented both clinical and radiological signs. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture from sputum specimens, which also isolated drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_.

Contact tracing
---------------
These cases of pulmonary TB clustered in time and place led to a broader investigation including a total of 334 individuals associated with this school in 2012, comprising students, teachers and administrative personnel. All were tested with interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) and 30 tests were interpreted as positive. Those who tested positive were put on prophylactic medication with isoniazid. Family members of the 3 patients who had been in regular contact with the 3 and 20 other persons in a factory where Case 1 was a trainer were also examined by symptom screening, followed by X-ray, and then sputum microscopy. In September 2012, this investigation led to the detection of subclinical pulmonary TB in 2 students (Cases 4 and 5) attending the same class as Case 3. In both cases, culture of respiratory tract samples yielded drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_ isolates.

The investigation led to the hypothesis that the teacher (Case 2) was the source case of this outbreak. The source case had no identified risk for TB from significant contact outside the school or a previous history of TB. Given that his clinical signs and symptoms were initially attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to heavy smoking, the diagnosis of TB was delayed and only confirmed after that of Case 1. Cases 3 and 4 were considered to have been exposed in the class in which the teacher taught. In addition, the teacher gave truck-driving lessons to the students of this class 3 times per week with each session lasting 4 consecutive hours. No direct contact between Case 1 and the teacher was established.

Laboratory investigations
-------------------------
_M. tuberculosis_ isolates collected in all 5 cases were sent to our reference laboratory for further analyses. Molecular testing using a marketed assay (GenExpert, Cepheid, Maureus-Scoport, France) [7] confirmed the identification of _M. tuberculosis_ and detected no mutations associated with rifampicin resistance. Susceptibility testing using conventional liquid culture showed no resistance to all 1st-line antimycobacterials. Real-time PCR genotyping targeting the intergenic region Rv0927c-pstS3 [8] and a 2nd region specific to the Beijing family [9] confirmed a Beijing genotype for all isolates. Multispacer sequence-typing (MST) [10] identified a genotype MST72 and confirmed that the isolates were indistinguishable. Our laboratory had only detected this genotype once previously among 174 strains of _M. tuberculosis_ genotyped since 2010 (data not shown) in a patient born in Thailand and residing in France who had no known contacts with the cases reported in the current outbreak.

Conclusions
-----------
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of an outbreak of _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype infections occurring in a school. This is also the largest outbreak of pulmonary TB detected in Marseille area in the last 15 years: in this area, the other outbreaks have only occurred in penitentiary establishments. This report illustrates the highly pathogenic and highly contagious nature of the Beijing strain family, which requires a quick laboratory confirmation. This outbreak was characterised by the high contagiousness of the source case and a clinically severe picture in 3 of the 5 cases detected. Prolonged contact within the confines of a truck cabin (with an approximate volume of 6 cubic metres) may confer a risk of TB infection not very different from that in a long-haul airplane flight [11]. This outbreak also illustrates the importance of contact tracing and laboratory investigation in improving the early detection of linked cases of TB and the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease even in the presence of other conditions leading to chronic cough. As in this report, most cases of TB today are caused by organisms which are not drug-resistant and which can be cured using a standard treatment with combination of anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months [12]. Patients on treatment only require isolation until they are no longer infectious. Given that Beijing strains are particularly transmissible and often exhibit multi-drug resistance, France and other European countries are concerned with Beijing strain family of _M. tuberculosis_ [13]. Schools should be integrated in nation-wide surveillance systems for TB in France.

[When a person with pulmonary, especially cavitary, or laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, droplet nuclei containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ can become airborne. Depending on the environment, these tiny particles (1-5 microns in diameter) can remain suspended for hours, and can be carried by air currents. If another person inhales these droplet nuclei, transmission may occur.

The probability that TB will be transmitted depends on the infectiousness of the person with TB (the number of organisms expelled into the air), the immune competence of the person exposed, the environment in which exposure occurred, the duration of exposure, and the virulence of the organism. Persons at highest risk for becoming infected with _M. tuberculosis_ are those having prolonged, frequent, or intense contact with a person with infectious TB. Close contacts include family members, roommates, friends, coworkers, or others.

Patients with laryngeal tuberculosis, an uncommon complication of pulmonary tuberculosis, are thought to be particularly contagious; although it is possible that concomitant far-advance pulmonary tuberculosis in these patients contributes to their infectivity (Braden CR, et al. Infectiousness of a University Student with Laryngeal and Cavitary Tuberculosis. Clin Infect Dis 1995; 21: 565-70).

Molecular typing of _M. tuberculosis_ strains in recent years has shown that a group of strains known as "Beijing," which have a similar genotype, are most prevalent in Asia but have been found worldwide; these strains predominate in some geographic areas, and have caused large outbreaks of tuberculosis, sometimes involving multidrug resistance in some regions (Glynn JR, Whiteley J, Bifani PJ, Kremer K, van Soolingen D. Worldwide Occurrence of Beijing/W Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A Systematic Review. Emerg Infect Dis. 2002 August; 8(8): 843-49. Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732522/). One multidrug-resistant strain, designated "W," belonging to the Beijing group, was found in New York City in the early 1990s and caused large institutional outbreaks of tuberculosis in the United States (Bifani PJ, Mathema B, Liu Z, Moghazeh SL, Shopsin B, Tempalski B, et al. Identification of a W variant outbreak of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ via population-based molecular epidemiology. JAMA. 1999;282:2321-7. Available at: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=192231).

Numerous outbreaks of tuberculosis have been reported in schools. Just a brief Internet search disclosed 9 relatively recent reports of school outbreaks:

Transmission rates in classrooms have varied from 10 to 83 percent (Braden CR, et al.
Infectiousness of a University Student with Laryngeal and Cavitary Tuberculosis
Clin Infect Dis 1995; 21: 565-70). High rates of transmission have been reported to occur following even minimal exposure to an infectious patient or in an environment thought not to be conducive to transmission of tuberculosis (Braden CR, Investigative Team. Infectiousness of a university student with laryngeal and cavitary tuberculosis. Clin Infect Dis 1995;21:565-70; and Hoge CW, Fisher L, Donnell HD Jr, et al. Risk factors for transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in a primary school outbreak: lack of racial difference in susceptibility to infection. Am J Epidemiol 1994;139:520-30). As in the above Eurosurveillance report, some investigators have postulated that the strains involved in such outbreaks may be especially virulent (Valnay SE, Sanchez MPC, Shinnick TS, et al. An outbreak involving extensive transmission of a virulent strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. New Engl J Med 1998; 338:633-9. Available at:
http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Outbreak%20Involving%20Extensive%20Transmission%20of%20a%20Virulent%20Strain%20of%20Mycobacterium%20TB.pdf).

In 1965, we described a large outbreak of tuberculosis that started in the fall of 1962 among medical students (11 cases) and employees of the medical school (11 cases) and medical college hospital (5 cases) (Alpert ME, Levison ME. An epidemic of tuberculosis in a medical school. N Engl J Med 1965;272:7l8-21). In the medical school classes in which cases of tuberculosis occurred, the tuberculin skin test reactivity rose from 16 percent on average among medical students at admission to medical school to 69-90 percent among those students that had not been vaccinated with BCG on admission. No one source was identified in this medical school out, but school outbreaks should serve as a reminder that students, especially young children, serve as indicators of recent transmission that warrants prompt investigation for a source with active tuberculosis in their environment so that further transmission can be rapidly interrupted.

Marseille, located on the southeast Mediterranean coast of France, is the 2nd largest city in France, after Paris, with a population of 852 395 within its administrative limits (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille). Marseille is the capital of the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region, as well as the capital of the Bouches-du-Rhone department.
