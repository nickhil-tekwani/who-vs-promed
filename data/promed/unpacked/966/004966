18 Farms have been hit by the Anthrax outbreak in Doubs. According to
the Department of Veterinary Services on Thursday [14 Aug 2008], 38
cattle have died since the beginning of the month of July 2008.

A beef animal died on Wed 6 Aug 2008 of anthrax at Avoudrey (Doubs)
on a farm which had not been contaminated by the disease. Then 4 beef
animals were found dead at the end of last week on 2 farms already
contaminated from the same source at Passonfontaine [Passonfontaine
is 2.1 nm south of Avoudrey. - Mod.MHJ]

The contaminated farms are in 8 communes in the same sector covered
by the DVS and the prefecture of Doubs.

By an official demand by the prefecture from 7 Aug 2008, the
vaccination of cattle and sheep has been made obligatory in 25
communes of the department of Doubs, and the opening of the game
hunting season has been put back from 16 Aug to 26 Aug 2008; forestry
work has been suspended and access forbidden to 6 ancient animal
cemeteries that have been identified. The DSV estimate is that there
will be 9000 animals (both sheep and cattle) that will need vaccination.

The disease is transmittable to humans but only in exceptional cases
and only in the case of extreme proximity to the animal, stressed the
prefecture.

"One does not know the exact origin of the contamination, but the
ancient animal mass graves are certainly a possible source," said
Isabell Pieson, Veterinary Surgeon of the DSV. Anthrax is an
infectious disease that affects all mammals, principally herbivores.
The bacteria of the disease can live in the soil several dozens of
years, principally in historic animal mass graves, as rendering the
carcasses was not done until the middle of the 20th century.

[The French use Carbovac, a standard 34F2 Sterne vaccine. In this
mountainous area just west of the Swiss border, I would not be
surprised if the occasional sporadic case gets missed. But once an
epidemic declares itself, every sick animal gets looked at twice. Our
thanks to Susan and Louis. Louis has suggested that maybe the mass
graves in Doubs got flooded, and this is what may have caused the
present outbreak. It seems that up until the middle of the last
century, anthrax carcasses were buried. After that, "equarrissage"
was established, and by law, a state-owned firm had the duty to
collect cadavers on farms and render them. Also, meat and bone meal
from bovine waste unfit for industrial valorisation (Category 1
byproducts according to the European legislation) are sent to be used
as fuel in the ovens of cement (i.e. concrete) manufacturing plants.
