When asking for information on the diagnosis, I assumed that a diagnosis
_differing_ from the original one published in "Konjugale Form der subakuten
spongi=F6sen Enzephalopathie" (Conjugal form of subacute spongiform
encephalopathy (CJD)) had been made with state-of-the-art methods and was
published afterwards in the Lancet. This was a misunderstanding, as I infer
from your posting.
The histopathological results described by you can definitely not rule out
CJD: we all know what a wide range the histopatholocical results can have.
It is known by the publication of Lasmezas et al., Science, Vol. 275, No
5298, 17 Jan. 1997, at the latest, that TSE can be present even without
detectable PrPres.=20
As far as your guess of a toxic encephalopathy is concerned, the exact
wording in the article mentioned above is: "Durch chemische Untersuchungen
konnte die M=F6glichkeit einer Intoxikation ausgeschlossen werden" (By
chemical analysis the possibility of an intoxication could be excluded).
They had taken metallic and organic substances into
consideration, as well as medicaments.
As a whole, the modern methods of re-checking the conjugal CJD case (age of
husband and wife 65 and 34 years respectively) diagnosed in the past have
obviously not at all proved that it was _not_ CJD. "Absence of proof... ".
I think this case and the increasing number of Austrian CJD cases should be
reason enough for searching even more for sources of CJD of animal origins
in Austria. A possibility for this could not only be scrapie-sheep (vicinity
to the former Czechoslovakia) in the past but also imports of Polish beef
(fed on British feed) today.

I strongly disagree. We have now experience with histopathology and PrP
immunocytochemistry in more than 300 human TSEs and, although they do cover
a morphological spectrum, they _can_ be diagnosed neuropathologically.
Moreover, we have ample experience with numerous even obscure
neurodegenerative conditions (our neuropathological archive comprises
material from some 15.000 autopsies) and know what and how to diagnose and
to exclude TSEs. If you doubt that, then indeed _everything can be TSE_, and
we are back at square 1. The very intriguing results reported by Lasm=E9zas=
et
al. pertain to an experimental situation; let us wait and see whether and
how it will apply to human disease. Also Corinne Lasm=E9zas and Dominique
Dormont diagnose their human cases with established diagnostics including
neuropathology.

I am not a forensic chemist nor a toxicologist, but I would be very much
surprised to learn that an examination 26 years ago was able to exclude
_all_ possible intoxications.

Again, according to criteria which are currently used for diagnosis, this
was not CJD.

I agree that close monitoring of the animal TSE situation is important in
any country, including Austria where we have very good data in humans. Wild
and domestic animals are said to be screened in Austria in the thousands
every year because we still have endemic rabies requiring close
surveillance. The brains of these animals are - according to the information
I got from veterinary authorities - examined for rabies as well as TSEs.

From: Karyn Bischoff <bischof@okway.okstate.edu>
Concerning the ability or lack thereof to rule out toxic causes of
"spongiform" encephalopathies:
I'm only a veterinary toxicology resident, but I can say with some
confidence that most of the toxins that would be associated with the type of
neural lesions described would be difficult or impossible to detect. This is
because that quite a bit of time usually passes from exposure to onset of
clinical signs, and death follows some time later. By then, due to
metabolism and excretion, the toxic compound is frequently at levels below
our ability to detect. I believe that most of the time this sort of
diagnosis is based on history of exposure--which may be a difficult thing to
obtain!
