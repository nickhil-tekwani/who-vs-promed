Three cows at a farm in the RM of Whitehead are the 1st confirmed
cases of anthrax in Manitoba in 2011, a year when flooding created
greater risk of exposure.

Canadian Food Inspection Agency spokeswoman Lynn Bates said farmers
are advised to have their animals vaccinated, especially this year
[2011], when overland flooding has boosted the risk animals could be
exposed to spores in the soil. "It may be that these spores were
buried and, with the overland flooding that we've had this spring,
suddenly they become available on pastures once they dry up," Bates
said.

The 3 animals from a beef farm in the RM of Whitehead died last week.
Samples sent to a provincial lab produced suspicious results, and on
Monday [26 Sep 2011], federal tests confirmed the animals had anthrax.
Under the Health of Animals Act, all suspected cases of anthrax must
be reported to the CFIA. In this case, the agency was notified after
private veterinarians were called to the farm.

Bates said this is the 1st case of anthrax in the RM of Whitehead in
at least 10 years and the 1st case in Manitoba this year [2011].
During the summer of 2010, there was one death of an animal reported
at a Manitoba farm.

In March and June of this year (2011), the CFIA warned Canadian
ranchers of the need to get their stock vaccinated. It would seem that
this rancher decided to wait until he had affected stock and then let
the government vaccinate his animals for him. The otherwise admirable
Canadian programme of subsidising the cost of clean-up and herd
vaccination after a case has been reported, which has been very
productive in the past, is now causing a delay in vaccination.
Although it has been discussed, I do not think that the rules have yet
been changed to only pay farmers who had vaccinated their stock.

On the other hand, it must be noted that the thorough provincial (AB,
MN, SK) and state (ND, MN, SD, MT, WY) programmes to persuade their
ranchers to vaccinate at the spring working have been successful, as
evidenced by the absence of outbreaks. This is a livestock disease
that publicly shows up procrastinators. There was a province-wide
epidemic in 2006 but, on the whole, there have been very limited
outbreaks since then, thanks to the awareness of risk. However, in the
past, this area of MB was notorious for not reporting sick or dead
stock. So, this ranch could well have had an old anthrax grave which
gave up its spores thanks to the flooding this year (2011).

It is due west of Winnipeg and 2/3rds of the way to the SK/MB border.
