Cluster of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Cases in Oman: October 2014
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) disease was 1st reported in 1995 in Oman. Since then sporadic cases have been diagnosed in different areas of the country. A survey conducted in 1995-96 by a team of experts from CDC in the Sultanate revealed seroprevalence amongst occupational groups and presence as well as evidence of infection in the vector ticks. Various species of ticks of _Hyalomma_ genus including the major vector _Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum_ were identified. Recent survey and observations by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MoA&F) suggests CCHF virus infection in domestic animals including goats, cattle and camels is high and presumed to be endemic in Oman. From 1997 to 2010 not a single case was reported in the Sultanate. Recently a rising trend has been observed. The surveillance system recorded 10 cases in 2013 and until the end of October 2014, 16 cases were reported.

The cases in 2014 showed a distinct pattern of clustering in time coinciding with the Eid celebrations that include festive slaughtering. Majority of the cases (11 cases) clustered and had onset during the risk period (incubation) following the Eid days, i.e. 28 Jul (Eid al Fitr) and 4 Oct (Eid al Adha) [2014].

The mean age of the total reported cases so far (n=33) was 37.5 years (Range 15 to 68 yrs.) suggesting young adults and adults were affected the most. No cases were reported in children. The men were the most affected 32 (97 per cent). Traditionally men are engaged in the slaughtering of animals either as a profession (animal handlers, milking, slaughterhouse workers) or otherwise slaughtering during Eid festivities. Of the 33 cases, Omanis were 20 (61 per cent) while Bangladeshi were the 2nd most affected (8, 24 per cent). Bangladeshi residents are known to participate in slaughtering animals for private parties. One each case was reported from other nationalities viz. Indian, Pakistani, Somali, Yemeni and Sri Lankan. In 2014, the Omanis comprised of large proportion of cases (11 out of 16, 68.8 per cent). In 2014 cases outside the risk period mentioned above, cases were due to occupational exposure. Three Bangladeshi and one Pakistani individuals were employees in the slaughter house while one Omani was an animal handler and was engaged in regular milking of animals. Slaughtering of animals and subsequent exposure to fresh blood or tissues was seen as the most important single factor responsible for the virus transmission. From 1995 till date NO secondary transmission has been observed in the contacts, either the health care workers taking care of the patient or the family members and other contacts. The overall proportional mortality (n= 33) was 42 per cent. In 2014 the case fatality appears to be lower than previous year. Of the 16 cases reported till October 2014, 3 cases died (CFR [case fatality rate] 19 per cent). CFR among 11 Omani cases was 27.3 per cent. Reasons for low mortality are unknown.

All Governorates in the country have reported cases of CCHF except Musandam and Al Wustah since 1995. Maximum cases were from North Batinah (6), Dakhliyah (6) and Dhofar (5) Governorates. Buraimi and Dhahira Governorates together reported 6 cases. The distribution of cases suggests increased incidence in areas closer to UAE and Yemen.

Control measures (2014)
-----------------------
Realizing the risk of CCHF infection associated with the festive slaughtering, the Ministry of Health has undertaken a number of activities and initiatives to educate and inform the community. The joint strategic initiative was developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MoA&F) and the Ministry of Regional Municipality. A circular was sent to all health institutions instructing health care workers (HCWs) to keep a high index of suspicion to detect cases of acute haemorrhagic fever in the risk period following the slaughtering of the animals during the Eid festivities. Other interventions include:
1. Tick control: Acariciding, strict control on animal importation, controlling the illegal animal traffic, routine inspection, legal actions against farms, etc.
2. Prevent secondary cases: To prevent secondary transmission in community and health care establishments, [interventions] include Infection Prevention & Control (IP&C) measures, follow-up of contacts and management.
3. Reduce mortality: General awareness in HCWs, early diagnosis and supportive treatment and selective use of antiviral (Ribavirin).
4. Intersectoral coordination and community education.

[Cases of CCHF virus infection have occurred previously in Oman. An 18 Oct 2014 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20141018.2878362) indicated that there were 6 cases of CCHF in the country this year with one death. The above report indicates that the number of cases has climbed to 16. An Omani case reported in ProMED-mail (archive no. 20120123.1019272) in 2012 was suspected due to contact with animals illegally imported into Oman. In that post, Mod.AS noted, "CCHF virus (CCHFV) circulates in an enzootic tick-vertebrate-tick cycle; members of the tick genus _Hyalomma_ seem to be the principal vectors. The virus can be found in many species of wild and domestic mammals, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, donkeys, and dogs. There is no evidence that the virus causes disease in animals. Domesticated ruminants including cattle, sheep, and goats are viremic for one week after experimental infections; the only symptom was a transient, mild elevation in body temperature. The introduction of viremic, symptomless animals to slaughterhouses can expose their personnel to infection. Otherwise, infected ticks are the main link between infected animals and humans; acaricides can be used on livestock and other domesticated animals to control ticks, particularly before slaughter or export.

"In meat, CCHFV is usually inactivated by post-slaughter acidification. It is also killed by cooking. Unpasteurized milk should not be drunk."

ProMED thanks Dr. Idris Al-Abaidani for his 1st-hand summary of the CCHF case occurrences in Oman this year and in the past.
