re: Toggenburg Orbivirus [TOV], caprine - Switzerland
-----------------------------------------------------
In the posting regarding the new caprine orbivirus in Switzerland, the
question was raised as to whether the Swiss case is exclusive and why TOV
has not been discovered elsewhere.

Antibodies to this virus were detected in imported animals in Sweden
earlier this year [2008]. A group of goats that were imported to Sweden
from Switzerland in March 2008 were sampled in quarantine and found to be
seropositive for BTV. Further investigations revealed that the animals had
been tested in Switzerland and found positive in the PCR system used there
in January 2008. On re-testing in March 2008, most of them were
seropositive but negative in PCR. The PCR-negative animals were exported to
Sweden, but the ones that remained positive were not. Moreover,
investigations in Switzerland showed that the PCR product was from a new
orbivirus and that this virus had most probably been transmitted from one
goat to her offspring during the vector-free season.

When the Swedish authorities learned about this and also realized that our
routine PCR system (specific for BTV-8) would not detect this virus (with
then unknown host specificity and pathogenic properties), it was decided to
send the animals back. However, the owner could not organize this, and,
eventually, the animals were culled. Some samples were sent to the
reference laboratory in the UK, but they were unable to culture any virus
from the material.

This does, however, show that TOV-infected animals would most likely come
up positive in serological surveillance for BTV but that the virus may go
undetected in PCR systems designed for specific BTV serotypes.

[The identification in Sweden of seropositive goats from Switzerland is
just an additional confirmation of the virus circulation in Switzerland. So
far, Switzerland remains the only country known to be infected. The
possible presence of this novel virus in other European countries, though
plausible, is yet to be studied. - Mod.AS]
