Pork supplies may become limited as farms experience a 2nd pig virus outbreak.

A pig virus that killed 10 percent of the hogs in the United States last year [2013] has been spreading around farms again this year. The virus, called porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv), almost always kills piglets. It was thought that the virus wouldn't hit again for several years due to pigs becoming immune to it after last year's outbreak, reports Reuters.

The 1st farm to publicly announce that it has been hit by the pig virus a 2nd time is in Indiana. The farm isn't being identified, but did say it had been infected. Other farms have also been hit by PEDv a 2nd time, but they haven't come out to publicly announce it. This could cause pork prices to soar past last year's [2013] record prices when the 1st round of the PEDv occurred, Reuters notes.

An answer to the pig virus may come from Neogen (NEOG). The company has announced that it has completed trials of 2 disinfectants that are effective at combating PEDv. The disinfectants passed Good Laboratory Practice protocols and meet the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) standards for a label claim. These 2 disinfectants are now waiting for approval from the EPA.

[It does not sound like the animals are developing any type of immunity. That is sad news. Hopefully the disinfectant will have a positive effect in stopping this virus.
