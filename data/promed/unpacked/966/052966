Epidemiology of WHO-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1)
infection
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This week�s issue of the World Health Organization (WHO) Weekly
Epidemiological Record, published online by WHO, sets out results from the
first analysis of epidemiological data on all 205 laboratory-confirmed H5N1
cases officially reported to WHO by onset date from December 2003 to 30
April 2006.
Data used in the analysis were collected for surveillance purposes. Quality,
reliability and format were not consistent across data from different
countries. Despite this limitation, several conclusions could be reached.
1. The number of new countries reporting human cases increased from 4 to 9
after October 2005, following the geographical extension of outbreaks among
avian populations;
2. Half of the cases occurred in people under the age of 20 years; 90 per
cent of cases occurred in people under the age of 40 years;
3. The overall case fatality rate was 56 per cent. Case fatality was high in
all age groups but was highest in persons aged 10 to 39 years;
4. The case fatality profile by age group differs from that seen in seasonal
influenza, where mortality is highest in the elderly;
5. The overall case fatality rate was highest in 2004 (73 per cent),
followed by 63 per cent to date in 2006, and 43 per cent in 2005;
6. Assessment of mortality rates and the time intervals between symptom
onset and hospitalization and between symptom onset and death suggests that
the illness pattern has not changed substantially during the 3 years;
7. Cases have occurred all year round. However, the incidence of human cases
peaked, in each of the 3 years in which cases have occurred, during the
period roughly corresponding to winter and spring in the northern
hemisphere. If this pattern continues, an upsurge in cases could be
anticipated starting in late 2006 or early 2007;
8. A more standardized collection of epidemiological data by countries and
timely sharing of these data are needed to improve monitoring of the
situation, risk assessment, and the management of H5N1 patients.
