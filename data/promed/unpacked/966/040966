Epidemiology: Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection
- introduction of new live animals;
- contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering;
- vectors.

Epidemiological comments: introduction in December 2007 from Australia of a
batch including 43 Senepol cattle vaccinated (instead of being treated with
imizol as usually done and recommended) with a live attenuated vaccine
(trivalent tick fever vaccine) containing _B. bovis_, _B. bigemina_ and
_Anaplasma centrale_.

21 herds (4300 cattle) are in a sequestration zone and 59 (4800 cattle) in
a protection zone.

Control measures applied
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- zoning;
- dipping/spraying;
- modified stamping out;
- vaccination prohibited;
- treatment of affected animals (imidocarb treatment with 1mL/100Kg for
animals clinically sick. Sterilisation with 2.5mL/100kg of imidocarb (2
injections in a 15 day interval). Protocol implemented since week 13 (24-30
Mar 2008).

Laboratory name and type: Laboratoire de la Nouvelle-Caledonie (LNC) (Local
laboratory)
Species: cattle
Test: tissue imprints
Test date: 14 Mar 2008
Result: positive

[This is the official confirmation of earlier postings. It will be
interesting to see if the quarantine, movement control, and other disease
control tactics can be effectively maintained long enough for the treatment
with imidocarb to have its desired sterilizing effect and then have the
disease completely and permanently eradicated from New Caledonia. For more
information, see Mod.AS/TG comments from Tick fever, bovine - New Caledonia
ex Australia (03) 20080330.1184.

New Caledonia is an island to the north of Australia, whose location may be
