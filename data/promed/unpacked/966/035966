Response to: Tuberculosis, wild boars - Spain (02) - 20050709.1955
------------------------------------------------------------------
I strongly disagree with some of the opinions on wild boars and TB
control [expressed in the above posting].
It is not true that "the major predator of wild boars, in places
where you don't have wolves and mountain lions, happens to be male
wild boars, who frequently unearth, kill, and eat the litters of
territorial rivals."
European wild boars do not "[un]earth" nor do they live "underground,"
and there are limited records of cannibalism (Gortazar et al., Ann NY
Acad Sci, 2002).
Food availability is probably the main factor affecting wild boar
densities, even more than hunting and far more than predation and
cannibalism.
Litter size is not only affected by food availability but also by
disease prevalence and population structure. Adult females have
larger litters (Ruiz-Fons et al., Theriogenology, in press). Hunting
usually reduces the proportion of adults in a population.
Hence, the sentence "the more boars you shoot, the more boars you end
up with" is also not correct. If shooting (or any other means of
population control) is done in areas with abundant food (sometimes
provided by the hunters), I agree that it makes little sense for
density reduction. But, if a ban of artificial feeding takes place at
the same time you increase hunting pressure, I am sure you will be
able to affect the wild boar population dynamics and achieve a lower
density.

The management of wild boar and/or feral pig populations has been
studied and discussed, in recent years in various countries, also in
relation to the control or prevention of several animal diseases
besides bovine tuberculosis: hog cholera, trichinellosis, African
swine fever, FMD (extensive studies in Australia since 1992) and
others. - Mod.AS/JW]
