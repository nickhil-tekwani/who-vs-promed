The ISP [Public Health Institute] confirmed a case of [a] hantavirus
[infection] in the [Coyhaique] region. A 25-year-old patient remains
in the Intensive Care Unit of the Regional Hospital and is making a
positive improvement.

After the samples were sent to the Institute of Public Health (ISP)
in Santiago, the presence of [a] hantavirus was confirmed, after
[laboratory] tests, in a young man who remains hospitalized in
Coyhaique Regional Hospital. To date, the patient has been admitted
to the ICU where he is making positive progress, said Aysen Health
SERMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat] epidemiologist, Marco Acuna.
"He has been disconnected from the ventilator today [22 Dec 2010],
took off the mask, is breathing spontaneously, is recovering, and the
progress has been favorable," said the expert.

The patient, aged 25, was hospitalized for severe pneumonia, so
health personnel followed protocols, given suspicions of the disease
from the symptoms presented. An investigation has also been taking
place from the epidemiological perspective.

To prevent such infections during the tourist season, when people
have greater contact with the outdoors, storage buildings are being cleaned.

Marco Acuna said they have detected considerable proliferation of
wild mice associated with the flowering of quila [a perennial bamboo
that grows in the humid temperate forests of Chile and Argentina].

Consistent with earlier recommendations to the inhabitants of rural
areas on preventing the entry of rodents [into buildings], people
should maintain a sanitary area [around the buildings], keep the
grass short, and do not place firewood within 30 meters of storage
buildings and homes.

"In the case of people who undertake rural activities such as hiking
and camping, they should establish their camps in open places, not
adjacent to forests and brushy areas, keep to established paths, and
protect food in rodent-resistant containers," said Acuna. He also
said that special care must be taken by workers who go to summer
houses that have been closed for months. These [buildings] must be
ventilated, opened to sunlight, and chlorinated water should be used
to moisten surfaces, floors and furniture before sweeping to avoid infections.

[This is the 2nd case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in this
geographic area of southern Chile during this spring/summer season
[2010-2011]. Although not stated, the hantavirus responsible for HPS
in the area mentioned above doubtless is Andes virus, which has the
long-tailed pygmy rice rat as it rodent host.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus,

[2] French Guiana

A resident of Macouria died this week of a pulmonary infection with
[a] hantavirus. This is the 3rd case identified in Guyana [French
Guiana] since 2008 and the 2nd this year [2010]. Last March 2009, a
58-year-old man living in a residential area of Remire-Montjoly died
of infection with [a] hantavirus, a virus carried by wild rodents.

The Pasteur Institute of Guyana has caught rodents in the
neighborhood where the victim lived: some of them carried the virus
effectively. This time, the victim lived in Macouria. The location of
the contamination and the rodent species involved here are being
investigated by the Regional Agency of Health and the Institut
Pasteur in French Guiana. They may never be identified; several weeks
can elapse between infection and onset of symptoms.

"In humans, hantavirus infection is rare and not contagious [except
for Andes virus - Mod.TY]. Frequently, the disease does not present
any danger. As in the entire American continent or in France, the
virus may be present in various species of rodents, exposing other
sporadic cases in Guyana, but cases are rare", said the Regional
Health Agency in Guyana. These viruses are transmitted by several
species of rodents, which, in Guyana, are _Zygodontomys brevicauda_
and _Oecomys bicolor_.

The virus is transmitted to humans through contact with saliva or
faeces of these animals, by inhalation of contaminated dust,
especially during cleaning work in places which are left shut up and
poorly ventilated, and by contact through eyes, nose or mouth after
handling an animal or a surface contaminated by these rodents.

One to 8 weeks after infection, a flu-like syndrome (fever, muscle
pain, fatigue) appears. Respiratory distress appears and sometimes
leads to death. There is no preventive treatment, so people should
avoid contact with rodents and their excreta.

[This is the 1st ProMED-mail posting of a hantavirus infection in
French Guiana, although the above report indicated that there have
been previous cases there. Although the specific hantavirus involved
in this and previous cases in French Guiana have not been mentioned,
2 hantaviruses have been documented in neighboring western Venezuela:
Cano delgado (host _Sigmodon alistoni_) and Maporal (host _
Oligoryzomys fluvescens_), and are likely present in French Guiana as well.
