A total of 3 different cheeses manufactured in Spain have been withdrawn from store shelves after a reported case of meningitis in Madrid. The warning follows a case of a 39-year-old man being diagnosed with the disease after consuming raw sheep's cheese.

The Beltza, Txuria and Gutizia raw sheep's milk cheeses are made by the Oihan Txiki Koop group in San Sebastian. The General Directorate of Public Health has recommended that if you have bought any of the products to get rid of them. In addition, if you have eaten any of the named cheeses recently, you should visit a health centre if you present any of the symptoms of the disease.

It is believed the affected products were mainly distributed in the capital, Cataluna and the Basque Country.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that cover the whole central nervous system. Its symptoms are characterized by high fever, drowsiness, headache, loss of consciousness, stiffness in the neck, agitation, delirium, convulsions, red spots on the skin and vomiting.

[The above news report fails to specify the microbial cause of meningitis in a 39-year-old man that developed after consuming cheese made from raw sheep's milk, but the most likely pathogen is _Listeria moncytogenes_. More information on this infection would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans. Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

Contamination of food can occur in nature, e.g., raw vegetables contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk by infected cows, or contamination can occur following cooking or other processing.

Because _Listeria_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures listeriosis is commonly associated with ingestion of contaminated food that have been held at refrigeration temperatures and then eaten without further cooking, e.g. ready-to-eat deli meats and cole slaw. The sources of human infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification techniques matching _Listeria_ isolated from a possible source with isolates recovered from a patient.

Listeriosis affects mainly pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and adults with impaired immune systems. Infection can cause diarrhea and in some patients invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur annually in the US), but the disease has an overall case fatality rate of 20 to 30 percent.

Madrid is the capital city of Spain and, with a population of about 3.1 million and a metropolitan population of about 6.5 million, is the largest municipality in both the Community of Madrid and Spain as a whole (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid). Catalonia is an autonomous community located on the northeastern corner of Spain and consists of 4 provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona; the capital and largest city is Barcelona (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia). The Basque Country is located in the western Pyrenees, on the border between France and Spain on the coast of the Bay of Biscay (A map of Basque Country can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Basque+Country,+Spain.) San Sebastián is a coastal city located in the Basque Autonomous Community (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebastián).
