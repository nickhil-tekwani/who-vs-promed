White spot disease, which is not harmful to humans but can kill off
crawfish, has been confirmed in commercial ponds across south west
Louisiana and in the Atchafalaya Basin.
The disease was 1st detected last month [May 2007] at a crawfish farm near
Arnaudville. More testing has confirmed the disease in 20 ponds in 6
parishes and in at least 2 samples of wild crawfish from the Basin,
according to information from LSU (Louisiana State University) Agricultural
Center and the state Department of Agriculture and Forestry.
State Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Bob Odom said the 20 positive
results for commercial ponds were out of 29 tested, raising fears that the
disease is widespread. Test results are pending on more than 70 other samples.
Crawfish season is drawing to a close, and most farmers are draining their
ponds. Farmers who are restocking with "seed" crawfish in preparation for
next year [2008] have been cautioned to carefully screen for white spot
disease.
The disease is named for the spotty calcium deposits on the shells of
infected shrimp, but crawfish with the disease do not always exhibit the spots.
Mark Shirley, south west regional aquaculture specialist for the LSU
Agricultural Center, said infected crawfish show signs of weakness and
lethargy and may die.
The disease is believed to pose less of a threat to wild mudbugs [crawfish]
than to crawfish raised in a pond.
Still unknown by researchers is how the disease spread to crawfish and what
its effect on next year's [2008] crop will be.

[White spot disease (WSD) has been confirmed in freshwater farmed crawfish
(also known as crayfish) in Louisiana, United States of America (US). This
is the 1st occurrence of WSD in Louisiana, and the source of the outbreak
is undetermined. Louisiana is the nation's largest producer of crawfish,
with farmed and wild-caught crawfish production totaling 95 per cent of the
total US harvest. While there is no export market for Louisiana-produced
crawfish, other crustacean exports from this state were valued at USD 7
million in 2005. This represented 1.3 per cent of the value of all US
crustacean exports for that year. The US produced about 324.8 thousand
metric tons of crustacean products from wild fisheries and aquaculture
sources in 2005, representing 3.26 per cent of world production. WSD is an
OIE-notifiable disease. White spot disease also affects shrimp.
On 8 May 2007, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL)
confirmed the presence of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in samples of
freshwater farmed crawfish (_Procambarus clarkia_) from St Martin Parish,
Louisiana. The source of the virus was undetermined, but crawfish
broodstock is regularly collected from wild populations of unknown health
status. Declining crawfish productivity and large numbers of birds around
the farm ponds were observed prior to the outbreak. Farmed crawfish are at
the end of their current production cycle, and all ponds in the region will
be emptied of crawfish and remain so until October 2007. Surveillance of
wild populations of crawfish within the region is ongoing.
The 1st documented occurrences of this disease in US commercial facilities
were in Texas and South Carolina in 1995. WSSV also has been found in wild
shrimp and crabs offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and near shore in Texas,
Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina. WSD was last reported to OIE for
an outbreak in Hawaii in April 2004.
