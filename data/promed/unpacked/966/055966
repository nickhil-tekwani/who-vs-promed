Fresh anthrax outbreak in 2 districts, northeastern Zimbabwe
------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax has broken out in 2 districts in northeastern Zimbabwe, the latest
in a series in recent months, according to veterinary officials. Murerwa
District veterinary officer, Eric Chikaka said the affected areas had been
quarantined, and a massive vaccination campaign was underway to bring the
outbreak under control. He said cattle in the 2 districts had been affected,
but did not give any figure of deaths or indicate whether human beings had
been affected.
"We have quarantined Chidye, Chivi, Kanyasa and Ruvhuri... while in Murerwa
affected areas are Hunda, Ndemera, Mutoriro, Shavanhowe and Chidema," said
Chikaka.
Zimbabwe has suffered frequent outbreaks of anthrax and foot and mouth
diseases, which have forced the country to suspend lucrative meat exports to
Europe and other markets. Lack of vaccines has been a major hindrance to the
country's ability to tackle the problem.

[Anthrax is a contemporary everyday problem now in Zimbabwe, a country where
4 decades ago anthrax was well-controlled, with minimal livestock deaths and
infrequent human cases. Neighbouring Mozambique reports little or no
anthrax. This may change if these present outbreaks spread into that
country, which wraps itself around the NE quadrant of Zimbabwe. I had noted
in respect of the 1996 situation in the latter country: OIE report: "Anthrax
has not been reported for some years, but the threat is still present. In
Zambezia province vaccination against this disease is not practised as no
report of the disease has been received for a very long time." A careful
reading of the full report indicates a general under-reporting of disease
and ineffective control measures. - Mod.MHJ]
