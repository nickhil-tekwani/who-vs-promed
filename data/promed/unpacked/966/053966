The Costa Rican Ministry of Health reported today [26 Jul 2018] that it is responding to an outbreak of hepatitis A in a town in the eastern sector of San Jos√© and asked the population to take hygienic preventive measures. So far, there are 3 confirmed cases and 8 suspected in the canton of Goicoechea, located in the eastern sector of the capital.

Health authorities have made an active search in recent days in the areas close to the outbreak, the Health Ministry said in a statement. In addition, health officials called in primary health care technical assistants to receive more information about hepatitis A, including the mechanisms of transmission, symptomatology, and prevention. The authorities also provided educational material to the population in shopping centers and common areas, and it is planned that tomorrow [27 Jul 2018] they will begin activities in educational centers so that students know the preventive measures.

The Ministry of Health ordered people with hepatitis A to refrain from attending study or work centers for at least 12 days and, upon their return, to attend to extreme hygiene measures, especially handwashing. To the population in general, the authorities urged frequent handwashing with soap and water, especially after going to the bathroom, before preparing or consuming food, or changing diapers.

[No information is given about the age of those affected. In much of the developing world, where hepatitis A is quite endemic, the population is almost all seropositive for HAV by the age of 10. I would wonder whether the infection was confirmed by a specific IgM anti-HAV antibody. - Mod.LL
