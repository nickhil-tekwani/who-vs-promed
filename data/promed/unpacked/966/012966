Detection of virus reactors

Text of a fax received on 28 Jun 2000 from Dr Mohd Nordin Mohd Nor,
Director General, Department of Veterinary Service, Ministry of
Agriculture, Kuala Lumpur:
Report date: 26 Jun 2000.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 14 Jun 2000.
The third phase of the Nipah virus surveillance programme has been ongoing
since April 2000 (see Disease Information, 13 [12, 43). The programme
involves testing of pigs at farms using ELISA(1) and virus neutralisation
test (VNT) to screen the pigs.
Six pigs from a farm in the district of Kinta were found to be positive to
both ELISA and VNT on the first screening, and a seventh pig on the second
screening. Subsequently, all the pigs in the farm were destroyed on 17 Jun
2000.
Three pigs were also found to be positive to ELISA and VNT on the first
screening in a farm in the district of Larut Matang. These reactors were
immediately destroyed and no movement of pigs is allowed from the farm. A
second test for all the pigs in the farm is now being undertaken. If the
results show more positive reactors, it will be indicative of active
infection and all the pigs in the farm will be destroyed.
Affected area:
Location / No. of affected farms
district of Kinta, State of Perak (4ยบ 23' N - 100ยบ 07' E) / 1
district of Larut Matang, State of Perak (4ยบ 55' N - 100ยบ 40' E) / 1
Total number of animals in the affected area:
species Sui
susceptible 2025
positive reactors 10
deaths 0
destroyed 1728
slaughtered 0
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Veterinary Research Institute,
State of Perak, Malaysia, and CSIRO(2) Laboratory, Geelong, Australia.
B. Diagnostic tests used: ELISA and virus neutralisation test.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: further epidemiological
investigations on the disease are being undertaken.
B. Mode of spread: contact.
Control measures during reporting period:
- quarantine measures and movement control;
- stamping-out policy;
- testing.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
(2) CSIRO: Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
(Australia).
