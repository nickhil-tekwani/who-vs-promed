Hepatitis outbreak alert
-----------------------------
Compared with 2009, this year the [number of] cases of hepatitis in
the city have increased by over 50 percent, according to statistics
from the Sanitary District VII. Based on statistics from the [health
department], there were 70 cases of hepatitis A in 2009, and so far
this year [2010], the figure has reached 160 cases.

This is a disease that is acquired orally, especially when consuming
drinks or foods that [were prepared without attention to] basic
hygiene. Even as intestinal infections decreased from 8921 last year
[2009] to 5122 this year [2010], the [Health Department] continues to
recommend to take hygiene measures to prevent diseases.

In a bulletin on the "hot season," the [health department] said this
season, the most common diseases are intestinal infections, fever,
diarrhea, food poisoning and hepatitis A, as well as scorpion stings,
which although not specifically a disease, occurs in greater numbers
during spring and summer. According to the report, in these months
there tends to be an increase in health risks as well as effects
associated with heat. The bulletin specifies care for extreme caution
during hot weather. These include washing hands before and after
using the bathroom, avoid exposure to excessive heat, drink plenty of
fluids, avoiding caffeinated drinks, very sugary or alcoholic beverages.

Hepatitis A mostly affects children. The virus [can be found] in the
feces of people who have contracted the infection. Therefore it is
important to wash your hands after using the toilet and before eating.

[While the article does not specify the location of the outbreak, the
newspaper is from Leon, Guanajuato in Mexico. Hepatitis A is a
disease closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor
personal hygiene. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics
worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences.

Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause
chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause
debilitating symptoms. Adults have signs and symptoms of illness more
often than children, and the severity of disease and mortality
increases in older age groups. Infected children under 6 years of age
do not usually experience noticeable symptoms, and only 10 percent
develop jaundice. Among older children and adults, infection usually
causes more severe symptoms, with jaundice occurring in more than 70
percent of cases. Most people recover in several weeks -- or
sometimes months -- without complications. For further information,
