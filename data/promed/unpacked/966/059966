Q FEVER, MEAT PROCESSING PLANT - UK (SCOTLAND)

The meat processing plant which has suffered an outbreak of rare Q
fever is bracing itself for more cases. Some 25 workers have been
taken ill at the Scotbeef factory in Bridge of Allan, 11 of whom have
been diagnosed with the disease.
While 4 men received treatment in hospital for the flu-like illness,
many more of the plant's 250 workers are awaiting the results of
blood tests.
Q fever can result in chronic infection if not treated swiftly with
antibiotics. The disease is caused by the organism _Coxiella
burnetii_, which lives in farm animals such as sheep, cattle and
goats as well as wild animals and ticks. Airborne infection is
possible for those who work in close contact with farm animals.
Scotbeef now believes the 11 workers caught the disease from an area
of the plant where lambs are held before they are slaughtered.
The meat plant remained open yesterday, 20 Jul 2006, but the lamb
area was undergoing deep disinfection.
Adam Muggoch, managing director of Scotbeef, said: "The number of
diagnoses of Q fever may still go up. We are still waiting for the
results of blood tests on the remainder of the staff. However, we are
seeing a steady decline in the number of absences through illness."
Scotbeef, he said, has begun plans to redesign the layout of the lamb
layerage area. He added: "We are very concerned for our staff and we
will do whatever we can to limit the risk of infection."
Professor Hugh Pennington, an Aberdeen-based expert in microbiology,
said: "It is always a possibility that people have been infected who
have not shown symptoms. But it only takes a simple blood test to
detect the fever. I think the likelihood of a chronic infection is
very low, because the outbreak was quickly diagnosed."
A Forth Valley Health Board spokeswoman said the outbreak is of
little risk to the wider public because Q fever is rarely transmitted
from person to person.
There is only "a small theoretical risk of contracting Q fever by
airborne spread within a half-mile radius of the plant," she said.

[ProMED thanks Pablo Nart for alerting us to this outbreak.
Transmission of the organism to the workers is thought to have
occurred from exposure to the live lambs through aerosolization of
infectious materials. Although the infectious form is relatively
stable, infection spread over any distance is quite unlikely.
Although meat could be contaminated, it is not thought to be a common
vehicle for transmission to humans. As noted, person-to-person
spread is quite rare but has been reported. A Russian outbreak
related to contaminated wool was posted by ProMED in 2005.
This review of the epidemiology of Q fever has been extracted from an
excellent CDC source
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/qfever/index.htm>:
"Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C.
burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other
animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated
pets. _Coxiella burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in
these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked
to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine,
and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the
organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the
placenta.
The organisms are resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for
long periods in the environment. Infection of humans usually occurs
by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne
barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids,
and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very
susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to
cause infection. Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by
regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less
common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans,
including tick bites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.
The incubation period for Q fever varies depending on the number of
organisms that initially infect the patient. Infection with greater
numbers of organisms will result in shorter incubation periods. Most
patients become ill within 2-3 weeks after exposure. Those who
recover fully from infection may possess lifelong immunity against
re-infection.
In the USA, Q fever outbreaks have resulted mainly from occupational
exposure involving veterinarians, meat processing plant workers,
sheep and dairy workers, livestock farmers, and researchers at
facilities housing sheep. Prevention and control efforts should be
directed primarily toward these groups and environments."
Bridge of Allan is a spa town just outside of Stirling in Scotland.
