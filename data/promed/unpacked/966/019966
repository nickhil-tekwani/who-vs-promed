INFLUENZA A, VIRULENT - CHINA (NORTH)

I'm not sure how much of this is common knowledge, and I have not had
time yet to check out much of the details. Beijing and the rest of
Northern China is being hit unusually hard with influenza this year.
The local (Chinese) press describes the incidence and severity of the
disease to be much worse than in recent years.
This involves regions of Inner Mongolia and "Manchuria" [Harbin area]
but has already extended to Beijing.
Most of the illness is characterized by very high fevers and severe
myalgias. Upper respiratory symptoms are then quickly followed by
pulmonary symptoms. As usual, the elderly are much more severely
affected by the illness. Patients are first showing up in my clinic
with little more than very high fevers, severe myalgias, and
headaches. The respiratory symptoms develop later.
In my American Embassy population most of the adults were immunized
against influenza a couple of months ago. It is not clear whether
there was much protection offered, as it is clear that many of those
who received the immunization are getting quite sick with illness
which looks identical to those who did not receive the immunization.
In the Beijing Embassy community these new cases just started
appearing last week, and it is clear that we are not over it yet.
This afternoon I called Prof. WANG Ai Xia who is head of the
Infectious Disease Department of Peking Union Medical College
Hospital, who confirmed what I was seeing and told me the situation in
the wider Chinese community was quite serious. Their hospital saw
300 patients in the Emergency Department two days ago, and 70% of
them were influenza patients. The severity of the illness and the
number of cases are dramatically different from recent years. She
says that the strain is an "A3 Sub Unit" (?strain?) which is known to
be particularly virulent. I am trying to make contact with CDC with
this information to see what else they can add. I suspect they are
already onto this.
I'll let you know when I get more information.

[Many thanks, John. In view of the apparent ineffectiveness of the
current vaccine, this bears watching closely. Historically, new
virulent strains of flu have originated in China, and taken a year to
reach the West, giving time for a homologous vaccine to be produced.
But in view of the early appearance of this strain, and increased air
travel between China & the West, we may not be so lucky this time
