Comments on the biology of alligators
-------------------------------------
Viruses that affect endothermic mammals and birds are rarely found in
ectothermic reptiles. The late Dr Sherman A Minton discovered evidence for
the presence of Western equine encephalitis virus in garter snakes during
the summer and early fall but, after winter and hibernation, it had
disappeared, indicating that the wide variation in body temperature endured
by ectotherms offers an unfavorable environment for such agents (1).
Crocodilians, particularly those in the warmer latitudes, may prove a
stunning reversal of the above finding (2).
1. Larger reptiles are very adept at thermoregulation.
2. Alligators, which are Archosaurs, are more closely related to birds than
to other reptiles, according to paleontologists such as Robert Baaker (3).
3. Baaker believes that some dinosaurs (_Archosauria_) actually were able
to thermoregulate internally.
4. Some alligator farming operations use heated slabs (hot water pipes
embedded in them; solar energy is used to heat the water) which cause
alligators to grow faster, feeding year round and in more abundance than
they would naturally. These devices provide a warmer environment for these
animals, maintaining them at steady body temperatures in the mid to high
90s, at a level very similar to the body temperatures of birds and mammals.
5. The fact that West Nile virus was discovered in captive farm-raised
alligators is relevant. Alligators are the only semi-aquatic reptile that
are commercially raised for their hide and meat.
6. These animals are farmed in outdoor pens or barns or on property set
aside for this purpose.
7. They are kept in or near to stagnant water, existing in close proximity
to ideal conditions for abundant mosquito populations, both in captive
rearing as well as under wild conditions.
8. Unexplained deaths of alligators under these captive conditions
represent significant financial losses for such operations so it is not
surprising that every possible cause would be investigated.
It is hard to say how amazing the discovery of West Nile virus in
alligators is, but it is certainly unusual. From what we know about
crocodilians (alligators) including their thermoregulating abilities and
their captive rearing conditions, they are of all reptiles, in retrospect,
the most likely candidate to become infected with West Nile virus.

Comment on "West Nile virus, reptiles, alligators - USA (FL) (03)"
------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is it "amazing" to find West Nile virus in Florida alligators? If my
memory serves me right, some years ago Craighead and colleagues of the
NIH/MARU lab in Panama reported evidence of frequent Eastern equine
encephalitis virus infections in local alligators.

[Do any readers remember the reference and have access to it? If so, do let
us know, and please summarise it for ProMED-mail. A Medline search on the
terms "alligator" and "encephalitis" yielded only one paper, on diseases of
captive crocodiles in Papua New Guinea (Aust Vet J 1990; 67: 323-30). Viral
infections were not mentioned in the abstract. - Mod.SH]
