The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] says a brand of caviar is being recalled because it may contain a dangerous toxin. The agency says the International House of Caviar is recalling its brand of rainbow trout caviar due to a risk of botulism. It says the caviar has been distributed in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. The recalled item is sold in 100-gram jars with a best before the date of 30 Aug 2018. The CFIA says there have been no reported illnesses linked to the caviar.

Food contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin may not look or smell spoiled, but can still make you sick. Symptoms in adults can include facial paralysis or loss of facial expression, unreactive or fixed pupils, difficulty swallowing, drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, and difficulty speaking. Symptoms in children can include difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, generalized weakness and paralysis.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
