[If your country lacks anthrax, any cases must have resulted from a visitation of the pathogen from a neighbouring country, in this case the Ukraine. Most cases in horses result from bites by a biting tabanid female fly that have previously snacked on a sick or moribund infected animal. These flies normally fly short distances as the next meal is usually close by and can be perceived by the fly's sensitivity to 'black bodies'. But distances of a few kilometers are not uncommon, and up to 15-20 km [approx 9-12 mi] not unknown, though not every day.

The last recorded human case in Belarus was in 1995, and in livestock in 1999: https://belsat.eu/en/news/for-first-time-in-20-years-anthrax-case-in-belarus/ - Mod.MHJ
