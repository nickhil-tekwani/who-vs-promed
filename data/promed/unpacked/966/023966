The 'hotbeds' of European fascioliasis appear to be France and Portugal.
GIDEON notes the following .

France:
- Fascioliasis is most common in Lyon, Bretagne Nord/Pas de Calais and
Sud-Ouest. Two cases were reported from Corsica during 1969 to 1989.
Prevalences of 0.34 to
3.1/100 000 are reported in Basse-Normandie; 0.83 to 1.16/100 000 in Corsica.
- Recent rates of approximately 0.03/100 000 per year are reported. Bovine
infection in Amiens decreased from 12% to 2.5% during 1983 to 1995.
- The first modern epidemic occurred in 1956 (over 500 cases). 3297 cases
were
officially reported during 1950 to 1983 (but 4813 cases were registered by
23 hospital laboratories during 1970 to 1982). 121 cases were reported in
Haute Vienne during 1955 to 1979.
- 58 cases were reported during 1982 to 1986 - watercress implicated in
89%, dandelion (_Taraxacum dens leonis_), lamb's lettuce (_Valerianella
olitora_) and spearmint (_Mentha viridis_) in the remainder.
- The local reservoir is _Lymnaea (Fossaria) truncatula_. Black rats
(_Rattus rattus_) may serve as a local reservoir in Corsica.
Portugal:
- Highest rates occur in the north.
- The prevalence was 2.0% in Fafe and 7.35% in Vizela during 1970 to 1972;
3.2% in
the inner Porto region during the 1980's.
- 561 cases were diagnosed in Porto National Laboratory during 1970 to
1985. 538
cases were reported in the literature during 1969 to 1989.
- The local reservoir is _Lymnaea (Fossaria) truncatula_.
