Thousands of German children suffer from vomit outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------
More than 6500 German children and teenagers have fallen ill with diarrhoea and vomiting that health authorities say has likely been caused by a food-borne virus in meals delivered to schools and day care centres.

Regional health ministries and a top health research institute said youngsters from 5 of Germany's 16 states had been affected by the acute gastroenteritis, with the 1st cases registered on Tue [25 Sep 2012]. So far, those affected had not suffered any complications.

"All the institutions which have registered cases of the illness so far are probably being provided by the same caterer," wrote the Robert Koch Institute, which researches and advises the German health ministry on infectious diseases. "This suggests that it is an outbreak caused by food."

The German government and affected states have established a task force charged with looking for the reason for the illness in order to prevent it spreading any further.

BERLIN (AP) â€• German health authorities say the number of children that have fallen ill with vomiting and diarrhea after eating food from school cafeterias and daycare centers has risen from about 4500 to 8400.

Authorities in Berlin and the surrounding eastern German states reported the new gastroenteritis cases Saturday [29 Sep 2012], while laboratory investigations to determine the exact cause of the outbreak were still under way.

Berlin's health department says the sicknesses are moderate and most children recover within two days without requiring to be hospitalized.

In Saxony state, at least 16 cases of norovirus, a mostly food- or water-borne illness, were proven, according to German news agency dapd.

The government-affiliated Robert Koch Institute said Friday [28 Sep 2012] that all facilities where the illness occurred likely received food from a single supplier.

[The sudden onset and rapid resolution of the illness are certainly characteristic of an outbreak of norovirus infection. However, the extent of the outbreak with simultaneous involvement of several schools in the Berlin area is an unusual feature. The outbreak is being attributed to contaminated meals delivered to schools and day care centres from a single supplier. But a particular contaminated food has not been identified yet, nor has norovirus been recovered from either the potentially contaminated meals nor the affected children. Further information is awaited.
