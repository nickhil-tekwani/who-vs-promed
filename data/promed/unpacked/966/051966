No fear of an epidemic outbreak of mad-cow-disease
------------------------------------------------------
Brains of the 2 cohort cows and the 2-year-old daughter of "Delhi" have been
found free of BSE by examinations carried out in the veterinary institute.
This information has been announced this morning [Sat 8 Jun 2002] by the
Ministry of Agriculture. "Delhi" was the first cow found infected in Israel.
"The laboratory results are backing our assumption that there is no fear of
a wide-scale outbreak of BSE", said Dr Nir, the Chief Veterinary Officer.
"However, we are obliged to carry out our plan which will ensure beyond any
doubt that each cow reaching the consumer will be completely safe".
The Agriculture Ministry is about to carry out its emergency program for
dealing with BSE, at the cost of 60 million NIS [about 12 million US
dollars]. There is still a dispute between the Treasury and the ministries
of agriculture and health regarding the rate of compensation to the farmers
for the destruction of internal organs, and the budget needed for the
struggle against illegal slaughter.
In the meantime, the agriculture ministry is preparing the last technical
arrangements in the slaughterhouses. The slaughter of cows older than 30
months has been banned. "This is the high-risk population", Dr Nir remarked.
The emergency plan includes rapid tests in all brains of slaughtered cattle
older than 30 months, the meat of which to be released only after
confirmation of their freedom from BSE. Internal organs -- including brain,
eyes, spleen, vertebral column and distal intestines -- will be destroyed.
Intensifying control on animal movements will back up these steps. The
public has been encouraged by the Ministry of Health to buy meat only in
certified shops and and to dine only in certified restaurants.

Czechs ban imports of Israeli beef
-----------------------------------
The Czech Republic has prohibited the import of beef and beef products from
Israel in the wake of the confirmation last week of a case of mad cow
disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) at Kibbutz Ortal in the Golan
Heights.
The deputy director-general of the Dairy and Meat Board, Ziv Matalon, said
he did not expect other countries to follow the Czech Republic's lead as
Israel, in any case, does not export beef to Europe or to other countries.
The head of the Agriculture Ministry's veterinary services department, Dr.
Oded Nir, said the Czech move had no practical significance as the European
Union and other countries have already prohibited the import of beef and
mutton from Israel because of its policy of vaccinating cattle and sheep
against foot & mouth disease.
Meanwhile, brain biopsy tests carried out on another 3 cows from the same
herd as the cow that died last week of BSE, showed the cows were healthy.
Two of the cows had been raised together with the dead cow and the third was
its offspring.
Dr. Oded Nir said Friday that despite the negative test results, the
veterinary services would continue with preparations to implement an
emergency plan to handle the disease. The plan includes a compulsory
examination of brain tissue of cattle slaughtered in Israel at the age of 30
months or above, a ban on the sale of all internal organs from cattle above
the age of 12 months, and increased enforcement efforts to track down black
market slaughter to prevent the marketing of meat that has not undergone
veterinary supervision.
Israel will also ban the sale of beef from cattle aged 30 months or older to
the Palestinian Authority in an effort to prevent the disease from spreading
there.
At the end of last week the government authorized additional funds to the
veterinary services to execute the emergency plan. The veterinary services
are asking for another NIS 50 million to finance the emergency measures -- a
70-percent increase on its regular budget.
