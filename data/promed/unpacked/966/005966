[Given the widespread occurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Nigeria [see ProMED-mail archive list below], it should not be surprising that HPAI has now been reported in neighboring Cameroon.

An FAO document published by EMPRES Watch (vol 32) in April 2015, titled "H5N1 HPAI spread in Nigeria and increased risk for neighbouring countries in West Africa", already warned of the risk of spread to bordering countries: "Traditional trading patterns, both formal and informal, between Nigeria and neighbouring countries provide an opportunity for cross-border or inter-regional disease spread." See the complete document at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4561e.pdf.

All outbreaks of HPAI reported from 1 Jan 2015 to date can be seen on the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/jo7ws3s (click on the section of interest on the map, and zoom in).
