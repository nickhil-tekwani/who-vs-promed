A 52-year-old resident died last Friday [10 Sep 2004], 2 days after being
diagnosed with dengue fever. Although the cause of his death has not been
confirmed, he is the 2nd person suspected to have succumbed to the disease
this year [2004]. He was experiencing body aches and giddiness, and, when his
symptoms continued to worsen, his family decided to take him to Tan Tock Seng
Hospital, his brother-in-law told The Straits Times.
Blood tests showed that he was suffering from dengue fever. His
condition later deteriorated, and he died on Friday [10 Sep 2004]. A
spokesman for Tan Tock Seng Hospital confirmed last evening [11 Sep
2004] that he was diagnosed with dengue fever. 6 people had died from
the disease last year [2003].
Up until 7 Aug 2004, a total of 3525 people had been infected with
dengue [in Singapore]. The 114 cases a week, on average, this year
[2004] is 26 percent higher than last year's [2003] 90.

Dengue fever in Viet Nam, which has eased off since August 2004, killed 73
local people in the first 8 months of this year [2004], a higher number than
the total number of deaths caused by the mosquito-borne disease last year
[2003].
The country detected some 1500 new dengue fever patients in each week
of August and in early September 2004, down 100 percent [sic] compared with
the previous peak months, the local newspaper Pioneer, on Tue 7 Sep
2004, quoted the Preventive Medicine Department, under the Ministry
of Health, as saying. Nearly 45 830 local people nationwide were
reported to have suffered from dengue fever between January and early
September 2004, mostly from southern localities such as the provinces
of Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, and Ben Tre, whose weather is most favorable
for the development of mosquitoes.
In an effort to minimize the number of new infections, the ministry
has recently launched an urgent nationwide program on dengue fever
prevention, supplied localities with more mosquito-killing chemicals,
medicines, and equipment, and, called for local health agencies to
raise public awareness of the disease.
Specifically, all residents across Viet Nam are urged to focus on
killing mosquitoes and their larvae on each Friday. The country is
spending 18 billion Vietnamese dong (USD 1.1 million) on anti-dengue
fever activities this year [2004].
In 2003, Viet Nam reported 35 073 cases of dengue fever infection, including
58 fatalities -- dengue cases up 48 percent & fatalities up 45 percent from
2002.

[3] Australia (Queensland): outbreak over
Date: 12 Sep 2004

<http://www.townsvilleonline.com.au/>

The dengue fever outbreak in the twin cities was officially declared
over this week [1st week of September 2004], after no new cases were
reported for the past 3 months.
The Tropical Public Health Unit, and the Townsville City Council,
declared the outbreak to be officially over on Monday [6 Sep 2004].
The outbreak began in Cranbrook in October [2003] and saw 58
confirmed dengue fever cases. The Tropical Public Health Unit
Director of Environmental Health Services, John Piispanen, said some
old lessons have been revised throughout the dengue fever outbreak
including ways to motivate people to check for breeding sites around
their homes.
He said the inspections of North Ward showed the importance of
regularly checking key containers, such as disused septic tanks and
wells, which provide prolific dengue mosquito breeding sites.
"This year's [2004] dengue outbreak in Townsville began when a person
who had contracted the dengue virus overseas, most probably in Papua
New Guinea, came into contact with local dengue mosquitoes, which
then spread the virus to local residents," Mr. Piispanen said.
Councillor Jenny Hill said Townsville City Council worked closely
with mosquito control experts from the Tropical Public Health Unit to
conduct house-to-house inspections and mosquito eradication. More
than 1000 premises were inspected, mostly in Cranbrook, Currajong,
and North Ward.
Mr. Piispanen said the outbreak proved that dengue fever doesn't just
follow the wet season, but, that there is a higher risk then.
A wide variety of levels of illness from dengue fever were shown
during the outbreak, with some people showing very few symptoms on
the one hand, to the death from dengue fever in the Torres Strait
Islands on the other, according to Mr. Piispanen.
