Outbreak of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease in Hong Kong Kindergarten
---------------------------------------------------
Health officials have been urged to investigate claims that one of
Hong Kong's most expensive schools did not act quickly enough to
inform parents of an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease among
its kindergarten children. No public announcement has been made about
the outbreak by the Department of Health, and officials only
confirmed the infections after questions were filed by the Sunday
Morning Post last week.
A department spokeswoman said 5 children from the kindergarten
section of the respected Yew Chung International School in Kowloon
Tong had contracted the disease. The children, all aged 4, have been
told to stay at home. None of the children, whose parents have been
contacted by the department, have developed complications. The
department spokeswoman said the parents of all the other children at
the school were notified on Thu 11 Mar 2004 -- at least 48 hours
after the first child fell ill.
Health officials did not say whether the school had acted properly in
notifying the parents. Teachers have expressed anger, claiming school
managers delayed telling the parents about the outbreak. There were
unconfirmed reports that as many as 10 children were infected during
the school's annual sports day last weekend.
Yew Chung's assistant director, Winnie Cheng, refused to confirm or
deny whether the school was aware that its pupils were infected as
early as 6 Mar 2004. "There is no need to confirm or deny this,
because I have no information on this aspect. We have very strict
hygiene measures to sterilise the school compound. Our cleaners wipe
down the furniture, stationary and playground equipment on a daily
basis," she said.
Hand, foot and mouth disease, which caused a public health scare when
it spread across Asia 6 years ago, is a viral infection that can lead
to flu-like symptoms in the early stages. Fever may persist for 4-5
days. A painless rash may also develop on the palms and soles and
sometimes on the buttocks, and there may be a loss of appetite,
especially if painful mouth ulcers make it difficult for the patient
to swallow.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) [the causative agent of hand, foot and mouth
disease] killed 100 people in Taiwan between 1998 and 2000. The
Department of Health said, however, that there was no cause for alarm
as [on this occasion] the effects of the disease were relatively mild.
Medical sector legislator Lo Wing-lok yesterday urged the department
to investigate Yew Chung's delay in informing other parents about the
disease. "What the school clearly has on its hands now is an outbreak
of hand, foot and mouth disease," he said. "Once a school has
confirmed that its students have contracted the disease, then they
should contact other parents as soon as possible so they will be
alert, and this will minimise the risk of others contracting the
disease." In 2003 there were 50 reported cases of EV71 infections in
Hong Kong, down from 477 in 2002.

[Some time ago a ProMED-mail correspondent provided the following
information, posted now because of its relevance to the preceding
news report.
A paper entitled "Enterovirus 71 outbreaks, Taiwan: occurrence and
recognition", by Lin TY, Twu SJ, Ho MS, Chang LY, Lee CY of the Chang
Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, can be found in Emerg. Infect. Dis.
2003 Mar;9(3):291-3. The abstract reads:
"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) caused a large outbreak in Taiwan in 1998 with
78 deaths, and smaller outbreaks recurred in 2000 and 2001. The
outbreak was recognized because of a large number of hand, foot, and
mouth disease cases and the rapid deaths of children with the
disease. Virologic and pathologic studies indicated that EV71 was the
most important agent related to severe and fatal cases and that a
neurogenic inflammatory response was involved in the pathogenesis of
cardiopulmonary collapse resulting from fulminant EV71 infection.
Seroepidemiologic study suggested that EV71 had circulated for at
least 16 years and that the accumulation of susceptible hosts might
have triggered the 1998 outbreak. However, a change in EV71
neurovirulence and host genetic susceptibility may also have affected
the clinical outcome. The Taiwan outbreak shows that worldwide
attention should be paid to such outbreaks, new antiviral drugs
should be developed, and that vaccination of children under 5 years
of age may be warranted." - Mod.CP]
