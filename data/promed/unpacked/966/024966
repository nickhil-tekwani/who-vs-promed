[1] Cholera - Haiti

Haiti's cholera death toll has risen to 3759, government figures
showed Thu 13 Jan 2011, but daily fatalities linked to the persistent
epidemic appeared to trend downward in the 1st days of 2011. The
figure, which marks the total toll from the discovery of the outbreak
in mid-October 2010 through 7 Jan 2011, is just over 100 more than
the Health Ministry's previous toll released one week ago. Total
infections rose to 181 000 in Haiti, including 101 000 people who
have been treated in hospital.

A Health Ministry graphic showed deaths between 1 and 7 Jan 2011
averaging about 17 per day, the lowest average of any period since
the outbreak. About 12 deaths were recorded on 7 Jan 2011, the
epidemic's smallest daily toll. The numbers for the period are not
final, however. The ministry retroactively updates daily death tolls
when new data is gathered.

As recently as 27 Dec 2010, there were more than 70 recorded deaths,
and 19 Dec 2010 marked a daily high of more than 105 fatalities,
according to the ministry.

Haiti's Thursday [13 Jan 2011] figures put the mortality rate at 2.1 percent.

Canals, rivers, and irrigation ditches along the Dominican Republic's
border region were likely responsible for cholera spreading to dozens
who were exposed to the contaminated waters, health officials said.
The Ministry of Health said about 60 percent of the 146 cases
analyzed were traced back to those water sources. A total of 154
cases have been reported.

About 65 percent of cholera patients are agriculture workers exposed
to contaminated water, the ministry said. No deaths have been
reported in the Dominican Republic.

More than half of the cases were reported in provinces on the Haitian
border that are home to 2 rivers that tested positive for the
bacteria. One of those rivers, the Artibonito, originates in Haiti.

So far this rainy season [2010-2011], cholera outbreaks have been
recorded in 3 of Mozambique's 11 provinces, with a total of 126 cases
diagnosed, reports this issue of the independent daily "O Pais",
citing the deputy national director of public health, Leonardo Chavane.

By last Thu 13 Jan 2011, 54 cases had been reported in the northern
province of Cabo Delgado, in the provincial capital, Pemba, and in
the districts of Ancuabe, Chiure, Montepuez, and Pemba-Metuge. In
Nampula province, 45 cases of cholera were diagnosed in Memba,
Mogincual, Nacaroa, and Meconta districts, while in Chimoio, capital
of the central province of Manica, 27 cases of the disease were
confirmed. In none of the 3 provinces concerned have any deaths from
cholera been reported.

Chavane warned that the heavy rains occurring over much of the
country, plus defective drainage systems, could lead to further
outbreaks of cholera

A fresh cholera outbreak which has seen 60 people infected with the
disease and 4 people dead has been reported in Bikita. Masvingo
Provincial Medical Director Dr Robert Mudyiradima said tests had
confirmed that the deaths of 2 children, one man, and a woman from
Nyika Growth Point were caused by cholera.

"We have dispatched our health teams to assess the situation and
raise more awareness on the disease," Dr Mudyiradima said. He said
the recent rains and a recent meeting of the Apostolic Faith members
could have contributed to the resurgent outbreak.

In 2008, 4000 people countrywide died of cholera according to the WHO.

There has been a sharp rise in the number of cholera infections in
Papua New Guinea's capital Port Moresby. Health authorities say there
were 295 serious cases of cholera in Port Moresby in December 2010.
So far in January 2011 there have been 138 with one death.

The city's cholera task force leader, Dr Timothy Pyakalyia, says wet
weather and large gatherings of people over the holidays are to blame
for the surge in infections.

Altogether there have been 6 deaths and nearly 4000 infections since
the contagious disease arrived in the city last April 2010.

[8] Cholera - Papua New Guinea (Central province)

A total of 5 people from Mailu Island in Central's Abau district died
from cholera during the festive period. Central health authorities
believed that the outbreak occurred during the Christmas and New Year
[2010] period.

Abau district health coordinator Etene Boyama said yesterday [10 Jan
2011] that the 1st cases were reported last Tue 4 Jan 2011, at the
island's health centre. She said 44 people were admitted and treated
including those with mild diarrhea throughout last week [week of 3 Jan 2011].

She said there was a possibility that the Wanigelas from Port
Moresby's Koki settlement, who went up for the holidays could have
infected those in the village, which caused the spread.

If the initial test results are anything to go by, cholera seems to
be rearing its ugly head in Mumbai. Doctors of Bandra's Bhabha
Hospital told TOI that stool samples of 12 children sent for the
Hanging Drop (HD) test have confirmed the presence of cholera bacteria.

There has been a spurt in diarrhoea cases in the city in the past 2
weeks with nearly 200 patients seeking treatment. Doctors of Bhabha
Hospital said that they had treated more than 100 diarrhoea patients
in the last 10 days. "All had come with complaints of severe loose
motions, fever, dehydration, and weakness," said a doctor adding that
both adults as well as kids were equally affected by the disease.

The situation was similar at Parel's KEM [King Edward Memorial]
Hospital. Here too the doctors claimed to have treated close to 100
cases in the last 2 weeks.
