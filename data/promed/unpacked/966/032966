The microbiological laboratory in Pazardzhik has confirmed that the
cause of the illness that affected 22 people in the town of Pazardzhik
from an Arab-run schwarma fast food outlet is attributed to
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] enteritidis, news.plovdiv24.com has
reported. Initially, 19 people were admitted to the emergency ward,
followed by another 3, including a 3-year-old child.

"_Salmonella_ enteritidis is the cause of contamination," said Dr.
Fany Petkova. "The source of the problem is the Ali Baba fast food
outlet in Pazardzhik. Of the 22 affected, 11 have already been
released, whereas the condition of the people who remain hospitalized
is stable," she said.

Data from the final analysis released by the laboratory in Pazardzhik
say that "_Salmonella_, from the eggs with which mayonnaise sauce was
made for the diners, caused food poisoning."

The outlet has been closed until further notice. It was revealed that
the enterprise had been checked 4 times since the beginnnig of 2009.
During the last investigation, conducted on 12 Jul 2009, a document
was signed obliging the owner to "improve the hygiene" as it was
considered to be "inadequate." In the previous examination, performed
in March 2009, the owner was told to use only "egg powder for the
mayonnaise," which he failed to comply with.

[_Salmonella_ enteritidis can silently infect the ovaries of
healthy-appearing hens and contaminate the eggs before the shells are
formed. Raw eggs in home-made mayonnaise, a thick, stable emulsion
made from egg yolks and vegetable oil, are certainly likely to be the
vehicle.

Pazardzhik (also spelled as Pazardjik or Pazarjik) is a town situated
along the banks of the Maritsa river in Bulgaria. It is the capital of
Pazardzhik Province which can be seen on a map at:
