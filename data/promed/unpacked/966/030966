Over 300 hundred head of cattle from 3 kraals in Ngwezi area in
Kazungula district died last month due to contagious bovine pleural
pneumonia (CBPP) that spread from Western Province in 2004.
In an interview yesterday, Crispin Ndopu, a representative of the
livestock farmers in the area, demanded immediate vaccination of
animals to avoid further spread of the disease.
Ndopu said people in Kazungula feared the disease could kill all
their animals if nothing were done by the veterinary department.
He said they had made several follow-ups with the veterinary
department in Livingstone over the matter but nothing had been done
to date. Ndopu wondered why the vaccination exercise was being
carried out in Western Province alone, leaving out Southern Province,
where the disease was killing animals at a fast rate.
On Tuesday, irate farmers from Ngwezi dragged district veterinary
officer Dr Jackson Soko to the provincial permanent secretary's
office, demanding an explanation for why they had not vaccinated the
animals long after the disease was discovered in the area.
When contacted, Dr Soko said the issue needed to be dealt with at a
much higher level.
But a source at the veterinary department said that CBPP was a very
difficult disease to clear and that slaughtering the animals was the
only sure way to prevent further spread.
The source said the department had suggested to the farmers that a
market for their animals could be found so that the proceeds could be
used to purchase those animals which were free from CBPP.
The sources disclosed that large a number of animals were still dying
in Western Province even after conducting the vaccination exercise.
"From what is happening in Western Province, people here need to
understand that this CBPP cannot be cured, even after vaccinating the
animals. We advised the farmers in Kazungula that their animals
should just be slaughtered, that will be all," said the source.
The Nyawa area in Kazungula was once hit by CBPP, but the disease was
cleared after farmers agreed that their animals be slaughtered and
replaced by non-infected ones.
