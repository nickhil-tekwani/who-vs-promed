CERCOSPORA SPOT, AVOCADO - KENYA

Unusually heavy late 2006/early 2007 rain in Kenya's main avocado-growing
regions caused an outbreak of a disease, which is expected to cause a
decrease in export volumes for the 2006/2007 season, although the
sub-sector remains in good overall health. The mixture of heavy rain and
sun caused an outbreak of _Cercospora purpurea_, characterised by dark
spots on the leaves and fruits. Cracks often appear on the spots, allowing
entry of the avocado fungus [that is, anthracnose, see comment below -
Mod.DHA].
The damage affected about 50 per cent of the yields of the grade 1 avocado
crop. Despite the losses, the avocado sector has proven more robust than in
previous years due to the significant investments made by both large scale
and smallholder farmers and others in the supply chain. General crop
husbandry is improved, as well as access to and affordability of
fertiliser, all contributing to better tree health. Many smallholders have
increased their number of trees to an average of 30 per farmer. In
addition, under a pilot arrangement with Equity Bank, over 3000 farmers had
been able to access pesticide spray services on credit. Even in the face of
the reduced volumes, the country's 5 major avocado exporters were
purchasing from more than 200 smallholder groups representing 5300 and 57
000 trees in order to honor supply contracts entered into before the season.
The reduction of grade 1 crop volumes left a large reservoir of avocados
for the secondary market, dominated by 3 large processors operating in
Kenya. Harvesting of the grade 2 crop began in late April [2007], when the
oil content of the crop due for processing was at an optimal level. Exports
of crude avocado oil from Kenya are expected to reach record levels,
providing the sector with a firm foundation on which to enter the 2007/2008
season.

[The disease is caused by _Pseudocercospora purpurea_ (previously
_Cercospora purpurea_) and has been reported from Brazil, South Africa,
Japan, Mexico, and the USA. Up to 70 per cent preharvest fruit losses have
been recorded. _P. purpurea_ causes very small, angular, brown to purple
spots on leaves and fruit which may coalesce to form brown areas. On fruit,
cells dry out and the spots become sunken and crack very commonly,
providing entry points for the anthracnose fungus. Spores are released
under warm, wet conditions and are spread by wind and rain. Insects may
also spread the pathogen.
The disease can be controlled, to a large degree, by timely fungicide
applications. Cultivars with fruit having a thicker skin appear to be more
resistant.
Other species in the genus cause leaf and fruit spot diseases in a number
of host plants.
Anthracnose is a serious disease of the fruit caused by _Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides_, which often remains unrecognised until ripening. The
fungus relies on available surface lesions as ports of entry and, thus, its
control depends on managing other diseases, pests, and cultural practices.
