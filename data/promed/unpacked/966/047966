China: avian influenza virus in Anhui outbreak not mutated
-----------------------------------------------
A senior bird flu control official said here, on Sat 10 Jul 2004, that the
avian influenza virus, which hit the eastern province of Anhui in early
July 2004, has not mutated, and, remains the same as when it affected the
country in the spring 2004 outbreak. Wei Jianzhong, member of the experts'
panel of the provincial Avian Influenza Control Headquarters, said
laboratory testing had proven that the virus is the H5N1 strain which is a
stable type of the avian influenza virus.
Outbreaks of avian influenza in the province, in the spring of 2004,
occurred at 4 locations: Ma'anshan City, Guangde County, Jieshou City, and
Fuyang City. The recent 5th outbreak was in Juchao District of Chaohu City,
near one of China's largest freshwater lakes, Chaohu Lake.
The Avian Influenza Control Headquarters has ordered close monitoring of
[potential] bird-to-human infection, although, so far, no such cases have
been found. The health authorities are monitoring to scrutinize any
flu-like cases, unidentified pneumonia patients, and deaths. The 37 people,
who had close contact with dead chickens, or, worked in the outbreak site,
were removed from medical observation on Sat 10 Jul 2004. But, the
provincial health bureau cautioned [local] health authorities to remain
vigilant with regard to any human infections. The bureau added that medical
examinations of, and home visits to, those working in poultry farms should
be strictly carried out.
The provincial government asked provinces and cities next to Anhui to lift
their ban over the entry of poultry products from the province. 6
provinces, and Shanghai Municipality, have all ordered suspension of the
shipment of poultry from Anhui since the outbreak on 3 Jul 2004. Officials
with the government of Anhui said that the province has undertaken proper
measures to successfully control the avian influenza outbreak, and, that
other parts of the province are not affected, apart from the outbreak area.
Anhui is a major producer of poultry, with an annual output of 800 million
birds, 860 000 tons of bird meat, and 1.2 million tons of eggs. About 40
percent of its production is sold to neighboring provinces and cities.

[The title of this Xinhuanet News Agency report, and its various
derivatives, is misleading. It has been established merely that the virus
isolated during the most recent outbreak of avian influenza in Anhui
province in China retains the antigenicity of the viruses previously
isolated throughout China and East Asia; i.e., the virus is a
highly-pathogenic strain of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. Until the
nucleotide sequence of the complete genome of this new isolate has been
determined, little or nothing can be inferred about the genetic stability
of the virus causing outbreaks of avian influenza in China, and, elsewhere
in East Asia. - Mod.CP]
