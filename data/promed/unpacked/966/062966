[The HPAI H5N6 virus has been detected in poultry in China, Laos, and Viet Nam since its initial emergence in 2014 as a reassortant of H5N1 and H6N6. There have been, in China, a total of 10 human cases since its recognition, mainly in Guangdong province.

In view of its recent resurgence in humans, China's authorities have issued in January 2016 a press release reassuring the public that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of HPAI H5N6 (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/15/c_135013921.htm).

The HPAI H5N6 outbreak described in the media report above, on a commercial poultry farm, has been reported to the OIE in follow-up report no. 14, submitted 11 Mar 2016. It included the following statistics:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 34 233 / 15 217 / 14 705 / 19 528 / 0
(available, with an interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=19897)

The updated summary of the event since its start (23 Aug 2014), as of 11 Mar 2016, is available in OIE's WAHID archive, as follows:

Total outbreaks = 34 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 285 159 / 51 299 / 41 912 / 243 173 / 0

The above, and a map showing the locations of the 34 accumulated outbreaks, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019897_20160311_105313.pdf.

China applies a stamping-out policy without vaccination for the handling of all HPAI strains in poultry. - Mod.AS
