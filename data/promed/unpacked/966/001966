[1] Etiology of HFRS in Russia
Date: Mon 19 Mar 2007
From: Galina Kompanets <gal_48_kom@rambler.ru>

In the ProMED-mail post concerning hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) in the Central Federal Region of Russia [see:
Hemorrhagic fever w/renal synd. - Russia (Central Fed.Region) (02)
20070313.0887], Dr. Heikki Henttonen suggested Puumala virus [PUUV]
as the likely etiologic agent of HFRS in this region of Russia.
As far as I know, cases of HFRS in this part of Russia have been
associated with Dobrava virus [DOBV] and not with Puumala virus.
Following are some recent references concerning Dobrava virus in the
Central Federal Region of Russia:
1. Tkachenko E et al: Epidemiological features of HFRS outbreak
caused by Dobrava/Belgrade virus in Central European Russia.
Abstracts in 6th Int Conf on HFRS and HPS and hantaviruses.
2. Balakirev AE, Bashkirtsev VN, Sedova NS, et al: Epizootology of
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the Central Chernozem Region
[Article in Russian] Vopr Virusol;2006 Sep-Oct; 51(5):28-32.
In addition, part 2 of the ProMED-mail post archived as "Hemorrhagic
fever w/renal synd. - Russia (Central Federal Region 20070311.0857"
states that rodents captured in HFRS foci were identified as
_Apodemus agrarius_, the dominant rodent species in the region and
carrier of Dobrava virus.

[2] Hantavirus taxonomy
Date: Mon 19 Mar 2007
From: Heikki Henttonen <Heikki.Henttonen@metla.fi>

I thank Dr Kompanets for her comment, which allows me to expand my
commentary on European hantaviruses.
Initially a short discussion of taxonomy is appropriate. Dr.
Kompanets referred to Dobrava virus (DOBV), whereas I mentioned
Saaremaa virus (SAAV) occurring in Central and Eastern Europe
(including Russia). Most probably we mean the same virus, carried by
_Apodemus agrarius_. When our Finnish-Estonian-Swedish team first
found a hantavirus in the striped field mouse, _A. agrarius_, in
Europe (in Estonia in 1996), in the 1st publications it was named
DOBV strain in _A. agrarius_. The strain in _A. agrarius_ in Europe
resembles more DOBV than Hantaan virus in _A. agrarius_ in the Far
East. The original DOBV found in European viruses are quite
different. Consequently, the name Saaremaa has been suggested for the
one in _A. agrarius_, and this name is quite commonly adopted. Still,
partly based on the literature from late 1990s, DOBV is still often
used for the virus in _A. agrarius_.
Also, there is scientific debate whether Saaremaa deserves the status
of a separate virus species, or if it is only a DOBV strain in _A.
agrarius_. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)
has formulated 4 criteria to define hantavirus species:
- the different species should have a different primary reservoir,
that is, they are found in a unique ecological niche;
- the amino acid compositions of the glycoprotein precursor protein
and the nucleocapsid protein sequences should differ by at least 7 percent;
- the difference in 2-way cross-neutralization test is at least 4-fold; and
- different hantavirus species do not form reassortants naturally
with other species.
Then, how close or distant are these viruses? SAAV and DOBV occur in
different host species, even when these hosts are found in the same
area. Cross-infection experiments show, for example, that SAAV
replicates poorly in _A. flavicollis_. Also, the difference in
cross-neutralization tests is at least 4-fold. The virulence is
different. DOBV kills suckling mice, SAAV does not. SAAV causes a
mild HFRS in humans, resembling that caused by PUUV, while DOBV
causes a severe HFRS. So, biologically they are clearly different
entities. However, the condition for amino acid (or nucleotide)
difference is not quite met. The status of SAAV is being decided by the ICTV.
Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) seems to be the most common hantavirus and
the cause of most of HFRS cases in the European part of Russia.
However, Dr Kompanets is correct in that SAAV also occurs in Russia,
which I also mentioned. I did not deal more specifically with SAAV
partly because of space, partly because my main emphasis was on the
ecological aspects. But it is good to point out that in regions where
_Myodes glareolus_-carried PUUV dominates but _A. agrarius_ also
occurs, seroscreening has suggested that SAAV infections occur in
humans. An outbreak in Tula region (close to the regions reported by
ProMED-mail) in 1992 has later, according to serotests, been
attributed to SAAV (or an SAAV-like virus). (But Tula virus is hosted
by the vole _Microtus arvalis_ and is generally considered nonpathogenic).
All this emphasizes the need for proper methodologies for reliable
conclusions, such as, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and sequencing
for rodent samples, further characterization and isolation of
viruses, and detailed human serology with proper antigens, especially
in regions where more than one pathogenic hantavirus co-occur.

[The taxonomy of the hantaviruses continues to develop. In the most
recent (8th) Report of the ICTV, Dobrava virus is now designated as
Dobrava-Belgrade virus. Furthermore, failure to reassort genome
sub-units is not an absolute indicator of virus species identity
since some reassortants have been isolated under laboratory
experiments. - Mod.CP]
