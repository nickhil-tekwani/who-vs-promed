Two patients at an Oregon hospital contracted a dangerous fungal infection during [their stays at the hospital in] an "outbreak" of _Candida auris_, a type of yeast rare to the United States, the Oregon Health Authority [OHA] reported on Tuesday [28 Dec 2021].

A case -- the first ever found in Oregon -- was detected at Salem Health [11 Dec 2021] and confirmed [17 Dec 2021] in an individual who had "recent international healthcare exposures". [Another] 2 already-hospitalized patients then came down with the infection on [23 and 27 Dec 2021].

Salem Health and OHA are working to notify healthcare facilities that have received transfer patients from the "affected units" at Salem Health. It was not immediately clear which units at Salem Health were affected by the outbreak.

The fungus, also called _C. auris_, can cause infections in wounds or the bloodstream and is most dangerous for hospital or nursing home patients who have serious medical conditions, weakened immune systems, or have tubes or lines entering their body, according to OHA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The risk of infection to otherwise healthy people is "extremely low".

Since 2013, about 1150 clinical cases of _C. auris_ have been identified in the United States. CDC describes it as presenting a "serious global health threat" [https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/index.html]. "_C. auris_ is an emerging pathogen of concern because it can cause serious infections, particularly in those with serious medical problems, and can be resistant to the antifungal drugs we have to treat it," Rebecca Pierce, Healthcare-Associated Infections Program manager with the OHA, said. Pierce went on to say the fungus in the cases at Salem Health is responding to existing treatments.

OHA, CDC, and Salem Health are developing and implementing a plan to stop the spread of _C. auris_ at the hospital, Jasmin Chaudhary, medical director of infection prevention at Salem Health said. The measures put into effect include ensuring frequent disinfection of patients' health care environments; using transmission-based precautions for those infected or colonized with _C. auris_; and adhering to handwashing protocols.

What is _C. auris_?
A fungal disease that spreads in healthcare settings, causing invasive infections. First identified in Japan in 2009, _C. auris_ began occurring in the US in 2015.

CDC is particularly concerned about it because _C. auris_ is difficult to diagnose, requiring specialized lab work, and prompt action is necessary to prevent it from spreading. In addition, most of its strains have proven resistant to at least one anti-fungal drug.

Who does it affect?
_C. auris_ typically preys on patients who already have a serious medical condition or a compromised immune system, especially those who require intrusive treatment with a tube going into their body. Healthy people typically don't get infected, but they should clean their hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer when they come in contact with a patient who has the disease or with surfaces or equipment in the room. CDC says 30-60% of the people who have contracted _C. auris_ infections have died, but it also points out many of them were at increased risk because of serious illnesses.

What are the symptoms?
Symptoms vary, but the commonest ones are fever and chills that don't respond to antibiotics. In those cases, specialized lab tests are required to ascertain whether the condition is _C. auris_. The disease often causes infection in the bloodstream, the ears, or in a wound.

How is it treated?
CDC said the majority of _C. auris_ infections respond to treatment with a class of antifungal medications known as echinocandins. But some strains resist all 3 main classes of drugs [echinocandins, azoles, and polyenes (amphotericin)] requiring higher doses of multiple medications.

How to avoid it?
If you're around a patient with _C. auris_, wash your hands and request that others who are exposed do the same, including healthcare workers. CDC recommends that patients with _C. auris_ be placed in a single room that may require frequent cleaning with a high-grade disinfectant.

[In the United States, CDC reports that about 90% of _Candida auris_ isolates have been resistant to fluconazole, about 30% have been resistant to amphotericin B, and less than 5% have been resistant to echinocandins; isolates that are resistant to fluconazole may occasionally respond to other triazoles, such as voriconazole and posaconazole (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-antifungal.html). Because isolates are uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin), invasive _C. auris_ infections are initially treated empirically with an echinocandin drug, with patients needing careful monitoring, as _C. auris_ can develop resistance quickly during therapy (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-treatment.html).

_C. auris_ can persistently colonize environmental surfaces, and epidemiologic investigations of hospital outbreaks find widespread _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patients' rooms, and surfaces that are frequently touched, such as computer screens, touchpads, and keyboards.

Screening cultures of patients at multiple sites (such as the axilla, groin, rectum) in nosocomial outbreak settings commonly find asymptomatic colonization. Colonized or infected patients frequently have prior extensive contact with multiple healthcare facilities, highlighting the value of careful and thorough communication at interfacility transfer. Investigations of the causes of hospital outbreaks frequently find infection control lapses, undoubtedly compounded by the care required for critically ill patients.

CDC recommends that infection controls for _C. auris_ in healthcare settings include hand hygiene, transmission-based precautions (isolation of patients in single rooms or cohorting, that is, housing people infected with the same MDR strain in the same room), disinfection of the patient environment, communication with other facilities when transferring patients, screening contacts of patients, and prospective laboratory surveillance to identify new cases in facilities where _C. auris_ has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-infection-control.html). - Mod.ML
