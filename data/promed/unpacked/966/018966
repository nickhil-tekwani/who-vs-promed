The superbug CRE [carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae] was a contributory factor in 3 deaths at University Hospital Limerick between 2009 and 2015, says the HSE [Health Service Executive]. HSE said that of the 92 cases of multi drug-resistant CRE detected in the Mid-West between 2009 and the end of May 2015, some 27 deaths had been recorded. A HSE spokesman said: "In 3 of these cases, CRE was found to be a contributing factor in their deaths. In the remainder, CRE detection was associated but was not the primary cause of death."

Dr Paul Burke, clinical director of the UL [University of Limerick] Hospitals Group, said the CRE figures were comparable with those found elsewhere. "People should not be worried. If they are ill they should come to hospital," he said.

He said the group has developed a quality improvement plan for the control of CRE. This has led to an overall reduction of 40 per cent of new detections of CRE in the first 6 months of this year [2016] compared to the corresponding 2015 period. "Measures include an intensive screening programme; use of an isolation ward for newly detected or known positive patients to reduce the risk of cross-transmission; flagging all CRE positive cases and CRE contacts through the management, surveillance and reporting software ICNet; and reporting new cases appropriately through our microbiology team," he said.

"In addition, UL Hospitals Group has introduced a preferred prescribing policy for antibiotic selections. Strict guidelines are issued to all [non-consultant hospital doctors] in relation to antibiotic prescribing in terms of 1st line and 2nd line antibiotics. More complex antibiotics are referred to the microbiology team before they are prescribed."

A HSE spokesman said the UL Hospitals Group will continue to work with HIQA [Health Information and Quality Authority] and the HSE nationally to ensure best practice is followed in dealing with CRE.

"A cohort ward for patients with infections was opened at UHL in November 2015. It is acknowledged that this is not the ultimate solution to the shortage of isolation facilities at UHL," said the spokesman. "The long term solution for this is single occupancy rooms for inpatients such as those provided at the 50 bed block in Ennis Hospital [Ennis Hospital, opened in 1940, is part of the University of Limerick Hospitals Group]. UL Hospitals Group has made a bid under the capital programme to provide a new 96-bed block at UHL [?] and looks forward to a favourable outcome in this regard to support best practice."

[Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is a family of bacteria that are difficult to treat because they are resistant to the carbapenem antibiotics (that is, imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem). Carbapenem-resistant _Klebsiella_ species and _Escherichia coli_ are frequent examples of CRE, but other bacterial species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family may also be carbapenem-resistant.

The usual mechanism for carbapenem resistance is production of a carbapenemase, an enzyme that breaks down carbapenems and destroys the antibacterial activity of these drugs. There are multiple types of carbapenemases, including KPC (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase), NDM (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase), and VIM (Verona Integron-Mediated Metallo-beta-lactamase). CRE are resistant to most other beta-lactam antibiotics, as well as other classes of antibiotics.

Infections due to these organisms are very difficult to treat and can be fatal in up to 50 per cent of patients who become infected. We are not told in the news report if the CRE outbreak in Limerick involved a single or multiple enterobacterial species, what was the mechanism(s) of carbapenem-resistance, or what other classes of antibiotics the CRE were resistant to.

For a discussion of carbapenemases, see moderator ML's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post: Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem resistant - Europe: survey 20130712.1822582.
