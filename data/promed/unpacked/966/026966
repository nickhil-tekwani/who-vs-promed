India (Andhra Pradesh): viral encephalitis diagnosis under renewed scrutiny
----------------------------------------------------
The medical fraternity is divided over the "mysterious fever", dubbed a
viral encephalitis, which has claimed the lives of more than 100 children
in the state ever since it surfaced 3 weeks ago. Senior medical officers in
the state are questioning even the views of the National Institute of
Communicable Diseases (NICD) experts, who diagnosed them as cases of
Japanese encephalitis (JE), after visiting the affected areas. "Considering
various factors including symptoms of JE, the nature of cases etc, the
opinion of the NICD experts [needs to be re-examined]," the local doctors say.

The NICD experts [have responded by] touring the same areas again to
collect blood samples for a second time to reconfirm their previous
findings. "It could be viral meningo-encephalitis, and all such cases have
to be treated at the earliest to prevent them from becoming more complex,"
Niloufer Hospital superintendent Dr NCK Reddy said. Dr Reddy and his team
of doctors have circulated to all districts the guidelines which they
followed in treating the children in the hospital. He feels that the focus
should be more on environmental hygiene and mosquito control. This exercise
should become part of every individual's life, he said.

Another question being posed is that: If the NICD opinion that the deaths
are due to JE is correct, why is the state government not administering the
readily available [one million] doses of JE vaccine? It has been pointed
out also that JE cases normally surface some 6 weeks after the first rains
during monsoon, whereas this time the disease broke out before onset of the
monsoon.

Another factor baffling doctors is that most of the children who survived
the mystery [illness] were [in normal health on recovery, whereas if they
had been infected by JE,] they would be incapacitated in one form or
another after recovery.

The authorities hoped to solve the mystery by a closer examination of the
blood samples drawn from surviving children but the [task] is proving to be
difficult, as it has to be done a week after the patient is discharged from
hospital. "Many survivors have moved to other locations [away?] from their
villages," officials said.

[The evidence for viral infection remains weak, and confirmation must await
the outcome of the second series of tests. The severity and sudden onset of
the illness and the apparent absence of sequelae suggests that a
non-infectious cause cannot be excluded at this stage. One does wonder
whether there is a connection between the earlier reported undiagnosed
outbreak in West Bengal and the above-reported outbreaks in Andrha Pradesh
and Maharastra state; a shared as-yet-unidentified agent either microbial
or toxic? More information from official sources would be welcomed. -
