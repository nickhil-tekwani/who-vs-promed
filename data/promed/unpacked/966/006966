A 41 year old man in China's eastern province of Jiangsu has been confirmed as the 1st human case of infection with a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3, Beijing's National Health Commission (NHC) said on Tuesday [2 Jun 2021]. Many different strains of bird flu are present in China and some sporadically infect people, usually those working with poultry. There is no indication that H10N3 can spread easily in humans.

The man, a resident of the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized on [28 Apr 2021] and diagnosed with H10N3 on [28 May 2021], the health commission said. It did not give details on how the man was infected. His condition is now stable and he is ready to be discharged. Investigation of his close contacts found no other cases, the NHC said. No other cases of human infection with H10N3 have been reported globally, it added. H10N3 is low pathogenic, which means it causes relatively less severe disease in poultry and is unlikely to cause a large-scale outbreak, the NHC added.

The World Health Organization (WHO), in a reply to Reuters in Geneva, said: "The source of the patient's exposure to the H10N3 virus is not known at this time, and no other cases were found in emergency surveillance among the local population. At this time, there is no indication of human-to-human transmission. As long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is not surprising, which is a vivid reminder that the threat of an influenza pandemic is persistent."

The strain is "not a very common virus", said Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the regional office for Asia and the Pacific. Only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, mostly in wild birds or waterfowl in Asia and some limited parts of North America, and none had been detected in chickens so far, he added.

Analysing the genetic data of the virus will be necessary to determine whether it resembles older viruses or if it is a novel mix of different viruses, Claes said. There have been no significant numbers of human infections with bird flu since the H7N9 strain killed around 300 people during 2016-2017.

CHP notified of a human case of avian influenza A (H10N3) in mainland China
Unique ID: 1009593077
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Information from the National Health Commission showed that this is the 1st case of human infection with avian influenza A(H10N3) in the world. The case involved a 41 year old male patient living in Zhenjiang City in Jiangsu Province who developed symptoms on [23 Apr 2021]. He was admitted to hospital for medical treatment on [28 Apr 2021] and is now in a stable condition. His relevant close contacts did not show any abnormalities during the medical surveillance period. Upon genetic analysis, the genes of the virus were determined to be of avian origin and the H10N3 virus is low pathogenic among poultry.

[The official press release from the Government of Hong Kong SAR is available at https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202106/01/P2021060100875.htm.

"An avian influenza A/H10N3 virus was first isolated in Hong Kong in 1979, and in a live bird market in Thailand in 2011. However, pathogenicity in mammals due to H10N3 viruses remains largely unclear. H10 subtype influenza viruses have been isolated in various species of waterfowl across worldwide geographic areas for more than 50 years. The viruses remain avian receptor binding, however, some strains are highly pathogenic to chickens, even though they lack multiple basic amino acids at the hemagglutinin cleavage site. H10 viruses occasionally infect humans" (https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34489).

"Seven H10 avian influenza viruses (AIVs), H10N3 (n = 2), H10N7 (n = 1), and H10N8 (n = 4), were isolated from chickens in Zhejiang Province, Eastern China, during surveillance of AIVs in live poultry markets in 2016 and 2017. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Zhejiang H10 strains received gene segments from H10, H3, and H7 viruses from birds in East Asia" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30302582/).

"Little is known about the virus, which appears to be rare in birds, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and does not cause severe disease. Yet avian influenza viruses that have little impact on birds can be much more serious in people, such as the H7N9 strain that killed almost 300 people in China during the winter of 2016-2017. The WHO has said there had been only rare instances of person-to-person spread of the H7N9 virus.

"The strain is 'not a very common virus,' and only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, according to Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the regional office for Asia and the Pacific" (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-018-4019-z).

The current risk of further infection with H10N3 can be expected to be low, with experts describing the single case as "sporadic". With growing surveillance of avian influenza in the human population, more infections with bird flu viruses are being picked up. As long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is hardly surprising, and continued surveillance in animals, as well as humans, is the only recourse to detect emerging novel strains quickly. - Mod.UBA

As the general term "highly pathogenic avian influenza" and the historical term "fowl plague" refer to infection with highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus, it is necessary to assess the pathogenicity of influenza A virus isolates for domestic poultry. Although all naturally occurring "highly pathogenic avian influenza" (HPAI) strains isolated to date have been of either the H5 or H7 subtype, most H5 or H7 isolates have been of low pathogenicity (LPAI). Such strains, in contrast with HPAI strains, do not require the application of severe control measures on poultry farms.

The methods used for the determination of strain virulence for birds have evolved over recent years with a greater understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity, but still primarily involve the intravenous inoculation of a minimum of 8 susceptible 4- to 8-week-old chickens with infectious virus; strains are considered to be highly pathogenic if they cause more than 75% mortality within 10 days, or inoculation of 10 susceptible 6-week-old chickens resulting in an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of greater than 1.2. Although all the truly HPAI viruses isolated so far have been of H5 or H7 subtypes, at least 2 isolates, both of H10 subtype (H10N4 and H10N5), have been reported that would have fulfilled both the OIE and EU in vivo definitions for HPAI viruses (see Wood et al. [1] below), as they killed 7/10 and 8/10 chickens with IVPI values greater than 1.2 when the birds were inoculated intravenously. However, these viruses did not induce death or signs of disease when inoculated intranasally and did not have a haemagglutinin cleavage site sequence compatible with HPAI virus. The IVPI of the currently discussed H10N3 strain deserves to be defined and compared with the 2 mentioned H10 strains. The above is mainly based upon OIE's terrestrial manual (version adopted in May 2015).
