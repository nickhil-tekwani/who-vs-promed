Beijing reported on [Sat 11 Feb 2017] a human case of avian influenza H7N9, the 1st human infection in the Chinese capital in 2017, authorities said. The patient is 68 years old and comes from the town of Langfang, in the neighboring province of Hebei. He is in a critical condition and receiving treatment.

The patient developed symptoms on [29 Jan 2017] and received care at a local hospital in Langfang. He was transferred to Beijing on [6 Feb 2017] due to the deterioration of his condition. On [Sat 11 Feb 2017], his infection with the H7N9 strain of avian influenza was confirmed. He is suspected of having had contact with live poultry.

The 1st case of human H7N9 infection was reported in March 2013 in China. The virus is likely to occur mainly in winter and spring.

China's southwestern Yunnan province confirmed one person has died from the H7N9 strain of bird flu, state media Xinhua news reported on [Thu 9 Feb 2017], bringing the total death toll from the virus to 30 this winter [2016-2017].

Chinese disease control experts have warned the public to stay alert for H7N9 avian flu, with more than 100 cases of human infections reported over the last 2.5 months [December 2016-February 2017]. In December [2016] alone, China had 106 cases of human infections, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

While South Korea and Japan are battling their own major outbreaks, the current China outbreaks appear isolated.

The virus is likely to strike in winter and spring, and farmers have in recent years ramped up measures such as cleaning regimes to prevent the disease.

China has confirmed 5 bird flu outbreaks among poultry this winter, which has led to the culling of more than 175 000 birds. The most recent bird flu outbreak in poultry hit a goose farm in China's southern Hunan province, killing 1054 birds, said the Ministry of Agriculture. The local government culled 2067 more birds after the outbreak, the 5th among poultry since [October 2016].

China, the world's 3rd-largest producer of broiler chickens and the 2nd-biggest consumer of poultry, has also closed some live poultry markets after people and chickens were infected by the avian flu strains.

Widespread infection can lead to severe health risks and big financial losses. The last major outbreak in China was in 2013, killing 36 people and causing more than USD 6 billion in losses for the agricultural sector.

At least 35 people have died in China's Jiangsu province due to H7N9 avian flu in the last 3 months, official media said today [10 Feb 2017].

Of the 49 people infected with flu, 21 died last month [January 2017], while 14 of the 54 people admitted for treatment in December [2016] have died, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

H7N9 has entered its peak season, and direct contact with live poultry remains the main source of infection, said Bao Changjun with provincial centre for disease control and prevention.

Cold weather provides the virus with a better environment and smog makes people vulnerable to infections, Bao added.

The public are advised to avoid direct contact with poultry and wear masks when symptoms such as headache, fever, coughing and chest congestion appear, the report said.

H7N9 is a bird flu strain first reported to have infected humans in China in March 2013. It is most likely to strike in winter and spring.

[A sudden increase in the number of human influenza A(H7N9) cases reported has been observed during December [2016] and January [2017]. However, a greater geographic spread of the virus was observed in this 5th wave, as compared to earlier waves of infection. For cases with available exposure history, most have reported prior exposure to live poultry or potentially contaminated environments, including live poultry markets (LPMs), a feature similar to earlier waves.

So far, there has been no indication of significant changes in the epidemiology of the human infections reported, no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, and no significant changes in the clinical presentation or disease outcome.
