[ProMED-mail has been monitoring the situation in Myanmar following
tropical cyclone Nargis, attempting to find reliable reports on the
health status of the population, while trying to avoid getting caught
up in political discussions. As our readers are well aware, after
mass disasters there are frequently the dangers of political agendas
clouding the information flow, with the unfortunate result of
misinformation and rumors abounding. We are very concerned about the
welfare of the population, and hope that through our direct reporting
we are able to assist in adequate, appropriate information
dissemination. We are hoping that our subscriber base in the region
will share accurate information on the actual health status of the
population, and allow for appropriate guided interventions to
mitigate further morbidity and mortality in the post disaster stage. - Mod.MPP]

Press conference on Myanmar humanitarian appeal
--------------------
Donors had responded to a flash appeal to assist victims of Cyclone
Nargis, which hit Myanmar earlier in the week, with pledges and
assistance totalling about USD 77 million, John Holmes, United
Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator and Under-Secretary-General for
Humanitarian Affairs, told correspondents at a Headquarters press
conference today [9 May 2008]

Mr. Holmes, briefing after the launch of the appeal, said the amount
included pledges that had been made today and other pledges of which
the United Nations was aware. It included some bilateral assistance
and assistance through the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

The appeal had been launched for a total of USD 187 million to cover
at least 1.5 million people for the next 6 months, with food as a
very important element, he continued. The need for food was expected to grow.

The lead donors at the moment were Japan and the United Kingdom,
which had pledged USD 10 million each, he said. In addition, USD 20
million was being allocated immediately from the Central Emergency
Response Fund to projects included the flash appeal. The amount would
be allocated in the next day or 2, to make sure that the most urgent
life-saving needs could be addressed quickly.

He described the response to the appeal as generous, pointing out
that the pledges had been made despite the fact that the countries
had not had time to study the appeal, which had been issued only a
few hours before the launch.

Mr. Holmes said a number of things had been made clear at the
conclusion of the appeal, including the huge sympathy of the
international community for the victims of the cyclone and an
awareness of on the part of everybody about the sheer scale of the
disaster that was still unfolding, with the casualty figure still
rising. In addition, there was a generous readiness to respond and a
warm welcome for the statement by the Permanent Representative of
Myanmar to the United Nations that help was welcome from any quarter,
as evidenced by the landing of a United States C-130 Hercules at
Yangon Airport on Monday [5 May 2008].

The final thing, he added, was a very strong hope that the
cooperation necessary between the international community and the
authorities in Myanmar would be as forthcoming, as flexible and as
rapid as possible to make sure that relief material and goods, as
well as humanitarian aid workers, could get in. The Permanent
Representative had made it clear at the launch that he fully
registered the messages and would pass them on to the authorities.

On the death toll, Mr. Holmes said it could be between 63 000 and 100
000, or even higher, adding that the 63 000 figure had been arrived
at by adding the official figures for the dead and missing. The
higher figure came from the strong impression of those on the ground
that the 63 000 might be an underestimate. The United Nations did not
have the information or the complete universal coverage about that
figure, but it looked reasonable to those on the ground that the 63
000 was an underestimate.

Continuing, he said the rhythm of aid delivery in Myanmar was picking
up, though not as much as the United Nations would like. The
challenge was not just to get the aid to the airport in Yangon, but
to get it onwards into the Irrawaddy delta and to the people in need.
One of the problems was that a lot of the transport in the delta
relied on local networks of boats, 80 percent of which had been
destroyed or washed away in the cyclone.

Myanmar's neighbours could play an important role in the relief
effort, and were already doing so, he said. The United Nations would
like to work closely with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and with its individual members to make sure that the right
logistical setup was in place to get aid in.

It had been disappointing to see the statement by the Myanmar
authorities that they were not ready to receive foreign aid workers,
he continued. He hoped that meant that they were not ready at the
moment, but would be in the future. A few visas had been granted to
aid workers and, as such, there was obviously not a blanket ban. The
United Nations hoped that the authorities would have an 'open house'
for international humanitarian aid workers, whether from the United
Nations or elsewhere, as quickly as they could, because that could
make a real difference.

In response to a question on how much the aid effort would have
progressed without the delays caused by the Government, he said it
was always very difficult to get an aid effort going for the first 4
or 5 days. It was, therefore, not completely unprecedented to have a
rather slow start. In the Myanmar case, though, the situation had not
been helped by the bureaucratic constraints and other problems.

Responding to another question, he said it was not impossible or
unusual for a Government to be involved in the distribution of
humanitarian assistance. There was no absolute blanket principle that
the United Nations did not allow Governments to be involved in
distribution. Medical aid from the World Health Organization (WHO)
and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) was currently being
distributed by the Myanmar Ministry of Health through its health
system, and that was perfectly normal. The current argument was
really about the degree of control and monitoring possible for the
distribution. That was where there was a need to negotiate and,
hopefully, reach agreement quickly, as the important thing was to get
the aid on the ground quickly.

Mr. Holmes told correspondents that any person or entity could
contribute to the flash appeal, not just countries.

On the situation of the emergency response team members, 2 of whom
had gotten into Myanmar while 2 had been turned away, he said that
the 2 that had been turned away were now back in Bangkok.

Asked for his opinion on possible Security Council action to pressure
the Myanmar authorities, he said that constructive pressure could be
helpful, but needed to be applied in the right way to persuade them
to be more accommodating.

Cyclone Survivors Now Racked by Disease
---------------------------------------
One in 5 children who survived in the areas hit by Cyclone Nargis is
suffering from diarrhea, according to a UNICEF official in [Yangon].
Osamu Kunii, UNICEF's chief of health and nutrition, told the
Associated Press that the number could still rise.

Veronique Terrasse, a communications officer for Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF) in Bangkok, told The Irrawaddy that her organization
was treating "many" diarrhea sufferers.

[Myanmar] will accept foreign aid but not foreign aid workers, the
foreign ministry said on Friday [9 May 2008], after a disaster rescue
team from Qatar that arrived in [Yangon] on an aid flight was turned back.

She said MSF had set up several mobile clinics, staffed by 35
helpers. Two trucks with food, fresh water and medical supplies had
arrived in the worst affected region, the Irrawaddy Delta. Outbreaks
of cholera and malaria are also being reported in the delta region,
where the cyclone created all the conditions for epidemics.

"Most of the area is covered by dirty water," said Osamu Kunii.
"There are a lot of dead bodies and the people there have very poor
access -- sometimes no access -- to clean drinking water or food."

One [Yangon] source said: "It is very difficult to bury the dead
because everywhere is flooded. We needed expert relief workers."

The World Food Program (WFP) announced that 2 trucks with 20 tonnes
of rice and 4 tonnes of high-energy biscuit, left [Yangon] for the
Irrawaddy Delta on Thursday [8 May 2008]. A total of 156 tonnes of
emergency supplies had so far been dispatched to the Delta and other
devastated areas, the WFP reported.

Meanwhile, senior officials of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations [ASEAN] at a meeting in Singapore pledged the organization's
readiness to help with aid and reconstruction.

The group suggested that [Myanmar] authorities could establish a
coordinating mechanism that could work with the international
community and aid agencies, to assess the damage and needs in the
affected areas as well as facilitate in-country distribution of
humanitarian aid, and entry and deployment of rescue and medical
personnel and equipment.

The [Myanmar] government announced on Friday [9 May 2008] that only
foreign cash and supplies are welcome, not international relief workers.

[As can be seen from the newswire in part [2] above, there are now
rumors that there has been an increase in malaria and cholera in the
post cyclone phase. What is not clear is the validity of these
rumors. Frequently in the immediate days following natural disasters
associated with flooding, vector borne diseases such as malaria are
reduced as the mosquito breeding sites have been affected by the
disaster as well, but after a period of time, the standing water does
serve to help repopulate the area with the mosquito vectors. As for
reports of diarrhea, a statement that one in 5 children (20 percent)
who survived the cyclone has diarrhea, would be more meaningful if
accompanied by information suggesting that this is an increase in
diarrheal prevalence from the pre-cyclone period; as would specific
information on the numbers of cases of cholera identified in the
affected zones. ProMED-mail would be very appreciative if we could
receive accurate information/estimations of the health situation in
Myanmar from knowledgeable sources.

InSTEDD -- Innovative Support to Emergencies Diseases and Disasters

medical facilities in Myanmar, from central referral hospital down to
sub-rural clinic that can be used for planning of activities in
Myanmar. This information was put together by people at Direct Relief
using WHO data, and then was further refined by people at Google.org.
