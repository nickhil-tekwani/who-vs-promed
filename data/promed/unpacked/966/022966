Health-care worker with Ebola flew on commercial flight a day before being diagnosed
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second health-care worker diagnosed with Ebola had a fever of 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit [37.5 C] before boarding a passenger jet on Mon [13 Oct 2014], a day before she reported symptoms of the virus and was tested, according to public health officials. Even though there appeared to be little risk for the other people on that flight, she should not have traveled that way, Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a news conference Wednesday. "She should not have flown on a commercial airline," Frieden said.

This health-care worker flew on a Frontier Airlines flight from Cleveland to Dallas-Fort Worth with more than 130 other passengers. She did not have nausea or vomit on the plane, so the risk to anyone around her is "extremely low," Frieden said. The health-care worker was not named by public health officials... She was part of a team that had cared for Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who flew to Texas and was diagnosed with Ebola last month [September 2014], during his hospitalization in Dallas. Duncan died last week. [A] nurse who also cared for Duncan, was diagnosed with Ebola on Sun [12 Oct 2014] and was in good condition Wed [15 Oct 2014], the hospital said.

[This 2nd nurse], who flew from Dallas to Cleveland on Fri [10 Oct 2014], flew back to Texas on Mon [13 Oct 2014][, a day after [the 1st nurse] was diagnosed. She reported a fever on Tue [14 Oct 2014] and was isolated and tested for Ebola. Still, the fact that she boarded a commercial flight raises the question of how much the other 50 health-care workers who entered Duncan's room could have traveled or moved around in recent days. The CDC recommends controlled movement on private flights or vehicles for people who may have been exposed to Ebola, Frieden said.

Officials with the CDC confirmed with FOX 4 Wed [15 Oct 2014] that they told ... the Dallas health worker it was safe for her to fly Mon [13 Oct 2014]. [She] had called and asked if it was OK to fly since she had a low grade fever at the time. However, a top federal health official said Wed [15 Oct 2014] that Vinson should not have flown on a commercial plane. The event could raise concerns among travelers that health officials aren't doing everything possible to contain the virus. News that [she] flew on a commercial flight raised fear among airline investors that the scare over the virus could cause travelers to avoid flying. Shares of the biggest U.S. airlines tumbled between 4 percent and 6 percent in afternoon trading. The overall market slumped on concerns about slowing global economic growth.

Frontier Airlines announced that public-health officials were notifying the 132 passengers on Monday night's [13 Oct 2014] Flight 1143 from Cleveland to Dallas-Fort Worth. The airline's crew reports that the woman showed no symptoms during the flight. Robert Mann, an aviation consultant and former American Airlines executive, said that if the 2nd worker showed no symptoms on her Frontier flight, the decision to notify other passengers was made out of extra caution. "But all that rational thought aside, it may cause some people to delay trips," he said... - more

[The nurse had to get back to work in Texas. She did the right thing by notifying her below threshold fever to CDC, and was cleared to fly.
We are not told whether hospitals in Ohio have the same capacity to handle Ebola as the newly reorganized Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. - Mod.JW
