- Mosquito control (Keys, Monroe county, Florida). 21 Aug 2020. (Reported) Florida officials plan to release 750 million genetically modified mosquitoes into the Florida Keys over the next 2 years as a way to prevent diseases. The modified mosquito -- named OX5034 -- can produce female offspring who die at the larval stage.

[2] Prior Zika and severe dengue

Zika virus infection enhances future risk of severe dengue disease
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leah C. Katzelnick, Cesar Narvaez, Sonia Arguello, Brenda Lopez Mercado, Damaris Collado, Oscarlett Ampie, et al.

Dengue and Zika virus epidemics have been lapping each other around the globe. These are closely related mosquito-borne viruses with about 40% homology within the envelope protein. We know that subsequent dengue infections bring a risk of antibody-dependent disease enhancement. Whereas emphasis has been placed on how prior dengue immunity affects Zika infection, little is known about how prior Zika immunity may affect dengue disease. Katzelnick et al. have been following a well-characterized and established pediatric cohort in Nicaragua who were serially exposed to both flaviviruses in recent years (see the Perspective by Clapham). This study shows not only that a previous history of just one round of dengue is a problem but also that prior Zika immunity creates an increased risk for severe dengue virus serotype 2 infection. By contrast, multiple infections raise antibodies to protective levels.

Abstract
----------
The Zika pandemic sparked intense interest in whether immune interactions among dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1-4) extend to the closely related Zika virus (ZIKV). We investigated prospective pediatric cohorts in Nicaragua that experienced sequential DENV1-3 (2004 to 2015), Zika (2016 to 2017), and DENV2 (2018 to 2020) epidemics. Risk of symptomatic DENV2 infection and severe disease was elevated by one prior ZIKV infection, one prior DENV infection, or one prior DENV infection followed by one ZIKV infection, compared with being flavivirus-na√Øve. By contrast, multiple prior DENV infections reduced dengue risk. Further, although high preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers protected against DENV1, DENV3, and ZIKV disease, intermediate titers induced by previous ZIKV or DENV infection enhanced future risk of DENV2 disease and severity, as well as DENV3 severity. The observation that prior ZIKV infection can modulate dengue disease severity like a DENV serotype poses challenges to development of dengue and Zika vaccines.

[The possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus disease by pre-existing Zika virus antibody has been a subject of speculation in the past. The above study in Guatemala provides evidence that ADE of dengue 2 infections can occur in Zika virus immune individuals. This study is another outstanding example of the benefits that derive from long-term (decades-long) proactive studies of a population, in this instance in Guatemala, that Dr. Eva Harris, her lab, and her colleagues in Guatemala have been carrying out. - Mod.TY]
