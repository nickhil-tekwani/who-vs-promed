Health Departments in Ohio are monitoring 44 residents who have a travel history to countries with Ebola cases, Ohio officials said Monday [22 Mar 2021].

The deadly virus emerged in 2014 in West Africa, infecting people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. A new epidemic was declared in Guinea, and there are also currently people infected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At least 9 people have died.

Ohio is not alone in monitoring people with travel histories. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said health departments were quarantining 11 people who had come to the state from the affected countries.

"They assess their exposure risk, they educate them about what symptoms they might have, and they quarantine those at high risk for 21 days, though we have not had a single person in Kentucky that is at high risk," he said last week.

Travelers from the impacted countries are being "funnelled" to 6 US airports "out of an abundance of caution," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC said the administration's goal is to "end these outbreaks before they grow into epidemics," a [26 Feb 2021] statement said.

3 cases had been confirmed, which was the 1st time the disease made an appearance since the 2014-2016 outbreak. During those 2 years, 11 000 died and 28 000 cases were confirmed, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

A WHO Investigation found a nurse in Guinea died from the virus on [28 Jan 2021]. 6 people who attended her funeral reported symptoms soon after, and 2 more people died.

In Guinea, 3632 people have been vaccinated for Ebola since [23 Feb 2021], a tool that officials didn't have 5 years ago.

The White House announced on [16 Feb 2021] officials are working with leaders in Guinea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, and Liberia to limit the spread to neighboring countries.

White House Chief of Staff Ronald Klein, formerly the Ebola Czar during the Obama administration, has pledged the Biden administration will do "whatever we can to keep the latest Ebola outbreaks from escalating." On [15 Mar 2021], he described the reports that an Ebola survivor may have sexually transmitted the virus in Guinea 5 years after recovery as "stunning" news.

The Ohio Department of Health said Monday [22 Mar 2021] the state will monitor people for 21 days.

"Ohio is currently monitoring 44 travelers who have returned to Ohio from Ebola-affected countries," spokesperson Alicia Shoults told Spectrum News 1. "None have reported symptoms."

Ebola, classified as a level-4 organism at the CDC, is a deadly virus that's spread through body fluids, or via objects such as bedding. It can also be transmitted to humans from infected bats or primates. According to the CDC, symptoms appear anywhere between 2 days-3 weeks after infection.

[This quarantine action is in response to the new US CDC rules for Congo DR and Guinea travelers.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new public health requirements for US visitors who have recently been in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or Guinea because of concerns about Ebola that take effect 4 Mar 2021, to address Ebola concerns, the agency said.

"Travelers who have been in the 2 central African countries within the past 21 days must fly to New York-JFK, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington Dulles, Newark or Los Angeles. The CDC will require airlines to collect and transmit passenger information electronically to the agency for public health follow-up for all passengers who have been in the 2 countries who are boarding a flight to the United States."

The Democratic Republic of Congo released its last confirmed Ebola patients from the treatment centers on Monday [22 Mar 2021], health authorities said.

The country has begun a 42-day countdown to declaring DR Congo free of the virus.

The release of 6 patients on Monday [22 Mar 2021] from the treatment centers in the North Kivu region could mark the end of a month-long resurgence of the 2018-20 epidemic which killed more than 2200 people before it was initially declared over in June 2020.

The World Health Organization confirmed that the last patient was discharged from a treatment center in Katwa yesterday [22 Mar 2021].

Congo-Kinshasa: What went wrong in the DR Congo's latest Ebola outbreak?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the Democratic Republic of Congo's largest-ever outbreak of Ebola first emerged in the north-east of the country in 2018, it appeared that it would remain small and relatively isolated.

A government that had successfully contained 9 previous outbreaks since Ebola was first identified in the country in 1976, first looked set to beat back the one which erupted in North Kivu province.

Having just successfully declared an end to an outbreak in the north-western Equateur province after only 3 months, the government launched -- with international help -- what a World Health Organization (WHO) study later called "the fastest, best-equipped, and best-funded" fightback in the history of Ebola responses.

But it took nearly 2 years to contain the North Kivu outbreak, a period during which 3481 people were infected, of whom 2299 died. The 2018-2020 outbreak was the world's 2nd-largest after the West Africa outbreak of 2014-2016.

What went wrong?
A study just published by the UK-based Overseas Development Institute and produced with input by Research Initiatives for Social Development (RISD-DRC), based in the DR Congo, provides some answers, and some lessons for the future [see reference below].

The study says the initial response from the DRC government and the WHO "came tantalizingly close to containing the virus during the outbreak's early weeks."

But its eventual containment came more slowly than first expected, and only after "significant, and belated, corrections to the response's leadership, the coordination model, and the response strategy."

After carrying out more than 120 interviews and examining other studies, a 62-page institute report cites as among the reasons it took longer than expected to end the outbreak:
- the people of North Kivu were unfamiliar with Ebola, previous episodes having occurred far away;
- local health structures were weak, with doctors and nurses lacking basic knowledge of Ebola and clinics lacking equipment, including personal protective equipment;
- the region has gone through decades of conflict -- the study named 14 armed groups scattered through North Kivu; and
- distrust of the government, other outside agencies and even aid workers and researchers, among local people and medical staff.

"For decades the Grand-Nord (area of North Kivu) has been under attack by foreign and local armed groups... and by a national military presence that is perceived as a foreign, occupying force," the report says. "The population is often caught in violence between irregular armed groups and government forces engaged in counter-insurgency.

The DR Congo's government and the WHO are criticised for first using a response plan developed for a different environment:

"At the heart of the poor context analysis was a lack of sensitivity to the depth of hostility in the Grand-Nord of North Kivu for the central government and its representatives, with whom WHO worked closely."

The report adds: "The population's scepticism for authority and distrust of officialdom fairly quickly manifested itself in resistance to the top-down, fear-based public health messaging employed by Ebola response teams at the source of the outbreak."

The institute's study reveals that money was also at the root of community suspicion and resentment: not too little of it, but too much of it. The Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) and the Congolese National Police (PNC) received "generous salary top-ups paid by the international response budget," the report says.

"The introduction of a billion-dollar response into an area characterised by a complex humanitarian crisis where basic needs are perennially underfunded helped fuel real and perceived instances of waste, corruption, and fraud, commonly referred to as 'Ebola business'." The report cites other studies as finding that this contributed to sexual exploitation and abuse.

"'Ebola business' was a perception among affected communities that resources marshalled for the response inordinately benefitted authority figures and response providers rather than victims, survivors, and their communities," the report adds.

"Inflated payments for armed escorts, medical responders, and community volunteers were cited by many as key components of the Ebola economy and served as a perverse incentive to continue the outbreak rather than end it.

"That the outbreak was deliberately stoked and/or the response debilitated in order to prolong 'Ebola business' was emphatically asserted in interviews, including with senior UN security and political officials."

In addition to addressing these problems, the report recommends that in future a more inclusive and coordinated response is needed to fight Ebola, especially in areas of conflict or humanitarian need.

An institute news release quoted Nicholas Crawford, the lead author of the report, as concluding: "In future outbreaks in complex and conflict settings, there's no room for a 'go-it-alone' approach."

"Key messages [edited]
-------------
"Attempts to get the UN Country Team and humanitarian operations in country to work more closely with the government and WHO led to the creation of parallel coordination systems. In future outbreaks, there's no room for a 'go-it-alone' approach. Leadership and coordination structures must work together from the outset of the response and avoid parallel structures and dual-leadership models.

"This was the 1st Ebola outbreak in a conflict area. Yet, at the beginning, the response structure was airlifted from the 9th outbreak, which was not in a conflict setting. This did not take into account context-specific approaches, including with community engagement, security, and financial management. Nor did it build on existing health and community structures already in place in country. For future responses, particularly in complex settings like eastern DRC, context analysis must be done from the start, and existing structures used.

"One of the key questions during the outbreak was whether the response should be treated as a public health response, a humanitarian response, or a health security response. By and large, it was initially treated as a health security response, which meant that many of the everyday humanitarian needs, such as food and water, went unmet, while other diseases, including cholera, measles, and malaria, continued unabated. Future Ebola outbreaks should be dealt with as part of a community's overall health needs -- now that there are successful vaccines and therapeutics -- and emphasis should be put on building better and more sustainable public health structures.

"The 10th Ebola outbreak was the 1st time the IASC [UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee] Scale-Up for Infectious Diseases was put into effect. However, it wasn't activated until almost one year after the outbreak began -- in part because there are no trigger points written into the Scale-Up. Before another large-scale response is required, triggers for the activation of the Scale-Up that aren't reliant on the good will of the agencies involved should be decided. These could include thresholds based on the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the outbreak area, the deterioration of security in the affected areas, trends in incidence or geographic expansion, spread within urban or mobile populations, or cross borders or simultaneous outbreaks elsewhere in the country that will result in reduced capacity.

"The initial focus on disease eradication above all else ignored many of the other issues in the area and actually led to increased cases of Ebola. Community resistance, armed violence, and what became known as 'Ebola business' waged out of control. High payments made to doctors, security personnel, and others in the response created perverse incentives for the response to continue. Instead, future responses that take place in complex contexts should build community acceptance, by engaging through recognised community structures, pursuing a security by acceptance rather than security by protection approach, implementing transparent financing of the response, and offering payments in line with area pay scales.

"On [1 Aug 2018], the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) declared the country's 10th Ebola outbreak in North Kivu. By the time the outbreak was declared over on [25 Jun 2020], 3481 people had been infected, of whom 2299 died -- the largest ever outbreak in DRC and the 2nd largest in the world after the West African outbreak of 2014-2016 (WHO, 2020).

"Overall leadership and coordination of the EVD response was in the hands of the Government of DRC, which brought significant technical and operational experience to the task, having successfully contained 9 previous outbreaks in the country since Ebola was first identified there in 1976. What first seemed like it might be another small and relatively isolated outbreak quickly grew in size and complexity, challenging the government's ability to contain the virus and testing its leadership and coordination capacities.

"This case study examines the effectiveness of international leadership and coordination in supporting the Ebola outbreak response and identifies lessons and recommendations to inform similar future responses. It considers the extent to which international partners, through their evolving leadership and coordination structures, enabled and shaped the government-led response. It also aims to draw lessons from how international partners deployed their expertise and assets in order to help shape future responses -- particularly in contexts where a public health emergency overlaps with an ongoing, complex humanitarian crisis.]
