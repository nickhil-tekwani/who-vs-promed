Viet Nam: Sick Cambodian Woman Being Tested for Avian Influenza
---------------------------------------------------------------
A 25-year-old Cambodian woman suspected of having avian influenza is
seriously ill in a hospital in southern Viet Nam, and tests are under way
to test for the virus that has killed 10 Vietnamese recently, doctors said
on Saturday [29 Jan 2005].
A doctor at the General Hospital in Kien Giang province bordering Cambodia
told Reuters that the woman was brought in on Friday morning with a high
fever. "Her condition is critical, she is on a respirator now," said the
doctor, adding that samples had been sent to the Pasteur Institute in
southern Ho Chi Minh City for testing and results were expected in 2-3 days.
"Cambodian people often come over to our hospitals here, but this is the
1st case of suspected bird flu so far," said the doctor in Kien Giang's
capital, Rach Gia, 155 miles southwest of Ho Chi Minh City. If confirmed,
she would be the 1st person from Cambodia found to be infected by the H5N1
virus in 2005.
The virus has killed at least 42 people since 1st erupting in Asia at the
end of 2003, including 12 who died in Thailand in 2004.
The World Health Organization has said the avian influenza virus might
already have infected people in countries neighboring Viet Nam such as
Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, but these countries lack the infrastructure or
capacity to conduct necessary surveillance. Outbreaks of the virus, which
kills about 80 percent of people it infects, were last detected in Cambodia
in September 2004. No human casualties have been reported there.
On Friday [28 Jan 2005], doctors said avian influenza has killed a man in
northern Vietnam while 4 others were being treated for the virus, bringing
Vietnam's total number of infections to 16 in the latest wave of the virus,
which started in early December 2004. Of those infected, 10 have died since
30 Dec 2004, and one has been discharged from a Hanoi hospital after he
recovered. Most of the victims are believed to have caught the virus from
infected poultry, but doctors fear it could mutate into a form that is
easily passed between people, unleashing a global human flu pandemic that
could kill millions.

Viet Nam; One more Death and Suspected Case ex Cambodia
---------------------------------------------------
On Friday [28 Jan 2005], a patient who lives in a Cambodian town adjacent
to Vietnam's southern Kien Giang province was admitted to the provincial
hospital of Kien Giang with avian influenza symptoms such as high
temperature and pneumonia.
Since 28 Dec 2004, a total of 16 people in Vietnam have been reported to
have contracted the H5N1 virus, of whom 10 (8 from the southern region and
2 from the northern region) have died. Altogether, 300 avian influenza
patients in the country have died since the disease [appeared] in December
2003. Since January 2005 [sic -- 2004?], bird flu has stricken 28 cities
and provinces in Viet Nam, including 6 in the northern region, killing and
leading to the forced culling of over 828 000 fowl, according to the
country's Department of Animal Health.

Viet Nam: Death of 13-year-old girl; Suspected Case from Cambodia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A 13-year-old girl has died from bird flu in southern Vietnam, where tests
are under way to determine whether the virus has also infected a
25-year-old woman from Cambodia who is seriously ill, doctors said on
Saturday [29 Jan 2005]. The girl's death brought to 11 the death toll in
Vietnam from the deadly H5N1 poultry virus in recent weeks.
A doctor at the General Hospital in Kien Giang province bordering Cambodia
told Reuters that the 25-year-old woman was brought in on Friday morning
[28 Jan 2005] with a high fever. "Her condition is critical, she is on a
respirator now," said the doctor, adding that samples had been sent to the
Pasteur Institute in southern Ho Chi Minh City for testing and results were
expected in 2-3 days.
"Cambodian people often come over to our hospitals, but this case is the
1st suspected of bird flu so far," said the doctor in Kien Giang's capital,
Rach Gia, 250 km (155 miles) southwest of Ho Chi Minh City. If confirmed,
she would be the 1st person from Cambodia found to be infected by the H5N1
virus in 2005.
The 13-year-old girl, who had been confirmed by doctors as infected by
avian influenza virus, died late on Friday [28 Jan 2005] in Ho Chi Minh
City's Paediatric Hospital No.1, said a hospital official. The girl from
the southern province of Dong Thap was taken to hospital on 22 Jan 2005,
one day after her mother died of avian influenza.
Officials said the mother [acquired the infection by swimming] in water
used to dispose of poultry. The death of the girl brought to 43 the number
who have died since the virus 1st erupted in Asia at the end of 2003. Of
those 31 were in Vietnam and 12 in Thailand.
The World Health Organization has said the bird flu virus might already
have infected people in countries neighbouring Vietnam such as Cambodia,
Laos and Myanmar, but those countries lack the infrastructure or capacity
to conduct necessary surveillance. Outbreaks of the virus, which kills
about 80 percent of people it infects, were last detected in Cambodia in
September 2004. No human casualty has been reported there.
On Friday, doctors said bird flu has killed a man in northern Vietnam while
3 others were being treated for the virus, bringing Vietnam's total number
of infections to 16 in the latest wave of the virus, which started in early
December 2004. Of those infected, 11 have died since 30 Dec 2004 [and one]
has been discharged from a Hanoi hospital after he recovered. Most of the
victims are believed to have caught the virus from infected poultry, but
doctors fear it could mutate into a form that is easily passed between
people, unleashing a global human flu pandemic that could kill millions.

[These reports appear to be the 1st indication of an extension in the range
of human cases of avian influenza virus infection in the current East Asia
outbreak -- if the tests on the Cambodian woman prove positive and it is
confirmed that she contracted infection in Cambodia before she arrived in
Viet Nam. Up to the present, no human cases had been contracted outside of
Thailand or Viet Nam. - Mod.CP]
