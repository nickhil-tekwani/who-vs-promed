The bacterium found in the 3 residents from the Beit Dafna [facility for disabled people] in Holon who are hospitalized at Wolfson Hospital is _Clostridium perfringens_; this was first published tonight (Tuesday [3 May 2022]) in the main edition. It has not yet been officially proven that the source of the bacterium is in the food received by the inmates at the home. It was reported that 3 inmates from the home, from the Eckstein home network, died at the hospital, and the suspicion is that it was food poisoning.

The condition of the 3 residents who are still hospitalized is stable. The source of the bacterium is usually found in chicken and meat products served from an institutional kitchen such as catering or restaurant. It usually causes diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, and nausea, but the disease is relatively mild. Mortality from the bacterium is rare, except in cases of immunocompromised adults.

Now, the families of the residents at the Beit Dafna home are facing the difficult reality in which the peace of their loved ones is not guaranteed. [LK], who previously cared for a resident, told "First Edition" today [4 May 2022] about the shocking conditions to which she was exposed: poor rooms, needs on the floor, food that is not fit for human consumption, and a lack of staff. However, others said their family members are sheltering at the place because they trust the home and feel that their relatives are in good hands.

The Ministry of Welfare revealed the unusual and serious incident at a home for people with disabilities in Holon: 3 residents, with complex medical backgrounds, have died in the last 2 days, and the initial suspicion is that some food contamination they consumed there led to their deaths. The Ministry of Health began investigating the circumstances of the cases.

[This posting suggests _C. perfringens_ as the cause of these illnesses. Unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness, in which the preformed toxin is ingested, in _C. perfringens_ disease, the enterotoxin is formed _in situ_ in the gastrointestinal tract. The following discussion was obtained from a previous version of the FDA Bad Bug Book (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf):

"1. Name of the organism
_Clostridium perfringens_ is an anaerobic, Gram positive, spore-forming rod. It is widely distributed in the environment and frequently occurs in the intestines of humans and many domestic and feral animals. Spores of the organism persist in soil, sediments, and areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.

"2. Nature of acute disease
Perfringens food poisoning is the term used to describe the common foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_. A more serious but rare illness is also caused by ingesting food contaminated with type C strains. The latter illness is known as enteritis necroticans or pig-bel disease.

"3. Nature of disease
The common form of _C. perfringens_ poisoning is characterized by intense abdominal cramps and diarrhea, which begin 8-22 hours after consumption of foods containing large numbers of those _C. perfringens_ bacteria capable of producing the food poisoning toxin. The illness is usually over within 24 hours, but less severe symptoms may persist in some individuals for 1-2 weeks. A few deaths have been reported as a result of dehydration and other complications.

Necrotic enteritis (pig-bel) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often fatal. This disease also begins as a result of ingesting large numbers of the causative bacteria in contaminated foods. Deaths from necrotic enteritis are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA.

Infective dose: The symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers (greater than 1 000 000) vegetative cells. Toxin production in the digestive tract (or in test tubes) is associated with sporulation. This disease is a food infection; only one episode has ever implied the possibility of intoxication (that is, disease from preformed toxin).

"4. Diagnosis of human illness
Perfringens poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms and the typical delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the toxin in the feces of patients. Bacteriological confirmation can also be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the causative bacteria in implicated foods or in the feces of patients.

"5. Associated foods
In most instances, the actual cause of poisoning by _C. perfringens_ is temperature abuse of prepared foods. Small numbers of the organisms are often present after cooking and multiply to food poisoning levels during cool-down and storage of prepared foods. Meats, meat products, and gravy are the foods most frequently implicated.

"6. Relative frequency of disease
Perfringens poisoning is one of the most commonly reported foodborne illnesses in the USA. There were 1162 cases in 1981, in 28 separate outbreaks. At least 10-20 outbreaks have been reported annually in the USA for the past 2 decades. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of persons are affected. It is probable that many outbreaks go unreported because the implicated foods or patient feces are not tested routinely for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin. CDC estimates that about 10 000 actual cases occur annually in the USA.

"7. Course of disease and complications
The disease generally lasts 24 hours. In the elderly or infirm, symptoms may last 1-2 weeks. Complications and/or death only very rarely occur.

"8. Target populations
Institutional feeding (such as school cafeterias, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, etc.) where large quantities of food are prepared several hours before serving is the most common circumstance in which perfringens poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most frequent victims of perfringens poisoning. Except in the case of pig-bel syndrome, complications are few in persons under 30 years of age. Elderly persons are more likely to experience prolonged or severe symptoms.

"9. Food analysis
Standard bacteriological culturing procedures are used to detect the organism in implicated foods and in feces of patients. Serological assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces of patients and for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. The procedures take 1-3 days."

The FDA discussion notes that deaths from necrotic enteritis (pig-bel syndrome) are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is quite rare. The following is a paper regarding a case of pig-bel:

Gui L, Subramony C, Fratkin J, et al. Fatal enteritis necroticans (pigbel) in a diabetic adult. Mod Pathol. 2002; 15(1): 66-70; http://www.nature.com/modpathol/journal/v15/n1/full/3880491a.html.

"Abstract
---------
Enteritis necroticans is a segmental necrotizing infection of the jejunum and ileum caused by _Clostridium perfringens_, type C. The disease occurs sporadically in parts of Asia, Africa, and the South Pacific, where it primarily affects children with severe protein malnutrition. The disease is extremely rare in developed countries, where it has been seen primarily in diabetics. Two cases have previously been reported in the United States, one in a child with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. A 66-year-old woman with a 12-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus developed severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea after eating a meal of turkey sausage. She died unattended at home. An autopsy showed peritonitis and segmental necrosis of the jejunum and ileum. Microscopic examination showed Gram-positive club-shaped bacilli consistent with clostridia coating a necrotic mucosa. Products of cpa and cpb genes of _C. perfringens_, type C were identified in the necrotic jejunum by polymerase chain reaction amplification."
