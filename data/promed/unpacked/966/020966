Distemper outbreak strikes Windsor-Essex raccoons
-------------------------------------------------
Authorities and wildlife experts are urging the Windsor-Essex public not to worry about a rising number of incidents with strange-acting raccoons: The poor scavengers are suffering from distemper, not rabies.

But that holds small relief for a Tecumseh resident, who encountered a large female raccoon wandering weirdly in her backyard Tuesday afternoon. "It was really slow," the resident said. "She was kind of dragging herself and wincing, really sluggish."
She said she tried to scare the raccoon away by making a commotion -- banging her deck with a stick, slapping a window with the palm of her hand. "She caught sight of me and came right up," she said. "She was very docile, laid on her side. She was totally ignoring (the noise)." After taking refuge indoors, [the lady] contacted the Wings Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, which sent someone to capture the animal.

This spring has seen an increase in incidents involving diseased raccoons across the city and county. People have been contacting Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) about the normally nocturnal omnivores staggering around in broad daylight, behaving in an unnaturally fearless and lethargic manner.

OPP spokesman Sgt. Rick Tonial said some of the afflicted raccoons have been so passive that officers have contained them by simply covering them with overturned recycling boxes until the arrival of animal services. "It's almost like they have a depressive, 'don't-give-a-care' attitude," Tonial said. But Tonial added that the public shouldn't call OPP about the sad raccoons. The proper organizations to contact are Wings, Erie Wildlife Rescue, or the humane society. Melanie Coulter, executive director of the Windsor-Essex County Humane Society, said her agency has taken in 59 raccoons so far this year -- more than 3 times the number over the same period last year [2011]. "We've definitely seen more cases than usual," she said. The humane society euthanizes the raccoons it receives.

The reason for the raccoons' odd behaviour is simple: They have a terminal illness. Distemper is a viral infection similar to human measles, affecting an animal's respiratory, intestinal and finally neurological systems. It's almost always fatal for raccoons.

Coulter stressed that although the disease is highly contagious among animals, it can't be passed to humans. But she added that raccoons with distemper are still capable of sudden aggression, especially if they feel cornered. As well, the symptoms of distemper are similar to those associated with rabies -- and the difference can't be determined without lab testing.

Nancy Phillips of Wings said raccoons with distemper in later stages develop unsteady gaits, crusted eyes, mucous discharge from the nose and mouth and "rotten-looking" fur.

The public is advised to keep their distance from raccoons no matter how weak and harmless they appear. "They're still wild animals," Coulter said. [And they still might have rabies. - Mod.JW].

Phillips said raccoons in the early stages of the disease are still mobile. "They're showing signs, but they're not sick enough to be caught easily," she said. "Always use your brain, not your heart."


The principal of St. William Catholic Elementary School in Emeryville, said a warning about a sick raccoon in the school's area on Monday [7 May 2012] afternoon prompted him to keep students indoors during recess. Later that day, the principal spotted the raccoon creeping around the school's parking lot. "We kept an eye on it and made sure nobody walked in that area," he recounted on Tuesday [8 May 2012]. "It was kind of slowly going from car to car." The raccoon eventually tottered off toward some residential properties.

Anyone who sees a raccoon with signs of distemper is encouraged to call Wings Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre or the Humane Society.

[In March 2012, 2 months ago, there was a report of a distemper outbreak in raccoons from another area of Ontario (see ProMED post 20120316.1072492).

As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. In raccoons, distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly.' Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear of humans and other animals and they fall into stupor and may become slower, but they show profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting and odd vocalization.

It is very important to make sure to keep the [rabies & distemper] vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up to date.
