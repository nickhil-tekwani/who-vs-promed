The fatal illness reported in Somalia has some similarity to
epidemics reported in neighbouring Ethiopia - Epidemic Dropsy. This is
a syndrome caused by tainting of cooking oil with the Mexican poppy,
_Argemone mexicana_, that is now grown in Ethiopia, India, U.S. and
India (and perhaps elsewhere). Epidemics have been reported in South
Africa as well as Ethiopia.

The syndrome is usually associated with G.I. symptoms (diarrhea and
vomiting) but presents with continuous or intermittent fevers and
bilateral symmetrical pitting edema and burning paresthesias of the
legs. The edema is a result of a capillary leak syndrome that can
progress to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, cough, dyspnea and
death.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Joffe for his contribution on a possible
cause for the outbreak in Somalia. This outbreak has affected more
than 90 people with 53 deaths and has been characterized by "fever for
one to 2 months, a high pulse rate, occasionally sore throat, and
progressive swelling of joints and limbs including pain."

ProMed-mail has previously posted reports on epidemic dropsy: see
Epidemic dropsy - India (UP): mustard oil susp. 20050207.0412.
Epidemic dropsy is an intoxication with benzophenanthridine alkaloids,
sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine, present in argemone oil, mainly
derived from the seeds of _Argemone mexicana_ (Mexican prickly poppy),
that has adulterated cooking oil, usually mustard oil
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10621875). Several outbreaks of
epidemic dropsy have occurred in the past in India as well as in
Mauritius, Fiji Island, and South Africa
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9189656).

More information concerning the clinical picture and epidemiology of
the Somali outbreak would be greatly appreciated.
