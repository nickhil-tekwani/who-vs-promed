A routine government safety review of the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
revealed 12 deaths in Japanese children who were taking it, but a US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel concluded today that the deaths were
not related to it.ï¿½
The Associated Press (AP) quoted Dr. Robert Nelson, chairman of the FDA's
Pediatrics Advisory Committee, as saying, "If we ever have a pandemic of avian
flu, which is a debatable point, people want to know that they have a drug
that will not cause more harm than the flu itself. There is no evidence that
this will."
The committee unanimously agreed that the drug's label does not need a warning
related to the children's deaths, the Associated Press (AP) reported. However,
the panel did say that information about serious skin reactions should be
added to the label. Oseltamivir, currently regarded as the best available drug
for preventing or treating a potential pandemic strain of influenza, is used
by more people in Japan than anywhere else. Many countries are stockpiling the
medication in case H5N1 avian flu triggers a human flu pandemic.
The FDA revealed yesterday that a legally required safety review for pediatric
drugs had identified the deaths in Japanese children taking oseltamivir. The
advisory committee discussed the report at a meeting today. In a statement on
its Web site, the FDA said the children's deaths appear to be part of a wave
of influenza-related encephalitis and encephalopathy cases in Japanese
children that began in the mid-1990s, before oseltamivir was approved. "Based
on the information available to us, we cannot conclude that there is a causal
relationship between Tamiflu and the reported pediatric deaths," the statement
said.
The safety review identified neurologic and psychiatric problems such as
delirium, hallucinations, abnormal behavior, convulsions, and encephalitis,
nearly all of them (and all 12 deaths) in Japanese children. "In many of these
cases, a relationship to Tamiflu was difficult to assess because of the use of
other medications, presence of other medical conditions, and/or lack of
adequate detail in the reports," the FDA said. The agency said that since the
mid-1990s there have been many reports of flu-associated encephalitis or
encephalopathy in children: "These reports originated primarily from Japan
where pediatricians described a pattern of rapid onset of fever, accompanied
by convulsions and altered level of consciousness, progressing to coma within
a few days of the onset of flu symptoms. This syndrome frequently resulted in
death or significant neurologic sequelae."
These reports prompted the launching of nationwide surveillance for such cases
in Japan before oseltamivir was approved for treatment of flu, the FDA
said. "Review of the available information on the safety of Tamiflu in
pediatric patients suggests that the increased reports of neuropsychiatric
events in Japanese children are most likely related to an increased awareness
of influenza-associated encephalopathy, increased access to Tamiflu in that
population, and a coincident period of intensive monitoring [of] adverse
events," the statement said.
The FDA said its oseltamivir review "also identified severe skin reactions
(like allergic reactions) in some pediatric patients. These events were not
all reported in Japanese children and have also been reported in adults.
Severe skin reactions in all age groups are currently being reviewed in more
detail." The AP said the FDA staff recommended adding information to the
drug's label about potential skin reactions.
The advisory panel asked the FDA staff to give an update about a year from now
on adverse events related to oseltamivir and to provide a full report in 2
years, according to the AP.
An official with Roche, manufacturer of oseltamivir, told Bloomberg News that
the 12 deaths represented a rate of about 1 death per million Japanese
children treated. "The scientific evidence is that neuro-psychiatric events
are no more common among people on Tamiflu than those not being treated," said
David Reddy, head of Roche Holding AG's virology unit.
A Roche statement said 24.5 million Japanese have taken oseltamivir since
2001, out of a total of about 33 million people who have used it worldwide.
The company said flu-related death rates in children treated with the drug are
60-90 percent lower than in those not treated.

[The FDA Panel statement provides a convenient point to disconnect this thread
until the Panel provides their update in one year's time and a full report 2
years from now. However, in the interim, it would be interesting to learn why
the Japanese children's deaths appeared to be part of a wave of influenza-
related encephalitis and encephalopathy cases that began in the mid-1990s,
before oseltamivir was approved. - Mod.CP]
