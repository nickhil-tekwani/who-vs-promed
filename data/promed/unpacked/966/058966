Genetic traces of a virus linked to an animal brain disease have been
isolated in the blood of a schizophrenic patient. The study results "may
indicate that the virus can also persist in human beings, as it can in
animals," conclude investigators at the Universitat Tubingen in Tubingen,
Germany.
Borna disease virus (BDV) triggers a neurological disorder found in animals
such as horses and cats. One 1995 report stated that the same virus had
been found in the blood of psychiatric patients. However, that finding
remains uncertain, the German team say, since "the detection of BDV... in
blood seems to be difficult."
The Tubingen researchers may now have stronger evidence of human BDV
infection, however. They report finding BDV-specific genetic material in
the blood of a 47-year-old schizophrenic. A series of tests were conducted
to "further rule out" the possibility of laboratory contamination. The
authors caution that "the presence of BDV in blood does not, however, prove
that BDV causes psychiatric symptoms."
