[The causal organism of European foulbrood of honey bees is the bacterium _Melissococcus plutonius_. The identification of its presence by the observation of signs of disease in the field is unreliable. The most usual and obvious sign is the death of larvae shortly before they are due to be sealed in their cells, but this may be for reasons other than European foulbrood. Most infected colonies display few visible signs, which themselves often quickly abate spontaneously before the end of each active season. Infection remains enzootic within individual colonies because of mechanical contamination of the honeycombs by the durable organism. Recurrences of disease can therefore be expected in subsequent years. The disease is widely distributed worldwide and is an increasing problem in some areas.
