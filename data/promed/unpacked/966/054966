A North Queensland university student who contracted meningococcal
disease on campus is expected to recover. The assurance comes after an
18 year old medical student was found dead in his room at the Catholic
College at James Cook University in Townsville on Wednesday night [27
Jul 2011]. Then a friend who lived on the same floor at the college
also started showing symptoms of the disease and was admitted to
Townsville Hospital on Friday [29 Jul 2011].

Queensland Health's public health medical officer in Townsville, Dr
Steven Donohue, said that he visited the student last night [31 Jul
2011]. "He's going to be fine," Dr Donohue told the ABC. "Fortunately
he presented very early."

Queensland Health has offered clearance antibiotics to those who had
close contact with the 2 students.

A 17 month old boy has become the latest person to fall ill with
meningococcal [disease] in Queensland's north following the death of a
university student last week [27 Jul 2011].

Queensland Health confirmed the toddler had tested positive for the
bacteria but said the child was in a stable condition and is
recovering in Cairns Base Hospital.

A total of 6 cases of the disease have been confirmed in north and far
north Queensland in recent weeks, including an 18 year old, who was
found dead in his bed at James Cook University's Townsville campus
last week.

A 19 year old woman is also recovering in Cairns Base Hospital while
an elderly woman who fell ill while holidaying on Magnetic Island
remains in a critical but stable condition.

The other cases involved a 2nd JCU [James Cook University] student and
a young child in Townsville.

Another 2 people in Cairns are awaiting final test results for the
bacteria after initial laboratory tests came back negative.

Townsville Public Health Unit physician Dr Steven Donohue says there
are no connections between the cases. He has moved to assure residents
the bacterium is not common. "The risk to the general community is
very low as the disease is not highly infectious, and is generally
only spread in situations of close and prolonged contact, for example
in household settings," he said.

Meningococci infect the area around the brainstem and spinal cord and
can cause blood poisoning. The disease is uncommon and has similar
symptoms to the flu.

[For a discussion of meningococcal disease, see ProMED-mail post:
Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (CO) fatal 20100625.2115.

The 1st news release above confirms that the 2 Townsville medical
students likely had close contact, being friends and living on the
same college dormitory floor. However, the 2nd news release says there
is a 3rd case in the city of Townsville in a "young child". A 4th case
in an "elderly woman" occurred on Magnetic Island, which is 5 miles (8
km) offshore from Townsville. The island is accessible from Townsville
by ferry and is considered a suburb of Townsville
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_Island).

We are told in the 2nd news release that there are no connections
among these cases, but that is obviously not true for the 2 medical
students. Thus, there are 3 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease
in Townsville (population of about 150 000) during a period of 3
months or less in people who live in the same community, but have no
close contact with each other; however, the primary disease attack
rate is less than 10 cases per 100 000 persons; a community-based
outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined by a primary disease
attack rate of 10 or more cases per 100 000 persons
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).

There are at least 2 more cases of meningococcal disease in Cairns
(population 150 000). Townsville and Cairns are cities about 175 miles
(281 km) apart in the state of Queensland
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns), on the northeastern coast of
Australia. The medical school of James Cook University is based in
Townsville during the 1st 4 years; in the final 2 years, the majority
of students relocate to other teaching sites such as Cairns, Mackay,
and Darwin
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook_University_School_of_Medicine_and_Dentistry).
