Gowa begins anthrax vaccinations
--------------------------------
The Gowa regency administration has begun vaccinating cattle for anthrax in
2 infected areas in the region and is requiring all farmers to have animals
tested and certified free of the disease before they are killed in
designated slaughterhouses.
Gowa animal husbandry office deputy head Muhammad Arfah Sulong told The
Jakarta Post on Tuesday [10 Oct 2006] that the regency had issued a
circular prohibiting farmers from moving cattle from known anthrax areas
and killing them outside official slaughterhouses. "This measure is to
prevent the spread of anthrax in Gowa," Arfah said.
Currently, 3 villages in 2 Gowa districts have been declared infected
zones. They are Maccinibaji and Pabbentengan in Bajeng district and
Bategulung village in Bontonompo. Arfah said the office had begun
vaccinating cattle in Maccinibaji and Pabbentengan but was not immunizing
animals across the entire region -- the standard procedure -- because it
did not have enough staff to do the job. "In the meantime, we have
prioritized the vaccination to cattle in areas where there have been
positive cases of anthrax, since we have limited manpower. We only have 6
officials ... so in a day, they can only vaccinate around 200 cattle,"
Arfah said.
Vaccinations in Bategulung and 2 other villages, Manjapai and Sengka in
Bontonompo district, will not begin until after the results are received
from tests conducted on blood samples of 96 cattle taken Sunday [8 Oct
2006], he said. The Gowa health office has yet to test blood samples taken
from residents in the affected areas. No people have been reported sick
with the disease. The office will work to completely vaccinate cattle in
the regency in stages, Arfah said. There are between 60 000 and 80 000
cattle across the regency.
Maccinibaji villagers said the outbreak had destroyed their business during
Ramadan, normally a boom time for farmers. "The anthrax cases are really
costing us. Usually, we have plenty of buyers starting from mid-Ramadan
until Idul Fitri, but now, there are none," Daeng said. But he said farmers
understood people's concerns and promised they would comply with the
government's restrictions.

[They have severe problems if they plan to vaccinate 60 000 to 80 000 head
and can only manage 200 in a day. That needs a radical re-think. If the
disease is localized, and only good record keeping can provide that
information, one sets up a program to vaccinate those villages and watch
the rest. - Mod.MHJ]
