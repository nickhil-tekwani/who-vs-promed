"Bunyavirus that has spread among cattle in Azerbaijan has mutated so that humans can be infected with this virus and it can cause death," [said] Vahid Maharramov, an expert on agriculture.

In order to prevent the spread of this virus and its transmission to humans, people should be warned: "Unfortunately, neither the Ministry of Health nor the State Veterinary Service admits our facts. As a result of studies, we have learnt that in 2009-2010, 171 people in Hubei and Henan provinces of China were infected with this virus and 36 of them died. They say that humans are not infected with this virus and ignore our facts. Nothing is done in this regard. They don't admit the fact that China has had a similar case. The World Health Organization has also issued a statement on the fact of human infection in China. It would be good if this fact is studied by the Ministry of Health."

The expert stressed that in fact, it is a very dangerous disease: "Actually, this virus is transmitted by blood, but humans can be infected with this virus ordinarily. Though cattle are going to recover, it does not mean that the virus leaves the body of animals completely. After a while, if there is a favorable environment, the disease can spread again."

Head of the State Veterinary Service's section for epidemiological surveillance and treatment on special dangerous diseases, Kliment Asadov, told that there [are] more than 100 viruses [in the _Bunyaviridae_] family: "The virus that has spread among cattle in Azerbaijan is not similar to the Chinese virus. We don't deny that these viruses can be transmitted to humans, but the virus spread in Azerbaijan is a mixture of 3 kinds of viruses that can not be transmitted to humans."

Head of Republican Anti Plague Station under the Ministry of Health, Ragif Abdullayev, told that no fact on transfer of bunyavirus from animal to human was recorded in the world up to this day: "I have not met this fact. Such a disease was observed in one of the foreign countries, but in the absence of any permeability, its origin has not been studied. We have not received any information about human infection with this virus. We have not revealed such a fact."

Program coordinator of the World Health Organization for Azerbaijan, Elkhan Gasimov, told that they had not received any information regarding the infection of humans with bunyavirus: "We have not received such information, so far. It is impossible to be infected with shamonda, aino, and akabane viruses belonging to the bunyavirus family. I am not familiar with the statement of the WHO on this disease in China."

The State Veterinary Service under the Ministry of Agriculture of Azerbaijan recommends abstaining from the use of locally produced beef in connection with the contamination of 176 000 heads of cattle with _Bunyaviridae_.

Yesterday [29 Aug 2013] Service's deputy director Ramiz Salmanov said that the Service does not advise to eat meat of dead animals. "Animals which toned up after an illness for 3 days should not be cut as a viral infection does not pass so fast," Salmanov stated.

At that, only 52 animals have died, and 59 cows had a miscarriage.

According to Salmanov, medicines for the treatment of animals cost 2 manats [USD 2.57] that is affordable for farmers.

He, however, did not specify what measures will be taken to prevent the getting of contaminated beef in the stores and markets. In this regard, it makes sense to refrain from using local beef, just so as not to tempt fate.

On 28 Aug 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture held an extended board meeting, the main topic of which was prophylactic measures against [bunyavirus] infection.

The epizootic outbreak has affected 35 regions of the country, and the Veterinary Service has already informed the [World Organization for Animal Health, OIE].

The State Veterinary Service is also prescribed to buy at its own expense 15 tons of disinfectants (caustic soda), and in a short time to distribute it through its regional offices.

The real remedy against [bunyavirus infection] is the drug ribavirin which (as quoted by directories) "strongly reduces mortality".

About 120 000 animals are ill at the moment, while a total number of cattle in the country is at the level of 2 730 700 heads as of 1 Jul [2013].

[The information on a disease (or rather "infection"?) affecting cattle in large parts of Azerbaijan, attributed to a "bunyavirus" without further classification, accompanied by conflicting views on its zoonotic impact, is rather confusing. The only member of the _Bunyaviridae_ family known to cause clinical disease in ruminants (sheep, goats, cattle) that is zoonotic, is Rift Valley fever virus. This serious zoonotic disease has, so far, not been recorded outside the African continent and the Arab peninsula. There are additional zoonotic _Bunyaviridae_ which may be mentioned, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The 3 viruses reportedly referred to in item 1 above (ascribed to the Program Coordinator of the WHO), namely Aino, Akabane, and Shamonda viruses, are teratogenic, abortifacient orthobunyaviruses in ruminants, closely related to Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an emerging virus and disease of ruminants in numerous European countries. They are not known to be zoonotic. Notably, the Head of Epidemiology in the State Veterinary Services stated that the current virus "is a mixture of 3 kinds of viruses that can not be transmitted to humans." The situation in Azerbaijan in relation to SBV is unknown.

The reference to human cases in Hubei and Henan provinces of China undoubtedly refers to severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a newly identified member of the genus _Phlebovirus_ in the _Bunyaviridae_ family (see reports and commentary in ProMED-mail posts 20110619.1880 and 20120805.1229337). A recent paper (Ref 1) provides the results of a serosurvey conducted in 2 counties in Shandong Province, PRC, from April to November 2011. SFTSV-specific antibodies were detected in 328 (69.5 percent) of 472 sheep, 509 (60.5 percent) of 842 cattle, 136 (37.9 percent) of 359 dogs, 26 (3.1 percent) of 839 pigs, and 250 (47.4 percent) of 527 chickens. SFTSV RNA was detected in all sampled animal species, but the prevalence was low, ranging from 1.7 to 5.3 percent. A cohort study in 38 sheep was conducted to determine when seroconversion to SFTSV occurred. Viral RNA was mainly detected in August and September. SFTSVs were isolated from sheep, cattle, and dogs and shared more than 95 percent sequence homology with human isolates from the same disease-endemic regions. The authors concluded that their findings demonstrate that natural infections of SFTSV occur in several domesticated animal hosts in disease-endemic areas, that viraemia occurs in the animals and that the virus has a wide host range.

The only available data on the clinical aspects of the cattle illness, as presented in item 2 citing the deputy head of the Veterinary Services, is "only 52 animals have died, 59 cows had a miscarriage". His remark, "animals which toned up after an illness for three days" may be interpreted as hinting at the seasonal, vector-borne rhabdovirus disease bovine ephemeral fever (BEF, "3 day sickness), known to be endemic in most tropical and subtropical areas of Africa, Australia, the Middle East, and Asia. This adds to the confusion and may be indicative of a multifactorial event.

According to the said item, the Veterinary Service of Azerbaijan "has already informed" the event and its extent to the OIE. No such information could be found in the OIE website; details on the above report (an "emerging" disease?) will be helpful.

The following questions arise:
1. Has clinical disease been seen in the cattle reportedly infected with a "bunyavirus", including congenital malformations?
2. Which diagnostic tests have been applied to identify a "bunyavirus"?
3. Is there further specification regarding the identity of the said virus?
4. Has BEF been recently diagnosed/suspected in cattle in the affected regions?
5. Have samples been forwarded to _Bunyaviridae_ reference laboratories elsewhere?
6. Is there evidence or suspicion of human disease related to the "bunyavirus"?
7. In case affirmative, details are requested.
