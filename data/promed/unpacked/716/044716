Georgia; First Human Case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in 2003
----------------------------------------------------------------
An elderly man in southeast Georgia is the first person in the nation
this year to get infected with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE),
state health officials said. The unidentified man went into a coma at
one point since his infection, which was confirmed on Fri 20 Jun
2003, said Dr. David Page of the Coastal Health District. Page
wouldn't comment on the man's current condition. EEE is caused by a
virus that causes inflammation or swelling of the brain. It is
transferred to humans by mosquito bites.
More than 30 percent of those infected by EEE virus will die, health
officials said. Between 3 percent and 15 percent of people infected
with West Nile virus die, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. EEE is a more serious virus than West Nile
fever, Page said. Unlike West Nile virus infection, where infected
people might not have shown any symptoms, if you get EEE, you will be
sick.
In Georgia, there have been 13 confirmed cases of EEE in animals this
year, according to the health department.
