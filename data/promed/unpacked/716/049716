The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has informed the Branch-Hillsdale-St Joseph Community Health Agency that a Hillsdale County fawn has become the 1st deer in Michigan to test positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The disease is an infectious, often fatal disease of horses, humans, and pigs that is spread by mosquitos. White-tailed deer can also become infected.

So far, 6 horses have also tested positive for EEE in Michigan. Health officials are reminding horse owners to vaccinate their animals since horses infected with EEE often do not survive.

You should call a veterinarian if you suspect EEE. If you suspect a deer is acting abnormal, it should not be handled or consumed.

[Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) (Togaviridae, _Alphavirus_) is maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle involving ornithophagic mosquitoes, specifically _Culiseta_ spp (Diptera: Culicidae), and passerine birds in freshwater swamp foci. EEEV is then transmitted to humans, horses, and other susceptible species via bridge vectors, mosquitoes that feed on both birds and mammals. Common bridge vectors include _Aedes vexans_, _Coquillettidia perturbans_, _Ochlerotatus sollicitans_, and _Ochlerotatus canadensis_. In the Northeast and Great Lakes regions, EEEV transmission peaks during summer and early fall, and not every year. EEEV can cause encephalitis and abnormal behaviour in white-tailed deer, though mortality is thought to be relatively uncommon. - Mod.PMB
