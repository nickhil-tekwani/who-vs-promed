Calder track quarantines 3 barns after horse diagnosed with herpes
------------------------------------------------------------------
Track also postpones 2 weekend stakes races.

The racing industry moved quickly to prevent the spread of equine
herpes virus 1, a potentially deadly disease diagnosed over the
weekend [28-29 Nov 2009] in a horse at Calder Race Course.

The female horse was euthanized Sunday [29 Nov 2009], and the track
imposed a 3-week quarantine on 3 stables containing about 100 horses,
spokeswoman Michele Blanco said.

The track postponed 2 USD 100 000 stakes races scheduled for Saturday
[28 Nov 2009] -- the Tropical Turf Handicap and the My Charmer
Handicap -- which were to draw participants from northern states.
Other races will proceed.

Other Florida tracks, including Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach,
announced they would temporarily bar any horses from Calder from their
property, restricting the common practice of moving horses from track
to track to compete.

Equine herpes virus 1 is a highly contagious disease that can cause
respiratory problems, neurological disabilities, and spontaneous
abortions in the horse.

News of the disease comes just as South Florida tracks prepare for the
arrival of horses from northern tracks closing down for the winter and
as the Wellington area gets ready for the arrival of thousands of
horses, trainers, grooms, and owners for a season of polo, dressage,
and shows.

"As we move toward our equestrian season --- and folks are already
arriving -- this is something we need to keep on our radar,"
Wellington Deputy Village Manager John Bonde said. "This is a very big
business here. We're very sensitive to any issue that could impact the
industry."

Wellington was the scene of the outbreak of a deadly, neurological
form of equine herpes virus in late 2006 that killed at least 6 horses
and infected 7 others.

The strain of the virus discovered at Calder is less deadly than the
one that struck Wellington , said Dr Michael Short, equine programs
manager for the Florida Department of Agriculture.

The track dealt quickly with the sick horse, he said, discovering it
and reporting it to the Department of Agriculture. But someone
mistakenly shipped the horse for diagnosis to the University of
Florida College of Veterinary Medicine along with 3 other horses on
their way to Ocala, exposing them to the disease, Short said. The
horses were immediately isolated, he said, and it's unlikely they will
spread the disease.

Short said he did not think the disease would reduce the number of
racehorses arriving from the north for the winter season.

The horse had come to Calder from Ocala, showed no signs at the time
of arrival, and had a clean veterinary's certificate, Blanco said.

No other horses have been diagnosed with the disease. The horses under
quarantine are having their temperatures checked twice a day.

"We've taken every precaution we could, to the extent of postponing
the 2 stakes races, and that was a hard business decision," Blanco
said. "But it's the right thing to do."

[Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and EHV-4 comprise 2 antigenically
distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2
of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide
and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary
infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis.
Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas
with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in
weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and
geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and
horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is
determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and
possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results in
abortion. Mares may abort several weeks to months after clinical or
subclinical infection with EHV-1. An infrequent clinical sequela of
EHV-1 infection is development of neurologic disease.

The natural reservoir of both EHV-1 and EHV-4 is the horse. Latent
infections and carrier states occur with both virus types.
Transmission occurs by direct or indirect contact with infectious
nasal secretions, aborted fetuses, placentas, or placental fluids.

Outbreaks with specific strains of EHV-1 infection result in
neurologic disease. Clinical signs vary from mild incoordination and
posterior paresis to severe posterior paralysis with recumbency, loss
of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin in the
perineal and inguinal areas. In exceptional cases, the paralysis may
progress to quadriplegia and death. Prognosis depends on severity of
signs and the period of recumbency. Neurologic disease associated with
EHV-1 is thought to occur more commonly in mares after abortion
storms, but it has been reported in barren mares, stallions, geldings,
and foals after an outbreak of EHV-1 respiratory infection.

If horses with EHV-1-associated neurologic disease remain ambulatory,
or are recumbent for only 2-3 days, the prognosis is usually
favorable. Intensive nursing care is necessary to avoid pulmonary
congestion, pneumonia, ruptured bladder, or bowel atony. Recovery may
be complete, but a small percentage of cases have neurologic sequelae.

Immunity after natural infection with either EHV-1 or EHV-4 involves a
combination of humoral and cellular immunity. While little
cross-protection occurs between virus types after primary infection of
immunologically naive foals, significant cross-protection develops in
horses after repeated infections with a particular virus type. Most
horses are latently infected with EHV-1 and EHV-4. The infection
remains dormant for most of the horse's life, although stress or
immunosuppression may result in recrudescence of disease and shedding
of infectious virus. Immunity to reinfection of the respiratory tract
may persist for up to 3 months, but multiple infections result in a
level of immunity that prevents clinical signs of respiratory disease.
Diminished resistance in pregnant mares allows cell-associated
viremia, which may result in transplacental infection of the fetus.

For prevention and control of EHV-4- and EHV-1-related diseases,
management practices that reduce viral spread are recommended. New
horses (or those returning from other premises) should be isolated for
3-4 weeks before commingling with resident horses, especially pregnant
mares. Management-related stress-inducing circumstances should be
avoided to prevent recrudescence of latent virus. Pregnant mares
should be maintained in a group away from the weanlings, yearlings,
and horses out of training. In an outbreak of respiratory disease or
abortion, affected horses should be isolated and appropriate measures
taken for disinfection of contaminated premises. No horse should leave
the premises for 3 weeks after recovery of the last clinical case.

This disease tends to spread easily where there are horse gatherings,
like racetracks. While this an economic impact for the owner whose
horse succumbs to the disease, it is also an economic impact to the
area.

Hopefully this outbreak will resolve quickly for all concerned.
