A horse [in] Los Angeles County, California is in quarantine after testing positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) earlier this month [January 2016].

"A draft-cross gelding displaying neurologic signs has been confirmed positive for the non-neuropathogenic strain of equine herpesvirus-1," the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) said in a [6 Jan 2016] statement. "A small percentage of the non-neuropathogenic-infected horses can display neurologic signs compatible with equine herpes myeloencephalopathy, which is a reportable disease in California. The positive horse has been quarantined and isolated."

The CDFA said no horses have entered or left the affected premises since last September [2015], and all exposed horses are being monitored. As of 15 Jan 2016, no new cases had been reported.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy. In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

The virus is spread by direct horse-to-horse contact or through contact with objects contaminated with the virus. The CDFA continues to monitor the situation in California.

[Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) can cause respiratory disease, abortion, respiratory illness, and death in neonatal foals and neurological disease in horses (Allen et al, 2004; Lunn et al, 2009). Primary infection of young foals typically results in establishment of a latent carrier state and the potential for viral reactivation during the life of the infected individual. Reactivation leads to the production of infectious virus that can be shed into the nasopharynx for a limited period of time and also result in a cell-associated viraemia, which may give rise to clinical disease and abortion in mares. Over the past decade [or more - Mod.TG], there has been an unexpected [but steady - Mod.TG] increase in incidence of equine herpesvirus neurological disease (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy [EHM]) (Perkins et al, 2009; Vissani et al, 2009; Fritsche and Borchers, 2010; Pronost et al, 2010; Smith et al, 2010). Recent studies suggest that EHM is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism at position 2254 in the EHV-1 DNA polymerase gene (encoded by open reading frame 30 [ORF30]) (Nugent et al, 2006; Goodman et al, 2007; Perkins et al, 2009; van de Walle et al, 2009). Based on these findings, EHV-1 strains possessing guanine (G 2254 ) at this site are considered to have neuropathogenic potential, whereas those strains with adenine (A 2254) are thought to be non-neuropathogenic and usually but not invariably associated with abortion and respiratory disease in horses.

Regardless of the genetics or the designation of the type of EHV, this is a serious disease. Owners should be paying attention to the veterinarians who say rest these horses and follow their treatment plan.
