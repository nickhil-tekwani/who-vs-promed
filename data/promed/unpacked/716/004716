Today, 19 Oct 2012, employees of the Krasnoyarsk Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] announced that a previously suspected "anthrax" diagnosis of a local resident has been confirmed [but see below], and that he could have acquired it in the flood zone of Boguchanskaya hydroelectric power plant. Spokeswoman Natalia Krasnopeeva told the "FederalPress.Sibir" that a final diagnosis would be become clear tomorrow.

"The preliminary diagnosis was confirmed in the resident of the Abansk district," said Natalia Krasnopeeva. "Specialists went to visit all places where a sick person stayed."

Allegedly, the sick person previously resided in the village of Kezhma, which was partially flooded by water filling the Boguchany Dam. The other day he came to town on personal business. There, his dog caught a muskrat and brought it to him. He butchered the muskrat and fed the dog. Some time later, the man had fever and boils.

The sick man told the Krasnoyarsk bloggers, he suspects that this all happened because of poor cleaning of the reservoir bed. Animal cemeteries, which were not properly prepared for flooding, were inundated.

The Health Ministry denied the information about an epidemic of anthrax in the reservoir area of Boguchanskaya hydroelectric power plant.

This statement was given by the Department of Health of the Region. denying the information circulated in the internet by a member of the initiative group of people from the flooded area, that he had contracted anthrax because of poor sanitation of the reservoir bed in the Kezhemsky region.

In particular, the man reportedly caught the infection on 9 Oct 2012 in the already abandoned village of Kezhma, presumably from the corpse of a muskrat, which was found by his dog. On his way back home to Aban, the man found himself sick with typical anthrax symptoms, and 5 days later he was hospitalized in the infectious ward of the Kan hospital. Moreover, according to published information, analysis sent to Krasnoyarsk, confirmed the diagnosis of anthrax.

The Ministry of Health of the Krasnoyarsk Region confirmed the admission and isolation of all the patient's contacts; however, it was too early to draw conclusions about the diagnosis -- the final results of the examination will be available only in 3 weeks -- and the preliminary analysis of anthrax was not confirmed. The man's disease looks like a lung infection -- tularemia, which is treated with antibiotics. The patient is currently doing well.

In this case, epidemiologists emphasize that the probability of contracting anthrax from muskrats is extremely low, as rodents are extremely resistant to this disease. In addition, the Ministry of Health added that, even if the diagnosis of anthrax is confirmed, it is in the lightest skin form, which is also treated with antibiotics.

Nonetheless, all medical services of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, particularly in Kezhemsky, Boguchany, Abanskom areas, have been given special instructions and guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of such patients.

In addition, experts have yet to identify the epidemic source of the infection, so they have to go through the entire routes of the sick person and collect samples.

Responding to the suggestion that the source of infection could be an unprocessed animal burial site at the bottom of the Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP) reservoir, the representative of the Rospotrebnadzor in Krasnoyarsk region assured that the Irkutsk Anti-Plague Institute sanitized all known animal burial sites in accordance with the current regulations. This year (2012), the Veterinary Service jointly with Rospotrebnadzor conducted a study on anthrax in the cattle burial site before the flooding of the area, and the results were negative.

[Our thanks to Sabine Zentis and Tamas Torok for this report of a case of tularemia initially diagnosed as anthrax. Why they suspected "anthrax" is hard to determine other than his "boils". Interesting that the subsequent health of his dog after eating the muskrat is not mentioned. Dogs are susceptible to this pathogen. Maybe he cooked the muskrat before feeding it to his dog. Or maybe his physician forgot to ask.
