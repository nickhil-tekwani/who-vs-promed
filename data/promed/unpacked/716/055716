Two new studies look at the Delta variant (B1617) behind the UK COVID-19 surge, with the 1st noting that young people are helping drive the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases in England. The 2nd study describes reduced COVID-19 vaccine and antibody efficacy against the more transmissible variant.

The 1st study, published today [17 Jun 2021] on the Imperial College London preprint server, involved testing a random sample of people from across England for COVID-19 as part of the ongoing Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission (React 1) study (https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/89629).

The researchers showed that COVID-19 infections in England surged from 20 May to 7 Jun [2021], with a doubling time of 11 days and an estimated R (reproductive) number of 1.44. Doubling time is the number of days before coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, or deaths doubled, and R indicates how many people, on average, catch the virus from an infected person.

In total, 135 of 108 911 swabs tested positive for COVID-19, for a weighted prevalence of 0.15%, up from 0.10% of swabs collected from 15 Apr to 3 May [2021]. Northwest England had the highest prevalence (0.26%), while the country's southwest region had the lowest (0.05%). Residents of socioeconomically disadvantaged areas were at nearly double the risk of testing positive compared with those in less-deprived areas.

Young people are behind the surge, with a 5-fold higher rate of COVID-19 test positivity among children 5-12 years (0.35% prevalence) and adults 18-24 (0.36% prevalence) than in those 65 or older. People younger than 50 were 2.5 times more likely to be infected than older people (prevalence, 0.20% vs 0.08%), although the researchers noted that infections seem to be growing at a comparable rate in both age-groups.

In early February [2021], the link between COVID-19 infection rates and hospitalizations started to lessen, apparently due to vaccinations, only to reemerge in late April [2021]. When the researchers stratified data by age, however, they found that those 65 and older still had a lower association between infections and hospital admissions.

"We can take a lot of comfort in the fact that there does appear to be very good protection in the older age-groups, where virtually everyone has been doubly vaccinated," senior study author Paul Elliott, MBBS, PhD, director of the React program, said in a BMJ press release today [17 Jun 2021] (Wise J. COVID-19: exponential growth in infections in England is driven by young people. BMJ. 2021; 373: n1568. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n1568).

The authors also confirmed that Delta has become dominant in the country, rising from 60% of positive COVID-19 tests at the beginning of the study to 90% by the end. As a result of the surge of cases, the easing of coronavirus restrictions in England has been delayed almost 2 weeks, and the researchers said they will send interim data from the next sample to the government to help it gauge the risk of reopening.

"Clearly, it's bad news, but it's very difficult to predict the duration of the exponential phase," lead author Steven Riley, DPhil, MSc, said in the release, noting that extending coronavirus vaccination to younger people in the next month should slow the surge.

In an Imperial College London news release, Riley adds, "Even though we are seeing the highest infection prevalence in younger people who are less susceptible to COVID-19, if this growth continues it will drive up infections in older, more vulnerable people, as the vaccines are not 100% effective and not everyone has been fully vaccinated. This would lead to more hospitalisations and deaths, and risks straining the NHS [National Health Service], which is why it's vital that people take up their vaccine offer and continue to stick to the rules" (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/224113/coronavirus-infections-rising-exponentially-england-react/).

In the 2nd study, published yesterday [16 Jun 2021] in Cell, a team led by University of Oxford researchers evaluated whether vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, or antibodies derived from COVID-19 survivors could neutralize the Delta variant's B1617.1 and B1617.2 sublineages (Liu C, Ginn HM, Dejnirattisai W, et al. Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 by vaccine and convalescent serum. Cell. Epub 16 Jun 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.06.020).

They exposed the Delta variants to neutralizing antibodies from vaccinated participants, convalescent sera from UK COVID-19 patients from early in the pandemic, and monoclonal antibodies. They also looked at the affinity of the variants' receptor-binding domains for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), which allows the virus to enter human cells.

The researchers found substantial reductions in the ability of the AstraZeneca/Oxford and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to inactivate the Delta variant, although the viruses weren't broadly able to escape neutralization.

The ability of the Pfizer vaccine to neutralize the Delta variant dropped 1.34-fold between 4 and 10 weeks after the 1st dose, at which time the ability was nearly lost. "Recently in the UK some reduction in Pfizer-BioNTech effectiveness has been detected at 10 weeks, presumably as a result of waning immunity, leading to the recommendation that the 2nd vaccine dose interval should be reduced from 12 to 8 weeks in those over age 50," the authors said.

The researchers noted previous studies that found lower vaccine effectiveness against mild to moderate COVID-19 in countries in which Beta (B1351) was dominant, as well as against the Alpha (B117) variant 1st seen in England, although protection against severe illness was maintained.

Overall, convalescent sera was 4-fold less effective against B1617.1 and 2.7-fold less effective against B1617.2 than against an early strain from Wuhan, China. Still, convalescent sera containing antibodies against the Beta (B1351) variant 1st seen in South Africa and the Gamma (P1) variant 1st identified in Brazil were the least able to inactivate Delta.

Data showed that the Delta variant's affinity for ACE-2 was slightly enhanced compared with that of the Wuhan strain as well.

"Individuals previously infected by these variants may be more susceptible to reinfection by B1.617.2," the authors wrote. "This observation provides important new insight for immunisation policy with future variant vaccines in non-immune populations."

The authors said that the true number of SARS-CoV-2 variants probably has been underestimated and that more variants of concern will continue to emerge.

"Early in the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 was under selective pressure to adapt to its new host, to evade the innate immune system, to efficiently bind to and infect target cells and to transmit to the next host," they wrote. "As the population develops immunity, by either natural infection or vaccination, pressure is mounting to select mutations that allow the virus to more effectively find an infectible host through increased transmissibility, or to evade the acquired immune response and cause reinfection."

The authors called for more epidemiological data on how often breakthrough infections occur after escape mutations and whether they will cause severe disease and hospitalization. "If this escape from the neutralising capacity of vaccines continues with evolution of new variants in vaccinated populations and leads to a substantial reduction in effectiveness against hospitalisation, there will be a significant impact on attempts to alter the course of the pandemic through immunisation and an urgent need to revise immunogens," they concluded.

More than 350 doctors and medical workers have caught COVID-19 in Indonesia despite being vaccinated with Sinovac and dozens have been hospitalised, officials said, as concerns grow about the efficacy of some vaccines against more infectious variants.

Most of the workers were asymptomatic and self-isolating at home, said Badai Ismoyo, head of the health office in the district of Kudus in central Java, but dozens were in hospital with high fevers and declining oxygen saturation levels.

Kudus, which has about 5000 healthcare workers, is battling an outbreak believed to be driven by the more transmissible Delta variant which has pushed up its bed occupancy rates above 90%.

Designated as a priority group, healthcare workers were among the first to be vaccinated when inoculations began in January [2021]. Almost all have received the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical company Sinovac, the Indonesian Medical Association (IDI) says.

While the number of Indonesian healthcare workers dying from COVID-19 has dropped sharply from 158 in January to 13 in May [2021], according to data initiative group LaporCOVID-19, public health experts say the Java hospitalisations are cause for concern.

"The data [show] they have the Delta variant (in Kudus) so it is no surprise that the breakthrough infection is higher than before, because, as we know, the majority of healthcare workers in Indonesia got Sinovac, and we still don't know yet how effective it is in the real world against the Delta variant," said Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist at Australia's Griffith University.

Spokespersons from Sinovac and Indonesia's ministry of health were not immediately available for comment on the efficacy of the Chinese firm's CoronaVac against newer variants of the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) approved emergency use of Sinovac's vaccine this month [June 2021], saying results showed it prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of recipients and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospital stays in all of those studied.

As Indonesia grappled with one of Asia's worst outbreaks, registering more than 1.9 million infections and 53 000 deaths, its doctors and nurses suffered a heavy toll of 946 deaths. Many are now experiencing pandemic fatigue and taking a less vigilant approach to health protocols after being vaccinated, said Lenny Ekawati, from LaporCOVID-19.

"That phenomenon happens quite often these days, not only within the community, but also healthcare workers," she said. "They think because they are vaccinated that they are safe."

But as more cases of the highly transmissible Delta variant are identified in the world's 4th most populous nation, the data [are] starting to tell a different story. Across Indonesia, at least 5 doctors and one nurse have died from COVID-19 despite being vaccinated, according to the data initiative group, although one had only received a 1st shot. In Kudus, one senior doctor has died, said IDI, although it is understood he had a co-morbidity.

In Jakarta, the capital, radiologist Dr Prijo Sidipratomo told Reuters he knew of at least half a dozen doctors who had been hospitalised with COVID-19 in the past month [May 2021], despite being vaccinated, with one now being treated in an ICU. "It is alarming for us because we cannot rely on vaccinations only," he said, urging people to take precautions.

Weeks after the Muslim Eid Al-Fitr holidays, Indonesia has experienced a surge in cases, with the positivity rate exceeding 23% on Wednesday [16 Jun 2021] and daily cases nearing 10 000, its highest since late February [2021].

In its latest report, the WHO urged Indonesia to tighten its lockdown, as increased transmission due to variants of concern and a surge in bed occupancy rates demanded urgent action.

[2] Pill to treat COVID-19
Date: Fri 18 Jun 2021 10:41 EDT
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/health/covid-pill-antiviral.html


The US government spent more than USD 18 billion last year [2020] funding drugmakers to make a COVID vaccine, an effort that led to at least 5 highly effective shots in record time. Now it's pouring more than USD 3 billion on a neglected area of research: developing pills to fight the virus early in the course of infection, potentially saving many lives in the years to come.

The new program, announced on Thursday [17 Jun 2021] by the Department of Health and Human Services, will speed up the clinical trials of a few promising drug candidates. If all goes well, some of those 1st pills could be ready by the end of the year [2021]. The Antiviral Program for Pandemics will also support research on entirely new drugs -- not just for the coronavirus, but for viruses that could cause future pandemics.

A number of other viruses, including influenza, HIV and hepatitis C, can be treated with a simple pill. But despite more than a year of research, no such pill exists to treat someone with a coronavirus infection before it wreaks havoc. Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's program for accelerating COVID-19 research, invested far more money in the development of vaccines than of treatments, a gap that the new program will try to fill.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key backer of the program, said he looked forward to a time when COVID-19 patients could pick up antiviral pills from a pharmacy as soon as they tested positive for the coronavirus or develop COVID-19 symptoms.

"I wake up in the morning, I don't feel very well, my sense of smell and taste go away, I get a sore throat," Dr. Fauci said in an interview. "I call up my doctor and I say, 'I have COVID and I need a prescription.'"

Dr. Fauci's support for research on antiviral pills stems from his own experience fighting AIDS 3 decades ago. In the 1990s, his institute conducted research that led to some of the 1st antiviral pills for HIV, "protease inhibitors" that block an essential virus protein and can keep the virus at bay for a lifetime.

In the early 2000s, researchers found that an antiviral called sofosbuvir could cure hepatitis C close to 100% of the time. Tamiflu, an over-the-counter pill for influenza, can cut the time it takes to recover from an infection, and reduce the chances that a bout of the flu will land someone in the hospital.

At the start of the pandemic, researchers began testing existing antivirals in people hospitalized with severe COVID-19. But many of those trials failed to show any benefit from the antivirals. In hindsight, the choice to work in hospitals was a mistake. Scientists now know that the best time to try to block the coronavirus is in the 1st few days of the disease, when the virus is replicating rapidly and the immune system has not yet mounted a defense.

Many people crush their infection and recuperate, but in others, the immune system misfires and starts damaging tissues instead of viruses. It's this self-inflicted damage that sends many people with COVID-19 to the hospital, as the coronavirus replication is tapering off. So a drug that blocks replication early in an infection might very well fail in a trial on patients who have progressed to later stages of the disease.

So far, only one antiviral has demonstrated a clear benefit to people in hospitals: remdesivir. Originally investigated as a potential cure for Ebola, the drug seems to shorten the course of COVID-19 when given intravenously to patients. In October [2020], it became the 1st -- and so far, the only -- antiviral drug to gain full FDA approval to treat the disease.

Yet remdesivir's performance has left many researchers underwhelmed. In November [2020], the World Health Organization recommended against using the drug.

Remdesivir might work more effectively if people could take it earlier in the course of COVID-19 as a pill. But in its approved formulation, the compound doesn't work orally. It can't survive the passage from the mouth to the stomach to the circulatory system.

Researchers from around the world are testing other antivirals already known to work in pill form. One such compound, called molnupiravir, was developed in 2019 by researchers at Emory University and has been tested against viruses including influenza and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.

In partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics of Miami, the Emory team carried out experiments in mice that were so impressive that Merck approached them to bring the drug into human clinical trials for COVID-19. "We thought this molecule was really amazing," said Daria Hazuda, vice president of infectious disease and vaccine research at Merck.

In a trial of hospitalized patients, however, molnupiravir seemed to have no effect on the disease. In April [2021], the companies announced they were scrapping the trial.

"I see that, and I'm like, 'Yeah, no duh,'" said Dr. Tim Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. "It's not surprising to me that those kinds of medications would not make a dramatic improvement in someone's outcome when they've been sick for several days."

The companies began a 2nd study last fall [2020], this time testing the drug on people recently diagnosed with COVID-19. That trial is continuing, and Merck is recruiting volunteers with a higher risk of infection, such as older people with obesity and diabetes. Dr. Hazuda said the trial should deliver clear results by October [2021].

Last year [2020], the government's funding of COVID-19 treatments focused on a handful of candidates, such as monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir. Many other studies on antivirals were small and underfunded. In January [2021], the incoming Biden administration began designing a new program dedicated to antiviral pills.

Last week saw the 1st results of this planning. The Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would purchase from Merck 1.7 million doses of molnupiravir at a cost of USD 1.2 billion, provided that the current trial leads to authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. The government may seek similar deals for 2 other antivirals far along in clinical trials, according to Dr. David Kessler, the chief science officer of the Biden administration's COVID-19 response team.

The hope "is that we can get an antiviral by the end of the fall [2021] that can help us close out this chapter of the epidemic," Dr. Kessler said in an interview.

One of the drugs the government is considering is AT-527, developed by Atea Pharmaceuticals. The compound has already proven safe and effective as a treatment for hepatitis C, and early studies suggested it might also work against COVID-19. Roche has partnered with Atea to test it in people, and the companies are currently running a late-stage clinical trial.

The other drug on the government's radar was created by scientists at Pfizer, adapted from a molecule initially designed in the early 2000s as a potential drug for SARS. That drug had sat on the shelf for years, but last spring [2020], the scientists decided to modify its structure so that it would work against the new coronavirus's protease. More than 200 Pfizer researchers joined forces on the effort on the molecule, known for now as PF-07321332.

The drug had been designed to be taken intravenously, but the Pfizer researchers succeeded in altering its structure to work as a pill. When mice were given the drug orally, it reached high enough levels in the body to block the coronavirus. Pfizer launched a clinical trial in March [2021] to study its safety in people, and expects to move to later-stage testing next month [July 2021].

Dr. Kessler acknowledged that there will be challenges in using such pills to drive down hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. People will need to gain access to the drugs as soon as they test positive. "Your testing programs are going to have to be linked to your treatment," he said.

And if the history of antiviral research is any guide, the 1st drugs for COVID-19 will probably only offer modest benefit against the disease, Dr. Fauci said. But that would be a good start.

"With all of these drugs that we've dealt with over the years, we've never hit a home run the 1st time at bat," Dr. Fauci said. "A line drive off the left-field wall to start would be really good."

The government will also spend up to USD 1.2 billion on research centers where scientists will carry out early-stage studies on drugs that block the coronavirus in other ways. Some drugs may interfere with other essential viral proteins, while others may make it impossible to copy the virus's genes.

Even if the next generation of pills doesn't arrive for a few years, many scientists say that the research will be a good investment. "It could help with this pandemic and potentially provide a 1st line of defense for the next one," said Mark Namchuk, the director of therapeutic translation at Harvard Medical School.

The program will support not only research on pills that work against coronaviruses, but also against other high-risk pathogens, such as flaviviruses, which cause diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile fever, and togaviruses, which cause mosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya and eastern equine encephalitis.

"There will always be a threat," Dr. Fauci said. "I think there's going to be a long-range need for drugs."

"Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has grown into a global pandemic, and only a few antiviral treatments have been approved to date. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a fundamental role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis because it allows viral entry into host cells. Here we show that ACE2 nanodecoys derived from human lung spheroid cells (LSCs) can bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and protect the host lung cells from infection. In mice, these LSC-nanodecoys were delivered via inhalation therapy and resided in the lungs for over 72  hours post-delivery. Furthermore, inhalation of the LSC-nanodecoys accelerated clearance of SARS-CoV-2 mimics from the lungs, with no observed toxicity. In cynomolgus macaques challenged with live SARS-CoV-2, 4 doses of these nanodecoys delivered by inhalation promoted viral clearance and reduced lung injury. Our results suggest that LSC-nanodecoys can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating COVID-19."

"Main: ...It is becoming undeniably evident that in addition to an efficacious vaccine, the development of therapeutics is necessary to completely end this pandemic and provide a solution to treat COVID-19 patients who are severely ill. Researchers around the world are in an urgent race to find an effective therapy for COVID-19. According to the published interim results from the World Health Organization's Solidarity Trial on 15 Oct 2020, all 4 of the treatments evaluated to date (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon) had little or no effect on overall mortality, necessity for mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay in hospital."

"Conclusions: We have provided evidence in a non-human primate model of live SARS-CoV-2 infection that cell-derived and cell-mimicking nanodecoys can protect lung cells from the infection and damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. The cynomolgus macaque model recapitulates many clinical features of human patients with COVID-19. Four doses of nanodecoy inhalation led to a reduction of viral load in both BAL and NS 8 days following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Adverse events such as weight loss, fever or mortality were not observed. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, RNAscope and immunofluorescence analyses of lung tissues demonstrated that the nanodecoys were not only effective in alleviating inflammatory cell infiltration and decreasing pulmonary fibrosis but, more importantly, were capable of reducing the levels of SARS-N and vRNA. Our results therefore suggest that LSC-nanodecoys can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating COVID-19."
