A World Health Organization survey of drug-resistant leprosy has detected 8 percent of samples tested in India resistant to rifampicin [also called rifampin in the U.S.], a drug used to treat the infection, leading to concerns that the country could fail to meet its target of completely eradicating the disease by 2020.

The global survey was carried out on new and relapsed cases reported between 2008-15 and shows the highest number of samples, apart from Brazil, that were resistant to the drug used in the 1st line of treatment under the national leprosy eradication programme.

"Within the limited surveillance coverage, we highlight the potential risk of resistance to effective multi-drug therapy, especially in the highest burden countries Brazil and India, where the rate of resistance is becoming noteworthy, while acknowledging the limitation that in those 2 countries, a high number of samples were tested," the survey noted.

Leprosy, a bacterial infection, is known to silently advance in the human host, with early symptoms of numb skin patches and shiny skin that progress into nodules on the entire body.

Although since 2005 the disease is no longer a public health concern in India [*see below], the country still has the highest number of leprosy patients in the world, and, also, every year, the highest number -- about 60 per cent of the total cases -- of new patients are detected in India.

Many experts have reiterated their concerns that rifampicin may not be a good option as a drug in preventing proliferation of leprosy following the WHO study.

"Some scientists at the National Institute of Immunology, too, had claimed to have developed a vaccine against _Mycobacterium indicus pranii_, which is also being used for leprosy. This medicine doesn't seem to be working the way it was projected. Hence, there is need to relook at the national leprosy control programme," said an expert at the Indian Council of Medical Research.

About 200 districts in India have a high incidence of leprosy, but the disease is not distributed equally among the population. "It seems difficult to meet the projected target of leprosy eradication by 2020," he said.

[*WHO defines elimination of leprosy as public health problem as a registered prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population, which was achieved globally in 2000. India achieved "the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem" nationally (that is, a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population) in December 2005. Nevertheless, in 2016, India contributed 63% of new cases of leprosy reported worldwide; (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/249601/1/WER9135.pdf). - Mod.ML]

[Leprosy control depends both on case detection and treatment with multidrug therapy (MDT), which has led to a significant decrease in its prevalence and incidence worldwide. However, the emergence of drug resistant strains of _Mycobacterium leprae_ poses a serious threat to leprosy control efforts. Because use of dapsone or rifampin alone resulted in relapses due to emergence of drug resistant strains of _M. leprae_, the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1982 initiated multidrug therapy (MDT) to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. MDT consists of 2 or 3 medicines: dapsone and rifampin for all leprosy patients, with clofazimine added for multibacillary (MB) disease. Since 1995, WHO has provided MDT free of cost to all leprosy patients in the world. Free MDT was initially funded by The Nippon Foundation, and since 2000, MDT is donated through an agreement with Novartis; the agreement runs until 2020. More than 16 million leprosy patients have been treated with MDT over the past 20 years (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/).

The current WHO recommendations (http://www.who.int/lep/mdt/effectiveness/en/) for adults are: daily dapsone (100 mg) and clofazimine (50 mg), with once monthly rifampin (600 mg) and clofazimine (300 mg) for a duration of one year in the treatment of MB leprosy; and daily dapsone (100 mg) and once monthly rifampin (600 mg) used for a duration of 6 months to treat patients with paucibacillary (PB) leprosy. Rifampin is an exceptionally potent bactericidal agent against _M. leprae_. Because rifampin is the core drug in the multidrug regimen, emergence of rifampin-resistance is an important issue.

Rifampin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for DNA transcription, by forming a stable drug-enzyme complex. Bacterial resistance to rifampin is caused by mutations in the region, known as the rifampin resistance-determining region of the rpoB gene, leading to a change in the structure of the beta subunit of RNA polymerase, which confers decreased binding of rifampin to its target.

Because _M. leprae_ cannot be grown on artificial media, drug susceptibility testing for _M. leprae_ must be done by the mouse footpad (MFP) assay or by molecular methods that detect mutations in the rifampin-resistance determining region of _M. leprae_ derived directly from clinical specimens. The MFP method requires a sufficient number of viable organisms from the patient and takes at least 6 months, at which time the number of bacilli in the footpads of treated mice and untreated mice are compared (https://www.lepra.org.uk/platforms/lepra/files/lr/sept12/269.pdf); whereas molecular methods have rapid turnaround times. However, the MFP method is the standard assay used to characterize the association of particular genetic mutations with drug resistance in _M. leprae_.

Drug-resistant _M. leprae_ mutants can be acquired in the initial infection from a source infected with drug-resistant _M. leprae_ (primary drug resistance) or in a relapse as a consequence of inadequate treatment (secondary drug resistance). WHO reports that the relapse rate after successful completion of the scheduled course of MDT is very low (0.1% per year for PB and 0.06% per year for MB on the average) (http://www.who.int/lep/mdt/effectiveness/en/). Nevertheless, rifampin resistance has been detected in new untreated patients (primary resistance) and in previously treated patients (secondary resistance) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18309708). For example, during 2010, WHO reports that a total of 109 relapsed cases were diagnosed at sentinel sites in China, Colombia, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, The Philippines, Viet Nam and Yemen (World Health Organization. Surveillance of drug resistance in leprosy: 2010. Wkly Epidemiol Rec, 2011; 86: 237 - 240. Available at http://www.who.int/wer/2011/wer8623.pdf). Of the 109 cases identified, 88 (81%) were tested for drug resistance. 75 (85%) presented with new skin lesions at the time of diagnosis, and 80 (91%) were reported to have had an increase in the bacteriologic index. Nine (10%) were resistant to dapsone and one (1Â·1%) was resistant to rifampin by DNA sequencing. No MDR cases were detected in this cohort. Other studies have found similar results for dapsone and rifampin resistance in patients who had relapsed with active disease after completion of or premature termination of MDT (https://www.lepra.org.uk/platforms/lepra/files/lr/sept12/269.pdf). - Mod.ML
