Ref: Wensman JJ, Blomqvist G, Hjort M, Holst BS: Presence of antibodies to Schmallenberg virus in a dog in Sweden. J Clin Microbiol. 2013 Jun 5. [Epub ahead of print]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
So far, Schmallenberg virus [SBV] infection has only been detected in domestic and wild ruminants, and there is no evidence of zoonotic transmission. To our knowledge, no investigations regarding SBV infection in other non-ruminant species have been described. Here, we report the 1st serological evidence of SBV infection in a non-ruminant species, namely a dog. In total 100 serum samples from 86 female dogs, submitted for routine analysis to the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, were examined blindly for the presence of SBV antibodies. An initial screening for SBV antibodies was performed using a commercial competitive ELISA (cELISA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (ID-screen(R) Schmallenberg virus Competition, ID-vet, Montpellier, France). In the initial screening, 2 serum samples were found positive (23 and 20 per cent competition, respectively). A sample was considered positive if the calculated competition percentage was equal to 40 per cent (ID-vet). The samples positive in the initial screening were re-tested using the same SBV-cELISA with similar results (26 and 24 per cent competition, respectively).

To confirm the presence of SBV-specific antibodies in the SBV-cELISA positive serum samples, a serum neutralization test (SNT) was performed at the National Veterinary Institute (Uppsala, Sweden). The virus isolate used was BH80/11-4, kindly supported by Friedrich-Loeffler Institut, Germany, and passaged in BHK-21 cells cultivated in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) complete (SVA, Sweden) with 2 per cent fetal calf serum. [For further technical SN performance details, see the original text].

Neutralizing antibodies were found in the 2 samples (titers of 64 and 128, respectively), confirming the presence of SBV-specific antibodies. When we broke the code list to the serum samples, we discovered that these 2 serum samples came from the same 8-year old female dog, living in Central Sweden, a region where SBV-specific antibodies have been found in ruminants. The 2 samples were taken in January 2013 only 4 days a part, and the titer was slightly lower at the 1st sampling.

Our findings indicate that non-ruminant species, like the dog, could be infected by and induce an antibody response to SBV. Whether the infection in this dog led to any clinical signs, or if it was a transient, recent or subclinical infection, is not known. Since SBV is an arbovirus, the likeliest route of infection is by biting midges, which are the main vectors. In Sweden, the vector season is considered to be from May to October, and the dog lived in an area where SBV has been found in ruminants. The only previous confirmed orthobunyavirus infection in a dog, leading to clinical signs, is to our knowledge a case of meningoencephalomyelitis in the United States due to La Crosse virus (LACV) infection. LACV belongs to the California serogroup, whereas SBV belongs to the Simbu serogroup, and thus no cross reactivity should take place. Antibodies to 2 viruses belonging to the Simbu serogroup (Peaton virus and Aino virus) have not been found in dogs, and to our knowledge, no investigations for the most closely related viruses to SBV (Shamonda virus, Sathuperi virus, and Douglas virus) have been performed in dogs. None of these viruses, except for SBV, have been detected in Sweden.

Our observation of antibodies to SBV in a dog could have important impacts on the transmission patterns and epidemiology of disease followed by SBV infection, and contribute to the overall knowledge of the nature of SBV. There are no national records of reproductive performance in Swedish dogs, hence, it is still unknown if there has been a change in the reproductive performance of the Swedish dog population since the introduction of SBV to Sweden. Whether SBV infection in dogs leads to reproductive failure and/or malformations of puppies, similar to what is seen in ruminants, warrants further investigations.

[Serological investigations in other species and in other SBV-affected countries, will extend the knowledge of the spectrum of this emerging teratogenic virus.

The potential growth of SBV in cell lines of various animal species is another way to evaluate SBV host potential. The virus grew, among others, in human 293T cells (see ProMED-mail posting 20130223.1556721). - Mod.AS
