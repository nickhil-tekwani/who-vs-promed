[As of Wed 12 Nov 2003, in the USA only 4 states -- Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada,
and Oregon -- have remained entirely free of West Nile virus infection of
any animal species (apart from travel-related human cases) since the
appearance of the virus in North America.
The weekly counts of new human cases during the past 11 weeks have been
414, 1046, 1214, 690, 1034, 646, 450, 429, 332, 502, and now 176.
The 3 western/midwestern states of Colorado, Nebraska, and South Dakota,
together with the state of Texas, have accounted for 67.6 percent
(5677/8393) of the total number of confirmed human cases, and 57.1 percent
(105/184) of fatalities during 2003. - Mod.CP]
