[1] Liberia: doctors stricken

A US doctor working with Ebola virus disease [EVD] patients in Liberia has tested positive for the deadly virus. The aid organisation Samaritan's Purse issued a news release on Saturday [26 Jul 2014] saying Dr Kent Brantly was being treated at a hospital in Monrovia, the capital. Brantly had been serving as medical director for the aid organisation's case management centre there.

Samaritan's Purse spokeswoman Melissa Strickland said Brantly's wife and children had been living with him in Africa, but were now in the US. Brantly was quoted in a posting on the organisation's website earlier this year about efforts to maintain an isolation ward for patients. "The hospital is taking great effort to be prepared," Brantly said. "In past ebola outbreaks, many of the casualties have been health care workers who contracted the disease through their work caring for infected individuals."

The disease has already killed 672 in four West African countries since the outbreak began earlier this year.

Last week a Liberian man died of ebola in Lagos, the first confirmed case in Africa's biggest city of 21 million people. Nigerian health authorities, anxious to stop the spread of the disease, are concerned that the sick man had boarded an international flight. They feared other passengers could take the disease beyond Africa due to weak inspection of passengers and the fact ebola's symptoms are similar to other diseases such as malaria and typhoid.

Officials in Togo, where the sick man's flight had a stopover, also went on high alert after learning that ebola could possibly have spread to a fifth country.

Screening people as they enter the country may help slow the spread of the disease, but it is no guarantee ebola won't travel by plane, said Dr Lance Plyler, who heads ebola medical efforts in Liberia for the aid organisation Samaritan's Purse.

An ebola outbreak in Lagos, where many live in cramped conditions, could be a disaster. Nigerian newspapers describe the effort as a "scramble" to contain the threat after the Liberian arrived in Lagos and then died on Friday. International airports in Nigeria are screening passengers arriving from foreign countries for symptoms of ebola, said Yakubu Dati, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria.

Airports in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three other West African countries affected by the outbreak, have implemented some preventive measures, according to officials in those countries. But none of the safeguards is foolproof. Doctors say health screens could be effective, but EVD has a variable incubation period of between two and 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot.

PS, a consultant for the Liberian ministry of finance, arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday and was immediately detained by health authorities suspecting he might have EVD. Authorities announced on Friday that blood tests from the Lagos University teaching hospital confirmed that he had died of EVD earlier that day. He reportedly did not show EVD symptoms when he boarded the plane.

Nearly 50 other passengers on the flight are being monitored for signs of ebola but are not being kept in isolation, said an employee at Nigeria's ministry of health, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. PS's sister also died of EVD in Liberia, according to Liberian officials, but PS claimed to have had no contact with her. EVD is highly contagious and kills more than 70% of people infected. It is passed by touching bodily fluids of patients even after they die.

[2] Liberia: doctors stricken

In Monrovia Dr Samuel Brisbane, the chief medical doctor at Liberia's leading hospital, the John F Kennedy Medical Center, has become the latest casualty of the deadly Ebola virus. Dr Brisbane, also a former chief medical doctor at the Firestone Rubber Plantation Hospital had been quarantined along with a physician assistant and Dr Nelson Korkor, the lead doctor at Phebe who was brought down to Monrovia 3 days ago after contracting the virus.

Hospital sources say Dr Brisbane selected to treat himself at home initially in a bid not to spread the virus to others but was brought to the ELWA hospital where the Samaritan Group has been treating serious cases, when the illness worsened, until his death on Saturday.

A hospital official told FrontPageAfrica on Friday that Dr Brisbane and the other ailing health workers were holding onto life, but that Dr Brisbane vomited occasionally. The PA, however, is still said to be deteriorating, a senior hospital administrator told FrontPageAfrica on condition of anonymity. Dr. Brisbane's death comes just a day after the JFK's ER Wing was shut down and patients already in care moved to another floor in the hospital. Health care workers are bearing the brunt of the deadly outbreak.

During programs marking the 167 Independence of Liberia, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf paid homage to the late Dr Sam Mutooro Muhumuza, a Ugandan national, and all the health workers around the country who have made the ultimate sacrifice in saving lives. "To their families, loved ones, associates, we extend our heartfelt sympathy," she said, adding that the government will shortly reach out to the families of the departed health workers to bring them comfort in their times of trials and tribulations.

President Sirleaf expressed appreciation to all the health workers - doctors, nurses, para-medics - who continue to be of service to the Liberian people in the midst of danger to themselves. "We like to say to them how much we appreciate what they do to contribute to helping the country arrest the deadly Ebola disease."

Protesters march on Ebola center in Sierra Leone: runaway found
---------------------------------------------------------------
Thousands marched on an Ebola virus disease [EVD] treatment center in Sierra Leone on Friday [25 Jul 2014] after a former nurse alleged that the deadly virus was invented to conceal "cannibalistic rituals" at the ward, a regional police chief said.

Across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, at least 660 people have died from the illness, according to the World Health Organization, placing great strain on the health systems of some of Africa's poorest countries. Sierra Leone now has the highest number of cases, at 454, surpassing neighboring Guinea where the outbreak originated in February [2014].

Angry crowds gathered outside the country's main EVD hospital in Kenema [Eastern Province] in the West African country's remote east where dozens are receiving treatment for the virus and threatened to burn it down and remove the patients. Residents said that police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds and said that a 9 year old boy was shot in the leg by a police bullet. Assistant inspector general Alfred Karrow-Kamara said on Saturday [26 Jul 2014] that the protest was sparked off by a former nurse who had told a crowd at a nearby fish market that "EVD was unreal and a gimmick aimed at carrying out cannibalistic rituals". He said that calm had now been restored to Kenema on Saturday, adding that a strong armed police presence was in place around the clinic and the local police station. Some health workers from the clinic have been reported absent from work because of "misconceptions by some members of the community," according to a local doctor.

Ebola can kill up to 90 per cent of those who catch it -- although the fatality rate of the current outbreak is around 60 per cent. Highly contagious, its symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea as well as internal and external bleeding.

President Ernest Bai Koroma said on Saturday [26 Jul 2014] that the government planned to "intensify activities and interventions in containing the disease and stopping it spread" with a view to ending the disease within 60-90 days. The new strategy will focus on contact tracing, surveillance, communications and social mobilization, psychosocial services, logistics and supplies, according to the president's statement.

WHO has previously said that poor health infrastructure and a lack of manpower were hindering efforts to contain the outbreak in Sierra Leone. Another problem is fear and mistrust of health workers among the local population, many of whom have more faith in traditional medicine.

Runaway found
-------------
Sierra Leone officials appealed for help on Friday [25 Jul 2014] to trace the 1st known resident in the capital with Ebola virus disease [EVD] whose family forcibly removed her from a Freetown hospital after she tested positive for the deadly disease. Amadu Sisi, senior doctor at King Harman hospital, from which the patient originally escaped, said on Saturday [26 Jul 2014] that she had been turned in after seeking refuge in the house of a traditional healer. "Because of media and police pressure they decided to give her up. Maybe they are now convinced it is EVD," he said.

[4] Sierra Leone: riots
Date: Fri 25 Jul 2014

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-25/sierra-leone-police-use-tear-gas-to-curb-ebola-related-riot.html


Local people in Kenema rioted and attacked the ebolavirus hospital lab, funded by George Soros, Bill Gates and the Pentagon. The mainstream media and local Sierra Leone police chief claim that a nurse who had warned locals that the lab was putting ebolavirus in circulation was "mentally ill". [In fact,] the country's health ministry announced on its Facebook page that the lab was to be closed, Tulane University was to stop testing for ebolavirus, the CDC was required to deliver an official report on the lab's activities and the CDC and WHO's own documents state that ebolavirus comes from hospitals. [Misinterpretation -- those documents state that ebolavirus spreads from EVD patients in hospitals which do not have effective infection control measures. - Mod.JW.]

[5] Sierra Leone: official update

Ebola outbreak update
---------------------
As of today, 26 Jul 2014, we have 116 cumulative number of survivors, 458 confirmed Ebola virus disease [EVD] cases and 153 EVD confirmed deaths; 82 patients are currently admitted at the Ebola treatment centers in Kenema and Kailahun.

The Ministry of Health and Sanitization and WHO have established a dedicated Ebola Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the WHO Country Office in Freetown. The EOC is co-directed by the minister of health, Ms Miata Kargbo, and the WHO representative for Sierra Leone, Dr Jacob Mufunda, and consists of leaders and partners involved in our fight against Ebola.

The EOC will serve as the Sierra Leone national central command and control center for outbreak response activities, and meets every day. The EOC members under the leadership of the honourable minister of health and sanitation unanimously decided at the 24 Jul 2014 meeting that the following actions be effected immediately:
- WHO and MSF to take over the management of the Kenema treatment center;
- WHO and MSF to bring more experts to run the treatment center in Kenema.

WHO's director general, Margaret Chan, has upgraded the Ebola response in West Africa to a Grade 3, the highest level of any emergency response. A Grade 3 involves a multiple country event with a substantial public health consequence that requires a substantial WHO country office response and substantial international partner response. This means partners could deploy resources from other countries into the region.

The EOC wishes the general public and all partners working in the health care sector to know that Dr Sheikh Umar Khan is responding well to treatment.

[In Liberia, the sad news is that the 1st international aid expert, a medical doctor, has contracted EVD, and a Liberian doctor has died.

In Sierra Leone, malicious rumours alleging "cannibalistic rituals" at the Kenema EVD treatment ward and that the Kenema lab is putting ebolavirus in circulation are sparking violent confrontations. Or are these 2 different versions of the same riot?

But at least one traditional healer is now convinced that EVD victims should go to a treatment centre.

The flight carrying the fatal case in Nigeria made a stop in Togo en route between Liberia and Nigeria. If any passengers or crew got off there, they are potential contacts. - Mod.JW
