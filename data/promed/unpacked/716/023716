There are now multiple reports implicating that a global pathogen traditionally associated with birds [is linked] to abortion in horses, researchers warn.

_Chlamydia psittaci_ is an emerging pathogen that must be included in routine microbiological diagnostic testing of all equine abortions, according to Susan Anstey and her fellow researchers in Australia.

_C. psittaci_ is traditionally regarded as a globally distributed bird pathogen that can spill over into other species. Infections are common in a variety of birds, including poultry, wild birds, and pet birds.

These infections are also found in humans and, to a lesser degree, domesticated livestock such as sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs.

The disease, known as psittacosis, or parrot fever, can cause fever and chills in humans, a headache and muscle aches, a dry cough, and occasionally pneumonia.

Spill-over transmission from the bird host to other animals, via direct or indirect contact, is thought to be the route of infection.

Compared to global studies, Australia has limited reporting in humans and domesticated livestock such as sheep and cattle.

While molecular research has identified an extended global host range and significant genetic diversity, Australia has reported a reduced host range, in birds, horses, and humans, with a dominance of clonal strains, denoted ST24.

In Australia, _C. psittaci_ has found a preferred host niche in the nation's parrots and thoroughbred horses.

To better understand how widespread this strain type is in Australia, Anstey and her colleagues conducted molecular-based tests on samples from birds, horses, marsupials, and cattle from Australia.

Their work, reported in the journal Pathogens, confirmed that clonal ST24 strains dominate infections of Australian parrots and equine hosts. However, they also identified novel hosts: the Australian white ibis, King parrots, racing pigeons, cattle, and a wallaby.

They also showed strain diversity does exist in Australia. Their discovery of a novel strain, dubbed ST306, in a novel host, the Western brush wallaby, is the 1st detection in a marsupial, they said.

The authors noted that while _C. psittaci_ infections in Australian parrots are not new, the 1st descriptions of the pathogen in thoroughbred horses in 2014 were considered novel and raised biosecurity concerns regarding a potential emerging infection.

_C. psittaci_ infection in a pregnant horse resulted in late-term pregnancy loss and a novel infectious aerosol transmission of _C. psittaci_ to humans handling infected equine foetal membranes, as reported in 2017 papers.

Since then, _C. psittaci_ has remained an annually reported cause of foal loss in the Hunter Valley region of Australia -- a major thoroughbred breeding center -- as observed in a study from 2016 to 2020.

"A recent retrospective study has also provided evidence this pathogen is not new in Australian horses and has been a cause of sporadic equine foal loss in Australia for over 30 years."

These studies, they said, highlight potential under-reporting, as _C. psittaci _was not previously considered in equine diagnostic panels.

"Addressing _C. psittaci_ knowledge gaps is important considering the high individual value of the thoroughbred foals and the zoonotic risk to farmworkers," the study team said.

Discussing their findings, the researchers said previous Australian studies have focused on molecular descriptions of equine strains, which, on their own, cannot provide an informed understanding of the disease-causing ability of each strain and the mechanism of equine foal loss.

"We are still facing knowledge gaps on how _C. psittaci_ is transmitted to the pregnant mare, how it colonises the placenta, and how pathological processes in the foetal membranes/organs are induced.

"If the infectious agent ... is orally ingested from pastures contaminated with faecal droppings containing _C. psittaci_, information about the density of the bird population shedding _C. psittaci_ is of importance."

They said while parrots might play a major role in Australia, pigeons might be considered as a potential infection source in European countries.

Case numbers of abortions in different geographical regions are closely related to the type and density of horse farming and breeding, they noted.

They noted mixed infection of _C. psittaci_ and other abortion-causing agents, such as equine herpesvirus-1, have been reported, but it remains unclear whether one of the agents (or a combination of both) induced the abortion.

Further studies on the lesions arising from infection and inflammatory processes would help to understand the disease process, they said.

The study team acknowledged a diagnosis of _C. psittaci_ in horses can be challenging. "While high loads are noted in clinical cases of both avian psittacosis and equine foal loss, the significance of detection of low levels in a healthy host remains unknown.

"Importantly," they continued, "early detection for intervention in the pregnant mare is still lacking.

"Considering Australia's major thoroughbred breeding center in the Upper Hunter Valley is in a potentially endemic ST24 region, what risk does the emerging strain diversity pose for an outbreak of foal loss and human psittacosis?"

They said there is a serious potential for cross-species transmission associated with _C. psittaci_. "Equine veterinarians and staff on equine breeding farms must take more precautions when dealing with the aborted equine conceptus and the affected mare."

Birthing in horses can now be considered as a time of higher risk for transmission of _C. psittaci_ to farmworkers, they said.

"Compared to global reporting, there is potential under-reporting in Australia, with less than 50 notified cases of psittacosis per annum in the past decade reported in the Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillances. [How can it be under-reported in a specific region if the infective agent is not suspected of being in the area, or it has not been previously known to be an agent to consider in the list of differential considerations of causation of the abortion? - Mod.TG]

"To date, some regions are considered endemic, and this study has identified the upper Hunter Valley as another potential region."

They said the recent development of a rapid diagnostic test for the pathogen in horses shows promise in helping to manage the risk for frontline workers. [What about a rapid test for horses? - Mod.TG]

They said their work has shown the predominance of a dominant ST24 strain in Australia, capable of causing serious disease in people and animals, and mortality in equines, as well as identifying a broader host range and found a new strain.

They said the descriptive framework around _C. psittaci_ disease should be updated. There should be ongoing surveillance and strain identification for potential outbreak intervention, including cell biology work to learn more about the disease-causing potential.

Indeed, _C. psittaci_ should be added to abortion screens for horses. A quick scan of the literature indicates this agent has been documented to be involved in respiratory diseases in horses since the late 1970s, and abortion has been noted most prominently in journals since 2015. One such abstract from Queensland is posted below and was posted on ProMED (citation and abstract below):

Abstract
"_Chlamydia psittaci_ is an important avian pathogen with spillover from infected wild and domesticated birds also posing a risk to human health. We recently reported a case of _C. psittaci_ equine placentitis associated with further spillover to humans. Molecular typing of this case revealed it belonged to the 6BC clade of _C. psittaci_, a globally distributed highly virulent set of strains, typically linked to infection spillover from parrots. Equine chlamydiosis associated with _C. psittaci_ infection has previously been reported elsewhere in countries where parrots are not endemic, however, raising questions over the identity of infecting _C. psittaci_ strains and the potential infection reservoirs. In this study, we describe the detection and molecular characterization of _C. psittaci_ in a case of equine abortion in southern Queensland. Equine placenta and fresh liver and lung tissue from the necropsied foetus were positive by _C. psittaci_-specific qPCR. _Chlamydia psittaci_-specific multilocus sequence typing and ompA genotyping were used to further characterize the detected equine strains and an additional strain obtained from a dove from a different geographic region presenting with psittacosis. Molecular typing of this case revealed the infecting equine strains were closely related to the C0sittaci detected in dove, all belonging to an evolutionary lineage of _C. psittaci_ strains typically associated with infections of pigeons globally. This finding suggests a broader diversity of _C. psittaci_ strains may be detected in horses and in association with reproductive loss, highlighting the need for an expansion of surveillance studies globally to understand the epidemiology of equine chlamydiosis and the associated zoonotic risk." - Mod.TG
