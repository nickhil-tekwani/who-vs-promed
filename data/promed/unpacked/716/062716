Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the
western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected
flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals, 2) direct contact
with contaminated tissues, or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of
respiratory secretions from infected persons or animals. In September
2010, the Oregon Health Authority reported the 1st 2 cases of human
plague in Oregon since 1995 and the only 2 USA cases in 2010.

Both illnesses began on 21 Aug 2010. The patients, aged 17 and 42
years, lived in the same household and might have been exposed to
plague by infected fleas from a dog; that dog was found to be
seropositive for _Y. pestis_ by the passive
hemagglutination-inhibition assay (dilution of 1:64). One patient
acknowledged sleeping in the same bed with the dog during the 2 weeks
before illness onset. Both patients had high fever and multiple
bilateral inguinal buboes; one patient had hypotension, tachycardia,
and acute renal failure and was hospitalized. A gram-negative rod with
bipolar staining was isolated from a specimen of that patient's
blood.

Four different clinical laboratories attempted to identify the
isolate. Three different commercial automated systems identified the
organism as _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Pseudomonas luteola_, and
_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_, respectively. However, 25 days after
specimen collection, the isolate was identified as _Y. pestis_ by
direct fluorescent antibody to F1 antigen, polymerase chain reaction,
and bacteriophage lysis at the Spokane (Washington) Regional Health
District Laboratory, prompting notification of the Oregon Health
Authority. The 2nd patient was identified retrospectively on the basis
of a single positive serology (passive hemagglutination-inhibition
[dilution of 1:32]). Plague was not suspected initially. Both patients
recovered uneventfully after empiric therapy with doxycycline and
amoxicillin clavulanate potassium, respectively, although the latter
is not considered effective in treating plague.

Automated bacterial identification systems can misidentify _Y.
pestis_ (1,2). Automated identification of _Yersinia_ spp. in blood
should prompt further clinical evaluation of the patient to determine
whether symptoms are compatible with plague. When plague is suspected,
treatment should be started immediately, and both the state public
health laboratory and public health authorities should be notified
promptly.

Plague is a Category A potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections
are rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate
depends on the clinical presentation (i.e., bubonic, septicemic, or
pneumonic) and timing of antibiotic therapy initiation; if untreated,
the case-fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and
approaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague (3). Rapid laboratory
identification can help guide therapy.

Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in
enzootic areas (4). Plague patients with no history of exposure to
rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected
rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea
control to dog and cat owners.
