["American foulbrood (AFB) affects the larval stage of the honey bee _Apis mellifera_ and other _Apis_ spp., and occurs throughout the world. _Paenibacillus larvae_, the causative organism, is a bacterium that can produce over one billion spores in each infected larva. The spores are extremely resistant to heat and chemical agents, and can survive for many years in scales (from diseased dead brood), hive products and equipment. Only the spores are capable of inducing the infection.

"Combs of infected colonies have a mottled appearance due to a mixture of healthy capped brood, uncapped cells containing the remains of diseased larvae, and empty cells. This is not a characteristic of AFB only. Cell cappings of a diseased larva appear moist and darkened, becoming concave and possibly punctured as infection progresses. The larval or pupal colour changes to creamy brown and then to a dark brown with a ropy appearance when drawn out. In some cases the larval remains are rather watery. The diseased brood eventually dries out to form characteristic brittle scales that adhere tightly to the lower sides of the cell. The formation of a pupal tongue is one of the most characteristic but rarely seen signs of the disease and precedes the formation of the scales. The clinical signs of AFB are very diverse and depend on the genotype involved, the stage of the disease and the strength of the bee colony (and possibly its resistance to AFB). Genotypes ERIC I-IV are all pathogenic for honey bees."
