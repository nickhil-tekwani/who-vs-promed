[Spring viremia of carp (SVC) is a disease of cyprinids caused by a rhabdovirus, which mainly affects common carp _Cyprinus carpio_. The disease is widespread in European carp culture, where it causes significant morbidity and mortality. It is a notifiable disease by the OIE.

Affected fish show destruction of tissues in the kidney, spleen and liver, leading to hemorrhage, loss of water-salt balance and impairment of immune response. High mortality occurs at water temperatures of 10 to 17°C [17 to 62.6°F], typically in spring. At higher temperatures, infected carp develop humoral antibodies that can neutralize the spread of virus and such carp are protected against re-infection by solid immunity. The virus is shed mostly with the feces and urine of clinically infected fish and by carriers. Waterborne transmission is believed to be the primary route of infection, but bloodsucking parasites like leeches and the carp louse may serve as mechanical vectors of SVCV.
