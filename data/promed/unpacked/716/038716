Botswana: Foot and mouth disease outbreak stalls exports to EU and SA
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The European Union (EU) followed South Africa's lead on Thursday and banned
imports of deboned meat from Botswana following an outbreak of foot and
mouth disease (FMD) in the country.
"The standing committee on food chain and animal health agreed to
temporarily suspend the importation into the EU of de-boned fresh meat of
these species [bovine, ovine, and caprine species and farmed and wild game
animals] from the whole territory of Botswana," an EU statement said.
The EU would re-evaluate its position within 3 months while neighboring
South Africa, which has just recovered from a similar outbreak and EU ban,
has extended its ban to include live cloven-hoofed animals, dairy products,
meat products, hides and skins and other products, and posted special
patrols at its border with Botswana.
The outbreak was first reported on a communal farm in the Matsiloje
extension area in the Francistown district to the north east of the country
on Sat 11 Jan 2003. It is the second outbreak in 2 years.
"The farmer saw some of his cattle were lame and immediately reported it to
the veterinary assistant in charge of the area who alerted his superiors,"
[said] Neo Mapitse, principal veterinary officer for the Botswana
Department of Animal Health and Production told IRIN. "On Sunday a team
which included a foot and mouth disease (FMD) expert, a virologist and a
laboratory technician were dispatched to investigate and immediately
suspected FMD."
By Monday morning the government had banned cattle exports or the movement
of cattle throughout the country, and by Tuesday 400 head of cattle out of
a suspected infected population of 3000 on communal and commercial farms
had been destroyed, Mapitse said.
With livestock byproducts one of Botswana's major exports, next to
diamonds, the department also notified its export markets that it had
closed abattoirs, placed a countrywide ban on slaughtering, and suspended
exports.
The slaughtering ban was lifted in certain areas on Thursday. Although
preliminary tests indicate FMD, the department was still waiting for the
result of an internationally recognized test to confirm the outbreak,
Mapitse said. It was also awaiting an indication of the strain and origin
of the outbreak.
Livestock owners would be compensated for the destroyed livestock, he said.
Meanwhile, Botswana's northern neighbor Zimbabwe, itself still under a
self-imposed export ban to the EU following a similar outbreak, has warned
that it does not have the foreign exchange to buy the vaccines needed to
keep its own outbreak in check.
Zimbabwe is currently experiencing a severe economic crisis and also does
not have enough foreign currency for many vital purchases including
fertiliser and fuel. Stuart Hargreaves, principal veterinary officer in
Zimbabwe's Department of Agriculture told IRIN that appeals over the last 2
years for funds to buy 2.3 million units of vaccine from its supplier in
Botswana had been unsuccessful.
Commenting on speculation that Botswana's outbreak may have originated in
Zimbabwe, Hargreaves said this had not been confirmed. However, he said
there was some cattle smuggling across the border by Zimbabweans taking
advantage of the favorable exchange rate of the Botswana Pula, the
strongest currency in the region, on the parallel market. He added that
most FMD infections including those occurring in Europe, were from illegal
imports, not from certified imports.
South Africa's Agriculture Ministry said that it would wait for a formal
request for assistance from Zimbabwe for vaccines before deciding what to
do. "Zimbabwe is part of NEPAD (the New Partnership for Africa's
Development) and SADC (the Southern African Development Community) so we
will look at it once we receive a formal request," ministry spokesman David
Tshabalala told IRIN.

Foot and mouth disease control claims 5000 cattle
-------------------------------------------------
FRANCISTOWN: To control the contagious foot and mouth disease (FMD), the
government will kill about 5000 cattle in the Matopi crush, in the
Matsiloje area.
Addressing farmers at Matopi last week, the assistant minister of
agriculture, Pelokgale Seloma said that the government has considered all
options before arriving at the decision. All animals in the infected areas
will be vaccinated as often as is necessary in order to protect them and
reduce the rate of animal to animal transmission of the disease. The
vaccinated animals are to be disposed of as soon as it is clear that the
disease is not widespread. Farmers will be compensated P650 [US Dollar 117]
per bovine animal and P350 [US Dollar 63] per pig killed irrespective of
age, size and condition. Owners will be given 70 per cent of the
compensation as cash and 30 per cent in the form of live animals for
re-stocking.
Seloma urged farmers to be vigilant and report any illegal livestock
movement to the chief, police or veterinary personnel. "Such illegal
movements have landed us in this predicament and the perpetrators have to
be brought to book," he warned.
Early last year, about 12 197 cattle and 131 pigs were killed and buried in
Matshelagabedi and Matsiloje following the outbreak of FMD in Lephaneng
crush near Matsiloje. Farmers were compensated P650 for their cattle and
P350 for pigs.

[Zimbabwe's unstable conditions seem to be contributing to the
deteriorating animal-health situation the entire region. There is an
obvious common interest of all countries in the region that FMD
outbreak(s), in any of southern Africa's countries, be speedily put under
control. Hence the need to urgently support the Veterinary Services of
Zimbabwe in their great efforts to control FMD, including supplying
suitable (polyvalent?) vaccines. - Mod.AS]
