An alarming number of dead birds are being discovered floating along
the shores of the northern Bahamas causing concern among some
residents in the Grand Bahama community. A week after the 1st
incident was reported [18 Jun 2007], accounts of dead birds floating
in Bahamian waters are still filing in.
Tom Christian, a director of Bahamas Air Sea Association (BASRA),
said that they have become aware of several reports regarding the
discovery of dead birds. The 1st incident happened in the waters near
the east end of Grand Bahama Island, off Borrows Cay.
"A boat had left from Freeport and went to Southern Abaco and on
their trip there, and, as they were coming back they spotted dead
birds," Christian explained. "The largest concentration of the dead
birds was off Borrows Cay, floating in the ocean."
The boaters estimated that they had seen somewhere between 50 to 100
dead birds on their trip. The birds were described as having brown
wings, white chests, and hooked beaks.
Mike Wallace, chief public analyst at the Department of Environmental
Health Services (DEHS), said last week that the DEHS was aware of the
incident but had not collected any carcasses at that point.
"We have, and do, herewith request that if there are fresh sightings,
that we be called immediately so as to have a chance to collect fresh
carcasses that we can pass on to the Department of Agriculture for
review," Wallace said.
According to Christian, there have been several new sightings since
the initial incident, yet he has not seen any action. There was an
incident reported to BASRA on 25 Jun [2007], by persons who had
spotted another large quantity of birds 15 miles off Freeport and
BASRA also received information of more dead bird sightings as far as
Bimini. Christian said that BASRA has unsuccessfully tried to get
into contact with Mike Wallace and the DEHS.
Several eyewitnesses also contacted The Freeport News last week
[18-24 Jun 2007] to report incidents of dead birds along Grand
Bahama's shores.
According to a website recommended by Wallace, hundreds of dead birds
also washed ashore in Florida last week [18-24 Jun 2007], and though
scientists are uncertain why these large numbers of birds died,
starvation is suspected. This information might suggest a possible
explanation but some residents are not quick to accept this data as
an answer to their concerns.
"I'm looking for the Health Department to do their own research in
our area and let the people know that dead birds could be washing up
on shore," Christian said. He also went on to say that while walking
along one of Grand Bahama's beaches, he also came upon some dead
birds. "On the 26th, I went out and picked up 4 dead birds, within a
mile, while walking down Williams Town Beach," he said.
At this point, the reason for the mass deaths of the birds remains unknown.
Residents are concerned the biggest threat is not knowing what the
possible health hazards may be, resulting in the spread of
misinformation. "The biggest danger could be kids picking up the
birds and playing with them or people stepping on them and becoming
contaminated," Christian explained.
Some are speculating that the birds might be eating some hazardous
materials in the water, meaning that some of the fish might also be
contaminated. Others think that the birds may have fallen victim to
the bird flu; either possibility warrants attention in the opinion of
concerned residents.
Wallace told Freeport News that once information on the dead birds
has been passed on to the Department of Agriculture, then, the issue
is no longer in the hands of the DEHS. The Freeport News attempted to
contact persons in charge at the Department of Agriculture yesterday
[29 Jun 2007], but those individuals were unavailable.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall
[The 1st report was primarily regarding seagulls (see ProMED-mail
20070623.2030). This report seems to extend to other birds, although
no types of birds are specifically mentioned and the description is
broad enough to include several types of species of seagulls.
However, it would seem that the DEHS should be concerned enough about
this die-off and residents/tourists concern to be collecting
carcasses and doing necropsies and testing. Even if the cause is
starvation, appropriate information is very helpful and reassuring to
both residents and tourists.
As tourism is a major industry in the Bahamas, the lack of response
from DEHS is difficult to understand. Die-offs like this, without
information, cause rumors and misinformation, which escalates fear
and can cause a drop in tourism.
If there is anyone with accurate information, or if any testing being
done on these avian carcasses, we would appreciate it if it could be
shared with us. - Mod.TG
