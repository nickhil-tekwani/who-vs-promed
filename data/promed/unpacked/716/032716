A bout of food poisoning sickened 1074 inmates at Osaka Prison in
Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, from Tuesday to Wednesday, 13-14 Dec 2011,
forcing it to serve preserved food stored for emergency use, prison
and local health officials said.

The inmates began complaining of food poisoning symptoms starting
Tuesday night, 13 Dec 2011, prompting the prison to report the matter
to the health center the next morning. The inmates were treated at the
prison.

Osaka Prison holds around 2500 male inmates. Their meals are cooked in
the prison's kitchen by about 40 inmates who undergo sanitary
inspections each month.

The health center closed the kitchen for 3 days starting 15 Dec 2011,
and the prison is now serving preserved food for use in emergencies.

[The etiology of the episode of presumed foodborne illness cannot be
readily assessed from the information available. Knowing the
incubation period between food ingestion and the onset of symptoms,
the specific symptoms, the presence or absence of fever and the length
of the illness can all be useful in suggesting a specific cause of
this outbreak that had an attack rate of about 44 percent.
