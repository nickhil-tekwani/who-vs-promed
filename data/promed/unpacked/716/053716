Economic crisis leads to re-emergence of rare disease
----------------------------------------------
Cases of konzo, an incurable disabling disease associated with high food
insecurity, were reported to be increasing in Bas-Congo, FAO said. In its
latest DRC food security update, received by IRIN on Monday, FAO said that
pressure caused by the economic crisis has led people in the area to reduce
the number of days they soak locally-grown bitter cassava, which was
insufficient to remove the high toxic cyanide content from the staple food
before it was consumed.
A report on WHO's web site says that konzo, a disease reported only from
poor rural communities in Africa, was known exclusively in areas
characterised by rapidly growing populations with insufficient household
food security, economic stagnation and severe agro-ecological problems.
Epidemics, the first of which was reported in Bandundu province in 1936,
have coincided with food shortages that led to protein-deficient diets and
shortcuts in cassava processing. Women of child-bearing age and children
aged between 3-13 years were at greatest risk of paralysis, it says. Even a
limited amount of relief food in konzo-affected areas may effectively reduce
cyanide exposure, the WHO report adds.

Section 4 IMPACT STUDIES
a) Reduction of Hydrogen Cyanide Contents in Cassava
Cassava is the most important food crop in the humid and semi-humid tropics
of Africa. The root contains glucosides called linamarin and lotaustralin.
The glucosides are hydrolized by the enzyme linamarase, with liberation of
cyanohydrins that can break down to highly toxic hydrogen cyanide.
When ingested, hydrogen cyanide ca
n lead to acute intoxication and death. Regular exposure to sublethal
quantities, ingested or inhaled during cooking, can cause epidemic spastic
parapesis, in central Africa known as 'konzo'; tropical ataxic neuropathy
(TAN); worsening of iodine deficiency disorders such as goiter and
cretinism; and risk of diabetes. An ACIAR-funded project aimed to reduce the
negative health impact of hydrogen cyanide in cassava in Africa. Lubulwa
(1995) makes an effort to evaluate the health benefits of this research.
The project's objectives were:
· developing a simple, semi-quantitative screening technique for cyanide
content;
· determining the influence of environmental and agronomic factors on
cyanide levels of cassava plants;
· screening cassava germplasm for low or zero cyanide varieties and
transferring these to IITA for incorporation in the cassava breeding
program, eliminating high cyanide varieties;
· determining the relationship between bitterness or sweetness and high or
low cyanide, and analyzing the chemicals causing bitter flavors;
· developing a cheap and simple method for estimating beta-carotene in
cassava, so breeders can combine high beta-carotene (vitamin A) and low
cyanide levels.
The objectives were met to varying extents. Scientists developed a simple
screening method for cyanide potential, and although there were some
reservations about it, it was subsequently improved. Progress was made in
determining the influence of environmental and agronomic factors, but this
topic needs further work. Genotypes were screened, and the ones containing
low cyanide levels were forwarded to IITA. The relationship between
bitterness and cyanide potential is complex. Cyanogenic glucose linamarin is
bitter, but the correlation between bitterness and cyanogenic potential does
not always hold, although bitter cultivars are more likely to be toxic. The
components causing bitterness in cassava have not been identified. This area
needs further work. A simple method for estimating carotenoids was
developed, to enhance the nutritional value of cassava.
Normally, bitter cultivars are processed, and traditional processing lowers
cyanide contents to safe levels. Because of changing socio-economic
situations, people are often unable to follow traditional preparation
methods because they tend to be very time consuming. This change in
preparation procedures leads to an increase of the related diseases. Also,
since bitter cultivars usually have higher yields, they account for a
growing share of cassava cultivation.
