Corn tar spot, 1st identified in the U.S. 3 years ago [ProMED-mail post 20150920.3658925], is now in 5 states. [It] has appeared in Illinois, Indiana, and more recently Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan.

Michigan State University's Martin Chilvers says tar spot is caused by a fungus originally found in Central America. "It's called _Phyllachora maydis_ and to date that's the only one we've found in the U.S. [see comments below]." [He says] the leaf disease does not seem to be a big yield concern as research continues. "So possibly this could just be a late-season disease that will have minimal impact on yield. But we'll just have to wait and see."

Chilvers says fungicide trials are ongoing in Central America and encourages growers to keep an eye out for Tar Spot. He adds the fungus is surviving on corn residue, so limiting that should be helpful.

[Tar spot of maize has been known to lead to serious yield losses of up to 75 per cent in Central and South America. It is considered to be a disease complex involving the synergistic association of at least 3 fungal species: _Phyllachora maydis_, _Microdochium maydis_ (previously _Monographella maydis_) and _Coniothyrium phyllachorae_.

Of these, _P. maydis_ is usually the 1st to cause leaf lesions. While _M. maydis_ is a common benign saprophyte on leaf surfaces, it becomes highly virulent only in association with _P. maydis_ and forms necrotic rings around the _P. maydis_ lesions. _C. phyllachorae_ may be a hyperparasite of the other 2, but its role is not fully understood yet. Leaf lesions may coalesce causing blight and complete burning of the foliage. In addition, characteristic black, shiny spots ("tar spots") are produced both within lesions and on other leaf areas. The disease reduces photosynthetic potential and therefore plant vigour. Affected ears have fewer kernels which may germinate prematurely on the cob.

_P. maydis_ is an obligate parasite; its spores are spread by wind and with infected plant material, and it produces a potent toxin, killing plant tissue. The disease is favoured by cool, humid conditions. Tar spot management may include fungicide treatments and use of maize varieties with tolerance or low sensitivity to the disease. However, resistance breeding is difficult because of the involvement of multiple pathogens, and little is known about the genetics of tar spot resistance.

In the US, tar spot was reported for the first time in 2015 from Indiana (ProMED-mail post 20150920.3658925). From the story above, it appears that so far only _P. maydis_ has been detected in affected areas which may account for the limited effect on yield reported here. The additional presence (either naturally or by introduction) of _M. maydis_ could be expected to lead to more severe yield losses and, therefore, this species would pose a risk to maize production
