The Ministry of Health has given assurances that in the next few days they
will have complete control over the outbreak of cholera that appeared during
the last three weeks in the Caracas central market of Coche. Until now,
there have been 28 cases and one death in the metropolitan area. The
Minister, Jose Felix Oletta, indicated that "95% of the persons affected came
from low-income families who exist in poor living conditions. In 6 of the
families, it was verified that they had scavenged discarded food from the
market, and 10 of the patients were workers in the market." Oletta said that
this outbreak began by the consumption of contaminated food probably by food
handlers (asymptomatic carriers), and later was spread by oral-fecal
contamination among family members. "50% of the cases were identified by the
health surveillance program of the ministry, and only 44% of the patients
needed hospitalization for rehydration."
As means of prevention and control, the minister announced "a prohibition on
the distribution of bivalves without bacteriological testing in the city of
Caracas", as well as the manual processing of bivalves in the area of the
market called "the beach". Also completed was a program of preventative
treatment of all workers in the market as well as those involved in food
transport in order to eliminate the probable existence of carriers of the
disease (during this program they succeed in discovering 4 cases of cholera).
Hygiene recommendations for the general public were again emphasized.
Since January of this year, there have been 1,454 cases of cholera and 41
deaths. The state of Zulia has reported the most with 711 followed by Merida
with 33 5 and Delta Amacuro with 315. In 1996, 269 cases were reported with
9 deaths.
