Situation update
----------------
Between 20 and 26 Aug 2021, European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries reported 15 human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection and one death related to WNV infections. Cases were reported by Greece (11), Hungary (2) and Romania (2). The death was reported by Greece. EU-neighbouring countries reported 3 human cases of WNV infection in Serbia and no deaths related to WNV infections.

According to media, 3 human cases of WNV infection were reported last week from the province of Seville, Spain. These cases will not appear in outputs, such as the WNV dashboard, maps and downloadable data file, until they are reported through The European Surveillance System (TESSy).

Since the beginning of the 2021 transmission season and as of 26 Aug 2021, EU/EEA countries have reported 43 human cases of WNV infection in Greece (25), Italy (11), Romania (3), Austria (2) and Hungary (2) and one death in Greece (1). EU-neighbouring countries have reported 6 human cases of WNV infection in Serbia (6) and 2 deaths in Serbia (2).

-------
Data on human cases are collected via The European Surveillance System (TESSy) managed by ECDC. Only locally acquired cases with known place of infection are included in this report. The following EU-neighbouring countries report human cases of WNV infection to ECDC: Albania, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey.

Animal data (i.e., outbreaks among equids and birds) are collected through the Animal Disease Information System (ADIS) of the European Commission. Reporting of WNV in equids and birds is mandatory at the EU/EEA level.

The distribution of human infections covers EU/EEA and EU-neighbouring countries, whereas outbreaks among equids and birds covers only EU/EEA countries.

*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.

[This weekly report provides an overview of West Nile virus (WNV) epidemiology in the EU/EEA and EU-neighbouring countries during the WNV transmission season (expected to be June-November). Following a One Health approach, WNV infections in humans and outbreaks in equids and birds are included in the report. Visit the dedicated webpages for more information on WNV infections and ECDC's seasonal WNV surveillance.

Since the beginning of the 2021 transmission season, 3 outbreaks among equids and no outbreaks among birds have been reported by EU/EEA countries. Outbreaks among equids have been reported by Spain (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/west-nile-virus-europe-2021-outbreaks-among-equids-andor-birds-updated-26-august). - Mod.UBA]

The Spain Ministry of Health and Families has confirmed the 1st West Nile virus fatality in a woman from Seville. The 75-year-old woman from Coria del Rio was hospitalized at the Virgen del Rocio hospital with severe meningoencephalitis.

Two other people from Seville contracted the mosquito-borne viral disease -- one is another resident of Coria del Rio, who is also hospitalized but whose sex or age has not been disclosed, and a 63-year-old woman living in Villamanrique de la Condesa, who is recovering at home after being discharged.

Seven people died last summer [2020] in an outbreak of meningoencephalitis caused by this virus in the provinces of Seville and Cadiz. It is transmitted by the bite of the mosquito of the genus _Culex_ that proliferates in the wetlands of the Guadalquivir River and, as the Epidemiological Surveillance Service recalls, there is no person-to-person transmission.

[Data from the regional surveillance networks and the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network, both for human and animal West Nile virus (WNV) infection, showed during the 2020 season a total of 77 human cases of WNV infection (median age, 65 years; 60% males) were detected in the southwest of Spain; 72 (94%) of these cases developed West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND), presenting as meningoencephalitis, 7 of which were fatal, as reported by Garcia et al (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.19.2002010). - Mod.UBA]

Three human cases of autochthonous West Nile virus (WNV) infection were detected in eastern Germany in August 2021. Two blood donations, both collected on 12 Aug 2021, in Berlin and Brandenburg, were found to be infected with West Nile virus (WNV) by RT-PCR. Both samples were found positive during blood donor infectious disease marker screening performed on all blood donations, which includes screening for WNV throughout spring and late autumn. One of the blood donors had been traveling to Denmark and Sweden in July 2021. The other blood donor had reported no travel history outside Germany in 2021.

A 3rd WNV case was diagnosed by diagnostic testing of a patient hospitalized in Berlin with encephalitis since 14 Aug 2021. Initial diagnosis was made by detection of WNV IgM in a serum sample collected on 18 Aug 2021. RT-PCR detection and WNV full genome sequencing was successful from a urine specimen collected on 20 Aug 2021. There was no reported travel history outside Germany.

In light of the detection of WNV in birds in Berlin (April) and Saxony-Anhalt (July and August) in 2021 (see database curated by the German federal research institute of animal health, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, at https://tsis.fli.de/Reports/Info.aspx), and the lack of available recent virus sequences from Germany or Europe, we want to share the WNV sequences obtained from these 3 patients.

The virus genomes are distinct from each other but highly similar to that of strains obtained from birds and humans in eastern Germany in 2018-2020 (GenBank accession no. LR743425, LR743426, and others).

We have submitted the complete coding region sequences to NCBI GenBank for immediate release (accession no. MZ964751, MZ964752, MZ964753).

[ProMED thanks Victor M. Corman for this important update on the recent human cases of WNV in Germany.

The above reports highlight that real-time surveillance of WNV infections is key to ensuring that clinicians and public health authorities receive early warning about the occurrence of cases and potential unusual seasonal patterns. Human cases may appear shortly after the 1st detection of animal cases. Therefore, public health authorities should develop preparedness plans before the occurrence of human or animal WNV infections. - Mod.UBA]
