Coccidioidomycosis in Workers at an Archeologic Site ---Dinosaur National
Monument, Utah, June--July 2001
------------------
Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by inhalation of airborne
_Coccidioides immitis_ spores that are present in the arid soil of the
southwestern United States, California, and parts of Central and South
America. Infection with _C. immitis_ previously has not been diagnosed in
patients outside these areas, except in travelers returning from areas
where the disease is endemic (1).
This report describes an outbreak of coccidioidomycosis in workers at an
archeologic site in northeastern Utah during June--July, 2001, and
represents the first identification of coccidioidomycosis in northern Utah.
Health-care providers should consider coccidioidomycosis in the
differential diagnosis for patients with compatible illness who reside in
or recently have traveled to this area. Interventions to minimize soil
disturbance and dust inhalation can reduce the risk for coccidioidomycosis.
Dinosaur National Monument (DNM) encompasses 320 square miles in
northeastern Utah and northwestern Colorado; 397 800 persons visited DNM in
2000 (Figure 1). On 18 Jun 2001, under the direction of National Park
Service (NPS) archeologists, 6 student volunteers and 2 leaders began work
at an archeologic site in DNM. Work included laying stone steps, building a
retaining wall, and sifting dirt for artifacts. Peak dust exposure occurred
on 19 Jun 2001, the day most sifting occurred. Workers did not wear
protective facemasks. During 29 Jun -- 3 July 2001, all 8 team members and
2 NPS archeologists who had worked at the site sought medical care at a
local hospital emergency department for respiratory and systemic symptoms.
All 10 persons had diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs; 8
were hospitalized with pneumonia of unknown etiology. Pending
investigation, NPS closed the work site to all visitors and staff, and the
TriCounty Health Department alerted the public. On 2 Jul 2001, the
TriCounty Health Department, the Utah Department of Health, and CDC
initiated an investigation to identify the risk factors, cause, and extent
of the outbreak.
During 2-4 Jul 2001, a total of 18 persons (the 8 team members and 10
archeologists) with potential exposure to dust at the work site in June
were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire to determine symptoms
and previous activities. Hospital records were reviewed to ascertain
clinical information. A case was defined as an illness with onset of at
least 2 selected symptoms (i.e., self-reported fever, difficulty breathing,
and cough) after 18 Jun 2001 in a person working at DNM.
Illness in 10 persons, including all 8 team members and 2 NPS
archeologists, met the case definition. Median age was 17 years (range:
16--29 years). Illness onset occurred during June 28 Jun -- 1 Jul 2001. The
most common symptoms included difficulty breathing (10), fever (10), cough
(9), fatigue (8), shortness of breath (7), myalgia (6), and generalized
skin rash (6). All 10 persons present at the work site on 19 Jun 2001 had
illness that met the case definition, compared with none of the 8 who did
not work that day (Fisher exact p-value=0.00002). One ill person had
visited the work site only on 19 Jun 2001 and had illness onset on 29 Jun
2001.
Results of blood cultures from the hospitalized persons were negative for
bacterial pathogens. Initial serologic tests were negative for antibodies
to _Francisella tularensis_, _Yersinia pestis_, Mycoplasma species,
_Histoplasma capsulatum_, and _C. immitis_. On further analysis, using
serum specimens concentrated 3--5 fold in an assay that detects IgM
antibodies (immunodiffusion tube precipitin), 9 of the 10 acute serum
specimens from patients contained IgM antibodies to _C. immitis_,
confirming the diagnosis of acute coccidioidomycosis (2). All hospitalized
patients were treated with fluconazole. The average length of hospital stay
was 1.5 days.
Because approximately 60 percent of infections with _C. immitis_ are
asymptomatic, a serosurvey of park employees was conducted during 15-17 Aug
2001 to identify other infected persons and to guide prevention and control
measures (1,3). Of the 40 park employees participating in the serosurvey, 3
(7.5%) reported "flu-like illness" since June. None of the 40 had
detectable IgM or IgG antibodies to _C. immitis_. These results suggest
that infection with _C. immitis_ during the preceding 12 weeks was unlikely
(2,4).
Investigation of the work site on 3 Jul 2001 revealed a desert environment
with the ground covered with bedonite, a fine, alkaline soil that can
provide a conducive environment for _C. immitis_ spores. NPS is working
with the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct mycologic studies of the soil
(M. Bultman, personal communication, October 2001).
On 24 Aug 2001, the state and local health departments jointly recommended
that employees minimize soil disturbance and dust inhalation (e.g.,
watering down the soil and wearing National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health [NIOSH-approved N95 respirators) at the work site to
reduce their risk for _C. immitis_ infection. During 24--27 Sep 2001, 4 NPS
employees completed work on the retaining wall and steps. Subsequently, one
developed respiratory illness consistent with coccidioidomycosis and
laboratory evidence of acute infection (IgM and rising titer of IgG to _C.
immitis_).
The site reopened on 28 Sep 2001. NPS guidelines advise DNM visitors to
stay on maintained trails to avoid raising dust or stepping on native soil.
Visitors' risk for infection with _C. immitis_ should be minimal because
their exposure to inhaled dust is substantially lower than that experienced
by the persons in this outbreak. However, additional measures are being
considered to minimize risk for visitors, including warnings to avoid the
site when wind conditions are conducive to dust exposure. Surveillance is
ongoing at area hospitals.

Editorial Note:
DNM is located approximately 200 miles north of the area of Utah where _C.
immitis_ is endemic. Soil disturbances can aerosolize _C. immitis_ spores
(arthroconidia) and result in coccidioidomycosis outbreaks (5). Other
ground disturbing activities, such as construction or archeology digs, may
increase the risk for infection (3,6). A similar point-source outbreak of
coccidioidomycosis occurred in 1970 among archeology students in an area of
northern California where _C. immitis_ was not known to be endemic. In both
of these outbreaks, a high attack rate of symptomatic infection was
reported (7).
Symptoms of acute coccidioidomycosis include fever, headache, rash, muscle
aches, dry cough, weight loss, and malaise. Most infections are
asymptomatic or self-limited and resolve without antimicrobial treatment in
patients with healthy immune systems. In rare instances, severe lung
disease or disseminated infection can develop in patients; susceptibility
is higher in immunocompromised persons, pregnant women, and persons of
African or Asian descent (8).
Because infection with _C. immitis_ results in long-term immunity, the
coccidioidin or spherulin skin test, which detects T-cell mediated delayed
type hypersensitivity to _C. immitis_, is the best method to screen for
past infection (3). However, the coccidioidin skin test is not available in
the United States. Therefore, a serosurvey was used to assess for
subclinical cases of infection in this outbreak. In previous studies of
asymptomatic persons who had positive skin tests, 7 percent had positive
serologies; the time of exposure in those persons was unknown (4). The
sensitivity of the serologic test is low for remote past infection and
unknown for recent asymptomatic infection (4). Therefore, this
investigation was unable to establish the prevalence of previous infection
among tested NPS employees.
In settings where coccidioidomycosis outbreaks have occurred, measures to
minimize soil disturbance and dust inhalation reduce the risk for
inhalation of _C. immitis_ spores (3,6). The most recent case indicates an
ongoing risk for infection at the site associated with this outbreak and
the importance of adherence to recommendations for respiratory protection
(e.g., NIOSH-approved N95 respirators that are properly fitted and
consistently worn) when dust exposure is unavoidable.
The outbreak in this location indicates that areas where _C. immitis_ is
endemic may extend farther north than previously documented. Surveillance
should be continued in these areas. In addition, health-care providers
should be alert for coccidioidomycosis cases in persons who reside in or
have traveled to these areas and who may have been exposed to dust from
disturbed soil.
