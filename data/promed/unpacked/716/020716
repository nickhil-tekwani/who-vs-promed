[1] Case update
- Sun 19 Aug 2018. Epidemiological situation report, 18 Aug 2018, DRC Ministry of Health
[in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=793d5e7266

- A total of 91 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 64 confirmed and 27 probable.
- 12 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 1 new confirmed case in Mabalako, which is a known and followed probable case contact.
- 1 confirmed case death in Mabalako.

News of the response
Monitoring and follow-up of contacts
------------------------------------
- Investigations by field epidemiologists have already invalidated several probable cases (or historical deaths) in the Mabalako area. This means that these historic deaths were not caused by the Ebola outbreak. Thus, several hundred contacts registered for these probable cases have been cleaned from the list of registered contacts. To date, surveillance teams have registered 1609 contacts to follow. The invalidated probable cases will be officially removed from the summary table later when the investigations are completed.

- Of these contacts to be followed, there are 41 who are in a red zone to which the surveillance teams do not have access because of the security situation. Of these 41 contacts, 15 were able to travel to Beni to facilitate their follow-up and the organization of their vaccination. For the other contacts who remained in the red zone, the nursing staff of the on-site health center work with the community relays to ensure their follow-up and transmit the data daily to the coordination by phone.

Vaccination
-----------
Immunization activities continue at the 3 sites of Mabalako, Beni and Mandima. Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 873 people have been vaccinated , including 467 in Mabalako, 256 in Beni, and 150 in Mandima.

[This report raises a number of questions. It states that "several probable cases (or historical deaths) in the Mabalako area" are not due to Ebola. The determination of these cases not being Ebola was through investigations by field epidemiologists, and they won't be removed from the summary table "until the investigation is completed". Are their sera being tested against a complete panel of agents in the laboratory to identify an etiologic agent? There are many pathogens active in the region plus environmental issues that could cause similar symptoms. If not Ebola, it would be good to know what else is causing disease and even death.

Of the 873 people vaccinated, how many are healthcare workers, and how many are contacts? - Mod.LK]

- Sun 19 Aug 2018. Ebola crisis worsens in Congo, health workers infected
[The Hill, edited]
http://thehill.com/policy/international/402553-ebola-crisis-worsens-in-congo-health-workers-infected

At least 10 healthcare workers have been infected with the deadly Ebola virus as they battle an outbreak in an eastern province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, officials said over the weekend [18-19 Aug 2018], as concerns mount that the number of cases is growing faster than public health officials can respond.

The Congolese Health Ministry said [Fri 17 Aug 2018] that at least 90 people had been infected in several regions of North Kivu province and neighboring Ituri province. 49 people have died, including 1 of the 10 healthcare workers who had been infected.

The Health Ministry and the World Health Organization expect more cases to emerge in the coming weeks. The Ebola virus disease carries an incubation period of up to 21 days, meaning it can take as long as 3 weeks for an infected person to show symptoms.

Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva, told The Hill that health officials had identified more than 1500 people who had come into contact with a possible or confirmed Ebola patient.

Health officials will monitor those contacts for 3 weeks to make sure they are quickly cared for -- or quarantined -- if they show symptoms. But, Jasarevic said, the full number of potential contacts are not yet known. "We're at a critical moment where we are not yet sure we have all the chains of transmission identified," he said.

Those tasked with contact tracing, including employees of the Ministry of Health, the WHO and other non-governmental organizations like Doctors Without Borders [MSF], face a challenge in North Kivu province unlike any they have faced during previous Ebola outbreaks. The province is home to about 8 million people, including as many as a million internally displaced people who live in refugee camps, after fleeing their homes in the face of clashes between rival ethnic groups.

North Kivu province sits on the border with Uganda, and the region's largest city, Beni, has been hit by bombings carried out by Islamic militants from across the border.

Jasarevic acknowledged the uncertain security situation has meant that contact tracers cannot reach every corner of the province. Those "blind spots," he warned, could give the virus a chance to spread.

WHO has sent virus-hunters to Beni and Mangina. Doctors Without Borders last week opened an Ebola treatment center in Mangina. On [Thu 16 Aug 2018], the group said it was treating 37 patients at the center -- including some of those healthcare workers.

"Among our patients, we have several colleagues from the Congolese health system," said Gwenola Seroux, the Doctors Without Borders [MSF] official coordinating the response to the outbreak. "They were the first to respond, and some were exposed to the virus."

Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA, said the fact that healthcare workers had been infected is a significant and troubling development. In Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where an outbreak that began in 2014 killed at least 11 300 people, already-vulnerable public health systems were decimated as doctors, nurses, midwives, and other health professionals came down with the virus.

"Healthcare workers are at the front line and extremely vulnerable to infection. They work in poor conditions, often without personal protective equipment [PPE], and thus [are] often exposed before an outbreak is detected," Rimoin said. "The reason this is so important is because healthcare workers can easily propagate disease given that they have contact with many sick people and their own families."

The Ministry of Health and other responders have begun administering a vaccine meant to protect against the Ebola virus, and healthcare workers are the first to receive those vaccines. None of the more than 3000 people who received the vaccine in another outbreak earlier this year [2018], in Congo's Equateur province, came down with the virus, a promising sign.

A team of researchers, based in Kinshasa and overseen by Rimoin, is in North Kivu province keeping tabs on the vaccine's efficacy.

The outbreak in North Kivu is already significantly worse than the one that hit Equateur province earlier this year [2018]. By the time the Ministry of Health declared that outbreak contained in July, 53 people had contracted the Ebola virus, and 29 had died.

Only days after the end of the outbreak in Equateur province, Congolese health officials alerted the WHO that at least 20 people had already died from the new outbreak in North Kivu. The virus likely started to spread after the funeral of one of the 1st victims, a woman in Mangina. Several relatives who attended the funeral, and who probably washed and dressed the body for the afterlife, began showing symptoms just days later. ...[more]

[And now bombing is taking place on the border with Uganda, in the largest city in the region, Beni. This will exacerbate border control making it even more difficult to limit where individuals cross the border so they can be checked for fever and other signs of illness.

The number of deaths among the healthcare workers (HCWs) is concerning, as these individuals are vital to the community. While many of these HCWs may have become infected prior to knowing Ebola was active in the region, it is critical all HCW are vaccinated and supplied with appropriate PPE to protect them and the patients they serve. - Mod.LK]

[Dakar/Paris, 18 Jun 2018. It was announced that "the medical humanitarian organization ALIMA (The Alliance for International Medical Action) will open an Ebola treatment center equipped, for the 1st time, with biosecure emergency care units, in Itipo in the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)."

And from the tweet above, it appears they are now working in Beni. A good sign.

Biosecure Emergency Care Units for Outbreaks (CUBE), are certified P4 isolation units designed for the treatment of patients suffering from highly infectious diseases with serious potential for outbreaks. ... The CUBE offers the added advantage of needing fewer medical personnel. It reduces the risk of exposure and contamination, and requires fewer medical materials. Medical personnel benefit from being able to work comfortably, protected from contamination without needing to wear personal protective equipment.

In the event that the outbreak spreads, the CUBE has been designed to be easily transportable, and can be decontaminated, disassembled, and reinstalled in other areas if needed (excerpted from https://tinyurl.com/yaq3pav2). - Mod.LK

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract. The structural features that govern broad-spectrum activity of broadly neutralizing, anti-ebolavirus antibodies (Abs) are currently unknown. Here we describe the 1st structure of a broadly neutralizing human Ab, ADI-15946, in complex with cleaved Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV GPCL). We find that ADI-15946 employs structural mimicry of a conserved interaction between the GP core and the glycan cap B17-B18 loop to inhibit infection. Both endosomal proteolysis of EBOV GP and binding of monoclonal Ab (mAb) FVM09 displace this loop, increase exposure of its conserved epitope and potentiate neutralization. Our work also illuminated the determinants of the reduced activity of ADI-15946 against Sudan virus (SUDV), and enabled rational, structure-guided engineering to enhance binding and neutralization against SUDV while retaining the parental breadth of activity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract. All available experimental vaccines and immunotherapeutics against Ebola virus (EBOV), including rVSV-ZEBOV and ZMapp, lack activity against other ebolaviruses associated with human disease outbreaks. This year [2018], 2 separate outbreaks of EBOV in the Democratic Republic of Congo underscored the unpredictable nature of ebolavirus reemergence in a region that has historically experienced outbreaks of the divergent ebolaviruses Sudan virus (SUDV) and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV). Here we show that MBP134 AF, a pan-ebolavirus therapeutic comprising 2 broadly neutralizing human antibodies (bNAbs) (see companion manuscript, Wec et al) could protect against lethal EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV infection in ferrets and nonhuman primates (NHPs). MBP134-AF not only establishes a viable therapeutic countermeasure to outbreaks caused by antigenically diverse ebolaviruses but also affords unprecedented effectiveness and potency: a single 25-mg/kg dose was fully protective in NHPs. This best-in-class antibody cocktail is the culmination of an intensive collaboration spanning academia, industry and government in response to the 2013-2016 EBOV epidemic and provides a translational research model for the rapid development of immunotherapeutics targeting emerging infectious diseases
