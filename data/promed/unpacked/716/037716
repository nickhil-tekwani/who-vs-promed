Strangles outbreak in Adelaide Hills
------------------------------------
TRSA Veterinary Surgeon, Dr R Robinson, has visited stables in the Hills
area to investigate a veterinary practitioner's reporting of a strangles case.
Dr Robinson reported, "The trainer concerned has been proactive in
instigating responsible management systems in an effort to contain the
disease. Details of recent movements of stock to and from the property have
been provided and this tracking process will be evaluated closely to assist
in the management of the situation."
"The trainer has been advised that the property has been quarantined in
accordance with the rules." Dr Robinson advises trainers to be cautious of
horses with excessive nasal discharge, elevated temperatures, swelling in
the jaw, and coughing and requests that trainers report any suspicious
cases to TRSA or their veterinary practitioner (TRSA Stewards Media Release).

[The infectious disease strangles is a caused by the bacterium
_Streptococcus equi_. In horses, the disease causes swollen lymph nodes and
a nasal discharge that may resemble pus. The lymph nodes may swell and
burst, thus spreading more bacteria. The horse may be lethargic and anorectic.
The disease is spread through objects such as water troughs, feed buckets,
brushes, reins, and other equipment, if contaminated with infected pus.
Recovered horses can spread the disease for up to 8 or 10 months, even
though they can appear clinically healthy and normal.
There are vaccines available for preventing the disease. Most often
antibiotics are used when horses have the disease. Horses need rest and
should be isolated from other horses if they have the disease. - Mod.TG]
