Influenza and acute respiratory viral infections morbidity overview -
Ukraine (Donetsk Oblast)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 cases of influenza [pandemic] A/H1N1 and 3 fatalities
have been officially registered in the Donetsk Oblast. There were
5007 visits to health care facilities recently. Since the start of
the epidemic in Ukraine (30 Oct 2009) 62 486 people, including 24 452
children, sought medical care in the Donetsk Oblast, and 2815
patients have been hospitalized. There were 3 fatalities and tissue
samples are being tested for etiological diagnosis. The results of
express diagnostic tests show that the majority of flu-like diseases
are caused by influenza A virus, however only 3 [pandemic?] influenza
A/H1N1 have been confirmed.

Several local and regional bodies have been created to oversee the
epidemic control measures. The sanitary epidemiological service
conducts on-the-spot inspections. So far 814 incidents have been
inspected and contravention of epidemic control measures, such as
absence of masks or disinfection procedures, has been identified in
every 5th case. 164 violation fines have been imposed and the work of
22 units has been suspended.
