The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has warned farmers across Punjab against the attack of foot rot disease in basmati [varieties of] rice. According to Dr Narinder Singh, foot rot is an important disease of basmati rice. After transplanting in the field, infected plants are killed after a few days. Pinkish growth of the fungus appears on the lower sheaths.

Dr Singh said the crop remains free from this disease if farmers have followed the seed and root dip treatment of nursery seedlings as per PAU recommendations. Attack of this disease has been seen in the fields of farmers who transplant basmati early and have not done root dip treatments. If this disease is not controlled, it will reduce the yield to a great extent. There is no treatment after the disease has appeared in the field. When the diseased plants are noticed, they should be rogued out [removed].

[Fungal foot rot (also called bakanae disease) of rice is caused by _Gibberella fujikuroi_ and can cause significant crop losses of up to 50%. The fungus also affects other crops, including barley, maize, sorghum, sugarcane, tomato, banana, and cowpea. Symptoms on rice may include abnormal growth patterns (such as highly elongated tillers), reduced tillering, and partially filled or empty seed heads. Diseased plants show yellow-green discolouration; their leaves dry up quickly and they may be distributed irregularly in a field. Infected seedlings with necrotic lesions on roots may die before or after transplanting from seedbeds.

The fungus infects plants through roots or crowns and later becomes systemic. Seeds are usually infected during the flowering stage, and the disease is primarily seed borne. The fungus survives under adverse conditions in infected seeds and diseased plant parts. Disease management is difficult and may include use of certified clean seeds and fungicides (such as seed treatments or root dips, as mentioned above); however, rapid development of pathogen resistance has been observed.

A different foot rot disease of rice can be caused by several species of bacteria in the genus _Dickeya_. These pathogens can also affect other crops, causing, for example, blackleg and bacterial soft rot of potato (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Traditional rice cultivars previously grown across northern India have largely been replaced by basmati (aromatic long grain) varieties. Some basmatis have shown a higher sensitivity to certain pathogens, for example to rice blast (_Pyricularia oryzae_; ProMED-mail post 20160407.4145967).
