The outbreak of vesicular stomatitis that affected hundreds of horses across Colorado and Texas is considered over, American authorities have reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

No new cases of the disease have been reported since early December 2014, according to Dr John Clifford, who is deputy administrator for Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which is part of the US Department of Agriculture.

Clifford told the OIE in the 28th and final report to the OIE on the outbreak, dated [29 DEC 2014], that a comprehensive epidemiological investigation into the outbreak had been completed.

"All premises previously under quarantine in Nebraska and Texas have been released," he said. "All the remaining premises under quarantine in Colorado will be released 21 days after lesions of all affected animals on the premises have healed.

"This VSV [vesicular stomatitis virus] event is considered closed."

The report officially brings to an end the worst recorded outbreak of the disease, which has symptoms similar to foot-and-mouth disease, in the United States.

The latest situation report on the APHIS website, dated [24 Dec 2014], shows that 433 premises were affected in the outbreak, with 370 of them in Colorado, 62 of them in Texas, and one in Nebraska.

In all, 644 horses and cattle were affected in the outbreak.

A total of 584 horses were infected, all of them in either Colorado (495) or Texas (89). November's [2014] 4 positive cases in Nebraska involved cattle.

Colorado had 48 cases involving cattle and Texas had 8.

APHIS said cases had been reported in the following counties since the outbreak began in May [2014]:

Colorado: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Douglas, Elbert, El Paso, Fremont, Huerfano, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Otero, Pueblo, Sedgwick, and Weld counties.

Texas: Bastrop, Falls, Guadalupe, Hidalgo, Jim Wells, Kinney, Lee, McLennan, Nueces, San Patricio, Travis, Val Verde, and Williamson counties.

Nebraska: Wheeler County.

Of the 433 premises across the states that were positive for the disease, 403 were positive equine premises, 27 were cattle premises, and 3 housed both cattle and horses.

[It is nice to know that since winter has descended upon much of the USA, the vesicular stomatitis outbreak has ended. The insects (biting gnats, culicoids, mosquitoes) that may carry this virus have finally been affected by the cold weather and the ability to spread this malady has ended for 2104. - Mod.TG
