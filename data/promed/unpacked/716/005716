Wheat stem rust is widespread on wild barley and has appeared in check
plots of susceptible spring wheats in the upper Midwest. Leaf rust is less
severe than last year on spring wheat in the upper Midwest; winter wheat
became severely rusted by soft dough stage. Stripe rust is widespread on
winter wheat in South Dakota. Barley stripe rust is severe enough to
warrant fungicide sprays in eastern Washington fields.
The small grain harvest has commenced from southwestern New York to
northern South Dakota. Winter wheat is generally in good condition and 1-2
weeks ahead of normal maturity throughout most of the U.S. In the northern
small grain area, the spring-sown grains are ahead of normal crop
development and in some wheat fields near the Red River of the North they
are under stress because of too much water.
Wheat stem rust. By the first week in July, trace-20% stem rust severities
were observed on the susceptible spring wheat varieties Baart and Morocco
in central Minnesota and eastern South Dakota plots. In the same south
central Minnesota plots on 22 Jun, only traces were observed on Baart
wheat. The rust development was due to spores which were deposited with
rains in early to mid-June. During the third week in June, most of the stem
rust development was found on the leaves and by the first week in July,
stem rust was found on both leaves and stems.
By late June, 20% stem rust severities were reported in plots of
susceptible winter wheat cultivars, e.g., 2174, in east central South
Dakota and east central Minnesota. In winter wheat fields in northern
Kansas and southern Nebraska, wheat stem rust developed late and since most
of the wheat cultivars are early maturing they escaped the stem rust. The
southern and central Great Plains, where the winters were mild this year,
provided spores for susceptible wheats farther north. In much of the
northern Great Plains the recent temperatures have been near normal and
moisture has been ideal for the spore infection process to occur.
As in 1999, the number of stem rust samples received at the Cereal Disease
Lab this year is twice as great as in recent years. The increased severity
of stem rust can be attributed to the large amount of inoculum produced on
susceptible winter wheat cultivars, e.g. 2137, farther south in the Central
Plains and to the temperature and moisture, which have been ideal for stem
rust infection in the Northern Plains this year. If current spring wheat
cultivars were susceptible to stem rust, a serious epidemic with
substantial yield losses would occur.
Wheat leaf rust. During the final week in June, leaf rust on winter wheat
was moderate in central and western South Dakota and moderate to severe in
eastern South Dakota. Susceptible cultivars like Alliance, Jagger, TAM 107
and Rose had 100% severities at the soft dough maturity stage in east
central South Dakota varietal plots. The rust infections in South Dakota
probably originated from inoculum sources in Oklahoma and Kansas. As in
previous years winter wheat flag leaves dried up quickly because of leaf
rust and hot windy conditions throughout South Dakota.
During the first week in July, leaf rust severities of 60% were reported on
the flag leaves of susceptible spring wheat cultivars, e.g., 2375, and
Oxen, in south central Minnesota plots. In fields, severities ranged from
trace to 10% on the lower leaves of spring wheats in western Minnesota and
eastern South Dakota. This year, leaf rust is not as severe and
concentrated in the Upper Midwest as last year. Less inoculum arrived from
the south, but weather conditions still favored infection. The spring wheat
cultivars currently grown are more susceptible than those planted 10 years ago.
In late June, susceptible winter wheat cultivars had leaf rust severities
ranging from 20-50% in southeastern North Dakota plots. In early July,
wheat leaf rust was increasing on spring wheats in eastern Washington
fields and susceptible wheats in nurseries had 60-70% severities.
Wheat stripe rust. In late June, wheat stripe rust was widespread in
central and eastern South Dakota on winter wheat. In plots at Brookings,
some winter wheat plots had a high level of infection, e.g., 80% on
Siouxland. Traces of stripe rust were found easily in spring wheat fields
and nursery plots. In foci centers, 30% severities were observed in some
spring varieties and lines. By the later part of the first week in July,
stripe rust development had slowed in South Dakota because of the hot
temperatures during the day and temperatures at night that were greater
than 60 degrees.
By late June, wheat stripe rust was starting to increase on spring wheats
in the Pacific Northwest, and the susceptible cultivars were sprayed with
fungicides. Rust losses will be minimal, since most of the cultivars have
high temperature, adult plant resistance.
Oat stem rust. During late June, 1% oat stem rust severities were found in
commercial fields in south central Wisconsin and trace-5% severities were
reported in plots in south central Minnesota and east central South Dakota.
In general, oat stem rust is more scattered than last year on the same
date, throughout the northern oat-growing area.
Oat crown rust. By early July, 40% severities were observed on flag leaves
of oat in south central Minnesota plots, while in fields 1-5% severities
were found on the lower leaves. In early July, crown rust had developed
very slowly at east central South Dakota and west central Minnesota
nurseries with trace to 20% severities on lower leaves of cultivars at the
milk growth stage.
In late June, crown rust severities were more severe and infections earlier
than normal on susceptible oat yield plots at Guelph, Canada.
Barley stem rust. In early July, 5% stem rust severities were observed on
10% of the plants of the 2 row barley Hypana, in west and south central
Minnesota plots. No stem rust was found on barleys with the T-gene, e.g.,
Robust.
In mid-July, 10% stem rust severities were reported on wild barley
(_Hordeum jubatum_) growing alongside the roadway in eastern South Dakota
and west central Minnesota. The last 2 years stem rust observed on wild
barley was very extensive throughout the northern Great Plains. The rust
developed early on the wild barley because of the early spring and
resulting earlier maturity of the wild barley. In general, the barleys are
more susceptible to stem rust as they mature. If current spring wheat
cultivars were susceptible to stem rust, the stem rust on wild barley would
be a significant source of inoculum and substantial yield losses would occur.
Barley leaf rust. In early July, 40% severities were reported on lower
leaves in spring barley plots in south and east central Minnesota and east
central South Dakota.
In late June, barley leaf rust was moderate on winter barley yield plots
and was starting to appear on susceptible spring barley near winter barley
strips at the Guelph, Canada research station.
Stripe rust on barley. By late June, stripe rust on barley was starting to
increase on spring barley in eastern Washington and susceptible cultivars
were rated from 20 to 50% in plots. Fields of susceptible cultivars were
sprayed with fungicides and rust losses will be minimal.
Barley crown rust. In late June, traces of crown rust were found in plots
and fields in eastern South Dakota and in south central and east central
Minnesota plots.
Rye leaf rust. By early July, 40% leaf rust severities were found on upper
leaves of spring rye in plots in southern and west central Minnesota.
Rye stem rust. There have been no new reports of rye stem rust since CRB #3
<http://www.cdl.umn.edu/CRB/2000CRB/00crb3.html>.
Stem rust on Barberry. There have been no new reports of stem rust on
barberry since CRB #6 <http://www.cdl.umn.edu/CRB/2000CRB/00crb6.html>.
