One more person has died of Rift Valley fever, driving the overall
death toll of the disease in South Africa since 13 Feb 2010, to 12,
the country's authorities announced on Wednesday [28 Apr 2010]. The
South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)
said the latest death had occurred in the Western Cape Province. The
person was from the Oudtshoorn area, an official with the NICD said.
This was the 1st Rift Valley fever death in the Western Cape in the
current outbreak.

The disease has affected thousands of farm animals and 150 people in
the Free State, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, and North West
provinces, according to the South African Press Association (SAPA).
In humans, the disease was mostly associated with people who had
direct contact with blood or tissues of infected animals, SAPA
reported. The majority of those affected were people working on
farms, veterinary workers, and workers in abattoirs. The fever is
associated with mild, flu-like symptoms. [While most human cases are
relatively mild, a small percentage of patients develop a much more
severe form of the disease. This usually appears as one or more of 3
distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease (0.5-2 percent of patients),
meningoencephalitis (less than 1 percent) or haemorrhagic fever (less
than 1 percent). - Mod.CP]
