Greek health officials have reported 21 additional confirmed human West Nile virus (WNV) cases during the past week, bringing the country total to 43 in 2018. Of the total, 35 presented with neuro-invasive disease (WNND, encephalitis and/or meningitis and/or acute flaccid paralysis) and 8 cases with mild symptoms (febrile syndrome). No deaths have been reported.

In Europe, since the beginning of the 2018 transmission season, as of 2 Aug 2018, 111 human cases have been reported in the European Union/European Economic Area member states. Italy reported 51 cases, including 2 deaths, Greece 43 cases, Hungary 10 cases, and Romania 7 cases. 70 human cases, including 4 deaths, have been reported in countries neighboring the EU, all by Serbia.

Europe's 2018 transmission season started earlier than usual and higher case numbers have been reported compared with the same period in previous years, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. All human cases reported during the current transmission season were reported in previously affected countries.

[Overall WNV activity is increasing in Europe, with cases reported from many countries including Greece. An early start of the transmission season can affect the vector control efforts. However, the presence of a surveillance system for vectorborne diseases, including WNV, is precisely the mechanism that can detect early cases and alert public health officials to modify their response plans accordingly. - Mod.UBA
