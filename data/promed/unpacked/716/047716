Egypt on Saturday [24 Jul 2010] announced the 110th discovered bird
flu [avian influenza A(H5N1)] case in the country, saying the
patient's condition is "critical."

"A 20-year-old female was transferred to Sadr al-Abbasiya Hospital in
Cairo, as she was suffering from high temperature and breathing
difficulties," Health Ministry Spokesman Dr. Abdulrahman Shahin told
reporters. The patient has been medicated with Tamiflu and is still
under supervision, he noted.

Egypt had taken preventive measures to contain the pandemic since its
outbreak in 2006, including restraints on mobilizing live birds
between provinces, as well as banning the slaughtering of birds
outside allocated locations, among other precautions.
