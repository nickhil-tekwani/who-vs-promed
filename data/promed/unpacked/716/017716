South Africa pauses AstraZeneca vaccine rollout amid variant COVID questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
South Africa recently received 1 million doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine and was poised to start vaccinating healthcare workers, but yesterday [7 Feb 2021], health officials announced a pause for the rollout to investigate early findings that it offered little protection against mild-to-moderate disease caused by variant 501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351 that's dominant in the country.

New questions about the vaccine come as World Health Organization (WHO) advisers this week consider it for emergency use listing, which if approved, would pave the way for lower income countries to receive their 1st doses through the COVAX program. The 1st shipments through COVAX depend on 350 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine.

Incomplete picture of severe outcome impacts
----------------------------------------------
The new findings, from a submitted preprint, come from researchers in South Africa and the United Kingdom. The study included 2000 volunteers with a median age of 31. Along with minimal protection against mild-to-moderate illness, they also found that viral neutralization against variant 501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351 was substantially less when compared to the standard virus.

However, the team said they couldn't assess protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, because the study's target population was younger and at low risk for those outcomes.

In a press release from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, the team said efforts are underway at Oxford to produce a 2nd-generation version of the vaccine that targets variants that are similar to 501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351.

Andrew Pollard, MBBS, PhD, chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said the study confirms that the virus will find ways to continue to spread in vaccinated populations, as expected, but promising results from other vaccine trials in South Africa using a similar virus vector suggest vaccines will still help ease the burden on health systems by preventing severe disease.

At a WHO briefing today [8 Feb 2021], Salim Abdool Karim, MD, PhD, co-chair of South Africa's COVID-19 advisory committee, said concerns about vaccine efficacy against the variant 501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351 deepened after Novavax reported 89% efficacy in the United Kingdom, but only 49% in South Africa.

He said officials paused the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine rollout to gather more clinical data to better understand the vaccine's effect, especially given the uncertainty about the impact on severe disease.

He said there are several caveats about the new South African trial findings, including that the number of participants was small and that confidence intervals were wide, with a 60% upper boundary range that approached the overall efficacy finding of the wider phase 3 study. He also said the dosing interval in the study was short, compared to newer longer intervals that have been proposed by AstraZeneca to improve immune response.

One proposal South African officials are considering is a stepped rollout, which would involve vaccinating an initial 100 000 people to monitor the vaccine's impact on severe disease, Abdool Karim said.

The variant 501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351 was first found in South Africa, where it currently makes up 80%-90% of cases. Along with the P1 variant detected in Brazil, it contains the E484K mutation, which is thought to help SARS-CoV-2 evade immunity to vaccines and natural infection. Scientists in the United Kingdom recently reported that a small number of B117 variants have developed the E484K mutation, raising wider concerns that ongoing evolutionary changes may dampen the impact of vaccination.

WHO advisors weigh emergency use
--------------------------------
At today's [8 Feb 2021] briefing, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the group's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) met today to review the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, and that tomorrow he will meet with SAGE's chair to discuss its recommendations.

In the next few days, the WHO expects to make a decision about emergency use listing of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, which would be its 2nd, behind the one from Pfizer-BioNTech. The emergency use would pertain to the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine made at 2 sites, one at India's Serum Institute and the other at SK Bioscience in South Korea.

Tedros said it's increasingly clear that manufacturers will have to adjust to virus evolution, taking the latest variants into account for future vaccines, including booster shots, similar to the process of updating flu vaccines. He said it's vital for countries to continue to report variants to the WHO, which is expanding its mechanism to provide guidance to manufacturers and countries.

Seth Berkley, MD, chief executive officer with Gavi, said as science evolves, health officials are learning more as they work with the vaccines and noted that discussions like the one underway now about the AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa are expected. He said there may also be changes in the way vaccines are used and in the make-up of the vaccines.

He said while officials wait for the SAGE guidance, it looks like the AstraZeneca vaccine is efficacious and has been reviewed by a number of stringent regulatory agencies, and officials expect to continue to rollout the vaccine for COVAX while monitoring further studies.

Richard Hatchett, MD, chief executive officer for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), said at today's briefing that CEPI has announced more funding for studies to optimize and extend the use of existing vaccines, which could involve "mix and match" strategies to improve immune response.

[According to some scientists, "the low number of cases evaluated as part of the studies outlined by South African scientists on Sunday [7 Feb 2021] made it difficult to pinpoint the precise effect of the variant. And it was not clear whether the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine protected against severe disease from the B.1.351 variant.

"The clinical trial participants who were evaluated were relatively young and unlikely to become severely ill, making it impossible for the scientists to determine whether the variant interfered with the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine's ability to protect against severe COVID-19, hospitalizations or deaths.

"However, based on the immune responses detected in blood samples from people who were given the vaccine, the scientists said they believed that the vaccine could yet protect against more severe cases.

If further studies show that it does, South African health officials said on Sun that they would consider resuming use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine." (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/world/south-africa-astrazeneca-vaccine.html)

This problem is not specific to Astra Zeneca. "Pfizer and Moderna have both said that preliminary laboratory studies indicate that their vaccines, while still protective, are less effective against B.1.351. Novavax and Johnson & Johnson have also sequenced test samples from their clinical trial participants in South Africa, where the variant caused the vast majority of cases -- and both reported lower efficacy there than in the United States." (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/world/africa/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-south-africa.html)

With Astra Zeneca, "There was virtually no difference in the numbers of people in the vaccine and placebo groups who were infected with B.1.351, suggesting that the vaccine did little to protect against the new variant. 19 of the 748 people in the group that was given the vaccine were infected with the new variant, compared with 20 of 714 people in the group that was given a placebo. That equates to a vaccine efficacy of 10 percent, though the scientists did not have enough statistical confidence to know for sure whether that figure would hold among more people." (https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/07/world/covid-19-coronavirus)

This is very concerning in relation to building herd immunity. Vaccine companies are apparently already working quickly to address the problem, but RNA viruses evolve rapidly, especially under conditions of intense transmission. Until a significant portion of the population is immunized, slowing transmission, the virus will likely continue to evolve. - Mod.LK]

Austria's alpine province of Tyrol emerged as the European region most afflicted by a vaccine-resistant mutation of COVID. One year after a superspreading event at its Ischgl ski resort, Tyrol is struggling to contain [the variant 501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351 mutation of the virus that was first detected in South Africa.]

Almost 300 cases have been confirmed with another 200 suspected, according to a broadcast interview on Monday [8 Feb 2021] with virologist Andreas Bergthaler. That rate of infection is 3 times more than in the U.K. and higher than anywhere else on the continent, he said.

https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-austria/austria-tries-to-contain-south-african-variant-outbreak-by-voluntary-means-idINKBN2A81Q6


Austria on Monday [8 Feb 2021] opted against placing the whole Alpine province of Tyrol under quarantine to contain an outbreak of the [501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351 variant of the coronavirus first seen in South Africa] instead urging the public not to go there unless they have to.

The province, a winter sports hotspot, has so far been unable to explain how the variant arrived in the Ziller Valley, long a popular tourist area. Austrian ski lifts have been allowed to open since [24 Dec 2020], but hotels are closed for all but business travel and restaurants can only serve takeaway meals.

Tyrol's provincial government has opposed the idea of a province-wide quarantine in talks with the national government on how to contain the variant. Both governments are led by the conservative People's Party. Austria loosened a national lockdown on Monday [8 Feb 2021], letting non-essential shops reopen.

"The government is warning against travel to Tyrol in order to prevent the variant from spreading, and the government asks all citizens to restrict journeys to Tyrol to those that are absolutely necessary," Chancellor Sebastian Kurz was quoted as saying in a government statement.

So far, 293 cases of the variant 501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351 have been confirmed in Tyrol and the current number of active cases is estimated to be at least 140, the statement added.

Austria's coronavirus vaccination plan relies heavily on the AstraZeneca vaccine, though researchers from the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Oxford have found that it provides only minimal protection against mild or moderate infection from the variant in young people.

South Africa halted Monday's [8 Feb 2021] planned rollout of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccinations in response to that analysis, stoking fears of a much longer cat-and-mouse battle with the pathogen.

Austria's government asked that anyone who has been to Tyrol in the past 2 weeks get a COVID-19 test, and urged those leaving Tyrol to do the same immediately before travelling.

Tyrol has already seen Austria's biggest coronavirus outbreak, at the ski resort of Ischgl last year [2020]. That prompted accusations of mismanagement that local authorities deny, and shook confidence in the province's anti-coronavirus efforts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
One of the key questions regarding COVID19 vaccines is whether they can reduce viral shedding. To date, Israel vaccinated substantial parts of the adult population, which enables extracting real world signals. The vaccination rollout started on [20 Dec 2020], utilized mainly the BNT162b2 vaccine, and focused on individuals who are 60 years or older. By now, more than 75% of the individuals of this age group have been at least 14 days after the 1st dose, compared to 25% of the individuals between ages 40-60 years old. Here, we traced the Ct [cycle threshold] value distribution of 16 297 positive qPCR tests in our lab between [1 Dec 2020-31 Jan 2021] that came from these 2 age groups. As we do not have access to the vaccine status of each test, our hypothesis was that if vaccines reduce viral load, we should see a difference in the Ct values between these 2 age groups in late January [2021] but not before. Consistent with this hypothesis, until [15 Jan 2021], we did not find any statistically significant differences in the average Ct value between the groups. In stark contrast, our results in the last 2 weeks of January [2021] show a significant weakening in the average Ct value of 60+ individuals to the 40-60 group. To further corroborate these results, we also used a series nested linear models to explain the Ct values of the positive tests. This analysis favored a model that included an interaction between age and the late January [2021] time period, consistent with the effect of vaccination. We then used demographic data and the daily vaccination rates to estimate the effect of vaccination on viral load reduction. Our estimate suggests that vaccination reduces the viral load by 1.6x-20x in individuals who are positive for SARS-CoV-2. This estimate might improve after more individuals receive the 2nd dose. Taken together, our findings indicate vaccination is not only important for individual's protection but can reduce transmission.

[BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, modified by 2 proline mutations to lock it in the prefusion conformation. A 2-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against COVID-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. This study did not analyze results by age group and is predominantly looking at single dose vaccinees. Thus, the investigators anticipate even greater reduction in viral load after a 2nd vaccination in those individuals who become infected with SARS-CoV-2. The results are promising because viral load has been correlated with transmissibility of the virus and severity of disease. They suggest that vaccination will protect both the vaccinees from becoming severely ill and those around them from becoming infected. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (89 226), Brazil (23 439), and Spain (17 171), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 8804 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 7 Feb 2021 to late 8 Feb 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (5 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Spain, Russia (15 916), and the UK (14 104). A total of 43 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 43 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 16.0%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 10.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 24.8% decrease in daily reported cases and a 2.7 % decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases over 400 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 106.9 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.33 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.UBA]
