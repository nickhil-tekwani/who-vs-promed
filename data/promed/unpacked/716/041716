Health departments in Southwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky [USA] are
investigating an outbreak of about 200 confirmed and probable cases of
cryptosporidiosis. Health departments from Northern Kentucky and in Adams,
Brown, Butler, Clermont, Clinton, Hamilton, Highland and Warren counties, and
Northern Kentucky, have been working together to monitor cases and prevent
further spread of the disease. People experiencing diarrhea who visit public
pools this weekend shouldn't swim, Hamilton County Health Commissioner Tim
Ingram said. Health departments have asked swimming pool operators to super-
chlorinate their pool water to kill the parasite. The outbreak isn't confined
to a particular swimming pool or county. "So we need to consider this a
regional problem," said Gary Crum, district director for the Northern Kentucky
Health Department.

[The many reports of cryptosporidia in the USA show that the parasite is
endemic and therefore cannot be regarded as an emerging infection. Outbreaks
of cryptosporidia in the USA occur every year in the summer and early autumn,
and ProMED will therefore cease reporting these smaller outbreaks from there. -
