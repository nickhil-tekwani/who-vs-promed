Xylella fastidiosa, spread by root grafts - Brazil 20010612.1145

My comment in the previous post was incorrect (see paragraph below). Please
see my comment at the end of this message.
Original text of my comment:
[The authors state that disease affects up to 40% of sweet orange trees in
Brazil, with consequent severe yield loss due to reduced fruit size. This
report presents a good example of a mode of virus spread not often
observed. The relatively high planting density (3 plants/m) used in
nurseries undoubtedly pre-disposed plants to form root grafts, thus
increasing the probability of virus spread via roots. Of great importance
is the need to determine if root grafts are associated with the spread of
diseases caused by other strains of _X. fastidiosa_ that cause coffee leaf
scorch in Brazil and of grapevine and plum in USA. - Mod. DH

[In my previous post on this topic I erred in stating that the pathogen
causing citrus variegated chlorosis disease of sweet orange was a virus.
Obviously the pathogen involved is _Xylella fastidiosa_. I apologize for
the mistake, and I sincerely thank the anonymous reader who put me
straight! - Mod.DH
