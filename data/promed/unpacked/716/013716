Doctors in Jordan, the region's leading destination for medical tourism, say antibiotic-resistant infections are at an all-time high.

"We've been noticing an organism, _E. [Escherichia] coli_," [Dr. Faris] Bakri said. "Many patients come with urinary-tract infections with this organism," but it doesn't respond to treatment as it once did. In 2000, _E. coli_ could be treated by the drug ceftriaxone 70 or 80 percent of the time, he estimated. Now its susceptibility is 37 percent, according to Bakri's data, which also show increasing antibiotic resistance among other bacteria. His findings, based on the hospital's patients, parallel national trends. "It's all over the country. Everyone's complaining of this phenomenon," he said.

In this new nightmarish world, patients with moderate infections are admitted to hospitals "for very expensive IV antibiotics," Bakri said, because "they just won't respond to oral antibiotics." For virulent infections, even fewer antibiotics are effective, and treatment is more complex. And as health systems deteriorate in surrounding countries, war-injured patients with complicated wounds are flocking to Jordan, the Middle East's top destination for medical tourism, for treatment, bringing fierce infections with them.

"We think that the Middle East is one of the hotspots globally for antibiotic resistance," said Richard Murphy, an infectious-disease specialist with Doctors Without Borders. We spoke in September [2014] during a 2-day conference in Amman organized by DWB [Doctors Without Borders] to jumpstart regional discussion and action on antibiotic resistance. The global medical NGO works all over the world, but it encounters notably high rates of resistance in the Middle East.
In this perfect storm of relaxed policy and lack of awareness, the abuse of antibiotics is almost a baseline in healthcare.

In Amman, DWB runs a reconstructive surgical project, which tackles complex cases like severe burns or bone infections. Since 2006, the project has treated 3000 patients from places like Gaza, Yemen, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. DWB's analysis found that drug-resistant bacteria caused 69 percent of all infections in Syrian patients and were present in 55 percent of Iraqi patients with bone infections. The project's surgical coordinator, Dr. Rashid Fakhri, estimated that overall, 60 to 65 percent of bacteria among the project's patients carry some form of resistance.

To kill these infections, "the antibiotic we use is the last one used in Europe," said Marc Schakal, DWB's head of mission for Jordan and Iraq. That antibiotic is imipenem, a broad-spectrum intravenous medication. Although it's usually a last resort, it's the drug DWB uses most frequently in Amman because 1st-line antibiotics aren't as effective. A full 6-week course of imipenem costs USD 2600 to USD 3000.

From 1970 to 1995, Arab countries went through "an impressive construction program of public hospitals and health centers," according to a 2012 review of the area's health services. Healthcare became more readily available in many of these countries, except ones in conflict, and several, including Jordan, "developed world-class factories for the manufacture of generic medications" for export and domestic use. The report highlighted "the inappropriate usage of antibiotics," which, The Lancet has written, "has contributed to the development of microbial resistance in the region." As health systems and access to medical drugs flourished, however, awareness about their proper use among both health professionals and patients lagged.

"People here take antibiotics for knee pain, for runny noses," Bakri said. "Doctors are under a lot of pressure from the patient to prescribe antibiotics, because if the patient doesn't receive antibiotics, he will not go back to the doctor." Dr. Najwa Jarour, head of the infection-control department at Jordan's Ministry of Health, added, "Even doctors write prescriptions for antibiotics without knowing if [an infection] is viral or bacterial," and patients often don't complete prescribed courses of antibiotics, stopping as soon as they feel better.

Even without a prescription, a person can walk into a pharmacy in Jordan, present symptoms or a self-diagnosis -- "Good afternoon, I believe I have a urinary-tract infection" -- and the pharmacist will most likely hand over some affordable blister packs of antibiotics. In this perfect storm of relaxed policy, lack of awareness, and doctors and pharmacists worried about making money, the lax dispensation of antibiotics and their consequent abuse is almost a baseline in healthcare.

The other major factor is war. Recent years have witnessed substantial violence in the Middle East -- 2014 alone includes the ongoing war in Syria, renewed fighting (again) in Iraq, and Israel's war with Hamas, plus continuing conflicts in Yemen, Libya, and elsewhere. Better initial treatment is not always feasible in conflict zones. In Syria, 60 percent of hospitals have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war.

"When health systems are fragile and patients don't get good initial treatment for their injuries, they frequently end up living with a chronic injury," DWB's Murphy explained. These injuries are susceptible to infection, which could be avoided if better initial treatment were available, he said. DWB's Iraqi patients in Amman have undergone an average of 4 previous operations, with 19 months on average between injury and DWB admission.

Even with ... Bakri's internal data, and DWB's analysis of patients bearing extraordinarily complex wounds, it's hard to glean precisely the impact on Jordan from antibiotic resistance. "You've got no idea of the levels of resistance coming in," said Tim Walsh, a medical microbiology and antimicrobial resistance professor at Cardiff University in Wales, while in Jordan, data on resistance are "almost nonexistent." Indeed, Ministry of Health surveillance of resistance is limited to select units in 4 public hospitals, though it has revealed high levels of bacterial resistance to both 1st-line and last-resort antibiotics.

Bakri said the university hospital had not conducted cost-impact studies, while Jarour, the health ministry official, couldn't say what antibiotic resistance might cost Jordan in the long run. But both were certain they'd see higher healthcare costs, worsening morbidity rates, and above all, more deaths. As Bakri stated frankly, "It's going to be a disaster."

[Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem, affects many types of pathogens, has appeared in both healthcare and more recently in community-acquired infections, and has major clinical and economic consequences. A recent report by WHO revealed "extensive antibiotic resistance across the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region", which includes the countries mentioned in the article above (Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Lybia) (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ and ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance - worldwide: WHO 20140501.2442194).

Similar to the article above, the WHO report goes on to say that in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, "In particular, there are high levels of _E. coli_ resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones -- 2 important and commonly used types of antibacterial medicine. Resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins in _K[lebsiella] pneumoniae_ is also high and widespread.... The report reveals major gaps in tracking of antibiotic resistance in the Region."

Most likely the article above is referring to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _E. coli_. ESBLs hydrolyze penicillins and cephalosporins, including the extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime), as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam. Most ESBLs are inhibited to some extent by beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam in vitro; but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy.

Because the genes that encode ESBLs are located on plasmids, the ESBL-encoding genes are easily transferable to other bacteria of the same or even different species. These plasmids also carry genes conferring resistance to several non-beta-lactam antibiotics. Consequently, ESBL-producing isolates are commonly resistant to many classes of antibiotics, most frequently aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Infections caused by these multiple drug-resistant organisms are most reliably treated with a carbapenem antibiotic, such as imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem.

There are multiple types of ESBLs, such as, TEM, SHV, CTX-M, OXA, each with multiple subtypes. One type, CTX-M-15 is currently the most widespread type in _E. coli_ in the UK and is reported to be widely prevalent in the community (Woodford N, Ward ME, Kaufmann ME, et al: Community and hospital spread of _Escherichia coli_ producing CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in the UK. J Antimicrob Chemother 2004; 54(4): 735-43. Available at http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/4/735.full.)

The use of carbapenems, the antibiotics of last resort to treat multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, has now become compromised by the spread of carbapenemases (e.g., KPCs and NDMs), beta-lactamases that destroy the carbapenem antibiotics, which leaves only toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics to treat patients infected by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
