On 4 Oct 2012, the French National Reference Laboratory for Arboviruses (ERBA) diagnosed one West Nile [virus] neuro-invasive case imported from Algeria. The case was a 74-year-old male resident in France who had travelled to Algeria:

- From 24 Aug to 11 Sep 2012, he stayed only in Jijel, located on the littoral between Alger and Annaba.

- He reported onset of fever on 12-13 Sep 2012 and was hospitalized on 16 Sep 2012 with fever and cognitive disorders. The patient died on 29 Sep 2012.

On 15 Oct 2012, The French National Reference Laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of WNV with seroneutralisation. No other suspect case has been identified among the patient's relatives in France.

This is the 1st reported case infected in Algeria since 1994 (cf. Note on 2010 and 2011 seasons WNV circulation).

In 2011, a sero-prevalence survey in humans showed that among 165 samples, 16 tested positive for WNV antibodies (unpublished study).

This case in Algeria occurs in a context of intensification of WNV circulation in the Mediterranean since 2010.

[This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of a West Nile virus infection in Algeria. However, its occurrence is not surprising since the virus has caused human and equine cases around the Mediterranean Basin in recent years, including 2012. In previous laboratory studies, WNV isolates from France in 1965, Algeria in 1968, and Morocco in 1996 belong to the same lineage. - Mod.TY
