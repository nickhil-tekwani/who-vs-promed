[1] New Zealand: influenza

Mask wearing and social distancing for COVID-19 has all but cut influenza cases in New Zealand this year [2020], with only 6 flu isolates detected in this country from April to August [2020].

As we move into the spring/summer period where flu is always uncommon in New Zealand, Professor Michael Baker offers his analysis on the flu season numbers and why masks continue to be so important. He said there has been "near extinction of influenza in New Zealand following our very effective COVID-19 response", as numbers vanished from the 2 standard systems for surveillance -- resulting in a 99.8 percent reduction in flu cases.

According to Baker, there were usually 1600 more deaths in winter, compared to other seasons, and around 1/3 of those were caused by influenza, mostly in older people with long-term health conditions. "What the COVID-19 response has done has largely eliminated those excess winter deaths and mortality as a whole is down around 5 percent," he said. "So that means an extra 1500 people will survive this year [2020] who wouldn't have."

Baker said these measures had led to "a revolutionary change in thinking about how to deal with respiratory pathogens" and could be brought back in the event of a serious flu pandemic. "These are not measures you would roll out routinely of course, but if we had a particularly severe respiratory disease like a severe flu pandemic ... and it had the same infection fatality risk as we've seen with COVID-19, that is half a percent or one percent of people dying, then we could think about using these measures again."

However, despite flu numbers being down, lockdown measures had not managed to stop ordinary colds and respiratory illnesses, such as rhinoviruses - which had dropped slightly during lockdown but bounced back soon after. "A lot does come down to their reservoirs and some are so well-adapted for humans and they're so widespread in the population that they are not affected a great deal by the lockdown."

He said that during the lockdown, a rise in rheumatic fever cases was observed -- and this was likely due to people stay home, often in overcrowded homes which increased their risk. This may have also been affected by less access to routine healthcare for throat swabbing and treatment. "Certainly, some pathogens are not affected at all by lockdown," he said. "These viruses are more primitive, they lack this lipid membrane covering and it means that they're less able to evade the human immune system, but it also makes them survive better in some conditions."

As for influenza, Baker said numbers were likely to stay very low as we moved into spring and summer, but what happens next year [2021] would depend on the country's ongoing response to border control. "It's likely that rates will stay very low for next winter as well if our response continues in the same way. "We have learned remarkable things from the COVID-19 response, both that we can keep out these viruses at the borders and that we can also stamp them out if we get clusters of cases."

[An interesting observation that has been mentioned previously, (see COVID-19 update (331): Southern hemisphere influenza, WHO, global 20200725.7610135). It is hard to dispute the almost lack of influenza virus identification combined with the reduced mortality usually seen during the influenza season. That being said, this article is an excellent segue into the following article about a gym related outbreak in Canada. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Canada: spin studio (gym) outbreak
Date: Tue 13 Oct 2020 01:02 GMT

A spin studio that public health officials say followed all COVID-19 protocols is now reporting 61 positive cases of COVID-19, and as many as 100 staff, clients, and family members may have been exposed. SPINCO, in Hamilton, Ontario, just reopened in July [2020] and had all of the right protocols in place, including screening of staff and attendees, tracking all those in attendance at each class, masking before and after classes, laundering towels, and cleaning the rooms within 30 minutes of a complete class, said Dr Elizabeth Richardson, Hamilton's medical officer of health, in a statement. But it still wasn't enough.

Public health officials are very concerned about the number of cases and the size of the outbreak, especially because the city is not currently a hotspot and the facility was not ignoring health protocols, they said in a statement to CNN. "They have also supported public health services in our investigation by sharing the messaging with all their members," said Richardson. There are currently 44 confirmed positive primary cases associated with SPINCO and 17 confirmed secondary cases. Exposure was linked to several classes held from [28 Sep to 4 Oct 2020].

The studio's co-owners told The Hamilton Spectator on Monday [12 Oct 2020] that public health officials told them "patient zero displayed no symptoms." In a post to clients on Instagram, SPINCO exclaimed in frustration, "We took all the measures public health offered, even added a few, and still the pandemic struck us again!'" SPINCO said it will stay closed pending further investigation by health officials.

City officials say SPINCO was operating at 50% capacity, with a 6-foot [2 m] radius around each bike, and that this might raise questions about the safety of gyms and fitness studios during the pandemic. "We continue to look at what does it mean, what do we need to understand about exercises classes," Richardson said in a media briefing Tuesday [13 Oct 2020].

Canada is reckoning with a 2nd wave of the coronavirus which has been marked by a doubling of new, daily positive cases of COVID-19 within the past month. Targeted restrictions and closures are in place in many urban centers including Toronto and Montreal, but not in Hamilton.

[Masks reduce the expulsion of virus laden droplets (and possible aerosolized particles) into the general ambience and reduce the number of viral particles inhaled by the individual wearing the mask. As much as it is not comfortable wearing a mask when exercising, this may have been an unfortunate fall out of not wearing masks during the however long spinning class and the misfortune to have a participant who was asymptomatic, but shedding virus (see WHO's guidance on mask wearing https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 216.

Data by country, area, or territory for 15 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesOct15_1602790880.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 28.4% of daily case numbers and 43.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 18.1 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Peru, Chile, and Costa Rica.

- The European region reported 39.1% of daily case numbers and 24.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 7.4 million. Countries not reporting cases today (15 Oct 2020) include Kazakhstan and Sweden. France is dominant, followed by the UK, Russia, Czech Republic, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Spain, Ukraine, Romania, Israel, and Portugal. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Turkey, Austria, Slovakia, Armenia, Rep. of Moldova, and Ireland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.1% of daily case numbers and 10.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.6 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Iraq, Morocco, UAE, Jordan, Tunisia, UAE, and Lebanon. Libya, Pakistan, Oman, Kuwait, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia each reported more than 500 cases but less than 1000.

- The African region reported 1.3% of daily case numbers and 3.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.24 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, Uganda, and Cabo Verde.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.66 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, French Polynesia, and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 23.0% of the daily newly reported cases and 16.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.2 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Brazil is reporting fewer and fewer cases, but transmission of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Americas region is still very active. Europe continues to increase as well, while India had reduced daily confirmations by over 30% in the past few weeks.

[India and the USA are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts and newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours, -- the USA (66 272) followed by India (60 439) -- have maintained their dominance. A global total of 5986 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (14-15 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (17 countries) include India, USA, Spain (35 647), France (30 621), Brazil, (29 498), UK (18 978), Argentina (17 096), Russia (13 754), Czech Republic (9720), Italy (8803), Belgium (8271), Poland (8099), Netherlands (7791), Germany (7074), Colombia (6823), Mexico (5514), and Ukraine (5067). A total of 44 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 43 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 were from the Americas region, 6 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region and 5 were from the Southeast Asian region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 6.8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 8.1%.

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase with countries in the European region, the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts followed by the Eastern Mediterranean region and South East Asia region. Brazil has markedly decreased the number of daily reported cases while Argentina has increased in the Americas region, albeit the European countries are markedly dominant in these daily reports. Note that over 1 million new cases have been confirmed in the past 3 days, with today's daily report breaking previous records. We may well reach a 2 day interval if this increase in cases continues. - Mod.MPP]
