A rare mosquito [rare for Oahu] has been found on Oahu for the 1st time in more than 60 years. Now the state is reminding people to get rid of standing water on their property.

The disease [virus]-carrying _Aedes aegypti_ species hasn't been found on the island since 1949. The vector control program recently identified the pest in traps at the Honolulu International Airport.

The _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito is common in Hawaii. The _Aedes aegypti_, which is more aggressive in spreading diseases, used to be found only in a few isolated spots on the Big Island. According to experts, the [_Ae.] aegypti_ mosquito can rapidly spread dangerous diseases [viruses] like dengue and yellow fever. Hawaii's health department has already received one reported case of imported dengue fever this year. In 2011, authorities investigated 6 imported cases.

Budget cuts crippled the state's vector control program. The traps at the airport are now the only routine mosquito surveillance on Oahu.

The state is asking health care providers to report any patients with a dengue-like illness.

The DOH urges residents and property owners to:
- Clear standing water from areas where mosquitoes may breed.
- Take a few minutes every week to inspect your yard and home and eliminate anything that holds water and can breed mosquitoes.
- Throw away old junk that collects water like old buckets, tires, and flowerpots.
- Clear rain gutters and turn over empty containers.
- Treat anything you can't dump out with soapy water to kill mosquito wigglers.

[One hopes that _Ae. aegypti_ has not spread beyond the airport area. If it has, eradication may not be possible. Surveillance needs to be intensified and extended quickly to other areas on Oahu Island, followed by control measures. ProMED-mail will be interested in receiving follow up reports on this situation.
