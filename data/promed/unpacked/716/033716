[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 1 603 719 with 81 802 (5.7%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 1 521 812 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 213 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 84 958 cases when compared with the data on 8 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 33 438 (39.4%), Spain for 5002 (5.9%), Germany for 4939 (5.8%), France for 4799 (5.6%), the UK 4344 (5.1%), Italy for 4204 (4.9%), and Turkey 4056 (4.8%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 94.9% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 29.2% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, have overtaken China in total numbers of cases. A global total of 95 722 deaths have been reported, 92 386 (96.5%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around or below 50 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Spain is number 2 and Italy is number 3. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Turkey has been accelerating. Turkey illustrates how rapidly things can increase: the 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 29 days the country has confirmed 42 282 cases; it now ranks number 9 out of 213 countries/territories in terms of absolute numbers of confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Serology based tests

Serology-based tests for COVID-19
---------------------------------
Serology testing for SARS-CoV-2 is at increased demand in order to better quantify the number of cases of COVID-19, including those that may be asymptomatic or have recovered. Serology tests are blood-based tests that can be used to identify whether people have been exposed to a particular pathogen by looking at their immune response. In contrast, the RT-PCR tests currently being used globally to diagnose cases of COVID-19 can only indicate the presence of viral material during infection and will not indicate if a person was infected and subsequently recovered. These tests can give greater detail into the prevalence of a disease in a population by identifying individuals who have developed antibodies to the virus.

This page serves to provide up to date information on serology tests that are in development or available for use. Importantly, many of these tests have been approved for research use only, which indicates that they are not yet approved for use as a public health diagnostic tool or for at-home diagnosis. Some of these tests may move forward to approval for diagnostic use, while others may be appropriate for research only.

Description of types of serology assays
---------------------------------------
- Rapid diagnostic test (RDT): This is typically a qualitative (positive or negative) lateral flow assay that is small, portable, and can be used at point of care (POC). These tests may use blood samples from a finger prick, saliva samples, or nasal swab fluids. RDTs are often similar to pregnancy tests, in that the test shows the user colored lines to indicate positive or negative results. In the context of COVID-19, these tests most frequently test for patient antibodies (IgG and IgM), or viral antigen. In some cases, it can be beneficial to measure baseline (before infection) of IgG and IgM titers.

- Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): This test can be qualitative or quantitative and is generally a lab-based test. These tests usually use whole blood, plasma, or serum samples from patients. The test relies on a plate that is coated with a viral protein of interest, such as Spike protein. Patient samples are then incubated with the protein, and if the patient has antibodies to the viral protein they bind together. The bound antibody-protein complex can then be detected with another wash of antibodies that produce a color or fluorescent-based readout. In the contest of COVID-19, these tests most frequently test for patient antibodies (IgG and IgM).

- Neutralization assay: This test relies on patient antibodies to prevent viral infection of cells in a lab setting. Neutralization assays can tell researchers if a patient has antibodies that are active and effective against the virus, even if they have already cleared the infection. These tests require whole blood, serum, or plasma samples from the patient. Neutralization assays depend on cell culture, a lab-based method of culturing cells that allow SARS-CoV-2 growth (like VeroE6 cells). When virus and cells are grown with decreasing concentrations of patient antibodies, researchers can visualize and quantify how many antibodies in the patient serum are able to block virus replication. This blocking action can happen through the antibody binding to an important cell entry protein on the virus, for example.

[4] Risks to supply and quality of tests, drugs and vaccines

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emergency efforts are underway to find optimum medical products to prevent infection and diagnose and treat patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Production and supply chains for COVID-19 candidate drugs (such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), and for many other essential medical products, are being impaired by this crisis. Supply chains for vital drugs for other diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus) are being disrupted because they are being repurposed to use against COVID-19, without adequate supporting evidence.

Without preparation for the quality assurance of diagnostic tests, drugs, and vaccines, the world risks a parallel pandemic of substandard and falsified products. Interventions are needed globally to ensure access to safe, quality assured, and effective medical products on which the world's population will depend.

History provides us with warnings. Quackery was rampant during the Great Plague of the 17th century. When cinchona bark became the treatment for malaria in the 17th century, it was adulterated on a vast scale. After World War 2, penicillin shortages led to widespread falsification.

Substandard drugs (because of production or supply chain errors) are driven by cost reduction, whereas falsified agents (because of fraud) thrive on shortages, particularly when buyers depart from regulated supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens a global surge in substandard and falsified medical products, not just for those directly related to COVID-19. Many products essential for COVID-19 treatment and prevention are at risk, including face masks, hand sanitisers, and diagnostic tests, and false claims have been made for prevention and treatment. Many falsehoods proliferate through illegal websites and social media, and these occurrences will mushroom. Poorly substantiated claims about effectiveness of drugs for treating COVID-19 have led to widespread shortages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and to fatal overdoses. Panicked global populations are desperate to procure products that might prevent and treat COVID-19. When chloroquine was used for malaria treatment, falsified versions were common. Paracetamol is at risk; in the past, nephrotoxic substandard and falsified paracetamol syrup caused hundreds of deaths. The Medicine Quality Monitoring Globe scours the internet for reports of substandard and falsified medical products in many languages, giving the general public early warnings of drug quality problems.

Multiple diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive interventions for COVID-19 are being trialed. If products prove to be efficacious against COVID-19, achieving global benefit will require prompt access for all people in need. Drugs must be affordable, quality assured, and not hoarded or diverted from treatment of malaria, autoimmune diseases, or HIV/AIDS. Ineffective interventions, wasting resources, and causing harm should be opposed by robust policies and community-specific public engagement. We need to plan strategically to ensure global manufacture, access, protection, and monitoring of supply chains in the face of unescapable shortages, cost increases, and national hoarding. All our fates are bound together, and any helpful products must be recognised as global assets. The effect on access to other products (eg, HIV diagnostics) must be minimised.

Coordinated information-sharing among global medicines regulators on authorisations for clinical trials, Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions, and off-label use, as well as comprehensive and rapid reporting of shortages of active ingredients and finished products by industry and regulators, are essential to optimise global demand and supply. With in-person inspections suspended by many regulators, greater use of reliance mechanisms and full information-sharing among regulators is vital. Effective regulatory supervision, emergency prequalification, robust authentication measures, and procurement policies supporting quality, with abjuring of national export restriction policies, the informal market, and illegal online websites, combined with trusted public engagement campaigns, will be needed to reduce substandard and falsified medical products.

Few nations have medicine regulatory authorities classed by WHO as well functioning and integrated regulatory systems, rendering most populations especially vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products. Innovative regional mechanisms (such as, the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum) might be part of the solution in this urgency. As efficacious COVID-19 treatments and vaccines are approved, intense global coordinated production, distribution chains, and postmarket surveillance will be needed to protect the general public from manufacturing and supply chain failures, inadequate manufacturing protocols, and criminals selling falsified products. Robust evaluation of diagnostics tests (premarket and postmarket) to ensure accuracy will be vital; bad tests will be worse than no tests.

If a drug is shown to be efficacious, devices able to detect whether the product contains the stated amount of active ingredient with appropriate dissolution will be important in supporting postmarket surveillance. Many portable screening devices are available but with scant evidence for their effectiveness. Few data exist to show which agents these devices can detect; none has yet been shown to accurately quantify diverse active ingredients. These devices will need to be integrated into national regulatory standards and WHO's Prevent, Detect and Respond frameworks, using public pharmacopeial standards.

Drug quality is vulnerable to fear, desperation, and disinformation. While hoping that the efforts of WHO and global coalitions to accelerate COVID-19 research will provide the means to fight this pandemic, we must ensure that access to affordable quality medical products, particularly in low-resource settings, does not become another casualty.

[5] WHO situation report 80 (as of 9 Apr 2020)
Date: Thu 9 Apr 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200409-sitrep-80-covid-19.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET, 9 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- The daily situation report will now report the COVID-19 transmission scenario for each country using the definitions published in the updated global surveillance guidance published on [20 Mar 2020] (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions). Transmission scenarios are self-reported by Member States to WHO. The determination of transmission scenario is still pending for some Member States. The transmission scenarios are: no confirmed cases, sporadic cases, clusters of cases, and community transmission. For definitions and more details, see the footnote under Table 1 below.

- As millions of Christians, Jews, and Muslims celebrate Easter, Passover, and Ramadan, WHO has released guidance for religious leaders and faith-based communities in the context of COVID-19. This is available at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/practical-considerations-and-recommendations-for-religious-leaders-and-faith-based-communities-in-the-context-of-covid-19. For more on this topic, see the 'subject in focus' section below.

- Today marks 100 days since WHO was notified of the 1st cases of "pneumonia with unknown cause" in China. In yesterday's [8 Apr 2020] media briefing, Director-General Dr Tedros recalled the work that WHO and its partners have been doing over this period and the continuing efforts to stop the pandemic in five key areas. Find more details at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19--8-april-2020

Subject in focus: having faith during COVID-19
----------------------------------------------
A sad reality of the COVID-19 pandemic is that many people have been infected in settings where they turn to for comfort at these difficult times. There have been outbreaks of COVID-19 among religious communities due to certain religious practices. To help stop transmission in communities while allowing people options to worship, WHO's Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) brings together members of diverse faith-based communities in virtual meetings and discussions. The EPI-WIN team and faith experts discuss the critical role of religious leaders and faith-based communities in saving lives and reducing illness during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Faith-based communities play a substantial role in supporting local health systems; advocating for the rights of vulnerable populations; providing support and comfort to communities; and being a trusted source of information. They are often integrated into broader communities through the services they provide, and in doing so they reach the most vulnerable groups with assistance and health information.

The EPI-WIN team and the faith community have co-developed practical guidance and recommendations, available at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/practical-considerations-and-recommendations-for-religious-leaders-and-faith-based-communities-in-the-context-of-covid-19, to support the special role of religious leaders, faith-based organizations, and faith-based communities in COVID-19 education, preparedness, and response.

This includes:
- Sharing evidence-based information about COVID-19, preparedness, and response.
- Avoiding large group gatherings and conducting rituals and faith-related activities remotely/virtually, as required and whenever possible.
- Ensuring that any decision to convene group gatherings for worship, education, or social meetings is based on a sound risk assessment and in line with guidance from national and local authorities.
- Ensuring safe faith-based gatherings, ceremonies, and rituals when they do occur.
- Strengthening mental and spiritual health, well-being, and resilience, through individual contact (while observing appropriate physical distancing) and through social and other communications media.
- Ensuring a human-rights-based approach to advocacy, messaging, and service delivery.
- Addressing stigma, violence, and the incitement of hate.
- Promoting ecumenical and interfaith collaboration, and peaceful coexistence during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Ensuring that accurate information is shared with communities; and misinformation in addressed.

EPI-WIN have also developed a mass gatherings risk assessment tool available at https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-2019-ncov-ra-tool-religious.xlsx> [the link is to a spreadsheet], and a decision tree available at https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-2019-ncov-mg-decision-tree-religious.pdf

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 210. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 18 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 37 294 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 85.0% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (3.7%) and Brazil (4.4%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 29.7% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 24.8%, Ecuador at 12.6%, and Chile at 7.7%.

The European region seems to be picking up again, having confirmed 39 442 (47.6% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 3877 (61.7%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, up from 33 881 new cases and down from 4904 new deaths from yesterday's update [8 Apr 2020]. Spain reported 15.7% of newly confirmed cases, the UK 13.9%, Germany 12.6%, Turkey 10.4%, France 9.8%, and Italy 9.7%. These 6 countries (representing 10% of the European countries) account for 72.2% of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 1997 new cases representing 59.5%% of the regional newly reported cases. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Pakistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, represent 8.9%, 7.4%, 4.6%, and 4.1% respectively. Removing Iran from the denominator, UAE represents 22.1% of newly confirmed cases, followed by Pakistan at 18.4%, Qatar at 11.3%, and Saudi Arabia at 10.1%.

In the African region, Cameroon reported 25.4% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria at 15.1%, South Africa at 13.9%, and Niger at 9.3%.

In the Western Pacific region, Japan reported 46.8% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Malaysia 14.3%, Singapore 13.0%, and the Philippines 9.7%.

In South East Asia, 5 of the 10 countries reported no new cases in the previous 24 hours. Of the remaining 5 countries, India reported 62.1% of newly reported cases, Indonesia 25.1%, Thailand and Bangladesh, 6.2% each, and Sri Lanka less than 1%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [9 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve seems to show Europe plateauing and even decreasing, but the Americas are adding to the overall height of the curve on a daily basis. The 24-hour newly reported case total for the European region was 39 442 today (9 Apr 2020), compared with 37 294 for the Americas region. After a dip last week [week of 1 Apr 2020] that looks promising, the European region has returned to the higher levels of cumulative cases. My cautious optimism that there might be a seasonality to this virus that would buy us time is tossed out the window with recent events.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 3 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
