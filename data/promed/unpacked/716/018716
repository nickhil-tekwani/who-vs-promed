The International Society for Infectious Diseases and its Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED-mail) is pleased to endorse the statement below calling for sharing and public access to data surrounding the current ongoing Zika outbreak. Since its inception in 1994, ProMED has held transparency in outbreak reporting as its guiding principle and has worked steadily to bring about this goal.

In the past, factors such as journal embargoes, overzealous interpretation of privacy standards, and political, economic, and commercial considerations have worked to impede the free flow of public health data. Fortunately, a growing global consensus has emerged recognizing that rapid and free exchange of such data across sectors is needed to optimally recognize and control outbreaks. ProMED was gratified to participate in the WHO consultation on Data and Results Sharing During Public Emergencies on 1-2 Sep 2015 in Geneva and we are pleased to join the distinguished lists of journals and organizations endorsing the attached statement.

Statement on Data Sharing in Public Health Emergencies
------------------------------------------------------
The arguments for sharing data, and the consequences of not doing so, have been thrown into stark relief by the Ebola and Zika outbreaks.

In the context of a public health emergency of international concern, there is an imperative on all parties to make any information available that might have value in combatting the crisis.

We are committed to working in partnership to ensure that the global response to public health emergencies is informed by the best available research evidence and data, as such:

- Journal signatories will make all content concerning the Zika virus free to access. Any data or preprint deposited for unrestricted dissemination ahead of submission of any paper will not pre-empt its publication in these journals.

- Funder signatories will require researchers undertaking work relevant to public health emergencies to set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities and the World Health Organisation.

We urge other organisations to make the same commitments.

This commitment is in line with the consensus statement agreed at a WHO expert consultation on data sharing last year [2015] whereby researchers are expected to share data at the earliest opportunity, once they are adequately controlled for release and subject to any safeguards required to protect research participants and patients.
