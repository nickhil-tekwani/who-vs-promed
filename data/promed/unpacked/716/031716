Today's highlights
------------------
- from 1 May 2010 to 31 Aug 2010, about 1519 illnesses were reported that
are likely to be associated with this outbreak;
- FDA identified salmonella with PFGE [pulse field gel electrophoresis]
patterns indistinguishable from the outbreak strain in egg farm
environmental samples;
- don't eat recalled eggs. Recalled eggs might still be in grocery stores,
restaurants, and consumers' homes. Consumers who have recalled eggs should
discard them or return them to their retailer for a refund. A searchable
database of products affected by the recall is available to consumers;
- individuals who think they might have become ill from eating recalled
eggs should consult their health care providers.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
In July 2010, CDC identified a nationwide sustained increase in the number
of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis isolates with PFGE pattern JEGX01.0004 uploaded
to PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local
public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that
performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections. This increase
began in May 2010 and is evident in the epidemic curve, or epi curve. The
number of reports increased substantially in July 2010 when the peak of the
outbreak appears to have occurred. From 1 May 2010 to 7 Sep 2010, a total
of 2612 illnesses were reported. However, some cases from this period have
not been reported yet, and some of these cases may not be related to this
outbreak. Based on the previous 5 years of reports to PulseNet, we would
expect about 1093 total illnesses during this same period. This means there
are about 1519 reported illnesses that are likely to be associated with
this outbreak. Many states have reported increases of this pattern since
May 2010. Because of the large number of expected cases during this period,
standard methods of molecular subtyping alone are not sufficient to
determine which reported cases might be outbreak-associated. CDC is
currently evaluating advanced molecular methodologies to see if they help
distinguish between outbreak-related cases and sporadic (or background) cases.

Illnesses that occurred after 5 Aug 2010 might not yet be reported due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks for salmonella.

Epidemiologic investigations conducted by public health officials in 11
states since April 2010 have identified 29 restaurants or event clusters
where more than one ill person with the outbreak strain has eaten. Data
from these investigations suggest that shell eggs are a likely source of
infections in many of these restaurants or event clusters. Wright County
Egg, in Galt, Iowa, was an egg supplier in 15 of these 29 restaurants or
event clusters; 3 are clusters that have been recently reported, but
occurred earlier in the outbreak. Traceback investigations are ongoing for
several of these clusters. A formal traceback was conducted by state
partners in California, Colorado, and Minnesota, in collaboration with FDA
and CDC, to find a common source of shell eggs. Wright County Egg in Iowa
was found as the common source of the shell eggs associated with 3 of the
clusters. Through traceback and FDA investigational findings, Hillandale
Farms of Iowa, Inc., was identified as another potential source of
contaminated shell eggs contributing to this outbreak. FDA is nearing
completion of initial investigations at both of these firms in Iowa. The
investigations involve sampling, records review, and looking for potential
sources of contamination, such as feed. FDA's inspectional observations, in
addition to sample results, indicate substantial potential for _Salmonella_
to have persisted in the environment and to have contaminated eggs.

Laboratory testing of environmental samples
-------------------------------------------
FDA has collected nearly 600 samples from Wright County Egg and Hillandale
Farms of Iowa during this investigation. The majority of these samples are
still undergoing laboratory testing and results are pending. To date, FDA's
testing of 7 environmental samples identified salmonella with PFGE patterns
indistinguishable from the outbreak strain. 6 of these positive samples
were collected from manure, as well as traffic areas such as walkways,
equipment, other surfaces in and around the farm, and from the feed mill at
Wright County Egg in Iowa. The feed was provided to pullets (young female
chickens or hens) raised at Wright County Egg facilities in Iowa. Pullets
are distributed to all premises at Wright County Egg in Iowa and Hillandale
Farms in Iowa. The 7th positive sample was collected from egg water wash in
a packing facility in Hillandale Farms of Iowa. These findings indicate
that Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa are the likely sources
of the contaminated shell eggs. FDA has not found that this feed was
distributed to any companies other than Wright County Egg and Hillandale
Farms of Iowa.

Recall information
------------------
On 13 Aug 2010, Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, conducted a nationwide
voluntary recall of shell eggs. On 18 Aug 2010, Wright County Egg expanded
its recall. On 20 Aug 2010, Hillandale Farms of Iowa conducted a nationwide
voluntary recall of shell eggs. Additional recall updates related to this
outbreak are listed on FDA's website at
