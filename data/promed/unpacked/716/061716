Warning as heroin deaths spread
----------------------------------------
Injections into muscles are a factor in the deaths. Drugs agencies have
issued a warning to heroin users around Scotland after an Aberdeen man died
in similar circumstances to nine addicts in Glasgow. The Glasgow deaths are
being blamed on an impure batch of heroin and the Grampian Addiction
Problem Service has warned users in the north-east to be on their guard.
GAPS spokeswoman Janice Jess said that much of the heroin available in
Grampian comes from Glasgow.
The illness is potentially so serious that Glasgow-based drugs worker
Andrew Horne has advised some heroin users to smoke and not inject the
substance, until the cause is confirmed. "Our advice to heroin users is
that if you are skin popping or finding it difficult to find a vein then
switch to smoking in the interim until the health board has completed its
investigation."
