Michigan hop growers in 2018 approached Michigan State University [MSU] with concerns about a leaf blight they had never seen before. This was followed by reports of hop cones shattering during harvest and yield losses in fields with the affected leaves.

Scientists observed a fungus growing in the symptomatic leaves [and] the same on the cones. "The fungus was shown to infect and cause disease in healthy hop plants," said MSU's Doug Higgins. "Genetic testing showed that DNA from the fungal pathogen did not match DNA from other known fungal species. We concluded that it is a novel species and for now called it _Diaporthe_ sp. 1-MI." As this novel fungus causes yellow margins to form around leaf lesions and the browning of cones, the disease [was named] "halo blight."

Surveys indicated that halo blight is widespread in Michigan, and that other production regions with similar climatic conditions might also be at risk. "A disease outbreak could impact the supply of hops," explained Higgins. "Additionally, cone discoloration can alter hop quality and may have implications on beer quality." He recommends that additional research be conducted to understand how the disease moves and develop management strategies.

[_Diaporthe_ species and strains are known to be associated with stem canker diseases in a range of crops, for example soybean, sunflower, and blueberry. They can cause high yield losses and may also affect international trade due to associated biosecurity risks. Depending on the host, symptoms may include leaf spots, twig blight, branch dieback, reduction of plant vigour, and even death of the plant. In addition, the pathogens may also affect flowers and cause fruit rot.

The diseases are favoured by warm, humid conditions. The fungi overwinter on plant debris left in the field and can be spread with plant material, by mechanical means (wounds), and via frost injuries and human activities. Disease management may include phytosanitation to remove inoculum (such as deep plowing of crop residues), cultural methods (crop rotation, wide row spacing), as well as fungicide treatments of crops and/or seeds. Resistant crop cultivars are available only for some of the pathogens.

For the novel hop fungus, the source publication states that sequence data suggest a unique cluster of isolates most closely related to the _Diaporthe arecae_ species complex, _D. hongkongensis_ and _D. multigutullata_. It was widespread amongst 347 cones collected from 15 fields and accounted for over 38% of all fungi recovered from cones in 3 of the fields.
