PHAEOACREMONIUM VINE DECLINE - USA (CALIFORNIA)

Vineyards in California's wine country are in vine decline. Spores from
"Black Goo" fungi, possibly associated with Vine Decline, have appeared in
the air, soil, and water, as well as rootstock from commercial nurseries
and from grapevine research facilities at the University of California,
Davis.
Doug Gubler, head of the university's plant pathology department, estimates
that the fungi have hit less than 10 000 of the state's 900 000 vineyard
acres. That has not been widespread enough to affect grape supplies or wine
prices.
The cause of the disease is not clearly understood. Growers blame nurseries
for selling them rootstock infected with the two different fungi,
Phaeoacremonium and Cylindrocarpon. Nurseries blame growers for not
properly tending their vines.
Growers see a range of symptoms: dark, gummy ooze instead of clear sap
coming out of the wood, stunted growth and grooved, asymmetrical trunks.
"I don't know what to do," said Bill Lerner, who's seen hundreds of the
13,000 vines he bought from a Bakersfield nursery die and the rest grow too
slowly. "The nursery agreed to replace the dead vines, but the new vines
might carry the same pathogens, so what's the point?"
Rich Kunde, president of the nursery Sonoma Grapevines, says growers are
trying to get others to pay for their mistakes. He said Vine Decline
becomes a problem only if vines already are weak or stressed, or if they've
been improperly fed, watered or planted. He compared the plant disease to
flu in humans which often strikes when they are run down, or stressed.
Although Black Goo has affected barely 1 percent of the state's vineyards,
Gubler says it is the top policy issue for California's booming wine
industry. A survey of members of the American Vineyard Foundation showed
that Vine Decline has jumped to the top third of grower concerns from the
bottom third in another survey several years ago.
"People are blaming the university and nurseries for (unwittingly)
spreading the disease, and it's a political nightmare," he said. Nurseries
often will replace vines that die after planting, but that hardly covers a
grower's costs. Phylloxera-resistant rootstock grafted to a varietal grape
vine like Cabernet Sauvignon or Chardonnay cost about $3.25 each. UC has
assigned to researchers to the Vine Decline problem, and the American
Vineyard Foundation recently allocated $50 000 to study the fungi.

[The name 'Phaeoacremonium vine decline' has been proposed by Doug Gubler
and others at UC-Davis to define the symptoms associated with infection by
of grapevine with either _Phaeoacremonium inflatipes_ or _P. aleophilum_.
The third species, _P. chlamydosporum_, has been assigned to new genus and
the disease caused by that fungus will be either "slow decline" or "----
vine decline". According to Gubler, pathologists are dealing with three
distinct diseases which may have, as one of their symptoms, black gumming
in the vascular tissue. He recommends that "black goo" not be used as the
name for three separate diseases. Of scientific interest is the fact that
the vine decline in California appears to be threatening younger grape
vines, whereas the pathogens in Europe are associated with disease in older
vines. - Mod.DH]
