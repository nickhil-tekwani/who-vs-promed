The conclusion of a case of "sporadic" BSE in Belgium is very interesting.
But as the moderator noted, this is an unusual conclusion and deserves
deeper investigation.
Farmers in the UK have anecdotally described to me having seen cases of a
disease like BSE over many years. [I have heard the same from experienced
large-animal veterinary clinicians. MHJ From the clinical cases I saw in
UK, BSE is distinct from other CNS diseases of cattle, so I would tend to
lend credence to this recollection of farmers. If the Belgian conclusion is
added to this, it lends support to the theory that this is a cattle disease
present at low levels, i.e. sporadic for a considerable period rather than
recently and directly scrapie derived. This implies that it may well return
to that state. Whether such a sporadic status involves the same strain as
BSE or another is an interesting point, but unlikely to be finely
differentiated by politicians or the general public. The intensive
monitoring in the UK could mean that "BSE" never "disappears" or is
eradicated there.
Other countries may appear BSE free if they do not look for BSE as
compulsively closely as the UK will inevitably continue to do although the
disease may be present. This may have continuing implications for UK (and
possibly other) cattle farmers unless the European public can be convinced
that the risk of infection is low. This in its turn will depend on the
numbers of cases of NV-CJD. For many reasons, let's hope these do not
increase. What is it about CNS diseases in humans such as BSE and rabies
that draws such close attention in the public mind compared to other more
common and fatal diseases?
