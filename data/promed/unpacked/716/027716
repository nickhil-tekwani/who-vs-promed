Two people are confirmed to have died of cholera in Kitebere and Sangalawo
fishing villages on Lake Albert in Ndaiga parish, Mpeefu Sub-County,
Kibaale district of western Uganda. According to the District Director of
Health Services in Kibaale, Dr. Dan Kyamanywa, other 28 people have also
been admitted at Kasojo health center IV where they have been treated since
the onset of cholera on 18 Dec 2006.
Dr. Kyamanywa attributes the cholera outbreak to sanitary practices and
poor hygiene around the lakeshores of Lake Albert. He advises the people
living at the fishing villages and other adjacent areas to stop eating
foods being sold at road side because they are contaminated.
The fishing villages of Lake Albert are prone to cholera outbreaks annually
due to lack of properly located latrines and the absence of clean safe
drinking water.

Cholera has hit Kisoro district, killing 3 people, reports Darious
Magara. About 40 others were by Mon, 1 Jan 2007 admitted in hospitals in
critical conditions, hospital officials revealed. The district director of
health services, Dr. Assay Ndizihirwe, said 2 women and one child died in
Kisoro Hospital over the weekend.
He said the cholera outbreak was intensified by unhygienic living
conditions of Congolese refugees at Bunagana, on the border with the
Democratic Republic of Congo. Ndizihirwe confirmed that most of the
victims were Congolese nationals who crossed to Uganda late in 2006 fleeing
fighting there.
Sources at the border said some of the victims had been transferred to
camps but other hundreds were still living at the Bunagana border.
Ndizihirwe appealed to NGO, international relief agencies and the
Government to come to their rescue. He said the district lacks the
capacity to handle hundreds of refugees at the border.

Four inmates of Kabasanda Prison in Mpigi have died of cholera, the
district prisons commander Lawrence Buserezi on 29 Dec 2006, said one
inmate died last week on his way home after he had finished serving his
sentence. His body was identified by residents who carried it to the
prison; it was later taken to Gombe mortuary.
Another inmate died on Sun, 24 Dec 2006, while the other 2 died on Mon, 25
Dec 2006.
Sources in the prison attribute the cholera outbreak to congestion and poor
hygiene. The prison is meant to accommodate 50 inmates, but it currently
houses more than 100.
