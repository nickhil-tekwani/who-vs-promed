Rust damages state's corn crop
------------------------------
Plant experts are warning Nebraska farmers to check their fields for
a potentially devastating corn disease. In 2006, southern rust hit
south central Nebraska, causing a 30 percent loss in yield. Now the
disease is back. "It causes a lot of injury to the leaves, and when
you injure the leaves, it competes with grain fill," said Tamra
Jackson, UNL [University of Nebraska- Lincoln] Extension Plant
pathologist.

But experts are more concerned about another rust that's, well, more
common. "Common rust is very widespread throughout the state right
now. We actually are having an even bigger problem in the southwest
part of the state where they're treating a lot of fields [with
fungicides] and they've never had to do that before," Jackson said.
Some treatments cost around [USD] 20 per acre.

"We had a lot of rain earlier in the season that delayed planting.
The late-planted fields are at a higher risk for disease and for the
damage caused by those diseases," Jackson said. That rainy and cool
weather caused the increase in rust. "The spores that cause the
infection actually have to blow in from southern states every year,
and since we had a lot of moisture earlier in the season, we've got a
lot more rust diseases," she said. Jackson said warmer weather could
help kill common rust but would help southern rust grow.

[_Puccinia polysora_ causes southern rust (also called polysora or
tropical rust) in maize. The fungus occurs in most tropical and
subtropical regions and can cause significant losses of over 50
percent. Southern rust is favoured by warm, humid conditions. Leaves
may die prematurely reducing photosynthetic ability, and therefore
infection before grain fill has been completed is more damaging to
yield than infection late in the crop cycle. _P. polysora_ needs
living host tissue for survival and spores are wind dispersed. No
alternate hosts of the fungus are known. Resistant or tolerant ('slow
rusting') varieties are being developed.

Common rust of maize is caused by the related species _Puccinia
sorghi_. The disease is found worldwide in cooler temperatures and
high humidity. Rust development is much more likely in pre-tassel
stage plants because a large whorl provides a humid environment, and
young leaf tissue is more susceptible to infection than emerged
leaves. Resistant maize varieties are available. This fungus can also
affect _Oxalis_ species as alternate hosts [_Oxalis_ is the largest
genus in the wood sorrel family Oxalidaceae, with approx. 800 species
worldwide. - Mod.JW]
