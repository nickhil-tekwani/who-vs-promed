Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), United Kingdom
--------------------------------------------------------
The following information was received on 15 Jun
2007 from Dr. Debby Reynolds, Director General
and Chief Veterinary Officer, Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA),
Director General for Animal Health and Welfare,
London, United Kingdom
Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 08 Jun 2007
Date of confirmation of event: 08 Jun 2007
Report date: 15 Jun 2007
Date submitted to OIE: 15 Jun 2007
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 04 Aug 2006
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H7N2
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (basic), Laboratory (advanced)
Report pertains to: Defined zone within the country
New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak Location: ENGLAND (St. Helens, St. Helens, Merseyside)
Total animals affected
Species: Birds
Susceptible: 34
Cases: -
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 34
Slaughtered: 0
Epidemiology
Source of infection:
-Introduction of new live animals
-Legal movement of animals
Epidemiological comments: A link has been
established via market tracing between this
outbreak and the index case of LPAI H7N2 in Wales.
ICPI = 0.13 [see commentary. - Mod. AS].
The date of last occurrence in this zone
(England) corresponds to an outbreak of LPAI H7N3
reported in 2006 in the county of Norfolk,
England.
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information
Department: H5 and H7 avian influenza in its low
pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable
disease as per Chapter 2.7.12. on avian influenza
of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. [See
commentary].
Control measures
Measures already applied
-Movement control inside the country
-Screening
-Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
-Stamping out
-Vaccination prohibited
-No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied
-None specified
Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: VLA Weybridge (OIE�s Reference Laboratory)
Tests and results
1.haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT), 07 Jun 2007: Positive
2.intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) test, 08 Jun 2007: Negative
[see commentary. - Mod. AS]

[Due to the risk of a low virulent H5 or H7
becoming virulent by mutation in poultry hosts,
all H5 and H7 viruses have been classified by the
OIE as notifiable avian influenza (NAI) viruses.
The methods used for the determination of strain
virulence for birds have evolved over recent
years with a greater understanding of the
molecular basis of pathogenicity, but still
primarily involve the inoculation of a minimum of
8 susceptible 4-8-week-old chickens with
infectious virus. According to OIE's Terrestrial
animal health Code and Manual (chapter 2.7.12.),
NAI can be divided into highly pathogenic
notifiable avian influenza (HPNAI) and low
pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza (LPNAI).
"HPNAI viruses have an Intravenous pathogenicity
index (IVPI) in 6-week-old chickens greater than
1.2 or, as an alternative, cause at least 75
percent mortality in 4-to 8-week-old chickens
infected intravenously. H5 and H7 viruses which
do not have an IVPI of greater than 1.2 or cause
less than 75 percent mortality in an intravenous
lethality test should be sequenced to determine
whether multiple basic amino acids are present at
the cleavage site of the haemagglutinin molecule
(HA0); if the amino acid motif is similar to that
observed for other HPNAI isolates, the isolate
being tested should be considered as HPNAI. LPNAI
are all influenza A viruses of H5 and H7 subtype
that are not HPNAI viruses."
Details on the test, applied to determine the
(low) pathogenicity of the isolate from St.
Helens, will help. - Mod. AS].

Chickens linked to 2nd bird flu outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------
A number of chickens said to have been bought at
Chelford Market are being linked to a 2nd bird
flu outbreak. Defra -- the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs -- has
confirmed test results proved positive for
low-risk avian influenza in poultry on a
smallholding near St. Helens in Merseyside.
Officials, who stress the disease is the H7N2
strain rather than the more deadly H5N1 virus,
believe the birds were purchased from the market
on Monday, 7 May 2007. All the farm�s birds -
which include chickens, ducks and peacocks - have
been killed. Defra carried out the tests as part
of the routine extensive tracings exercise
following the outbreak in North Wales at the end
of last month [May 2007]. It wanted to track down
any poultry keepers, buyers and sellers who
attended the early May Bank Holiday sales at
Chelford.
A spokesman confirmed this is the only premises
to date with evidence of infection but the
tracings investigation is still ongoing and no
single �cause� has been established yet. Defra
lifted the temporary ban on chicken and duck
sales and Chelford Agricultural Centre ran its
first poultry market following the scare as
normal on Monday (11 Jun 2007).
Partner at Frank Marshall, Gwyn Williams said:
"There was not as big an entry as we would expect
at this time of year, we had 150 pens and we
would normally get around 300 to 350 pens, but we
had been shut for 2 weeks." The market had
suspended all poultry sales -- not just chickens
and ducks -- as a "responsible" measure, he said.
Mr Williams added: "Obviously we are hoping sales
will pick up. I suppose there will be some
unease, but I think the general feeling is that
bird flu has been around for a long time now in
one guise or another but it is more recognised
now. There is a lot of uncertainty about where
the disease has come from. We would like to know
where it came from and we have not been told what
the link is."
A total of 30 chickens were slaughtered at the
farm in Conwy after 15 Rhode Island hens died
when they were infected with mild bird flu. Tests
at another farm on the Llyn Peninsula were
negative. The strain is not thought to pose a
risk to people and no more human cases have been
reported.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph Dudley
[Lifting the temporary ban on chicken and duck
sales and reopening the Chelford Agricultural
Centre have become possible due to the absence of
additional cases in premises which might have had
contacts with the Chelford market. It will be
surprising if the very primary origin of
infection is found; we shall follow the continued
epidemiological investigations with interest.
It is the high alertness, prevailing in the UK
and in other developed countries following the
global spread of H5N1, which has contributed to
the discovery and expedient eradication of the 2
minor UK foci of H7N2 infection, in Conwy and St.
Helens. Limited outbreaks of low pathogenic avian
influenza in smallholdings might have occurred in
the past, in the UK and in other developed
countries, without being noticed. - Mod.AS]
