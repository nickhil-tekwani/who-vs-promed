There are 2 confirmed cases of typhoid in Tongatapu: the first cases of 2012. Radio Tonga reports a teenage boy and a 5-year old child from Tatakamotonga are in Vaiola hospital getting specialist treatment for typhoid.

Dr. Malakai 'Ake of Vaiola Hospital says it is likely that the patients contracted the bacterium because of poor hygiene.
The two current typhoid cases lead doctors to believe that there are still people in Tongatapu who are carrying the bacterium, but are healthy and don't appear infectious.

The Ministry of Health has banned communal feasting. They will also test the family and friends of the patients.

A total of 15 cases of typhoid have been confirmed at Koroboya Village in Ba and nearby settlements. This was confirmed by Ministry of Health officials who have been living at the village ever since a public health emergency regulation was imposed in Feb 2012. According to Ba sub-divisional medical officer Dr Luse Tinakoi, the 15 people were from Koroboya Village, nearby Naitarisi Village and people living in settlements outside the village.

While updating the Commissioner Western Commander Joeli Cawaki, Dr Luse said their operations to contain the outbreak were welcomed by the villagers. "The villagers know that they were the cause of the outbreak and we believe that the compliance of the villagers to our regimen is 100 percent," Dr Luse said.

The number of typhoid cases recorded in a government hospital in rural central Karnataka almost tripled to 757 in 2011 from the 2009 figure of 260. The Harapanahalli Town government hospital is one of 16 such health centers spread across the Harapanahalli Taluk [subdistrict].

The taluk is located in Davanagere District. As of mid-February 2012, over 360 patients had been treated for typhoid in the Harapanahalli Town government hospital and Harapanahalli specialty clinic, a private practice in the area.

"5 to 10 patients are tested positive every day," said Jagadish, a lab technician at the Harapanahalli Town government hospital. Some patients have recurrent attacks.

Municipal Councillor G. Bashusaheb of Agasena Katte, Third Ward, Harapanahalli Town, said work is in progress for the construction of underground drains in slums, where typhoid is common, to improve sanitation. "Only in rural areas do you find cases of typhoid," said Senior Health Inspector H. Kantharaj. He said he is only responsible for the town and not the villages beyond. The taluk health officer is responsible for rural health care, he said.

Even as the Province of Cebu is trying to fight the typhoid menace in the town of Tuburan, another 11 reported cases surfaced in Alegria town. 7 children were brought to Reinhard Wirtgen Memorial Hospital, while 4 were rushed to the nearby Malabuyoc District Hospital. Most of the cases came from Barangays Legaspi and Poblacion of Alegria. As of press time, 2 patients were discharged from Reinhard Wirtgen Memorial Hospital together with 4 others in Malabuyoc District Hospital.

In the latest development, Dr. Expedito Medalla, DOH-Central Visayas Health and Emergency Management Staff (HEMS) coordinator, said there is a downtrend of patients in Tuburan. Although there are still people heading to the hospital for consultation, no more serious cases were reported. He said the chlorinator in the water system helped in the decrease of patients.

This is the second time that the town of Alegria was struck by a typhoid outbreak. The first one happened in December of 2010.
