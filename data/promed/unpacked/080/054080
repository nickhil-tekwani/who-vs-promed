[Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) poses a serious threat to wildlife and domestic animals, as well as having significant zoonotic potential. Most mycobacteria of the TB complex are able to infect zoo and wildlife species. The virulence and infectivity vary widely across species. Camelids were not considered highly susceptible to TB, but several cases have been reported in recent years.
