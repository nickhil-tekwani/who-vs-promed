An outbreak of gastroenteritis hit 52 children and 2 supervisors of a
holiday resort in the Haute-Savoie region, with a total of 125 people
affected, said the Prefecture and the Departmental Directorate of
Social Cohesion on Thu 21 Jul 2011.

"11 children have been hospitalized, but their condition is not a
cause for concern," said the prefecture in a statement, adding that
symptoms were mainly gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, vomiting,
nausea and diarrhea. Cases have occurred "in 2 waves" located in the
centre of St. Jeoire-en-Faucigny, with 39 cases occurring between
Saturday and Monday [16-18 Jul 2011], and 15 new cases since Wednesday
[20 Jul 2011].

The situation did not require the closure of the centre, where 110
children 6 to 15 years of age will complete, in late July 2011, a stay
of one month under the care of 15 supervisors. The virus apparently
spread very rapidly because the children were confined indoors due to
bad weather.

Hygiene measures were reinforced in the establishment, where analyses
are underway to identify the origin of the episode. "The results of
the epidemiological investigation tend to rule out food contamination
and favor person-to-person spread of a virus, said the prefecture.

[The abruptness and rapidity of spread of this outbreak through
person-to-person contact rather than via a food-borne route, is
indicative of an outbreak of norovirus infection. The nature of the
illness and the response of the medical authorities are compatible
with such a diagnosis. Information on the outcome of the diagnostic
tests would be welcomed.
