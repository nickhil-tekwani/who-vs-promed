Starting today [20 Apr 2013], the Dumb Friends League is temporarily suspending dog intakes and adoptions at its Quebec Street shelter while it contains an outbreak of pneumonia that has killed 5 dogs.

The shelter has seen 12 cases of pneumonia in dogs during the past week, said CEO Robert Rohde.

"Due to the severity and number of these cases, we are working in consultation with several veterinary specialists and diagnostic laboratories to clarify the nature of the illness and provide the most effective treatment in our care," Rohde said.

"We are voluntarily ceasing dog intakes and adoptions to protect the 263 dogs currently in our care, as well as the dogs in our community. At present, only a small percentage of our population has been affected, and we are carefully monitoring the health of all animals in our care."

Rohde said the suspension is expected to be in effect for 4 weeks. People can check the League home page, http://www. ddfl.org, for the current status of dog operations.

Dogs at other League facilities, such as the Buddy Center in Castle Rock, are not affected by the suspension, nor are cats and small pets at any facility including Quebec Street.

Kristin Snow, director of communications, said it is believed the outbreak stemmed from a stray dog taken into the Quebec Street shelter, on South Quebec Street. All dogs currently at the shelter are being given a preemptive course of antibiotics.

"We're calling everybody who adopted a dog from 1 Apr 2013 to the present to alert them to look for symptoms and get treatment," Snow said. It usually takes 12-14 days for clinical signs to show up in infected animals.

The main clinical signs are coughing, sneezing and lethargy, said Dr. Jeff Sankhauser, the League's chief veterinarian. There may also be vomiting and diarrhea.

Sankhauser said the current outbreak is a more severe, fast-moving strain of pneumonia. Vigorous testing is underway at the shelter, he said.

Rohde, meanwhile, asked for community understanding. "Your compassion and support over the years helps us through challenging times like these," Rohde said "Thank you so much for your understanding."

Starting today [20 Apr 2013], the Dumb Friends League Quebec Street shelter in Denver is temporarily ceasing dog intakes from the public, as well as dog adoptions, for 30 days to ensure containment of pneumonia. The closing affects only the intake and adoption of dogs at our Quebec Street shelter; cats and small pets are not affected, and intake and adoptions of those animals will continue as usual.

Since 12 Apr 2013, the shelter has seen 12 cases of dogs with pneumonia, which is an increase in what we are used to seeing. We have reached out to several veterinary specialists and diagnostic laboratories to clarify the nature of the illness and provide the most effective treatment.

In keeping with our high standards, we are taking this responsible and proactive approach to prevent any additional illnesses. To that end, we are voluntarily ceasing dog intake and adoptions to protect the 263 dogs currently in our care, as well as the dogs in our community. At present, only a small percentage of our population has been affected, and we are carefully monitoring the health of all animals in our care.

In the meantime, Denver-area residents who need to surrender a dog or who are planning on adopting a dog should proceed to one of our Metro Denver Shelter Alliance partners or shelters listed on our website. We appreciate the collaborative relationship we have with Denver-area shelters, rescue groups and animal care and control agencies.

We anticipate that the measures will be in effect for 4 weeks in order to ensure the success of the treatment and containment of the illness. Please check our home page (http://ddfl.org) for the current status of our dog operations.

Thank you for your patience as we continue our mission to provide the best possible care for homeless pets in our community. For more information, please contact Chris Gallegos, public relations manager, at <media@ddfl.org> or (303) 419-1162.

Frequently Asked Questions:

When did you 1st realize there was a problem with the dogs?
We believe we saw our 1st case on Fri 12 Apr 2013, and by Mon 15 Apr 2013, we had a 4th case. By the end of the week (19 Apr 2013), we had an additional 8 cases. During this time, we were assessing the situation, testing for various illnesses, and reaching out to experts on the situation. We then made the proactive decision to close dog intake and adoptions based on the results.

How did the illness get into the shelter?
We don't know, but we believe it was from a dog brought in as a stray.

What if I adopted a dog in the last week or 2 from the Dumb Friends League?
We are attempting to reach all adopters of dogs adopted from the Quebec Street shelter since 1 Apr 2013. If you adopted a dog during this period and have not received a call, please contact us.

What will the Dumb Friends League's return for treatment program look like at this time?
We are continuing to see recent adoptions through our return for treatment service. For the purposes of this event, we are extending the return for treatment timeframe to 30 days from time of adoption. Patrons can contact return for treatment at (720) 241-7100 to arrange an appointment for their recently adopted dog or to fill prescriptions.

What precautions is the Dumb Friends League taking to care for its healthy dogs?
All dogs at the Quebec Street shelter are being treated with antibiotics to minimize risk.

How will volunteers at your shelter be affected?
During the closure, our volunteers will be offered to be assigned to work with cats.

Is the Buddy Center in Castle Rock impacted?
No, the Buddy Center remains open with all of its services offered.

[When the organization was founded in 1910, it was named after a London, England animal shelter called Our Dumb Friends League. In those days, the term "dumb" was widely used to refer to animals, because "they lacked the power of human speech."

The mission statement of the Dumb Friends League includes these words: "speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves," meaning our animal friends.

There are a number of types of pneumonia in dogs. It may be bacterial, fungal, viral, parasitical, or a type called interstitial pneumonia. The type of pneumonia affecting this shelter was not identified in the article or in the FAQ's from the web site. At the time of the article and the FAQ publication, they may not have known what type of pneumonia is present, as samples have only recently been sent to the diagnostic lab. Since the shelter states they have them on antibiotics, it is likely a bacterial pneumonia.

Signs of pneumonia may include fever, depression, cough, rapid breathing, rapid pulse, and often times, but not always, a thick mucous nasal discharge. Frequently, the cough is moist sounding and may be accompanied by a bubbling sound, indicating fluid in the lungs. Dogs with severe pneumonia frequently sit with their head extended and elbows turned out to allow for greater expansion of the chest.

An X-ray of the chest is often helpful or even diagnostic when coupled with appropriate blood testing. Bacterial culture and sensitivity tests are helpful in selecting the most effective antibiotic.

If your animal has these signs, it is critical that you get your pet immediate veterinary care. These fast moving diseases can be present, and the pet may be in the crisis stage in a short time.

With appropriate care and treatment, pets should recover. The overriding caution is to give the animal plenty of time and rest and to follow your veterinarian's advice on medications.
