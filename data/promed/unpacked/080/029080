Follow-up report No. 3
Translation of an extract from an e-mail received on 25 Aug 2000 from Dr
Oscar Alejandro Bruni, President of the National Service of Agrifood Health
and Quality (SENASA), Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and
Food, Buenos Aires:
End of previous report period: 21 Aug 2000 (see Disease Information, 13
[33, 139, dated 25 Aug 2000).
End of this report period: 25 Aug 2000.
Among all the illegally-imported animals, only one tested Probang positive.
The A24 strain isolated in this case will be sent for diagnosis
confirmation, typing and sub-typing, and sequencing, to the Pan American
Foot and Mouth Disease Centre in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the OIE World
Reference Laboratory in Pirbright, UK.
So far, no other animal from any of the country's provinces has given any
positive serological test results. As of the date of this report, samples
have been taken from 6 245 bovines from 142 establishments which received
shipments of cattle from the affected province (Formosa) between 1 Jun 2000
and 5 Aug 2000. All the test results were negative.
In regard to the mass serological survey being carried out throughout the
totality of the country in order to verify the sanitary situation, 3 569
samples have been taken from 3 452 bovines, 61 pigs, 42 sheep and 14 goats.
In these cases, too, all the test results were negative.

[The results from Pirbright will be interesting but may not answer the most
important question: Where did this probang positive A24 strain come from? -
