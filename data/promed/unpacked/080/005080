The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) on Tuesday [18 Feb 2014] confirmed outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in poultry in southwest China's Guizhou Province.

On 13 Feb 2014, a farm in a village of Xixiu District in Anshun City of Guizhou reported [that] 3629 chickens had showed symptoms of suspected avian flu and that 976 of them had died.

The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory confirmed the epidemic was H5N1 after testing collected samples, according to the MOA.

Local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area. The infected chickens have been culled and safely disposed of to prevent the disease from spreading, said the MOA.

[This is the 3rd HPAI H5N1 in China since the start (on 27 Dec 2013) of this recurring epizootic. A follow-up report on this outbreak has been submitted to the OIE on 18 Feb 2014, including the following data on "total animals affected":
Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
324 268 / 3629 / 976 / 323 292 / 0

Additional information is available in the follow-up report above at http://tinyurl.com/kh5ussc.

An interactive map showing the 3 recent outbreaks is available in OIE's 'event summary' at http://tinyurl.com/l4omevo. Of these outbreaks, 2 are located in Guizhou province and one in Hubei province. The distant locations may be indicative of a wider circulation of the virus. Such a concern has been underlined by the recent information from Canada on a person returning from a visit to China, who has become the 1st case of A(H5N1) infection in North America. The (unfortunately, fatal) infection had, most probably, been acquired in Beijing, suspectedly by the patient's passing through or near an illegal live bird market (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140212.2274077).

The current HPAI H5N1 Chinese outbreak in poultry is regarded as "continuing". - Mod.AS
