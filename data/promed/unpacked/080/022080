[There is a Global Meat News report on the beef export restrictions placed on Kazakhstan as a result of the human and bovine cases. See: http://www.globalmeatnews.com/Safety-Legislation/Anthrax-tainted-meat-linked-to-multiple-deaths. Copyright restrictions stop me from posting this report.

Anthrax -- the disease -- is rarely contagious. Being in a room with a case or treating a case does not normally present any risks. But there is a real risk when butchering an infected carcass as the organism in the blood can gain access through any skin cut, or scratching your face or arm because of an itch. - Mod.MHJ
