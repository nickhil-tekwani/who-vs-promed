[Press release (https://www.gov.za/speeches/agriculture-land-reform-and-rural-development-another-avian-influenza-outbreak-farm-gauteng; abridged and edited) from the South African government, Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development published on 6 May 2021:
"The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD) hereby announces another outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in a commercial chicken farm in Randfontein in Gauteng.

"Preceding this outbreak, 4 outbreaks were detected on other commercial chicken properties. A total of 5 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks -- 4 in Gauteng and one outbreak in North West. All affected farms have been quarantined, with control measures being implemented.

"Genetic evaluation has confirmed that the outbreak reported in commercial layers on [13 Apr 2021] in Gauteng [see ProMED 20210414.8307559] and the one on commercial broiler-breeders in the North West seem to have been caused by non-identical AI strains. These 2 outbreaks were, therefore, more likely to have been caused by separate introductions. It is essential for everyone across the country to remain on high alert.

"It must be mentioned that no human infection, due to these circulating strains, had been reported in Europe and thus the zoonotic risk to people is very low, the consumer has no reason to be concerned."
- Mod.CRD

In April and May 2021, several outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in many poultry farms have been reported in South Africa. HPAI H5 outbreaks have been numerous and occurring in different parts of the country. Some had different strains, which means that they come from separate origins. One of these outbreaks was caused by HPAI H5N8, while all the others were caused by H5N1. This report describes wild bird species (geese, gulls, and wild birds kept in a zoo) that were found positive during those outbreaks. - Mod.PMB
