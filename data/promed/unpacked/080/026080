Observations during the present outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF)
in South Africa confirm that the vast majority of human infections
occur in persons involved in the livestock industry and result from
contact with the infected tissues of diseased animals. Only a small
proportion of infections can be presumed to result from mosquito
bite, and the local vectors of the virus generally bite outdoors at
night in fields close to their breeding sites, and not in towns.

At the time of release of the interim report on the current outbreak
on 3 May 2010, there had been 172 laboratory confirmed human cases of
the disease with 15 deaths. Many diagnostic specimens arrive at the
laboratory with scant information, and the histories of potential
exposure to infection have to be obtained retrospectively. By 3 May
2010, it had been established that 113/139 (81 percent) of the 172
patients were employed in the livestock industry and that 124/128 (97
percent) had direct contact with infected animals or tissues prior to
the onset of disease. Of the remaining 4 patients investigated, one
had ingested unpasteurized milk and 3 (2 percent) reported exposure
to mosquito bite in the absence of exposure to sick animals or animal
tissues. By 20 May 2010, 202 cases of the disease had been confirmed
(out of 1400 specimens examined), and investigation of the patient
histories continues, but laboratory confirmations have declined to
5-10 per week in line with a marke!
d reduction in veterinary diagnoses. From past experience, it can be
surmised that there will be a sharp decline in transmission of the
disease when the onset of frosts at the end of May 2010 suppresses
mosquito activity.

There is no evidence that RVF infection has ever occurred in urban
consumers of meat subjected to inspection at abattoirs, as opposed to
meat derived form informal slaughter of sick animals in rural
communities, and pasteurized milk and other dairy products sold in
towns likewise appear to be safe. Since RVF did not pose a threat to
the population at large at the height of the present outbreak, it is
unlikely to present a hazard to tourists during the winter months of
June and July.

Veterinary control and prevention of the disease is compounded by the
irregular occurrence of outbreaks and the feasibility of mass
immunization of livestock. Methods for predicting outbreaks of RVF
are as yet imprecise. Nevertheless, national and provincial
veterinary services in South Africa repeatedly warned farmers to
vaccinate livestock during the past 3 years. Unfortunately, many of
the farmers are unfamiliar with the disease and were slow to respond.
Moreover, if livestock are vaccinated during an outbreak, there is a
danger of spreading the outbreak. Furthermore, it is not cost
effective to produce and stockpile vaccine when demand is low, so
supply problems are often encountered during outbreaks. The most
readily produced veterinary vaccine, a modified live virus vaccine,
causes abortion in a small proportion of pregnant animals with a
resultant reluctance to use it in breeding stock. An inactivated
(killed) virus vaccine is also available, but is more laborious and e!
xpensive to produce, and since at least 2 initial doses and annual
boosters are required to induce solid immunity, it is less effective
for use in the face of an imminent outbreak.

The institution of compulsory livestock vaccination and veterinary
control would be prohibitively expensive and impossible to sustain
for a disease which disappears for decades at a time. The situation
may change with the advent of improved vaccines, which are already in
an advanced stage of development. A killed vaccine for use in humans
was produced in limited quantities decades ago, but it is no longer
available, and the small and irregular potential demand inhibits the
development of a new human vaccine.

[ProMED-mail very much appreciates the information provided by Dr.
Willie Ungerer, which details some factual information about Rift
Valley fever transmission to humans, control strategies in animal
populations and factors determining the disease control choices made
during the current outbreak of RVF in South Africa. Clearly, it is
important to emphasize the fact that the vast majority of cases in
humans are associated with animal contact on farms and that foodborne
transmission of well cooked items, with the exception of
unpasteurized milk, has clearly never been associated with human RVF
cases. Again, Dr. Ungerer points out that Rift Valley fever has not
been a transmission threat to urban consumers of meats, and so
tourists who stay in town to watch the upcoming FIFA World Cup are
not at any increased risk of disease. This is emphatically the case
as evidenced by the fact that there are no international travel
warnings for South Africa concerning RVF.

What is of greatest interest in this South Africa RVF outbreak is the
assessment and management of risk and the integration of animal and
human health concerns. Risk is not limited to only the probability of
disease spread in the animal population and its potential for
infecting humans. A proper risk assessment requires consideration of
magnitude of the consequences if the disease were to not only infect
farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers etc. but also somehow
infect a tourist traveling outside the FIFA World Cup game sites
while on their visit to South Africa. The FIFA world cup will last
for about a month, and any case of RVF in tourists would have severe
ramifications.

Clearly, the disease has a history of disappearing for decades in
South Africa, but it has also appeared for the last 2 years in South
Africa affecting cattle, sheep, goats and African buffalo, with 28
outbreaks and 501 cases in 2008 and 56 outbreaks and 401 cases in
2009 (see Disease Database Query on Animal Diseases in the RSA at
<http://www.daff.gov.za/>).

Does the fact that the disease appeared in South Africa during the
last 2 years change the disease control calculus in any way? Another
issue, which really is the proverbial elephant in the room, is how
much risk is being accepted by letting the disease run its course,
when so many tourists are flocking to the country. It is stated by
Dr. Ungerer that the disease would be prohibitively expensive to
control in livestock, but what would be the consequences and cost of
even a single tourist being diagnosed with a true case of RVF?
Additionally, given that farmers are only encouraged but not mandated
to vaccinate, are not provided vaccine by the government and have
apparently chosen not to vaccinate, it appears that the only RVF
disease control strategy has been to allow the disease to run its
course. This has resulted in a situation where the control strategy
for both animals and, by extension, humans depends on reducing the
disease in animals passively as the vector population d!
ies out with the approaching winter. Given recent experiences with
climate variation associated with global climate change and the
extension of vector ranges such as bluetongue in Europe, is such a
passive strategy justified given the stakes this year (2010) in South
Africa?

The disease outbreaks are still being updated at OIE, so can we
really depend this year (2010) on the traditional onset of winter to
end the epidemic in animals? Would a formal cost benefit and risk
analysis provide help in making any or all of these risk management
decisions?

A final issue which may shed light on optimal disease control
approaches to use in the future is how well have the human and animal
disease control sectors integrated their responses. This is
particularly important because the nature of Rift Valley fever is
such that animals are the source of the disease and the source of its
ultimate control. Control efforts in people appeared to be a high
priority as the South African Field Epidemiology and Laboratory
Training Program (SAFELTP) was involved early, but it would be
fascinating to know the public health perspective on letting the
South African winter end the epidemic in animals as the chief disease
control tactic for the source of ongoing disease spread. It would
also be important to know how decision making in the South African
public health establishment integrated veterinary inputs for
controlling the disease in animals, their assessment of risk after
the last 2 years of outbreaks, and how much emphasis is placed on
zoonotic!
disease control in various public health decision making centers
such as the FELTP program. In the end, it is a question of how much
and at what levels integrated veterinary and human health inputs in
disease control decision making occur, how integrated the process is
in the day to day disease management sense, and how much of a One
Medicine, One Health perspective is taken when being faced with an
outbreak situation involving a major zoonotic disease during a time
of high visibility, greatly increased worldwide travel to South
Africa and when major economic stakes are involved.

In summary, we are beginning to understand that disease emerges when
just the "perfect storm" of events come together to foster the
emergence of a new disease or a major change in disease epidemiology.
Is the failure of vaccination in animals, the passivity of the
control program in animals, the lack of emphasis on monitoring and
control at the human animal interface, the population and
demographics changes which are occurring with the influx of tourists
for FIFA World Cup games just such a "perfect storm"? Probably not,
as the emergence of new disease is rare indeed and some new
transmission dynamics would have to be elaborated by the virus
because current prospects for any human transmission to tourists are
really highly unlikely. However, I do hope such precautionary
thinking is a part of an integrated prevention perspective where such
unusual circumstances occur from time to time around the world. -
