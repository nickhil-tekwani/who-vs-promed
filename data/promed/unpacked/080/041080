What does 'successfully using' mean in this context? Germany has apparently
not been spared by the recent increase in human cases of infection with _S.
enteritidis_ reported throughout Europe (see
<http://www.eurosurv.org/1997/970626.htm>).
>>vaccine based on a nonpathogenic, modified _S. typhimurium_ single
deletion<<
In fact there are two different live vaccines in use. None of them is a
deletion mutant (see below).
>The companies producing the vaccine are Empstoff Dessau ...
The producer should read Impstoffwerke Dessau
Their live vaccine (Zoosaloral H) is a double auxotrophic mutant (requiring
histidine and adenine) which was created by chemical mutagenesis. The
mutants have not been genetically engineered, and the mutations have
therefore not been further characterized. It is not known in which enzyme
of the biosynthetic pathways to histidine and adenine the mutations are
located. The frequency of reversion to prototrophy for either of the
mutations does not suggest that there is a deletion involved in the
mutation. The vaccine was initially produced for cattle in the former GDR,
and was 'adapted' for use in poultry by raising the inoculum size.
>> Lohmann Animal Health,<<
This vaccine (Salmonella VacT, TAD) is also not a deletion mutant. Two
antibiotic resistances (nalidixic acid and rifampicin) were introduced by
spontaneous mutation, and were reportedly attenuating the strain by
increasing its generation time. A further mutation was introduced by
chemical mutagenesis (called 'Rtt') and leads to 'hypersensitivity' of the
vaccine strain to various chemical agents, including detergents, dyes, and
the antibiotic erythromycin. Neither of the three mutations has been
genetically characterized.
