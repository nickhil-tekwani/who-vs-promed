A 45-year-old woman died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, known as Congo fever, in Kutch [district, Gujarat state] on Wednesday afternoon [15 Jul 2015].

Dr Pankajkumar Pandey, chief district health officer of Kutch said, the woman was resident of Rampara Vekra village in Mandvi taluka of the district.

"We came to know about the suspected Congo fever patient on 12 Jul [2015]. We had taken her blood samples and sent it for testing in Pune. The report arrived on Tuesday [14 Jul 2015] which confirmed she was infected with Congo virus. She was admitted to a private hospital and on Wednesday [15 Jul 2015] was referred to G K General Hospital in Bhuj where she died at around 3:20pm," Dr Pandey said.

"We have deployed medical teams in the woman's village to find out if there are other people having similar symptoms. Besides medical teams, a team of veterinary officials are also camping in the village," said an official.

[There was one previous suspected case and one confirmed case, also from the Kutch district, of CCHF in Gujarat state reported on 18 Feb 2015 and 29 Mar 2015, respectively. CCHF virus is endemic in Gujarat state, and human cases have occurred there as recently as last year (2014). The way in which this and previously reported CCHF virus infections were acquired is not stated. Perhaps the veterinary and public health teams investigating the situation in the village will be able to determine the source of her infection. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150128.3124546, the virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

The CDC states, "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was 1st characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.

The virus is sensitive in vitro to the antiviral drug ribavirin. It has been used in the treatment of CCHF patients reportedly with some benefit (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/). However, since the patient died so soon after admission, effective use of the drug in the treatment of the case above would not have been possible.
