[1] Case update
- Wed 3 Jun 2020. Situation in DRC
[Deutsche Welle (DW), abridged, edited]
https://m.dw.com/en/dr-congos-relentless-fight-against-ebola/a-53675143

An Ebola outbreak in the eastern part of the Democratic Congo (DRC), which has been going on for nearly 2 years, was almost contained when another outbreak was confirmed at the far end of the country in the northwest. The 2 regions are about 1200 kilometers (745 mi) apart.

Four people have died so far, the Ministry of Health said on Monday [1 Jun 2020]. The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, said 5 have so far died of the virus. Four more people have also been infected.

The country's minister of health, Eteni Longondo, told DW there have 12 suspected Ebola cases as of Tuesday [2 Jun 2020]. The affected area is Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur Province. It boasts important transport routes, such as the navigable part of the Congo River, through which Ebola could spread further.

Dealing with Ebola is not new for the province. An outbreak in the region 2 years ago [2018] lasted about 2.5 months. In that outbreak, 54 people contracted the virus and 33 of them died.

The 2018 experience was definitely a turning point.

"It's a very positive sign how quickly the outbreak was noticed," Natalie Roberts of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) said. "The people who work in the region understand the signs of Ebola much better. They have access to testing and can get results quickly."

Roberts said she is optimistic that the outbreak in the northwest can quickly be contained.

According to UNICEF, the people killed by the virus died between 18 and 30 May [2020]. In the 2 largest Ebola epidemics in the world, in West Africa outbreak from 2013-2016 and the one that has been going on in eastern Congo since 2018, much more time passed before an outbreak was declared, Roberts said. "We lost control of the spread before an outbreak was even noticed," she added.

The time factor is crucial. The sooner a cluster is known, the smaller the chances infected people would have moved, and, ideally, the smaller the network of contacts that need to be isolated or prophylactically treated.

In addition, developments in the medical field are much further along than during previous epidemics. At the end of 2019, both the USA and the European Union had approved the Ervebo vaccine [rVSV-ZEBOV]. According to the manufacturer, Merck, the DRC, Ghana, Zambia and Burundi have now also authorized the vaccine. The Congolese Ministry of Health has already declared that vaccines and medicines are to be brought to Equateur.

Irrespective of the vaccine approval, the drug has already been used in emergencies during outbreaks. For example, 2 years ago in the province of Equateur, a few thousand people including contact persons of infected people and health personnel were vaccinated.

Professor Marylyn Addo, research head of infectious diseases at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, led one of the studies on the effectiveness and tolerability of the vaccine. "Those who were vaccinated in 2018 may still have some protection," the physician said. However, there are limited data on how long the immunization really lasts after receiving the vaccination.

Up to now, the vaccine has been administered to prevent the disease from spreading: "You vaccinate all contact persons and the neighbors. One tries to close a vaccination bar around an outbreak," Addo explained.

That is how the vaccine was tried in the eastern part of the Congo. Since the outbreak in early August 2018, there have been 3463 cases of Ebola, and almost two-thirds of those infected have died of the infection. More than 300 000 people have received the vaccine there. Natalie Roberts spent about half a year in North Kivu in 2019, working with Doctors Without Borders' vaccination program. She said they faced some challenges.

The vaccine must be stored at -80 deg C (-112 deg F). "This is not easy in a country like the DRC, where electricity or roads are not always reliable," Roberts said. Since it was still an experimental vaccine at the time, the number of doses of the vaccine was limited.

Since Ebola symptoms resemble those of malaria, which is prevalent in the region, malaria cases had to be carefully filtered out. Another problem was that some people got Ebola even though they were vaccinated. This means that they [likely] were already infected at the time of vaccination, but the disease had not shown symptoms.

"A lot of people didn't really understand this," Roberts said.

There is another important factor in the fight against Ebola in DR Congo: the citizens. There were reports that parts of the population did not trust the aid organizations, and there were repeated attacks on Ebola centers and in some cases, Ebola patients fled.

Roberts added that aid organizations also made mistakes. "We are building a system that is only for Ebola patients," Roberts said. "Doctors without Borders need to understand that patients tend to go to their health service of trust. This can be the local pharmacy, the traditional healer or a local private clinic. They don't necessarily go to a non-governmental organization that comes from outside and say: 'I think I might have Ebola; can you take me to your center?'" Aid agencies should adapt to people's behavior, not the other way around, she added.

Research on the Ebola virus is continuing in the medical field. According to infectiologist Addo, a 2nd vaccine is currently being developed, but it must be administered in 2 doses, 56 days apart. Therefore, it is not suitable for an acute outbreak and could rather be used for the immunization of health personnel. According to Natalie Roberts, there is hope that this vaccine will provide longer protection against infection. In addition, there are still studies underway on drugs for treatment when the disease has broken out.

But no matter how hard the virus is fought, Ebola will always return, Addo said, because the virus is also found in animals: "From there the disease can always be transmitted to humans." The technical term for such diseases is zoonosis. As counterexamples, Addo cited measles: "In measles, there is only the human being as a reservoir. That means if we eradicate measles from humans the way we've eradicated smallpox, it won't come back."

Addo said the DRC is generally prepared for further outbreaks: "Until the 10th outbreak [in eastern Congo], they were all relatively small. The Congo has always managed to control these outbreaks by itself -- even without a vaccine."

Roberts said she expects more outbreaks to be detected in the future. For them, however, this is "a positive thing."

"I think the outbreaks have always been there, only in 2 or 3 cases people didn't even notice it," she said, adding that she thinks it's likely that people are now much more sensitized and therefore more likely to detect an epidemic.

But the fight against other diseases cannot be ignored: In 2019, more than 6000 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo died from measles, more than from Ebola [see ProMED-mail Measles update (15) 20200531.7412542].

[Byline: Emma Farge and Hereward Holland]

Two more people infected with Ebola in new Congo outbreak, WHO says. An epidemic of the virus on the other side of the country has killed more than 2200 people since 2018.

The 2 outbreaks are the same strain of the virus, which means the same vaccines can be used to help contain its spread, health officials say, although they are not thought to be linked.

"The latest person confirmed with Ebola attended the burial of one of the 1st cases, but was detected in the town of Bikoro, 150 kilometres (about 93 mi) away from Mbandaka," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists. "This means that 2 health zones are now affected."

Mbandaka suffered a small Ebola outbreak in 2018 in which 33 people died. The use of a vaccine and swift containment efforts including mobile handwashing stations and a door-to-door education campaign kept it at bay.

On Wednesday [3 Jun 2020] almost 50 health workers from WHO and its partners arrived in Mbandaka with 3600 doses of Ebola vaccine and 2000 cartridges for lab testing, Tedros said.

[2] Response
- Fri 5 Jun 2020 07:25 EAT. Red Cross
[Africa Business Communities, edited]
https://africabusinesscommunities.com/news/red-cross-calls-for-swift-extensive-response-to-the-new-ebola-outbreak-in-dr-congo/
[Byline: Pie Kamau]

The Red Cross calls for a swift, extensive response to the new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). More than 150 trained Red Cross volunteers have been deployed as part of a 1st wave of response to the latest Ebola outbreak in the Equateur Province, in the western part of the DRC.

Dr. Simon Missiri, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies' (IFRC) Regional Director for Africa, said: "The resurgence of the virus in Equateur Province comes at the worst possible time, when we are already facing a double outbreak -- COVID-19 and Ebola in East and West DRC -- in one of the most complex and dangerous environments in the world. The health, economic and social impact has the potential to be huge for millions of people who have limited capacity to cope, as their access to healthcare, food security and safety nets is continuously being eroded by humanitarian emergencies and the ongoing conflict."

The 11th Ebola outbreak in Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur Province, was officially declared by the DRC Ministry of Health on 31 May 2020. This area was previously affected by an outbreak between May and July 2018. It adds an additional layer of suffering for a population that is already struggling to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

The DRC Red Cross has been on the frontline of all previous Ebola outbreaks in the country and has developed a strong in-country capacity with 1600 trained and highly skilled volunteers. Crucially, these have successfully built trust with communities. During the most recent outbreak in the eastern DRC, these volunteers provided information on prevention to almost 3 million people and conducted over 28 000 successful safe and dignified burials for confirmed or suspected Ebola cases as part of the 10th outbreak.

Robert Ghosn, Ebola Operations Manager for the IFRC, said: "When it comes to containing epidemics before these turn into large-scale humanitarian disasters, you need not only to act local, with local responders taking ownership of the response, but also to act fast. As the global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought the world to its knees, we at the Red Cross have lost no time in scaling up activities in DRC. This is not the time to look away from the dire suffering of Congolese people, or the consequences for millions of them would be unimaginable."

[3] New spillover event
- Fri 5 Jun 2020. Phylogenetic analysis
[Virological.org, edited]
https://virological.org/t/ebola-virus-disease-case-in-equateur-province-drc-is-a-new-spillover/504

On 1 Jun 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced a new cluster of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases occurring in Mbandaka health zone, in Equateur Province. This is the same area where the DRC's 9th Ebola outbreak occurred back in May 2018. A sample was sent to Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in Kinshasa for confirmatory testing. Ebola virus (EBOV) was confirmed by PCR on 1 Jun 2020 using the GeneXpert (GP ct 31, NP ct 28). The sample was sequenced using an amplicon strategy developed with Primal Scheme (using MK007330 as a reference to generate the primers), followed by Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation. The consensus genome 10 was generated using iVar 1 on 4 Jun 2020.

The new EVD cluster could have been seeded from the current North Kivu/Ituri outbreak (Ituri), from the May 2018 Equateur province outbreak (Tumba) via a persistent source, or a new spillover event from the reservoir host. The new EBOV genome was aligned to single representatives from previous EVD outbreaks using MAFFT, and a phylogenetic tree was inferred using RaxML (see Figure 1 at source URL).

Figure 1. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of all EVD outbreaks, including the sequence from the new outbreak in red.

Due to the level of divergence from Ituri (more than 350 substitutions) and Tumba (more than 150 substitutions), this genome likely represents a new spillover event and the 11th EVD outbreak in the DRC, the 3rd outbreak in 2 years. A root-to-tip analysis (see Figure 2 at source URL) shows the new genome grouping with 4 variants that have reduced rates of evolution compared with the 11 other representative sequences. More thorough analyses will be conducted in the coming days.

[This spillover event is the 3rd outbreak in 2 years. This represents a rapid rate of emergence of Ebola virus from its sylvatic reservoir(s). Such a high rate of emergence underlines the importance of studying the sylvatic and farmed vertebrate hosts and, equally, maintaining a strong public health infrastructure that is ready to respond immediately upon detection of new cases.
