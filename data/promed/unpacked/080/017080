AFRICAN SWINE FEVER - MADAGASCAR

The authorities in Madagascar are trying to halt the spread of an
epidemic which has affected nearly half the country's population of
pigs. They have forbidden the transfer of pigs from one area to another,
and are considering slaughtering some 200 000 animals in an attempt
to stop the disease.
The BBC correspondent in Antananarivo says pig farmers are not keen on
this solution because no financial compensation is available. Farmers
are also concerned because the disease, known as the African Plague, has
led to a fall in the price of pork.
[Perhaps some of our readers who are more knowledgable about this could
inform us of the clinical signs and treatment options if there are any
