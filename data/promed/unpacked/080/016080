Mongolia: hand-foot-mouth disease update No. 1: 10 Jun-8 Jul 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Hygiene promotion activities have commenced and already volunteers and
staff of the Mongolian Red Cross Society have been mobilized to deliver
important messages to the public about the prevention of this disease.
Activities to support capacity building at the branches for the ongoing
prevention of hand-foot-mouth disease will start in late July [2008].

The situation
-------------
Since 8 May 2008 a serious outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) due
to enterovirus 71 (EV71) has affected thousands of children and families
throughout Mongolia. As of 7 Jul 2008, a total of 2618 people have been
diagnosed with this virus. 83 per cent of the reported enteroviral diseases
occurred in children who were younger than 10 years and 10 per cent of
those infected were younger than one year.

Although many have recovered on their own and no fatal cases have been
reported to date, as of 7 Jul 2008, 24.5 per cent of all those diagnosed
with enterovirus 71 had complications that required hospitalizations.
Several patients had severe complications such as aseptic meningitis,
encephalitis, myocarditis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis, which may lead
to disability or even death. It is known that pulmonary edema or
haemorrhage, which is a common complication, can kill a child within one
day, therefore health workers all over the country have been working
around-the-clock providing intensive care to patients in critical
condition. Largely owing credit to these efforts, no casualties have been
reported to date. As of 7 Jul 2008, 162 individuals remain hospitalized and
599 people have been discharged from hospitals.

Total number of cases of HFMD (8 May-7 Jul 2008)
------------------------------------------------
According to the Ministry of Health of Mongolia this is the largest spread
of enterovirus recorded so far in Mongolia and since the 1st case in 8 May
2008, it has affected 90 per cent of all territories within Mongolia. Next
to Ulaanbaatar, the most affected areas are in the Eastern region
(Sukhbaatar, Khentii, Dornod provinces), the Orkhon-Selenge region (Selenge
province), the Gobi or Southern region (Dornogobi province), and the
Khangai region (Uvurhangai province).

As Naadam, Mongolia's most popular festival [comprising outdoor events such
as equestrianism, wrestling, archery, et alia] approaches, the authorities
fear that it may bring another spike in the epidemic of HFMD, and are thus
conducting activities to increase the communities' outbreak control and
preparedness. While schools and kindergartens resumed their normal
operations in most places, the youth summer camps have been suspended until
mid-July [2008].

Concurrent with this major outbreak, many of the affected provinces are
coping with the devastating consequences of the snow fall disaster that
struck most of Mongolia in early May [2008] in which 52 people died and 150
000 livestock animals perished. It was estimated that 1500 people were
affected in that disaster and now face risk of encountering HFMD shortly
thereafter.

For further information specifically related to this situation please
contact the Mongolian Red Cross Society (Mr Ravdan Samdandobji,
secretary-general) <redcross@magicnet.mn>.
