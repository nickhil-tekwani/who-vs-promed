[The following comments are from Dr. G. Lee, Acting Deputy Director for
Preventive Services in American Samoa. They're reproduced with his
permission. Dr. Lee provides PACNET with an update of the situation re:
dengue-like fever in American Samoa, following a previous specific RFI, and
recent PACNET warnings about dengue-like fever in other Pacific islands
(Fiji and Samoa). We wish to thank Dr. Lee for his contribution, and also
[point out that American Samoa Dept. of Public Health is now e-mail
connected to PACNET - YS

During the past three months, July 1, 1997 to date, we have recorded only
three suspected dengue fever cases (one inpatient in August; one outpatient
in September; and, one outpatient in October). None of these cases has
been confirmed. Available data does not indicate a significant increase in
other flu-like illnesses.
We continue to monitor outpatient and inpatient utilization data for these
diseases, as well as other notifiable diseases, and will provide timely
notification to the Pacific Public Health surveillance Network of any
increased activity in such febrile conditions.
[There being no confirmation that this outbreak is due to a dengue virus,
we will withhold future reports on the situation until we obtain
clarification. -Mod. CHC
