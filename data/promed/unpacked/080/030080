An emergency situation has been announced in one of the farms of the
Gorodovikskoe rayon of Kalmykia because of anthrax. Tests on the
samples from one of the slaughtered cows confirmed the presence of
anthrax. 12 contact persons are in the hospital now.

A similar outbreak occurred in the village of Uspenskaya of
Beloglinskaya rayon during the fall [2010], when 3 cows fell ill
because of anthrax, and 19 other cows were culled. As of 29 Sep 2010,
8 people had been admitted to the hospital with the skin form of
anthrax. However, none of the human cases were laboratory confirmed.
