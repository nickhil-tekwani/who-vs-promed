[1] Cholera - Uganda (Namayingo District)
Date: Tue 10 Jun 2014

The Ministry of Health is missing in action in Namayingo District more than 2 weeks after a cholera outbreak that has so far claimed the lives of at least 3 people and seen another close to 100 admitted in different health facilities. The district health inspector, Mr Musenze Mutumba, told this newspaper at the weekend [7-8 Jun 2014] that the district had recorded 61 new cases last week alone, bringing the number of cases in hospital to 94, up from 33 recorded in the previous week.

Matters have been complicated by lack of capacity in terms of drugs, medical personnel and resources to handle the magnitude of the problem. The district has 1 medical doctor who is stationed at the 60-bed Buyinja Health Centre IV, and 113 other medical workers stationed in its 23 health facilities.

The vice chairperson of the district, Ms Anastansia Koni Ndira, who is also the woman councillor representing Sigulu Islands in the district council, said the matter was addressed to the Ministry of Health when the 1st cases were reported, but that they had not received any response. The only intervention, she said, was that of the NGO, Star EC (which is involved in the fight against HIV), which delivered Jik and other disinfectants when the epidemic 1st broke out.

[2] Cholera - Congo DR (South Kivu Province)

The chief physician of the area of health of Fizi, Dr Delphin Asende Ehebelo, claims to have identified about 52 cases of cholera in a week in the locality of Baraka (Sud-Kivu [South Kivu Province]). He has delivered this information on Sunday [1 Jun 2014] to the journalists in Bukavu, in South Kivu.

Dr Delphin Asende has explained the reasons for the resurgence of this epidemic to Baraka: "Baraka does not have drinking water. There are 77 fountains that have been constructed for a population estimated at 80 000 people. Some people go out to draw water from the lake, which constitutes a large fireplace of diseases."

He regretted that the population consumes the water of Lake Tanganyika without observing appropriate hygiene measures. The cholera treatment center of Baraka had registered, last May 2014, 50 cases. The districts most affected by the disease were among other areas, Mwemezi, Aebaz and Macampagne, where water taps were not installed.

According to the chief physician of the area of health of Fizi, no deaths have been recorded. Baraka often faces cholera caused by poor sanitation and lack of drinking water in several neighborhoods.

[3] Cholera, diarrhea - Nepal

The Epidemiology and Diseases Control Division [EDCD] has said that despite various awareness raising campaigns after a diarrhea outbreak 2 months ago [April 2014], the disease is yet to be contained in various places across the country, due largely to negligence on the part of the people.

The waterborne disease has claimed 2 lives and affected as many as 880 people to date at Gaindatar of Chandrapur municipality, Rautahat [District, Central Region].

Similarly, 12 people have died and 2207 people have been affected by the disease since late April 2014 in Biratnagar of Morang District [Eastern Region].

"Though we have been organizing various awareness campaigns and using preventive and curative treatment to contain the disease, there has been no decline in the incidence of diarrhea cases," said Dr Baburam Marasini, director at EDCD. He said that people were still drinking contaminated water, which was the main reason why the outbreak is not subsiding. The diarrhea outbreak, which was 1st reported in late April 2014, is still affecting thousands of people.

[4] Diarrhea - Solomon Islands (Malaita Province)
Date: Wed 11 Jun 2014

http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/2400-lau-lagoons-hit-by-diarrhea-outbreak


The diarrhea outbreak announced by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services last week [week ending 8 Jun 2014] has taken its toll on those residing on the artificial islands in the Lau Lagoons of Malaita [Province]. Famous for its more than 100 man-made islands and mostly fishing expert inhabitants, the region has also been one of the most heavily struck by the diarrhea outbreak.

Reports reaching the Solomon Star said that the outbreak had spread rapidly amongst artificial island inhabitants, especially since they all live crowdedly in their islands in the seas. Speaking to Solomon Star, Niuleni village elder, Satu Pita, said children were the ones mostly struck by the outbreak.

"It is somewhat frightening, especially given the fact that we survive off the sea, we live in the sea, eat from the sea, when a virus or bacterial disease like this spreads, everyone will fall victim. Our students on the island have been down with diarrhea; this is just a glimpse of how much the outbreak is taking its toll on us islanders," Mr Pita said.

Similar sentiments were received from other artificial islands, adding that the outbreak has also gotten most of their children down. Meanwhile, most Lau Lagoon islanders are calling on medical authorities to do brief medical rounds in the lagoon, especially to do general medical checkups on children that have been heavily struck by the outbreak.
