How do you save a billion dollars on livestock handling costs? Split Texas
into 2 rankings for cattle tuberculosis (TB) eradication, and more than 99
percent of the state's 153 000 producers could move their cattle across
state lines without TB testing and tagging restrictions. A U.S. Department
of Agriculture report says this "freedom of movement" could save producers
up to a billion dollars over a 5-year period.
Splitting the state sounds simple, but Dr. Terry Beals, Texas' state
veterinarian and head of the Texas Animal Health Commission (TACH), says
this not only requires federal review and approval, but it's a political
and economic issue for producers left "behind the line." Nevertheless, Dr.
Beals said making the request is essential, due to new tighter federal
regulations that are scheduled to become effective later this year.
"If the state is split, the El Paso area will have a lower TB eradication
status, and the 88 beef producers and about a dozen dairy operators in the
region could have to tag all cattle and test breeding stock before the
animals move intra- or inter-state. If we don't split the state, every
Texas producer will face these restrictions, and it will cost producers up
to a billion dollars during the next 5 years in extra livestock handling
costs."
The El Paso area is predominately a dairy production area, with more than
20 000 dairy animals and around 3000 beef cattle. Since l985, cattle TB
has been confirmed in 252 dairy animals in the area, and most of these, 204
cases, were found in one badly infected dairy depopulated in the early 90s.
Typically, the quarantined herds have had a low incidence of
disease--sometimes only one animal--reports Dr. Baca.
A biosurvey of the Rio Grande Valley in l996 was conducted as a cooperative
project of the USDA, TACH, and Texas Dept. of Health, Agricultural
Experiment Station, Extension Service, and Animal Damage Control. Surveyors
collected and tested birds, rodents, air, carnivores, soil and water, all
without detecting infection. The 124 dairy workers tested also were
disease-free.

[Splitting the state by disease status has been done previously in other
animal health control programs. For example, North Carolina began it's
pseudorabies eradication program with 2 different classification of disease
status. It is analogous to the regionalization of countries into areas
which being free of disease qualify to export animals and a second area
that contains the countries diseased animals. While the economic benefits
can be considerable as in this case, it is important that risks of
exporting disease are not also increased. Good surveillance is a must. -
