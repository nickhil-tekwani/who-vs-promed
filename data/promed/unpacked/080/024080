[1] Cholera - Niger (Zinder)

Cholera has claimed 21 lives among 206 infected people in Niger
following seasonal rains that have flooded communities and left them
unable to cope with a health crisis.
A joint task force of the UN, Red Cross and Non Governmental
Organisations (NGOs) has been put in place to monitor the cholera
epidemic. Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) is overseeing an isolation
unit 12 km south of the town Zinder, which is in the far southeast of
the country.
Niger health authorities said Zinder, 900 km east of the capital,
Niamey, was the worst affected. They said 8 people died and another
100 with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea were taken to a regional
hospital center for treatment.
Landlocked Niger, hemmed in by the Sahara desert in north central
Africa, is the poorest country in the world, according to the UN's
Human Development Index (HDI), which ranks 177 countries according to
factors such as access to healthcare, literacy and life expectancy.

The number of people being treated for cholera at Vanga Health Centre
in Kwale District has risen to 15. 2 people have so far died of the
disease and most of the patients were children.
On Mon, 25 Sep 2006, the provincial medical officer of health, Dr
Anderson Kahindi, asked villagers during a tour of the area that
borders Tanzania to put chlorine water from wells. "We have
identified the source of the disease as the wells and have
chlorinated them," Dr Kahindi told the Nation by telephone.
By yesterday, 26 Sep 2006, 30 people from the area had been treated
and discharged.

[3] Cholera - Kenya (Coast Province)
Date: Mon, 25 Sep 2006
From: SK Sharif <sksharif@ikenya.com>

The Ministry of Health of Kenya has confirmed an outbreak of cholera
in Vanga Village in Kwale District in Kenya. The first case reported
on 17 Sep 2006 and by 25 Sep 2006 there were 45 reported cases. So
far there have been 2 deaths.
Vanga village is on the southern Coast of Kenya bordering Tanzania.
The area is cholera endemic with frequent outbreaks. The last
outbreak reported from the area was in 2004. The source of
contamination is thought to be water in shallow wells and the wells
have been contaminated by pit latrines which are very close to the well.

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Sokoto)

<http://allafrica.com/stories/200609250560.html>

About 100 persons have died as a result of a cholera epidemic in 4
local government areas in Sokoto state recently. Weekly Trust reports
that many more people are still bed-ridden with the disease, fueling
fears that the last death has not been recorded yet.
The communicable disease, first detected in Tureta local government
about 50 km away from Sokoto, the state capital, claimed over 20
lives before another outbreak was recorded in Gwadabawa.
However, the outbreak in Dange-Shuni last week over shadowed the
number of causalities in Tureta, Gwadabawa and Wammako local
government areas all neighboring the state capital.
The outbreak in Shuni town and about 6 surrounding villages notably,
Kwannawa which is just behind, the Army Barracks, Sokoto was detected
on 21 Sep 2006 and within 48 hours, over 30 lives were lost while
about 158 victims were treated and discharged.
Although officials of the state ministry of health under the
leadership of the deputy director, Primary Health Care, Alhaji
Abubakar Khadi were not forthcoming with the exact figure of the
dead, officials of the Dange-Shuni local government council as 22 Sep
2006 put the figure at 22 while the state ministry insisted on 9 only.
However, the information officer of the Nigerian Red Cross Society in
Sokoto, Malam Ahmed Are Ashige told Weekly Trust that within the
initial 48 hours, about 9 deaths were recorded at the temporary
clinic set up at the Kwannawa Primary School just behind the Army
Barracks while over 22 people died in various villages surrounding Shuni town.
By Sun afternoon, 24 Sep 2006, the death toll rose to almost 40 with
about 200 of those affected treated and discharged while about 55
were still on admission.
