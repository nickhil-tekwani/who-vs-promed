An outbreak of flea-borne typhus has hit downtown Los Angeles [CA], the county Department of Public Health said Thursday [4 Oct 2018]. Health officials say they are investigating several cases of flea-borne typhus, a disease that infected fleas can spread to humans.

Although the fleas can come from cats, rats, and opossums, pets and animals do not get sick from typhus. In people, however, typhus can cause high fever, chills, headache, and rash. It is not transmitted from person to person and can be treated with antibiotics.

"Although typhus normally occurs throughout LA County, we are observing several cases in the downtown Los Angeles area," Los Angeles County Health Officer Muntu Davis said in a statement. "We encourage pet owners to practice safe flea control and encourage all cities in the county to ensure maintenance of their trash clean-up and rodent control activities." Typhus can spread in areas where there is an accumulation of trash that attracts wild animals like feral cats, rats, and opossums.

To help prevent typhus, the department recommended that residents:
- Practice safe flea control.
- Use flea control products on pets.
- When outside, wear pants tucked into socks or boots when outside. Spray insect repellent with DEET on socks and pant cuffs.
- Avoid being near wild or stray animals.
- Never feed or touch wild animals, especially opossums, rats, and stray or feral cats.
- Store trash in cans with secure lids to avoid attracting animals.
- Clear areas where rats and stray animals sleep, hide or find food, such as crawl spaces, attics, or under decks, and wear gloves and a mask when clearing these areas.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) is reporting an endemic flea-borne typhus outbreak in downtown Los Angeles. Between July and September 2018, health officials identified 9 cases of flea-borne typhus.

The cases have a history of living or working in downtown Los Angeles, and 6 of them have reported experiencing homelessness or living in interim housing facilities in the area. All cases were hospitalized, and no deaths have occurred.

Flea-borne typhus is endemic in LAC with cases detected each year. In recent years, the average number of cases reported to LAC DPH has doubled to nearly 60 cases per year; however, geographic clusters of the size occurring in downtown Los Angeles are unusual. Most cases occur in the summer and fall months.

In LAC, the primary animals known to carry infected fleas include rats, feral cats, and opossums. People with significant exposure to these animals are at risk of acquiring flea-borne typhus. Pet dogs and cats that are allowed outside may also come in contact with infected fleas and could carry them to humans. Infected animals are not known to get sick from flea-borne typhus.

Flea-borne typhus, also known as murine or endemic typhus, is a disease transmitted by fleas infected with _Rickettsia typhi_ or _Rickettsia felis_.

Flea-borne typhus may be a mild, self-limited illness, or can present as severe disease requiring hospitalization. Symptoms occur 7 to 14 days after exposure, and typically include abrupt onset of fever, headache, chills, myalgia, abdominal pain, or vomiting. A maculopapular rash may appear after one week but may also be absent altogether. Severe cases may result in renal, respiratory, ophthalmologic, cardiac, or neurologic dysfunction. Person-to-person transmission does not occur. Humans are a dead-end host for flea-borne typhus.

Flea-borne typhus is readily treated with antibiotics. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice.

[The above news articles report an outbreak of flea-borne typhus in downtown Los Angeles, California, occurring mainly among homeless people. The homeless population has been reported to be particularly at risk of many vector-borne diseases like flu-borne typhus because of their poor living conditions (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957111000828). In July 2018, ProMED-mail recently posted a report of flea-borne typhus, also called murine typhus, in the city of San Diego [CA] about 120 miles (193 km) south of Los Angeles. Of the approximately 200 cases of murine typhus reported in the USA each year, most cases occur in the states of Texas, California, and Hawaii.

Murine typhus, which occurs throughout the world, is a flea-borne rickettsial disease caused by _Rickettsia typhi_ and possibly _R. felis_ (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737805/). Rats are the primary animal reservoir of _R. typhi_; however, other mammals, such as free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums, as well as their fleas, can maintain this microorganism in areas where rats and rat fleas are absent (Azad AF, Radulovic S, Higgins JA, et al. Flea-borne rickettsioses: ecologic considerations. Emerg Infect Dis 1997;3(3):319-27; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627639/).

Humans are usually infected by contact with infected flea feces, either by inoculation into excoriated flea bites, inhalation, or ingestion. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, vomiting, nausea, myalgia, and rash. The illness usually resolves within 3 weeks, even if untreated. However, some patients are sick enough to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit, and up to 4 percent of hospitalized patients will die from the infection. Treatment is doxycycline. Prevention is directed at control of flea vectors and animal reservoirs.
