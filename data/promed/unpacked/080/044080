One comment regarding the posting cited above. Why are public health
officials so
quick to rule out water as a source for outbreaks such as this one based on
coliform counts? I understand that this counts suggest that bacterial
contamination of the water source is unlikely but coliform counts have
repeatedly been shown not to correlate with the viral load of a water
source (reference below). The symptoms listed could well be of viral origin.
