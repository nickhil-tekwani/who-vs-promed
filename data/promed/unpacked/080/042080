Even as Kozhikode is recovering from the Nipah jolt, 2 isolated cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been reported from the district.

A mosquito-borne viral infection resulting in inflammation of the brain, JE can cause fever, headache and seizures.

T. Jayakrishnan, Associate Professor (Community Medicine), Government Medical College, Manjeri, told The Hindu on Tuesday [29 May 2018] that JE cases were 1st reported in the State in Alappuzha in 1996, and there had been isolated cases from other districts since then.

They could have a debilitating effect on children and might lead even to disability. The mortality rate is high too. However, vaccine had been made available for the disease.

"Since a couple of JE cases had been reported from Kozhikode now, there is a chance that a few more will crop up in the days to come. It will be better to be on high alert to avoid any casualty," he added.

Additional District Medical Officer Asha Devi said both the patients had been discharged from the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode.

She added that health activists had started mosquito eradication activities in the localities of the affected patients when the cases were reported. Cleaning activities too were in full swing, she said.

[The JE virus transmission season is beginning in India. Although the above report mentions that vaccine is available, there is no indication that the 2 patients had been vaccinated or whether a vaccination campaign is planned. Because vector control is difficult and expensive, vaccination is a more effective preventive measure.

Frequently, in reports of JE cases in India, acute encephalitis syndrome of undefine etiology is often mentioned with JE cases, a minority of those hospitalized. In the above 2 cases, AES is not mentioned nor is there an indication that their JE virus etiology was laboratory confirmed. Fortunately, both patients survived. Putting the populace in the area on alert is prudent. - Mod.TY
