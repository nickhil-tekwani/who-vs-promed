In 2008, specialists of Agroscope Changins-Waedenswil (ACW) discovered
"Chinese nematodes" in Swiss glasshouses [see ProMED-mail post
20080912.2846]. The cause of unusual damage to vegetables in
glasshouses of northern Switzerland was identified as the introduced
root knot nematode _Meloidogyne enterolobii_. Early in 2008, the
national phytosanitary services of the Netherlands and Germany had
informed the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization
(EPPO) that _M. enterolobii_ was discovered in imported plants. The
nematode, which had been neglected until then, was included in the
EPPO Alert List.

Because several countries are concerned, EPPO launched a risk
analysis. A group of experts with ACW involvement came to the
conclusion that this nematode could become established in Europe in
the long term. Particularly affected are the southern countries, as
this species can overwinter well there. In temperate climates --
including Switzerland -- it is a danger for glasshouse crops.
According to ACW studies, the potential economic damage of this
species is higher than that of other nematodes because it has the
ability to bypass any known natural resistance mechanisms of plants.
Because of this risk analysis, EPPO may proclaim the pest a quarantine
organism in 2010.

The ACW scientists have already tested a rapid and reliable diagnostic
method and biological control strategies -- such as the use of
compost, organic fertilisers, or a biological pesticide.

[Root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) attack a wide range of
plants and cause significant economic losses in many vegetable and
fruit crops. The genus contains around 70 species and is found
worldwide in tropical and sub-tropical regions in many types of soil.
Symptoms may include stunting, wilting and leaf chlorosis, and large
galls are formed throughout the root system affecting plant vigour and
even killing the host. The pathogens can persist in the soil for years
and are spread by plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for
example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an
area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management
requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural
measures, nematicides, and use of resistant crop varieties.

_M. enterolobii_ is polyphagous and, although its precise host range
is still unknown, has been found on many economically important crops
including coffee, soybean, sweet potato, beans, guava, and several
solanaceous and cucurbit vegetables. It is considered a particularly
aggressive pathogen with increased virulence against crop varieties
resistant to other root knot nematodes. For example in Switzerland, it
was first reported on tomato rootstock lines resistant to _M.
incognita_, _M. javanica_, and _M. arenaria_. Its establishment in
Europe would pose a serious economic threat to the region.
