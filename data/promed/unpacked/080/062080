[Amol is located on the banks of the Haraz River 26 25'N 52 21'E, at an altitude of 76 m (250 ft) above sea level, about 18 km (11.2 mi) from the Caspian sea and about 10 km (6.2 mi) from the northern Alborz mountains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amol).

During April and May 2015, Russia and Kazakhstan reported HPAI in wild birds (see report below). These findings were located in areas around the Caspian Sea. Given the proximity of this recent outbreak in Iran to these previous findings, and the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 in wild birds in this area, there is a likely link between these events.

A previous outbreak in Iran was also located in the Mazandaran province. The event was resolved on 18 Jan 2012. See final report and map at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000011517_20120118_123834.pdf. - Mod.CRD
