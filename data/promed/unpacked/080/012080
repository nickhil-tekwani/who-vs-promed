A 2nd anthrax outbreak has been reported in Victoria's north-west. At least one sheep has died from the disease at a property near Nyah, with a "significant number" of other sheep dying at the site over the past few months. It follows a property near Swan Hill being quarantined last week[week of 6 Mar 2017], with at least one confirmed case of anthrax.

Agriculture Victoria said neighbouring properties in Nyah were being assessed and stock vaccinated.

Chief veterinary officer Charles Milne said the latest outbreak did have a relationship with the farm where the bacteria was detected in dead livestock last week. "It occurred on a property that was linked in business terms to our original case," he said. "The 2 properties are some distance apart and we know that the way anthrax infects animals is through the soil. We had certainly investigated that first property to ensure there was no risk factors that were of concern. This appears to be a separate incident, although we are clearly still investigating to see if there is any link."

Mr Milne said while many sheep had died on the Nyah property, anthrax had only been confirmed in one animal. "There's only the one sheep that we've had laboratory confirmation from," he said. "But there are a number of other sheep that have died on the property over the preceding months. Significant numbers [have died] but because of the advanced state of decomposition of some of them, it's impossible to give a precise number."

Human infection ruled out
-------------------------
There was concern a Swan Hill farmer had been infected by the disease in the last outbreak. But Dr Milne said there was good news on that front. "I'm pleased to say it was proven that it was not anthrax that caused the lesion in that individual," he said. "And that just emphasises the fact that human cases are very rare."

We can only wait to find out what the Victoria CVO, Charles Milne's people discover as to the cause of this 2nd sheep outbreak. Logically there might (note 'might', not 'may') be an epidemiologic link, such as animals being moved fro one to the other unvaccinated. The die-off on the 1st was massive with some 80 dead sheep being recorded, so it might have been a dirty truck with bloody mud. It will be interesting to know what they find. This is a job for an epidemiologist with muddy boots and a sharp eye, and good hearing; shepherds and owners will tell you things you never expected. "But there are a number of other sheep that have died on the property over the preceding months. Significant numbers [have died] but because of the advanced state of decomposition of some of them, it's impossible to give a precise number." Whatever started it did so a while ago. A challenge. - Mod.MHJ]
