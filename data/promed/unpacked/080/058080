The Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Dr. Chikwe Iheakweazu, on [Sat 10 Jul 2021], said, 6 states of the federation reported 1786 suspected cases of cholera between [20 to 26 Jun 2021]. While giving a list and a breakdown of the affected states, the NCDC DG, who spoke in Abuja, on [Sat 10 Jul 2021], said the states included Bauchi, 1239 cases; Kano, 362 cases; Niger, 62 cases; Zamfara, 55 cases; Kaduna, 59 cases, and Plateau, 9 cases.

He said in the preceding week of [13 to 19 Jun 2021], 5 states- Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau and Zamfara- reported 1757 suspected cases. Bauchi State reported 900 cases, Kano State reported 575 cases, Kaduna State reported 70 cases, Plateau reported 98 cases, while Zamfara reported 114 cases.

Ihekweazu said between [January 2021], and [27 Jun 2021], a total of 14 343 suspected cases of cholera were reported from 15 states and the FCT. This, he added, included 325 deaths. The affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross-River, Nasarawa, Niger and the FCT.

NCDC's Situation Report on cholera indicates that 27.6% of victims across the country are those in the 5 years to 14 years bracket. The report also indicated that 51% of the suspected cases were male, while 49% were female.

Ihekweazu also told journalists that a multi-sectoral national Emergency Operations Centre coordinates the national response activities. "The EOC is co-led by the Federal Ministry of Environment and that of Water Resources, given the link between cholera, water, sanitation and hygiene. The centre has been supporting states to ensure a coordinated, rapid and effective response to the current outbreak. This includes the deployment of National Rapid Response Teams to support the response at the state level, provision of medical and laboratory supplies, and scale-up of risk communications amongst other activities,'' he explained.

Ihekweazu said that the NCDC would continue to support states to intensify their cholera outbreak responses, noting that the risk of death from cholera was higher when treatment was delayed. He advised Nigerians to boil and store water in clean and safe containers before drinking. And to wash their hands frequently with soap under clean running water to prevent infectious diseases like cholera.

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J, eds. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp. 113-136:

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2- or 3-dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80% for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single-dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single-dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products, which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64)."
