The state health department said biologists on Prince of Wales Island last Sunday [13 Jul 2014] trapped several Keen's myotis bats, one of which was acting more aggressively and seemed possibly sick. It was euthanized and tested for rabies. The test came back positive on Thursday [17 Jul 2014].

The 2 prior cases of confirmed rabies in bats in Alaska were in 1993 and 2006, both in Southeast [region].

Louisa Castrodale, an epidemiologist with the state, says Alaska doesn't have a huge bat population. She says it is assumed there is bat rabies in south east Alaska but the extent is not known. She says the department wants to ensure anyone who may have been bitten by a bat doesn't discount their possible risk of exposure.

[Keen's myotis bats, _Myotis keenii_, has one of the most restricted ranges of any temperate vespertilionid bat, being found only in the coastal forests of the Pacific north west, extending as far north as south east Alaska, and reaching as far south as the state of Washington, with the bulk of its range contained in British Columbia. Keen's bats may make small scale movements to suitable hibernacula but do not migrate. For a picture go to http://www.mnh.si.edu/mna/images/images/TNc_815432211434038.jpg.

Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the estimated 41 bat species in the United States, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species.

Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.
