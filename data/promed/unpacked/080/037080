From: Blaine Hollinger <blaineh@melnick.mvir.bcm.tmc.edu>

In the Dallas outbreak in 1966, one of the largest epidemics studied, the
overall attack rate of SLE in the community was 15.2 per 100 000 with a
case fatality of 9.7%. The infection rate in the mosquito population prior
to aerial spraying (the first time that this had been mandated) was 1 in
every 167 tested. Significant rates of SLE antibody were found in all
major species of birds, especially sparrows. The spraying resulted in a
significant reduction in the resting site collections to near zero for
about a week. This was felt to temporarily reduce transmission to an
ineffectual level since SLE viremia usually occurs in birds within 18 to 48
hours after the mosquito bite and usually lasts no longer than 3 or 4 days.
Thus, it was felt that most birds would have time to lose their viremia
before another crop of mosquitoes emerged. After the spraying, only 2
isolations were made from over 57 000 mosquitoes collected, both isolations
being made about 3 weeks after the spraying. Thus, SLE activity was
drastically reduced, the epidemic may have been aborted, and large-scale
transmission was unlikely. Epidemics have occurred in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania in addition to Kentucky, Tennessee and west of the Mississippi.

[Thanks for reminding us of these data, Blaine (former EIS Officer at CDC).
I would also suggest two other references. The definitive book "St. Louis
encephalitis", edited by Tom Monath (American Public Health Association,
Washington, D.C.; 1980) and a paper, "Manhattan: a tropical isle?", by
Harry Most (Am J Trop Med Hyg, 17:333-354, 1968. The latter never mentions
SLE but it describes many of the odd infectious agents one can find in a
big city and is well worth reading for perspective. If people in New York
City believed they were safe from arboviruses, they now know they were
mistaken. Any place as good for watching birds as New York City is has a
potential mosquito problem. Does New York City have an arbovirus
surveillance system, other than being on the lookout for human cases? As
Ogden Nash said, "Progress might have been alright once, but it has gone on
too long." - Mod.CHC
