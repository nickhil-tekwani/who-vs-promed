In reference to a previous posting of rabies vaccine containing sheep
brains. By now, the whole world should know about human/animal TSE's
[Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies. So why would any country still
be using rabies vaccine, made from sheep brains on humans or animals? It's
time to do away with this vaccine altogether. It's nothing more than a time
bomb, waiting to go off 'AGAIN'.
I have posted a bit of information below, and a URL you can go to for more
information. Plus, let us not forget; Scrapie, the original disease in
sheep, has been easily transmitted by mouth to many experimental mammals
including primates. Humans are primates

A letter followed by 5 others on the same subject by H. Diringer, L.R.
Bridges, H. Fraser, J. Hardy and A. Goate, and S.C. Arya. The
correspondence by S.C. Arya suggests the cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) in India may have resulted from scrapie in rabies vaccine made from
sheep's brain.
Sheep-brain rabies vaccines
Arya, S. C.
Vaccine 1991 9 1 70 India
The author recommends a mandatory histological screen for scrapie in a
proportion of sheep (10-20%) in all flocks used to produce sheep-brain
rabies vaccine to prevent the spread of viruses which can cause spongiform
encephalopathies in India.
Acquisition of CJD in India through sheep-brain rabies vaccination.
Arya, S. C. [Correspondence. National Medical Journal of India 1991 4 6
311-312.
Because of the widespread use of Semple-type rabies vaccines produced from
sheep brains there is a possibility of the number of spongiform
encephalopathy cases in man increasing due to transmission of the scrapie
agent. The author suggests a number of measures that should be adopted to
monitor prevalence of CJD in those vaccinated with the Semple-type vaccine.

Sheep consumption: a possible source of spongiform encephalopathy in humans.
Davanipour Z, Alter M, Sobel E, Callahan M
A fatal spongiform encephalopathy of sheep and goats (scrapie) shares many
characteristics with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a similar dementing
illness of humans. To investigate the possibility of CJD being acquired by
ingestion of contaminated sheep products, we collected information on
production, slaughtering practices, and marketing of sheep in Pennsylvania.
The study revealed sheep were usually marketed before central nervous
system signs of scrapie are expected to appear; breeds known to be
susceptible to the disease were the most common breeds raised in the area;
sheep were imported from other states including those with a high frequency
of scrapie; use of veterinary services on the sheep farms investigated and,
hence, opportunities to detect the disease were limited; sheep producers in
the area knew little about scrapie despite the fact the disease has been
reported in the area, and animal organs including sheep organs were
sometimes included in processed food.
Therefore, it was concluded in Pennsylvania there are some 'weak links'
through which scrapie-infected animals could contaminate human food, and
consumption of these foods could perhaps account for spongiform
encephalopathy in humans. The weak links observed are probably not unique
to Pennsylvania. PMID: 3915057, UI: 86231250
