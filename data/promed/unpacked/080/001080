Brucellosis found in West too
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed that 4 farms in the West
have now tested positive for Brucellosis.

Initial tests showed the outbreak confined to Wainivesi and Waimaro in
Tailevu.

4000 cattle have been tested with 314 being culled -- but now a
brucellosis outbreak has been detected in the Western Division.

The farms that have recorded cases of the disease are from Nadi,
Sigatoka, and Tavua -- with test results for Rakiraki still pending.

Agriculture ministry official Josefa Uluilakeba says while the source
of the outbreak is still being investigated, it's possible that the
infection emanated out of Tailevu.

He says counter measures are now underway to ensure that this time the
bacterial infection is eradicated once and for all.

[Culturing of the pathogen and its phage typing are anticipated to
definitely confirm this unfolding, expanding event.

It seems to be high time for an official notification to the OIE on
the reoccurrence of brucellosis in Fiji, preferably with details of
the laboratory tests performed, confirmation of the pathogen involved,
and information on disease control activities, performed or in
planning, including vaccination. - Mod.AS]

[If the outbreak originated in Tailevu, how did it get there in the
1st place? - Mod.JW]
