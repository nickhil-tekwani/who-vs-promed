Agriculture Victoria veterinarians and animal health staff are responding to the detection of anthrax in a small number of sheep on a property near Swan Hill. Anthrax has been identified as the likely cause of death in 5 sheep to date on the property, which has been quarantined.

Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Graeme Cooke said thanks to the farmer's early reporting, the necessary steps to reduce the likelihood of the detection impacting more livestock had been put in place, and at-risk livestock were being vaccinated.

"Anthrax is caused by a naturally occurring bacteria, _Bacillus anthracis_, that is known to be present for long periods in the soil in parts of northern and North-West Victoria," he said. "It is not unusual for incidents of anthrax to be detected in cattle and sheep in the region during the warmer months when it is drier and cattle and sheep forage deeper into the soil when grazing. Quarantine controls that were put in place will not affect the movement of any local people or vehicles."

Anthrax is not a concern for the general public because anthrax does not spread rapidly and is not very contagious. There is little general public-health risk associated with anthrax. Any risk is confined to people who handle dead livestock such as farmers, veterinarians, and knackery workers. There is no impact on local produce or food safety.

Dr Cooke said while incidents commonly occur during the warmer months when it's drier, cases of anthrax have occurred, and may occur, at any time of year, so continued vigilance is required. Local farmers, veterinarians and Agriculture Victoria are well prepared to handle these incidents that occur from time to time, he said.

"This includes pre-emptively vaccinating stock each year and, if there is a detection, the implementation of strict quarantine and biosecurity arrangements, the vaccination of potentially exposed stock, and the destruction of the carcasses of affected animals."

Agriculture Victoria veterinarians and animal health officers are currently working closely with livestock owners and veterinarians in the region to ensure they are aware of the signs of disease and appropriate actions to take if they are concerned. Farmers are urged to report any cases of unexplained deaths to the 24-hour Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.

The previous outbreak in Victoria was also in the Swan Hill region and occurred almost 3 years ago, to the day; see ProMED post 20190306.6352544.

There has been a series of sheep anthrax outbreaks in Swan Hill, Victoria, that started in March 2017; see ProMED post 20170306.4882640 and further links below. Extensive livestock vaccination has been done in 2017, 2018, and 2019. While Sterne vaccination should provide adequate protection, it is only temporary and wears off after 6-9 months. Plus animals get missed, and newly purchased stock may not be vaccinated on entry as promptly as they ought. It can get frustrating, but eventually cases cease to occur. One just has to remember to keep vaccinating regularly until it is clear that some 6-8 years have passed without any new cases. I think we will find that this 2022 flock was not vaccinated in the spring. Annual flock vaccination can be an exhausting process, but eventually it pays off.

At all times, keep one eye open for any unexpected deaths, and promptly check them if and when they occur.
