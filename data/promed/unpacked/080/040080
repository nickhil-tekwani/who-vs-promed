One horse quarantined and another put down in Queensland/New South
Wales (NSW) outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hendra virus was declared endemic in 2 states yesterday [11 Oct
2011] as it was confirmed that another outbreak had left at least one
horse dead.

In the 18th case across Queensland and NSW this year [2011], a
property in Caboolture, 54 km [33.5 mi] north of Brisbane, was
quarantined yesterday [11 Oct 2011] following confirmation a horse had
the deadly flying fox-borne disease.

The horse was put down yesterday after becoming unsteady and having
difficulty eating over the weekend [8-9 Oct 2011]. Another horse at
the Beachmere property collapsed and died last week with Hendra-type
symptoms and test results are expected today.

Queensland chief veterinary officer Rick Symons said the virus was
already considered endemic in Queensland but this year reported cases
had spread south across the border.

"It is endemic in NSW," he said. "In the past up to this year [2011],
there has only been 1 case in NSW; this year we've seen 8 cases. It
has certainly been a changing picture for NSW."

Dr Symons said 2011 was undoubtedly the more severe year, though the
cause remained undetermined. "This year has been the worst year for
Hendra virus cases," he said. "There is no doubt that 2011 has been a
difficult year for this virus."

Before this year's extraordinary cluster, 14 horses had died since
1994. This year, 22 horses have died in 10 outbreaks in Queensland and
8 in NSW.

Dr Symons warned horse owners and vets to be aware that horses could
contract Hendra at any time throughout the year. The virus is spread
between flying foxes but it is fatal to horses.

Of the 7 people who contracted Hendra virus 4 have died [in years
previous.]

Hendra is more virulent this year. Dr Symons said baseline Hendra
levels were 8-10 per cent in colonies, but this year up to 60 per cent
of flying foxes were excreting Hendra, perhaps because of additional
stresses from the summer flooding.

Queensland's chief health officer, Jeannette Young, said all 66 people
monitored for Hendra this year [2011] had been cleared. 8 people at
the Beachmere property who had "low to negligible" contact declined
testing, a Queensland Health spokeswoman said.

Queensland Horse Council president Debbie Dekker said unusual signs
shown by the horses were a warning for owners to remain vigilant.

"There are instances of Hendra at the moment but there are cases that
have come through that nobody would have ever called a vet before,"
she said.

"We're picking up cases that we never would have before. It's here, it
has always been here. Now that we know about it, we have to start
taking precautions."

30 dogs have also been tested this year; 1 had contracted the virus
and was euthanised. 19 properties were quarantined across Queensland
and 118 horses have been tested.

Yesterday [11 Oct 2011], Queensland Premier Anna Bligh announced AUD 7
million [USD 7.14 million] for research including Hendra virus
transmission, flying fox dispersal, and the effectiveness of a
proposed horse vaccine.

[2] Hendra research projects

Hendra research projects announced
----------------------------------
Scientists are hoping to unlock the mysteries of the deadly Hendra
virus, with 5 new research projects announced today [12 Oct 2011].

More than 20 horses have died after catching the disease in Queensland
and New South Wales so far this year [2011].

It is hoped researchers will be able to discover how the virus is
transmitted and how to stop it spreading to horses and, more
importantly, humans.

Work is also continuing on a Hendra vaccine.

The projects are being coordinated through the cross-border Hendra
taskforce, which includes vets, health officers, and scientists.

NSW Department of Primary Industries chief vet Ian Roth says the
future of the virus is a mystery. "We have to work out how it's
transmitted along with looking at other risks, and that will certainly
put us in a better situation into the future," Mr Roth said.

NSW Primary Industries Minister Katrina Hodgkinson says 2011 has been
the most fatal year for the disease the 2 states have seen. "In NSW
the virus claimed 10 horse deaths at 8 properties, all on the NSW
north coast," Ms Hodgkinson said.

"These critical new research projects aim to get to the bottom of this
year's spike and look at new ways to reduce further cases in the
future and ultimately minimise the risk of human infection."

There have also been 12 cases in Queensland, with a horse put down
yesterday [11 Oct 2011] in the latest case on a property at Beachmere,
north of Brisbane.

Among the new research projects announced, the world-renowned
Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute will lead an AUD 900 000
[USD 917 000] study looking at virology issues, including new
state-of-the-art testing techniques.

An epidemiologist from the Wollongbar Primary Industries Institute is
also undertaking one of the research projects, examining the
transmission of the virus from flying foxes to horses and the impact
flying fox dispersal has on virus infection levels.

The New South Wales and Queensland Governments have committed a total
of AUD 6 million [USD 6.11 million] to the projects, and the Federal
Government has matched their commitment.

Submissions are now being sought for the remaining funds

[This has been a very bad year with regard to the virulence of the
Hendra virus. It would seem that declaring the virus endemic in 2
states would be a way of putting people on permanent alert. In other
words, they should always have that disease as one of the
differentials regarding horse illnesses.

Hopefully the vaccine will be available soon. Also hopefully some of
these projects will pay dividends and provide answers to the many
questions about Hendra virus. - Mod.TG]
