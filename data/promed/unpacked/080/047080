VOICED AT:
INTRO: THE UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AGENCY HAS PLAYED DOWN
RECENT REPORTS OF A CHOLERA EPIDEMIC AMONG REFUGEES IN
EASTERN ZAIRE. THE U-N-H-C-R SAYS THE DISEASE OUTBREAK
SHOULD NOT HINDER A MASSIVE REPATRIATION EFFORT TO GET
REFUGEES BACK HOME TO RWANDA -- AN OPERATION WHICH IS
SCHEDULED TO BEGIN SOON. SONYA LAURENCE GREEN REPORTS.
TEXT: THE U-N HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES -- THE
U-N-H-C-R -- SAYS RECENT REPORTS OF A CHOLERA EPIDEMIC
AMONG REFUGEES IN EASTERN ZAIRE SOUNDS MORE ALARMING
THAN IT ACTUALLY IS. SPOKESMAN PETER KESSLER SAID CHOLERA
HAS ONLY AFFECTED A SMALL FRACTION OF THE 100-THOUSAND
REFUGEES SOUTH OF KISANGANI.
" CHOLERA IS ENDEMIC IN THIS REGION OF ZAIRE, AS IT'S ENDEMIC,
OF COURSE, ACROSS GREAT SWATHES OF AFRICA. WE'RE WATCHING
THIS OUTBREAK VERY CLOSELY. HOWEVER, THE STRAIN OF
CHOLERA IS PROVING ITSELF VERY, VERY TREATABLE, THE
PATIENTS ARE RESPONDING WELL TO MEDICATION, SOME 150
PEOPLE HAVE COME DOWN WITH SYMPTOMS OF WHICH NINE,
UNFORTUNATELY, HAVE DIED. //OPT// BUT THE "MEDICINES SANS
FRONTIERES" ("DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS") STAFF ARE DOING A
GREAT JOB. THEY'VE GOT 25 EXPATRIATES AND SCORES OF LOCAL
HEALTH WORKERS. THEY'VE SET UP TWO ISOLATION CENTERS AT
THE CAMPS, AND WE DON'T SEE THIS AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE
REPATRIATION. "
MR. KESSLER SAID CHOLERA IS A COMPARATIVELY SMALL THREAT
IN THE CAMPS, WHERE REFUGEES ARE DYING IN LARGE NUMBERS
FROM OTHER CAUSES.
" YES, CHOLERA IS A PROBLEM AND WE'RE CONCERNED, BUT IN THE
PAST WEEKS WE'VE ONLY HAD NINE PEOPLE DIE OF THE DISEASE,
AND IT'S PROVING VERY TREATABLE. ON THE OTHER HAND, //END
OPT// FOR INSTANCE A FEW DAYS AGO WE HAD 93 PEOPLE DIE IN
ONE DAY -- 93 PEOPLE DIE OF MALNUTRITION AND THE EFFECTS OF
WOUNDS AND UNTREATED SORES THAT HAVE JUST BEEN GOING ON
FOR MONTHS SINCE THEY FLED KIVU. SO CHOLERA IS NOT THE BIG
KILLER, HUNGER IS THE BIG KILLER."
THERE HAD BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT A CHOLERA OUTBREAK
COULD DELAY THE U-N-H-C-R'S PLANNED AIRLIFT OF REFUGEES
BACK HOME TO RWANDA. BUT MR. KESSLER SAID THE U-N-H-C-R
HAD BEEN WATCHING THE CHOLERA OUTBREAK, AND SAID IT WAS
NOT GOING TO DELAY THE MASSIVE REPATRIATION EXERCISE.
"YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS FOR ABOUT 10 DAYS, IT
JUST BECAME PUBLIC LAST WEEK, WE DON'T SEE IT AS A
ROADBLOCK TO THE REPATRIATION. THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS,
LIKE GETTING PEOPLE ACROSS THE RIVER, USING THE
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, GETTING JET FUEL IN GOMA THAT
PRESENT MUCH BIGGER HURDLES TO THE REPATRIATION THAN
THIS."
MR. KESSLER SAID THE U-N-H-C-R NEEDED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
FROM DONORS AND BETTER ACCESS IN REBEL-HELD TERRITORY TO
MAKE THE REFUGEE AIRLIFT A REALITY. HE SAID ONLY ABOUT
THREE-THOUSAND REFUGEES HAVE BEEN FLOWN OUT IN SMALL
GROUPS SO FAR, BUT HE SAID THE U-N-H-C-R HOPES TO STEP-UP
THE FLIGHTS LATER THIS WEEK. (SIGNED)
