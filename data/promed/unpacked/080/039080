Adding to the cases of Legionnaires' disease, 2 new cases have been
identified as being part of an outbreak in South Wales. These new
cases have brought the number of cases to 19 in total, all of which
have needed hospital treatment. All these 19 cases remain seriously
ill and hospitalized.

Huge efforts are continuing to find and eradicate the source of the
outbreak clustered around the Heads of the Valleys corridor. Public
Health Wales (PHW) is working closely with the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) and Environmental Health Officers from 8 South Wales
local authorities.

The increase in the number of cases related to the present outbreak
follows the confirmation of 3 extra cases on Friday [10 Sep 2010].
There are another 4 cases of this disease that are related to the
outbreak. All are being investigated.

Out of the 4 cases 2 are pensioners who passed away within the last
week. One of them was a 64-year old woman who died in the hospital
and the 2nd was a 74-year old man who also passed away in the
hospital.

It was announced today [11 Sep 2010] that 2 new cases of
Legionnaires' disease have been identified as being part of an
outbreak in South Wales. The rise brings the number of cases to 19 in
total, all of which have required hospital treatment.

Major efforts to find and eradicate the source of the outbreak,
clustered around the Heads of the Valleys corridor, are continuing.
Public Health Wales (PHW) is working closely with the Health and
Safety Executive (HSE) and Environmental Health Officers from 8 South
Wales local authorities.

The rise in the number of cases linked to the current outbreak
follows the confirmation of 3 extra cases yesterday [10 Sep 2010].
There are also 4 cases of Legionnaires' disease that are possibly
linked to the outbreak. All remain under investigation. Among those 4
cases are 2 pensioners who have died within the last week. One was a
64-year-old woman who died in hospital on Monday [6 Sep 2010]. The
2nd was a man, 74, who also died in hospital, on Wednesday [8 Sep
2010].

Efforts to trace the source of the outbreak have been focusing on the
Merthyr Tydfil, Rhymney, and Blaenau Gwent areas. Yesterday [10 Sep
2010], HSE officials shut down a company's water cooling tower at a
site in Dowlais, Merthyr Tydfil. The firm immediately cleaned and
disinfected the tower and was quickly given the green light to
restart work. PHW officials have stressed that the site of the
un-named firm has not been confirmed as being the source of the
outbreak. More than 100 separate workplaces have so far been visited
by officials trying to locate the source.

Dr Gwen Lowe, chair of the Outbreak Control Team, said:
"Legionnaires' disease cannot be passed from person to person. We
therefore investigate places people have been to, where they may have
come into contact with a source of infection. Our investigations show
that there is no single building visited by all the people linked to
the outbreak. The sources, or source, are therefore likely to be
industrial processes such as cooling towers. Environmental health
officers and Health and Safety Executive officials have visited and
checked all the registered cooling towers in the area under
investigation. They have also visited unregistered cooling towers.
These investigations continue."

She added: "A team of more than 100 staff from 10 agencies have been
working to find the source of the outbreak. We will continue to do so
until we are confident that we have found the source and removed it.
Legionnaires' disease is a rare but potentially life threatening
illness. It has an incubation period of up to 3 weeks so we are
likely to see further cases of illness even after the source is
removed."

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of
the disease; more than 70 percent of cases are due to _L.
pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand. For
Australia and New Zealand, _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted
for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis,
and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases
(Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups
isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired
legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis.
2002; 186(1):127-8).

Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis that is less
severe than Legionnaires' disease. Pontiac fever takes its name from
an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA. Risk factors for
Legionnaires' disease include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and immunosuppression.

Legionnaires' disease, and presumably Pontiac fever, is acquired by
inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Usually
a building's contaminated water system is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing
systems and in cooling towers. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
water storage tanks of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the
contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in
groceries, fountains, and cooling towers.

In contrast, in Australia and New Zealand, Legionnaires' disease as
been associated with gardening and exposure to potting mix, compost,
and soil; in these countries _L. longbeachae_ has been commonly found
in potting mix, compost, and soil and cultured from the respiratory
specimens of patients with sporadic community-acquired pneumonia.
Cases of community-acquired pneumonia due to _L. longbeachae_ also
have been reported sporadically in Europe
(<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19497>).
Indeed, Legionnaires' disease in a gardener due to _L. longbeachae_
was reported recently in Scotland
(<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11167176>). However, legionella
urinary antigen test, which is commonly used to diagnose
Legionnaires' disease, is only valid for detection of _L.
pneumophila_ serogroup 1 and therefore other samples must be
collected from a patient suspected to be infected with _Legionella_
other than _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 (such as, sputum or
bronchoalveolar wash obtained during bronchoscopy) for detection of
_Legionella_ by culture using special media.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful
tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one
genotype in patient specimens suggests transmission from a common
source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples
without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative
infectious reservoir should be demonstrated by means of genotyping
methods (see <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/> and
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>).

The Heads of the Valleys Road (the A465) is a major road in South
Wales; it runs along the southern border of the Brecon Beacons
National Park and joins together the north ends (or 'heads') of the
South Wales Valleys from Ebbw Vale, Tredegar, Rhymney, and Merthyr
Tydfil (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A465_road>), the region
currently suspected of being involved in the South Wales valleys
Legionnaires' disease outbreak. A map of this area is available at
<http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2010/09/11/new-cases-of-legionnaires-disease-hit-wales-91466-27248515/>.
Merthyr Tydfil is a town with a population of about 30 000 that
relies on a combination of public sector and manufacturing and
service sector companies to provide employment
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merthyr_Tydfil#Employment>).
