The DSP prevention services indicated that during the 8 months of the current year [2022], 192 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis were recorded in the wilaya of Naâma, a sharp decline compared to previous years.

The largest number was recorded in Aïn-Sefra with 44 cases, followed by Mécheria with 25 cases, while in some municipalities, the number of people affected varies between 5 to 8 cases, if not negligible for other municipalities.

This decline reflects the efforts and campaigns carried out on the ground, following the instructions of the public authorities concerned about the very high number of cases in the wilaya. An improvement therefore in the situation compared to the period from 2009 to 2015, when the number fluctuated between 600 and more than 700 cases per year.

[Algeria has more cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) than any other country in the world except for Afghanistan. In this vast country, Africa's largest, 3 different species of _Leishmania_ cause CL: _L. major_, accounting for >90% of cases, historically concentrated in arid and semi-arid rural areas; _L. infantum_, which is confined to lowland coastal regions, and; _L. tropica_, which occurs sporadically in geographically disparate districts. Recent decades have seen a rising incidence and large outbreaks of zoonotic CL caused by _L. major_, progressing from the Sahara northwards into steppe and highland regions of Algeria [Ref. 1]. The spread of _L. major_ in Algeria and other North African countries (except Egypt) has been attributed to climate change and increased human settlement contact with the rodent reservoirs (sand-rats and gerbils) and the sand fly vector (_Phlebotomus papatasi_) of _L. major_ [Refs. 2 and 3].

The brief report above concerns the northwestern Algerian province of Naâma, bordering Morocco. The causative Leishmania species is not indicated, but it is very likely to be _L. major_, which is the dominant cause of CL in the adjoining provinces of Béchar, El Baydh, and Sidi Bel Abbès [Ref. 1]. The drop in CL cases in Naâma province is commendable in the face of the aforementioned general increase in CL cases in Algeria and North Africa. Although the report does not spell out what control measures have been implemented by public health authorities, such measures are likely to include rodent control, insecticide spraying, and/or diligent human case detection and treatment with meglumine antimoniate.
