OIE RISK ASSESMENT PUBLICATION
===============================
Office International des Epizooties
New release
Scientific and Technical Review, Vol. 14 (4), December 1995
Risk assessment for veterinary biologicals
Risk assessment has proved to be a valuable tool in many fields: it
may help to clarify perceptions of risk, simplify communication with
regard to risk (by providing various degrees of quantitative and
qualitative data), and thus reinforce the process of risk management.
Great potential exists for risk assessment to improve regulatory
processes governing the manufacture, transport and use of veterinary
biologicals.
Different countries and regions need to harmonise the means of using
risk assessment to simplify and strengthen these regulatory procedures,
and it was in this context that the First International Symposium on
Risk Assessment for Veterinary Biologicals -- organised by the Office
International des Epizooties (OIE) -- was held in Arlington, Virginia
(United States of America) from 5 to 7 December 1994. The Symposium was
attended by 128 participants from twenty-seven countries, most of whom
were representatives of regulatory agencies or major vaccine producers.
This issue of the OIE Scientific and Technical Review contains the
Proceedings of the Arlington Symposium (some contributions have been
specially revised and updated for this publication). Summaries of the
communications, together with the conclusions and recommendations of the
participants, were published by the OIE in June 1995 in a booklet
entitled Risk assessment for veterinary biologicals: Summaries and
Conclusions.
The papers presented in this issue of the Review focus on realistic
approaches to the development and evaluation of specific risk
assessments for veterinary biologicals, identifying data requirements,
exposing gaps in current knowledge, and examining the analytical
techniques necessary to make objective assessments of risk for
biologicals.
This publication of the Proceedings of the Arlington Symposium,
together with the booklet of Summaries and Conclusions, will be of value
in furthering the international harmonisation of risk analysis in the
field of veterinary biologicals.
