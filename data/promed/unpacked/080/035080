The black flies that transmit river blindness have reemerged in parts
of Ivory Coast, sparking a fresh campaign to ensure villagers can
work their fields without fear.

Health workers are handing out a drug -- whose distribution was
stopped 3 years ago -- that prevents the worst effects of the
disease, irreversible loss of vision.

"These tablets stop you from going blind," said local nurse Mamadou
Kone. But some local people who recall the past are pushing for more
radical measures.

"The situation before was dramatic," recalled Konan Kouadio, a
villager in his 70s wearing large, tinted spectacles to conceal his
own sightless eyes. "We had many blind people in the heart of the community."

For villages like his Kouadioa-Allaikro, in the centre of this West
African country, black flies are not only a debilitating health
scourge but a financial drain as well.

Agriculture is one of Ivory Coast's main sources of wealth, and the
people in this region produce food crops and cocoa that are vital not
only to their own livelihoods but to the country's economy as well.

The disease was curtailed in the past by dousing insecticide along
the local river, but such measures were stopped in 1992 due to lack
of funds, according to Ivorian authorities.

In March 2008, the country's National Programme Against Blindness
(PLNCE) conducted an epidemiological study in 15 villages and
confirmed that the black flies were back in force.

"The flies have multiplied," said nurse Kone. "The villagers can't
get to their plantations from February to May."

Although the bolder residents still venture out, they risk being
bitten. But as community health worker Raphael Konan Kouadio pointed
out their dilemma: "You can't abandon your crops or you are going to
die of hunger."

An estimated 500 000 people are at risk with the resurgence of the
flies, which now haunt a zone that extends 15 km (nearly 10 miles)
around the river.

The disease, transmitted by black flies of _Simulium_ species whose
bite can be extremely unpleasant, has in the past devastated local communities.

In the 1970s and '80s, villagers bitten by the insects as they worked
in fields near the rivers gradually lost sight, as the worm larvae
transmitted by the bite hatched and grew.

Though the disease is endemic in central and west Africa, fertile
river areas are the most dangerous, because they are the insects'
natural habitat; they lay their eggs in fast-flowing waters. Hence,
the popular name for the disease that is more correctly called
onchocerciasis, which can also produce a disfiguring skin
inflammation and intense itching.

But Kouadio-Allaikro is only one of many villages in this district,
at the mouth of the Kossou hydroelectric dam in the Yamoussoukro
region, where the flies have returned.

"The onchocerciasis situation is more and more worrying in the zones
extending south of the forest, where 15 percent (of the population)
has been affected," said Souleymane Yeo, who heads up the PLNCE programme.

For him, the distribution of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectine,
which started in September 2008, came not a moment too soon. Local
villagers knew it would allow them to get back to working the fields
and fishing the rivers. "Onchocerciasis no longer turns people blind
thanks to the distribution of these medicines," said Emery Patrice
Bosso, of Helen Keller International, which finances programmes
against the disease.

But there remain practical problems on the ground, for as good as the
treatment may be, getting the medicines out to the villages is no easy task.

"The work of volunteers is no longer guaranteed," said Kouadio,
himself a volunteer. The main problem is the lack of transport to get
to the most far-flung villages. "I cover 10 villages without even a
motorbike," he said. And as much as he wants to do the work, he said
he could not carry on under current conditions.

Though thankful for the drugs, some local people would like to see
the return of the weapon the government used to fight the disease
effectively in the past. They want the length of the river again to
be dosed with insecticide.

[Onchocerciasis, African river blindness, is caused by a nematode,
_Onchocerca volvulus_, transmitted to humans by blackflies. The adult
worms are found in subcutaneous nodules where they produce
microfilariae, which migrate in tissues, especially the skin and eye.
Inflammation in the eye results in blindness or reduced eyesight.

The Onchocerciasis Control Program in West Africa (OCP) was launched
in 1974 and covered 30 million people in 11 countries at its peak
<http://www.who.int/apoc/onchocerciasis/ocp/en/index.html>.
The OCP was closed in 2002, when most countries within the program
area had a prevalence of onchocerciasis of less than 5 percent,
including the Ivory Coast (see maps at the WHO URL shown above).
Ivory Coast has been through a civil war over the past years, which
probably has affected the national control program, and it is likely
that this and the closure of the OCP contribute to the emergence of
onchocerciasis in Ivory Coast.
