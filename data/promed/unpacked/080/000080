[Northern Nigeria lies within the African meningitis belt, the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A had been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt beginning in 2010, WHO has noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the prior 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, having been replaced by other serogroups, notably serogroup C. - Mod.ML
