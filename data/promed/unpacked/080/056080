[Anthrax is infrequent to the point of absent in Sardinia: my only record is for 1997, a single outbreak in cattle. The Italian statistics for 2014 have yet to be available on the OIE site.

As goats are browsers and not major grazers, one is tempted to think that the primary outbreak/case was missed, and it was the blowflies feeding on this carcass that contaminated the browse these goats were feeding on. But as blowflies are not distant fliers -- the browse contaminated with fly vomit is usually within 10-15 metres of the contaminated carcass -- that primary case is thereabouts. As the sample was sent to Foggia for confirmation we can expect its director to have already initiated its genotyping. We can confidently expect more information on this singular outbreak. In the meanwhile, because of the problems of BSE/Mad-Cow disease, bone meal is not commonly available as a livestock feed in Italy. - Mod.MHJ
