Indonesia investigating suspicious bird flu cases
------------------------------------------------------------
Indonesian bird flu officials said Tuesday [18 Dec 2007] they were
investigating several recent avian influenza deaths where the victims
were believed not to have come into contact with infected poultry.

"In the last 3 to 4 months, we have had 4 cases where the poultry in
the victim's neighbourhoods (tested) negative for the virus," said
Bayu Krisnamurthi, head of Indonesia's National Avian Influenza
Committee. "The number is significant enough for us to intensify our
investigations so that we could have a more accurate explanation," he
told a press briefing giving an overview of what has happened in
Indonesia this year with bird flu. "Some 20 percent of confirmed
cases in 2006 were inconclusive, meaning there was no direct contact
with poultry. This year (2007) the figure has been raised to 30
percent," he added. The bird flu virus is usually transmitted to
humans from infected birds, but scientists fear it could mutate into
a form easily transmissible between humans, sparking a global
pandemic that could kill millions.

Krisnamurthi nevertheless insisted that Indonesia had made progress
in tackling bird flu, with the number of reported cases decreasing
this year. In 2007, 40 cases were confirmed with 35 fatalities,
compared to figures of 55 and 45, respectively, in 2006. But he also
conceded that Indonesia needed more effective measures, particularly
to combat bird flu in poultry. According to Krisnamurthi, even though
the agriculture ministry vaccinated 70 percent of the country's
farmed poultry in 2007, "the quality of the vaccine must be
improved," he said.

Indonesia has recorded a total of 115 confirmed bird flu cases, 93 of
which resulted in death [see part [2], below].

Some speculation of the possible sources of the infection in these
cases would have been useful. - Mod.CP]
