[Foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks have been widely reported in
southern Africa this year (2011) causing high economic losses
(http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=80039&no_cache=1).
This is the 3rd outbreak in Namibia this year but it is confined to a
particular area of the country. The region of Caprivi in the north
east corner of Namibia can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1vE* and the location of
the outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the
source URL above.

Foot and mouth disease is an infectious viral disease that affects
both domestic and wild, hoofed animals. The virus causes high fever
for about 2-3 days, followed by blisters in the mouth and on the feet
that may rupture causing the animal to limp. It is spread through
aerosols, fomites, domestic and wild animals. Foot and mouth disease
is a transmissible animal disease of great socioeconomic cost to
nations, and financial costs to individual dairy cattle producers.
While the disease is severe and contagious and affects livestock with
economic impact on farmer's earnings, it holds no danger for humans. -
Mod.OOB

Outbreaks in communally owned cattle are of concern here because
spread can affect large numbers of cattle residing in concentrated
feedlot based operations. Furthermore, the news source Mod.OOB refers
to in his comments indicates that Namibia may be lacking the
veterinary infrastructure to effectively combat the disease. Control
of FMD requires significant personnel outlays and those people must be
out in the field to ensure effective control. - Mod.PC]
