[1] Variant B.1.1.529
[A] Africa travel ban
Date: Fri 26 Nov 2021

Travellers arriving in England from several southern African countries will have to quarantine amid warnings over a new coronavirus variant. UK health secretary Sajid Javid said from 12:00 GMT on Friday [26 Nov 2021] 6 countries would be added to the red list, with flights being temporarily banned.

One expert described the variant, known as B.1.1.529, as "the worst one we've seen so far," and there is concern it has the potential to evade immunity. No cases have been confirmed in the UK. Only 59 confirmed cases have been identified in South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana so far.

All flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini are being suspended.

Mr Javid said that scientists were "deeply concerned" about the new variant but more needed to be learned about it. But he said the variant has a significant number of mutations, "perhaps double the number of mutations that we have seen in the delta variant." He added: "And that would suggest that it may well be more transmissible and the current vaccines that we have may well be less effective." He said adding the 6 countries to the red list was about "being cautious and taking action and trying to protect, as best we can, our borders".

From noon on Friday [26 Nov 2021], non-UK and Irish residents will be banned from entering England if they have been in the 6 countries in the past 10 days. Any British or Irish resident arriving from the countries after 04:00 on Sunday [28 Nov 2021] will have to quarantine in a hotel, with those returning before that being asked to isolate at home. Those who have returned in the last 10 days are being asked to take a PCR test by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The flight ban will remain in place until the hotel quarantine system is up and running.

BBC Africa correspondent Andrew Harding said scientists in South Africa were trying to understand the mutations of the new variant, but the one thing they did know was that it was far more transmissible. He said there was unhappiness at the new red listing by other countries, with scientists saying the country needed more support and more reward for spotting the new variant. Experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) are meeting South African officials on Friday [26 Nov 2021] to assess the evolving situation in the country.

The new variant, which has been designated a new variant under investigation by the UKHSA, is heavily mutated, and the confirmed cases are mostly concentrated in one province in South Africa. Scientists say the variant has 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of most vaccines and the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. Experts in South Africa have said the variant is "very different" to others that have circulated, with concerns that it could be more transmissible but also able to get around parts of the immune system.

Professor Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, said the new variant had the potential to escape immunity and have increased infectivity. Imperial College London's Professor Neil Ferguson said it was concerning the new variant appeared to be "driving a rapid increase in case numbers in South Africa" and said the move to restrict travel was "prudent". But he said it was not clear if the variant was more transmissible or resistant to vaccines and therefore it was too early to judge the risk it poses.

At the moment, around 500 and 700 people are travelling to the UK from South Africa each day, but this figure was likely to have increased as the festive period began. British Airways said it was contacting affected customers, and Virgin Atlantic said it would be reviewing its schedule for South Africa for the coming week, with flights from Johannesburg to Heathrow cancelled between 12:00 on Friday and 04:00 on Sunday.

All the countries that remained on the UK's red travel list were removed in October [2021]. Each UK nation sets its own policy, but they have generally followed the same rules for past announcements. Scotland is following the UK government's decision, with anyone arriving from the 6 countries having to self-isolate and take 2 PCR tests, while hotel quarantine will be in place from 04:00 GMT on Saturday [27 Nov 2021].

Currently people travelling to the UK who are fully vaccinated do not need to take a COVID test before setting off but do need to take a lateral flow test 2 days after arrival and fill out a passenger locator form. Those who are not fully vaccinated and are over 18 must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take a COVID test in the 3 days before travelling as well as on day 2 and day 8 of their return.

[B] What is known
Date: Fri 26 Nov 2021 15:38 IST

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/covid-19-b-1-1-529-5-things-to-know-about-new-coronavirus-variant-b-1-529-2625381


Here are 10 things to know about the new COVID-19 variant
---------------------------------------------------------
1. The B.1.1.529 variant has 50 mutations overall, including more than 30 on the spike protein alone. The spike protein is the target of most current COVID-19 vaccines and is what the virus uses to access our body's cells.
2. There are also 10 mutations on the receptor binding domain part of the variant, compared with 2 for the delta variant. The delta plus variant that mutated from the latter was characterised by the K417N mutation on the spike protein; this mutation has been linked to immune escape, but it is unclear if this is among the mutations in B.1.1.529.
3. This new variant may have evolved from a single patient -- possibly during a chronic infection of an immunocompromised person (possibly in an untreated HIV/AIDS patient), Francois Balloux, the director of the UCL Genetics Institute, said.
4. First identified in South Africa this week, the strain has spread to nearby countries, including Botswana, where fully vaccinated people have been infected. In South Africa, over 100 cases have been linked to this variant, with several more in Botswana.
5. Two cases have also been detected in Hong Kong -- where 2 travellers arriving from parts of southern Africa had been quarantined, in line with local laws, in separate rooms.
6. Samples from the 2 infected people in Hong Kong returned "very high" viral loads, epidemiologist Dr Eric Feigl-Ding tweeted this morning. "PCR Ct values of 18 and 19...insanely high considering they were negative on recent PCR tests," he said.
7. What is more worrying is the patients were in separate rooms, suggesting the variant is airborne. "...looks like vaccine evasion could be real with this variant...and yes, it is very airborne. Hotel guests were in different room across the hallway. Environmental samples found the virus in 25 of 87 swab across both rooms," Dr Feigl-Ding tweeted.
8. On Thursday [25 Nov 2021], India called for rigorous screening of passengers from these countries. "This variant is reported to have a significantly high number of mutations, and thus, has serious public health implications for the country, in view of recently relaxed visa restrictions and opening up of international travel," the ministry said.
9. The United Kingdom has moved quickly to suspend flights from 6 African countries, including South Africa and Botswana.
10. The World Health Organization has called for caution in the initial stages of dealing with this variant; more research needs to be conducted to understand how B.1.1.529 behaves, the global health body said. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's COVID-19 technical lead, underlined the importance of ensuring complete vaccination.

The new variant was identified after a surge of cases in Gauteng, an urban area containing Pretoria and Johannesburg. Initially the cluster of cases, centered on a university, was assumed to be because of an increase in socialising.

However, this week the variant was identified as a potential cause of the increase. The 1st detected cases of the variant were collected in Botswana on 11 Nov 2021 and a case has also been found in Hong Kong -- a 36 year old man who tested positive while in quarantine after a trip to South Africa.

In the past 48 hours, South African scientists reviewed PCR test data from the Gauteng region and discovered the variant appeared to be behind the increase in cases, having risen to account for about 90% of cases in a matter of weeks. At a national level, South Africa's daily number of infections hit 1200 on Wednesday [24 Nov 2021], up from 106 earlier in the month.

Professor Anne von Gottberg, a clinical microbiologist and head of respiratory diseases at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa, said there were now about 100 cases confirmed through full sequencing of samples, up from just 10 reported on Wednesday, and signs of community transmission.
