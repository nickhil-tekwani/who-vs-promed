Epidemic of psittacosis in Severomorsk
----------------------------------------------------
On 20 May 2015 an epizootic of psittacosis in pigeons was recorded. This case was detected near the garages in the city [Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast]. Specific tests were taken from the birds, which showed the presence of psittacosis. The disease can also affect humans, causing pneumonia, or other pulmonary diseases. The symptoms for which people might suspect this infection are high fever, pain in the head, poor sleep, pain in the lower back and legs.

[Psittacosis is a zoonotic disease of birds caused by the intracellular bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Infections are especially frequent in Psittaciformes (parrots, parakeets, etc.) and Columbiformes (pigeons and doves), but most bird species are susceptible of infection. Infected birds shed the pathogen into the environment in their droppings.
