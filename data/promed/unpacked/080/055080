The sudden attack of virus on watermelons has come as a rude shock for farmers in Sirkali [or Sirkazhi, in Nagapattinam district, Tamil Nadu], where the crop has been raised on about 100 acres [40.5 ha].

One of the farmers, regarding cultivation of the crop for the past 8 years, said he had never witnessed such a serious crisis. Against his anticipated yield of 15 tonnes an acre, he could hardly get one tonne. "The growth of fruits has come to a close after the first yield as the virus has affected the crop," he said.

Farmers want some compensation by the State government towards the loss.

[More than 15 viruses are known to infect cucurbits which include crops such as different kinds of melons, cucumber, squash, gourds, and pumpkin. Losses occur through reduction in growth and yield, but may also be due to distortion and mottling of fruit which make the produce unmarketable. Molecular methods are needed for virus diagnosis, symptoms are not sufficiently reliable.

Many of the major cucurbit viruses are transmitted by aphid species or by other sap-sucking insects. Several of them are also seed transmitted. Disease management of aphid transmitted viruses is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of virus and vector reservoir hosts, phytosanitation to reduce inoculum (such as crop debris), use of clean planting material and resistant crop cultivars, if available. Use of certified clean seed is mandatory for seed transmitted viruses.

Examples of viruses known to occur on cucurbits in India and the region include _Cucumber mosaic virus_, _Zucchini yellow mosaic virus_, and _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
