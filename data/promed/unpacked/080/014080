Subject: Rift Valley Fever (RVF) situation in Mayotte, a French department in the Indian Ocean.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis affecting ruminants and humans.
1. Modes of transmission:
- vectors (many species of mosquitoes), mainly;
- direct contact with biological fluid;
- ingestion of contaminated products (milk or meat not sanitized).

2. Background
Mayotte is at risk of exposure:
- geographical proximity to many endemic countries (the Comoros, Madagascar);
- illegal movements of animals;
- tropical climate (vectors).

3. Situation
Between 22 Nov 2018 and 14 Mar 2019, 101 human RVF cases and 60 [cases] in ruminants recorded [separate maps for animals and humans presented].

4. Livestock monitoring
Suspicion in farm - early detection of disease in livestock
Veterinary visit triggered by a call from the farmer:
- blood sampling;
- confirmed case: animal with clinical signs and positive IgM test;
- official confirmation by PCR (CIRAD);
- epidemiological investigation.
Active surveillance in ruminants:
- 4000 farms, with 20 000 cattle and 15 000 small ruminants;
- sampling of 1500 farms (blood sample).

5. Control measures
a. Biosecurity measures:
- burial stillborn;
- isolating sick animals;
- protect animal with insecticide treatment.
b. No stamping-out of livestock because
- period is too favourable to the development of vectors;
- short duration of viraemia (7 days) vs delay of result;
- risk of under-declaration [under-reporting] of outbreaks;
- increasing the risk of illegal introduction of ruminants.
c. What about vaccination?
- to date, no vaccine authorized in the EU

6. Joint action human and animal health
a. vector control: disinsectization around human and animal outbreaks.
b. awareness messages for population and breeders:
- boil the milk;
- cook the meat;
- keep out mosquitoes;
- eliminate larval breeding habitat.
c. for professionals:
- use of individual protective equipment (masks, gloves, and goggles);
- report abortions to the sanitary veterinarian.

7. Conclusions:
a. French authorities remain vigilant to the epidemiological situation in Mayotte:
- measures adapted to the local conditions;
- human and animal epidemiological surveillance, biosecurity, information, vectors control.
b. Risk of RVF spreading [from Mayotte, internationally] is negligible because
- deficit in beef and sheep meat in Mayotte;
- no live animals nor products exchanged from Mayotte to La Reunion or EU territory;
- administrative decision to prohibit the export of live ruminants and products (meat and milk).

[According to the above presentation by the French Ministry of Agriculture, the recent RVF event in Mayotte, which started in late November 2018, may have been caused by the introduction of the virus from endemic regional countries (the Comoros, Madagascar). This could have occurred either by traded animals or windborne infected vectors. The tropical ecological/climatic situation in Mayotte is not similar to the East African situation (and consequent RVF epidemiology), characterised by periodic exacerbations of latent endemic foci of infection or dormant mosquito larvae.

As apparent from the maps included in the presentation (RVF in animals and in man), the disease spread throughout the island. A recent paper addressing the RVF situation in Mayotte presented the following conclusion: "Communes in the central region of Mayotte would play a major role in the spread of livestock diseases. A widespread epidemic is likely due to their high connectivity between themselves and to communes in the outer region. Surveillance efforts, therefore, need to be focused on central communes to achieve the timely detection of disease occurrence and minimise its consequences." (See Kim Y, Dommergues L, Ben M'sa A, Merot Ph, Cardinale E et al.: Livestock trade network: potential for disease transmission and implications for risk-based surveillance on the island of Mayotte. (Nature) Scientific Reports. 2018; 8:11550. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-29999-y.)

Preventive vaccination could have significantly decreased the RVF epizootic, and consequently human infection; unfortunately, this seems to be, due to EU current legislation, excluded.

According to a recent report by Le Journal de Mayotte (https://lejournaldemayotte.yt/2019/03/22/progression-de-la-fievre-de-la-vallee-du-rift-interdiction-dexporter-viande-ou-lait-cru/), since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November 2018) and as of 22 Mar 2019, 75 outbreaks of disease in animals (including 59 cattle) have been established by samples taken by veterinarians from sick animals or during abortions. The animal foci are mainly located in the center and northwest of the island, but the 1st animal foci appeared in the commune of Mamoudzou (4 bovines and one small-ruminant focus).

In humans, a total of 107 cases have been reported to the monitoring and health emergencies platform of the ARS OI (CVAGS) of Mayotte by the CHM laboratory. Of those who could be interviewed, almost 80% reported contact with animals. Most human cases occurred in the center and northwest of the island. - Mod.AS
