Five persons associated in some way with Caymanas Park, located in
the communities of Independence City and Gregory Park, have been
infected with malaria since January [2009].

As a result, the Ministry of Health, through their Kingston/St Andrew
and St Catherine health departments, carried out a malaria
eradication and education drive at Caymanas Park on Saturday [14 Mar
2009] dubbed 'The Malaria Derby.'

The health ministry used the opportunity to educate the masses,
mostly men, on the dangers of the disease and requested voluntary
blood testing for traces of the disease. More than 130 persons were tested.

Strict measures
---------------
The ministry has not prevented races from being held at the track,
but stipulated strict measures for the organisers of the horse racing
industry to adhere to. A major one is that races should finish before
dusk, which is when mosquitoes are most dangerous. "We want them (the
organisers) to close off before dusk, we don't want anyone to be
bitten," said Dr Eva Lewis-Fuller, director of the Healthy Lifestyle
Programme in the Ministry of Health told The Portmore Star.

The ministry has taken nothing for granted and the entire premises
was fogged a day prior to Saturday's raceday. "We did some fogging
last night (last Friday) [13 Mar 2009] to rid the premises of
mosquitoes," she continued.

Malaria is a disease, which is contracted via the bite of a female
anopheles mosquito. The mosquito passes a parasite into the blood
stream of the unsuspecting victim.

Signs and symptoms
------------------
Signs and symptoms of malaria include fever, sweating, chills,
headaches, weakness, and vomiting. If you experience these symptoms,
you should contact your doctor or the nearest health centre.

[The current outbreak of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in Jamaica
started in 2006 and was the 1st autochthonous malaria in Jamaica
since 1966. _Anopheles albimanus_ is the most important malaria
vector in Jamaica as in Central America and is exophagic and
exophilic (out door biting and out door resting). Spraying therefore
has to cover natural vegetation, which is difficult especially as the
_A. albimanus_ has preferences for high resting places. Further
information on the situation and the control program would be
appreciated. - Mod.EP]

More information on the findings of an investigation, including
speciation of the organism involved, would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
