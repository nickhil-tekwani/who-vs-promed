Infections at nail salons put spotlight on oversight
----------------------------------------------------
Several months after the public first became aware of the mysterious
infection plaguing nail salon patrons, health authorities are still
struggling to answer 2 key questions: Why here and why now?
Are the hardy bacteria that cause the persistent leg sores more
prevalent in Santa Clara County's water, leading to 143 cases
involving at least 33 salons? Are the county's nail technicians more
lax in cleaning the pedicure spas that provide an ideal environment
for the bacteria to grow? Has the explosion in the number of salons
overwhelmed the authorities who are supposed to regulate and inspect
them? Or do the Santa Clara County infections simply highlight the
possibility that these outbreaks could happen anywhere?
One thing is clear: The number of beauty establishments, manicurists,
and pedicurists has skyrocketed, and state oversight has not kept up.
The California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology performed 18 315
inspections in 1999 but only 7094 in 2003.
Such diligence may be what's needed to [root] out bacteria that seem
to be present in most municipal water systems. Researchers who
studied a similar outbreak 5 years ago in Watsonville, CA concluded
that the microbe entered the salon in the tap water and multiplied to
dangerous levels by feeding on organic debris on footbath inlet
screens.
"We know it's fairly prevalent, if you look hard enough," said Dr.
Duc Vugia, chief of the infectious diseases branch at the state
Department of Health Services. "But clearly we don't see disease
associated with using bath water at home."
Though they were able to detect mycobacteria in the Watsonville
salon's tap water, researchers said their tests, which are tricky and
rarely performed, could not measure how much of it was present. Nor
do they know what levels would be considered a health hazard. Unlike
other bugs that water districts routinely monitor, such as fecal
coliform, "for mycobacteria, there's no kind of data for what's an
acceptable level," said Duncan Gillies, laboratory director for the
Santa Cruz County health department.
As part of the Santa Clara County investigation into the
pedicure-linked infections, San Jose Water Company,which supplies
water to just under a million people in parts of San Jose, Los Gatos,
Monte Sereno, Campbell and Cupertino, would like to test for
background levels of mycobacteria. But it hasn't found commercial
labs that can perform the tests with validated methods.
"You can spend a lot of money and get some data but not really know
how good it is," said Andrew Gere, director of the water company.
Scientists who studied the Watsonville cases suspect that these
salon-related infections are not isolated in Santa Clara County and
occur at some baseline level nationwide. But the illness is hard to
track. "A lot of these infections are minimal," said Dr. Kevin
Winthrop, former epidemiologist for the state Department of Health
Services who led the Watsonville investigation. "Some women may have
one small boil that might go away on its own in a month."
And mycobacteriosis isn't on the state's list of "reportable" diseases,
so doctors aren't required to provide case counts to health
authorities.
But with all the attention surrounding the Santa Clara County
outbreak, the state Department of Health Services is trying to gather
this data. In Jan 2005, the agency set up a pilot, asking county
health departments to encourage doctors to report non-tuberculous
mycobacterial infections, Vugia said. So far, he has heard about "a
handful" of cases outside Santa Clara County.

[The reported numbers of cases since the last posting on 19 Dec 2004
has increased from 95 to 143, and the number of affected salons has
increased from 18 to 33. Although not stated in the recent outbreak,
the 2001 cluster was primarily due to _Mycobacterium fortuitum_. -
