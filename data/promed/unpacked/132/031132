Kyrgyzstan: human case of rabies contracted by dog bite in the Osh region
-----------------------------------------------
On Sun 4 Jul 2004, a 14-year-old girl was admitted to the Osh Regional
Hospital. She was hospitalized, because she had developed signs of rabies.
Despite symptomatic treatment, her condition progressively worsened, and
she died, on 8 Jul 2004, with a diagnosis of hydrophobia [rabies]. The
young girl was bitten by a dog on 2 May 2004, and she was admitted to an
ambulatory-care trauma unit. However, she failed to return to receive her
anti-rabies vaccination. 25 people have been identified as contacts, and
all of them will be vaccinated.

[It must be presumed that canine rabies is enzootic in Kyrgyzstan. In the
longer term, a comprehensive canine vaccination program will be required to
protect the human population, and, to avoid such tragic accidents. Osh is
close to the Uzbekistan border in the west - Mod.CP]
