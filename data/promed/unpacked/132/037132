Re: Transmission of West Nile Virus from Alligators to Humans
---------------------------------------------------
I need to clarify the discussion in the foregoing post [West Nile virus,
human - USA (Idaho) (02) 20031111.2793], as it is a bit misleading. There
are no commercial or any other types of alligator farms in Idaho. The
weather and environment is much too inhospitable for that purpose. American
alligators (_Alligator mississippiensis_) are naturally found in 10
southeastern states with the largest numbers, probably a million or more,
being in Louisiana and Florida, followed then by Georgia. coastal South and
North Carolina, lower Alabama, eastern Texas, extreme SE Oklahoma,
Mississippi, and extreme southwestern Arkansas contiguous with eastern
Texas populations (1).
So these animals do exist in areas where there is significant seasonal
climate change in their natural environment. The West Nile virus (WNV)
infected animals have so far only been identified in farmed animals kept at
artificially high year round temperatures (92-95 degrees F) to encourage
year-round feeding and growth.
The only conceivable reason a "worker" would be handling live baby American
alligators in Idaho is because these animals were in the process of, or
have entered the pet trade. Baby alligators have no other commercial value
and retail anywhere from one to several hundred dollars each in the pet trade.
This factor adds a new dimension to the potential problem, which is
reminiscent of the Turtle/Iguana/Salmonella issue of a few years ago. The
source of baby alligators in the pet trade are likely to be alligator farms
in Louisiana or Florida that find it more profitable to divert such animals
as "pets" than to raise all of them to commercial size for leather or
novelty meat purposes. The leather is used to make luxury shoes,
boots,wallets, and the like. The tail meat is sold frozen by specialty
shops and is often served deep fried using a variety of recipes. However,
baby alligators are of no value for this purpose and are much more valuable
as live pet specimens.
The reports from Idaho indicate that the worker there (in Idaho) was
handling these animals and that testing found the animals positive for WNV.
This leads to the obvious conclusion that an arthropod vector was not the
source of transmission but that these baby alligators were shedding virus
in some manner, which may have been contracted by the handler through a cut
or abrasion. A concern, however, involves not only the threat of some pet
alligator owner becoming infected through cuts and abrasions combined with
contact with an infected animal but also as a result of the possibility of
even more casual contact, as we have seen demonstrated in the transmission
of Salmonella to humans from reptiles in past cases.
This case in Idaho requires intense investigation as to whether these
animals, which are hopefully still alive, are shedding the virus somehow,
whether a cut or abrasion may have been the portal through which it was
introduced in the infected victim, and whether the conditions at alligator
farms in Louisiana and Florida (as highlighted by Pete Brazaitis in the
previous posting) may be contributing to the spread of the disease.
Certainly mosquitos in the alligator home states such as Florida and
Louisiana are part of the chain of transmission, but the case is Idaho is
definitely disturbing for the reasons given above.
