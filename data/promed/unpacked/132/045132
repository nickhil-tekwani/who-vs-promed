From: "Howard L. Lipton" <hllipton@merle.acns.nwu.edu>

I would be interested in getting more information, perhaps the
article in the Vet Record. I work with Theiler's virus-induced
demyelinating disease in mice which is a model for multiple
sclerosis. Theiler's virus is a picornavirus that is unusual in that
it persists in the central nervous system of mice which leds to
inflammatory demyelination (the virus can be readily isolated from
the spinal cords of affected mice for many months post infection).
Paraparesis slowly evolves in the mice.
Theiler's virus mainly infects mice in nature, but several other
related rodents may also harbor this virus. Theiler's virus has also
been shown to experimentally infect hamsters, rats and possibly
guinea pigs, but very few studies have been done in these species. We
have a putative receptor protein which is found in the brush border
cells of dogs.

[Firstly, ProMED is many things but one thing it isn't is a library.
For that service one should go to the appropriate room in one's
institute or university and talk to the people there. Spoken to
nicely they are, in my experience, extremely helpful.
Secondly, if there is such a virus in hedgehogs how would it survive
the reality that such a (?chronic) infection and progressive
neurological lesions will soon result in a hedgehog being lunch for a
fox or a badger, and termination of the infection? A number of
solutions come to mind, e.g., either that many are called (infected)
but few are chosen (for lesions); or that the length of the infection
does not significantly impact overall fertility; or that the
infections have spilt over from the natural reservoir into hedgehogs
