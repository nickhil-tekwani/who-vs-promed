99/123 First report of impatiens necrotic spot tospovirus in Israel
-------------------------------------------------------
In January 1999, anemone plants (_Anemone coronaria_) imported from Europe
and grown in open fields near Jerusalem, Israel, developed foliar
ringspots and necrosis. A few weeks later, anemone plants in the
surrounding area were also affected and seriously damaged. The presence
of impatiens necrotic spot tospovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was
detected in these diseased plants (by ELISA, inoculations to indicator
plants, electron microscopy).
This is the first report of impatiens necrotic spot tospovirus in Israel.

report of impatiens necrotic spot tospovirus (INSV) in Israel.
Plant Disease, 83(6), p 587.
[Three tospoviruses have now been reported to occur in Israel: tomato
spotted wilt (TSWV), iris yellow spot (IYSV), and, with this report,
impatiens necrotic spot (INSV). INSV is known to occur in Europe and
North America. All known infected anenome plants were eradicated, but
plans must be made to prevent further introduction of the virus since it
might spread to greenhouse and field crops. -Mod. DH
