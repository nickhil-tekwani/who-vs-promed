Relative to Dr. Evans comments on canine distemper I would like to express
my concern regarding his description of the neurologic form of the disease
in the raccoon as "Old Dog Encephalitis"- like. In my experience the
neurologic form of canine distemper in raccoons is a demyelinating
encephalitis and is morphologically similar to the typical lesions of the
encephalitic form of the virus in the dog. Old Dog Encephalitis, a chronic
disease of mature dogs, consists of a lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis
without demyelination. It is a distinct disease from the more typical
demyelinating encephalitis of canine distemper that can have a delayed
onset in dogs.
Old Dog Encephalitis has been found to contain paramyxovirus like
inclusions, that ultrastructurally contain paramyxovirus. It has been
thought to possibly be due to CDV for decades however it has just been
shown recently to likely be due to CDV (see reference below).

in a gnotobiotic dog. Veterinary Pathology. 35(6):527-34, 1998.
