Quahog disease worries shellfishermen
-----------------------------------------
In the biting cold this week [3rd week of December 2004], the slow removal
of more than one million quahogs from aquaculture grants in Wellfleet
began. Officials and shellfishermen hope that the painful step will save an
economic engine and a way of life.
In November 2004, 3 shellfishermen with grants near Egg Island came forward
with concerns that shellfish disease QPX, or quahog parasite unknown, had
infected a number of their animals. Although the disease has no effect on
human health, and, in fact, infected quahogs can be eaten safely, it can be
devastating to the economic health of shellfishermen and the town as a whole.
Its appearance in Wellfleet immediately brought to mind the disease's
appearance in Provincetown in the 1990s, when it wiped out an industry that
has never recovered.
"It is definitely scary," said Bill Walton, fisheries and aquaculture
specialist for the Cape Cod Cooperative Extension, and former Wellfleet
shellfish constable. "That disease really took root (in Provincetown); it
killed a lot of clams and put a lot of people out of business."
The concern in Wellfleet is magnified, as there are 100 farms in Wellfleet,
the largest number of farms in the state. "There is a lot at stake,
certainly," Walton said.
The concern of those in town was evident, when an emergency meeting was
held on Monday [13 Dec 2004] with state and county officials, as well as
Roxanna Smolowitz, a veterinarian and pathologist at the Marine Biological
Laboratory in Woods Hole, who has been studying QPX, to discuss the disease
and its impacts. More than 60 people packed the senior center to talk about
next steps.
It became clear then that perhaps the most important task was to get the
infected quahogs, or hard-shelled clams, out of the water, so the disease
wouldn't spread. Both Walton and current Shellfish Constable Andy Koch said
that the cold temperatures this time of year was actually a benefit, as the
slime mold that makes up QPX prefers warmer waters. Studies show it grows
well in warm, salty water around 72 F and may always be present in the
water column.
Other than removing the infected clams, there is not much they can do, as
there is no cure or feasible treatment for the disease, although scientists
have been working on breeding quahogs that are not susceptible to QPX.
After the Provincetown blight, some regulations were put in place, and some
towns don't allow the transfer of seed to different water bodies. To stop
its spread, growers in Wellfleet were also asked to wash their clothing in
freshwater, which kills the disease.
The infected growers in Wellfleet said they did "everything by the book,"
said Walton. And, according to some people in town, the state is looking
into the fact that the infected quahogs all came from the same place and
from the same year class in an area that has seen the disease, Barnstable.
The clams were bought at Cape Cod Oyster. The company could not be reached
for comment. Since some, if not all, of the clams are not covered by
insurance, and the loss can be likened to almost a year's pay, there are
moves afoot to find the responsible party.
Come spring, said Walton, researchers will be out testing the waters to
make sure that QPX has not spread around to other grants. Although the
disease can be found in the wild fishery (where the clams are not farmed),
it seems to thrive when the quahogs are close together, as they are on
grants. It is transmitted by direct infection, quahog to quahog.
QPX is not like red tide, an algae that clams eat that makes them toxic --
and sometimes deadly -- to warm-blooded animals. Since QPX is not harmful
to anything but its namesake, waters will remain open to fishing and
shellfishing. Walton said that QPX's presence in the water doesn't
automatically doom the industry.
QPX was discovered on 3 grants in Pleasant Bay in 2001 and was the 2nd
major outbreak in the United States. And, although it was an economic blow
that year, it does not seem to have had tremendous long term effects.
Orleans Shellfish Constable Dawson Farber said he has not heard growers
talk about the disease in the past several years, and that is fine with
him. "It is very much a concern for us," Farber said, adding, that they
hope "that the last outbreak will be it."
Walton said there are some areas in which, though QPX exists in the water
column, it doesn't decimate a fishery. In fact, Barnstable Harbor was
struck with it recently, but some growers have come to expect a routine
amount of losses from the disease, similar to what they expect from crab
predation. "They are successfully farming despite that threat," Walton said.
Koch said it is just too early to tell whether Wellfleet will receive only
a glancing blow from QPX. "Unfortunately only time will tell that," Koch
said. "It is a major scare, (but) hopefully, it's a little brush fire we
have to put out." He explained the quahog fishery is worth millions of
dollars and impacts the entire economy, as the ripple effect goes from the
guy selling the gas for the outboard motors to the restaurants in
town. Koch said that, although people on the Cape may not be eating as
many clams as they do in the summer, this is an important time of year for
shellfishermen who sell the animals to be shipped around the country for
holiday dinners.
Ironically, QPX is particularly devastating, because it kills the clams
just as they are ready to hit the market after 3 years of growing. Signs of
the disease are cracked or chipped shells and a gaping mouth, as the
quahogs become too weak to close. "It's the worst quahog disease," Koch
said, and looking for a positive, added, "the only thing is it doesn't
effect our oysters."
Since Provincetown, some progress has been made on studying the disease.
For instance, the "X" has now been defined as the protist
_Labyrianthomorpha_. But seeing that shellfishermen are still relatively
powerless about what they can do to protect their livelihoods, which are so
much a part of the culture of the peninsula, many are frustrated with the
lack of scientific progress. "I am outraged that more research has not been
funded by the government," said Selectwoman Helen Miranda Wilson.

[Protists are a category of microbes having a very wide range. They may be
very complicated organisms. Protists include slime molds, protozoa and
primitive algae. These are single cell organisms that have their DNA
contained within a nucleus (eukaryotic).
These organisms are not truly plant or animal, but something in between,
and are rather difficult to work with in the laboratory, which may be the
reason more research has not been done. It is understandable this community
is upset. - Mod.TG]
