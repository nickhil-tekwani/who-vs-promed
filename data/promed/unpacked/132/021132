Tropical Race 4 of Panama disease (TR4 of Fusarium wilt) is spreading to new localities in Asia and the Middle East, [due to] expansion of Cavendish banana production. The 1st incidences in Laos and Viet Nam have just been reported [see links below].

The 1st global campaign to address the disease has just been launched by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and partners [see link below]. Currently, the only [control] option are Cavendish variants bred in Taiwan, which have higher tolerance but not total immunity to TR4. [But] it's uncertain how well these will fare in subtropical areas. Furthermore, there are uncertainties [about] yield as well as adaptability and suitability for processing and transport. These clones are currently being trialled in Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting and streaking of pseudostem; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But in recent years, Tropical race 4 (TR4) has been reported outside that area in the Middle East and Africa (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20131107.2044265, 20131206.2095450).

TR4 is of great concern worldwide and is estimated to have devastated around 100 000 hectares of bananas so far. Consequently development of TR4 resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries. As mentioned above, new cultivars potentially resistant or tolerant to TR4 require lengthy testing under field conditions in the various production regions and need to be assessed for commercial suitability.
