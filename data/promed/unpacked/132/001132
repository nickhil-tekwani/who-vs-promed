At least one child has died and over 300 infected by whooping cough [pertussis] in district Two, Grand Bassa county.

According to reports, these cases have been discovered in Kpawootroh town, Gargar Town, and several other towns within the district. The outbreak is happening in an area bordering Margibi county, and reports suggest that several cases have also been discovered there. Alexander PM Joe, Officer in Charge [OIC] of district Two health center, confirmed to FrontPage Africa [FPA] that they discovered that there's an increase of the diseases in the area, with a several hundred children already infected.

"Since January this year [2019], most the babies that we have been treating have been affected with whooping cough and as a result of that one child has died already,' Joe told an FPA reporter who visited the area. "The sign and symptoms of whooping cough are red eye and uncontrollable cough as well as constant running down of tears. "We have communicated with the Grand Bassa County Health team about the situation but we are hopeful that they are going to help in the soonest possible time." He warned that if nothing is done quickly, there could be further in the number of cases, which may cause more deaths. "The lack of drugs is a major problem at this health center but it is a nationwide issue. We are hoping that the Ministry of Health intervenes quickly as to have the lives of over 300 babies saved," the OIC stressed.

A mother of 4 children, also confirmed that the lives of her kids are at serious risk. "My son is also affected with this same whooping cough; I am worrying because one child has died already. I don't want my son to leave me," she said. "I am calling on all the health institutions to come to our aid before this disease goes out of hand." Another parent whose 2 children are infected, is also worried that the current challenges facing the health sector would make it difficult to seek referral treatment in Buchanan city.

The outbreak comes as the major referral hospital in the county's capital ­- the Liberian government hospital ­- faces enormous challenges and is struggling to keep its doors open to patients. There are lots of challenges ranging from the lack of fuel allotment and essential drugs so we are constrained, said Dr Abraham Jawara, Medical Director of the hospital. Last week [week of 28 Jan 2019], Dr Jawara warned that outpatients were told to purchase their own drugs while inpatients have already been asked to transfer to other health centers.

Reported cases of whooping cough spiked in Maine last month [January 2019] to more than twice what that had been the prior year [2018], according to the state's public health agency. Overall, Maine had 55 reported cases of pertussis last month, up from 24 in January 2018, according to the Maine Center of Disease Control and Prevention's latest disease surveillance report released earlier this week [week of 4 Feb 2019].

Of the 55 cases, 39 were in just 3 of Maine's 16 counties. Hancock county had the most with 16, York county had 13, and Waldo county had 10. More than half the cases affected children and teenagers between 11 and 19 years old, according to the Maine CDC.

The CDC last month [January 2019] declared only one outbreak of pertussis at an unidentified K-12 school in York county. Of nearly 450 reported cases of pertussis in Maine in 2018, York county had the most, with 174 reported cases. 20 outbreaks were identified in Maine last year [2018], with 9 occurring in York county and 4 in Hancock county.

In Hancock county, concern about the spread of pertussis last month [January 2019] prompted school officials with Regional School Unit [RSU] 24, which serves 9 towns, and at Ellsworth Elementary Middle School to send out notifications to parents. One case was confirmed at the Ellsworth school, but information about whether any cases were confirmed at RSU 24 schools was not made public. According to a report in the Ellsworth American weekly newspaper, 11 cases of whooping cough were reported at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill between early November [2018] and mid-January [2019].

Pertussis cases are increasing in South Dakota, with the state already seeing 27 cases early in 2019. In particular, the Sioux Falls School District has seen 10 cases in 11 different schools since December [2018].

We spoke with Dr Joshua Clayton, the state epidemiologist for the South Dakota Department of Health, to find out what you need to know. Nationwide, there are between 10 000 and 40 000 cases of pertussis per year on average. Out of the 27 cases in South Dakota so far in 2019, 18 of them have been in children under 5 years old, Clayton said.

Why is South Dakota seeing more pertussis cases? Pertussis outbreaks tend to be cyclical, with spikes occurring every 3 to 5 years in general, Clayton said. In 2014, there were 109 cases, but that number dropped to as low as 9 in 2017 before skyrocketing to 162 cases in 2018. "Every 3 to 5 years we do see an increase," Clayton said. "Part of that is due to waning immunity." Unlike some vaccines, pertussis vaccines are only 85 percent effective, Clayton said, meaning there is a chance people who have been vaccinated will still get sick. Immunity typically only lasts about 2 years before beginning to decline.

Molly Satter, the health services coordinator for the Sioux Falls School District, said 9 out of the 10 cases seen in the district this winter [2018-19] were up to date on their shots. Of the more than 23 000 students enrolled in the district, upward of 98 percent are fully vaccinated, she said.

In addition, the CDC says getting the pertussis vaccine can help prevent infection and lessen the severity of symptoms, even if you do get the disease. Before the pertussis vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, about 200 000 children contracted pertussis and 9000 died each year from it. Now, out of the 10 000 to 40 000 cases seen nationwide each year (https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph-2017.jpg), only 20 people die each year.

As the number of whooping cough cases at school grows, the next step may be to limit interschool activities, according to the Los Angeles County Health Department Office of Communications and Public Affairs.

The whooping cough outbreak has now reached 30 students across both campuses [of the Harvard-Westlake School] between [16 Nov 2018] and [22 Feb 2019], according to an email sent to parents of students who are in a class with a student who has pertussis.

According to the Office of Communications and Public Affairs, school closure due to the whooping cough outbreak is not probable, and there is not a number of cases at which the Health Department would tell the school to close.

New Brunswick has declared a whooping cough outbreak at Moncton High School [Westmorland county] after at least 5 cases of the highly contagious disease were diagnosed at the school.

"Recognizing that this is highly unusual and that there are likely many other undiagnosed cases in the school, I have officially declared a pertussis outbreak at your school," wrote Dr Yves A Leger, the Medical Officer of Health in the province's east region, in a letter sent to parents on [Sun 3 Mar 2019].

Leger is recommending that if a parent or their child has a cough that they see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. "Do not assume that it is merely a cold or the flu," Leger writes in the letter. "A simple test can be done to confirm if you have pertussis or not." He recommends wearing a mask when arriving at the clinic and avoiding infants and pregnant women. Leger says that guardians should mention they are from the Moncton High School community and there have been many cases of whooping cough. It is also recommended that guardians should verify their child's immunization records.

In addition to routine childhood vaccines, an adolescent booster dose of the whooping cough vaccine is required and provided through the province's immunization clinics in Grade 7. Leger says that an adult booster dose at age 18 or later is also required.

According to the region's immunization program statistics, Leger says up to 30 per cent of students have not received their adolescent booster dose. In an effort to change that, Leger says that the province will be holding an immunization clinic at the school on [20 Mar 2019]. In the case of a school closure, the clinic will be held on [21 Mar 2019]. Permission forms are set to be distributed after the March break.

The Medical Officer of Health says that if guardians are unsure whether their child has received their adolescent does that they should contact their usual provider or reach out to the local public health officer at 506-836-3502 or by email at <vaccine@gnb.ca>.

A North-West primary school has reported a case of whooping cough. Somerset Primary will send a note with more information home with the oldest child in each family on [Tue 19 Feb 2019].

Statistics from Communicable Diseases Prevention Clinical Director Dr Faline Howes suggest that Tasmania is in the midst of an outbreak. There have been 124 notifications of whooping cough in January this year [2019]. This is an increase from 103 in December 2018, and 84 in November.

Dr Howes said Tasmanian outbreaks usually last for months and involve people of all ages over the whole state, with babies under 6 months of age being most at risk of life-threatening diseases. Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is an infection caused by bacteria that affects the lungs and airways.

Last year [2018] there was an outbreak of the disease on the coast prompting a warning for people to check their vaccinations were up to date.
