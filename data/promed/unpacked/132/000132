The Department of Vector Control and Environmental Health of the
Herrera health region, indicated a control and surveillance operation
in the Boca de Parita community, after the 1st positive case of [a]
hantavirus [infection] in 2010 was detected. Tomas Higuera, Regional
Health Director in Herrera, indicated that the report referred to a
38-year-old man who is in the intensive care unit in the El Vigia de
Chitre Hospital in a frail state. This is the 2nd case [of a
hantavirus infection] in the country; the other case was registered in
January [2010] in the Llano Marin de Cocle.

The Minister of Health, Frankalin Vergara, said yesterday [9 Feb 2010]
in Penonome that this case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] will
not affect the celebration of the Carnivals, and recommended that the
citizenry implement the recommendations of the Ministry of Health.

The [virus that causes] HPS is transmitted by [the wild rat]
_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_ and the [virus] is contracted on breathing
air contaminated with [dust from dried] feces, urine or saliva of the
wild mice or by direct contact with their excretions.

The regional health authorities are recommending preventing this fatal
disease by frequent cleaning and [airing out] houses and storage areas
while using masks, among other measures.

The hantavirus most likely to be the etiological agent in these cases
is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number
20081027.3389, hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in
Panama include Rio Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo
(_Oligoryzomys fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo
(_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only
Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
