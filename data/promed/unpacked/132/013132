[As a result of a disease that attacks certain commercial and
ornamental fruit trees,] 2 areas of western Niagara County have been
placed under agricultural quarantine.
The plum pox virus has caused a moratorium to be imposed on portions
of the towns of Porter and Wilson that bans planting several species
of stone fruit trees, including peach, plum, nectarine, apricot, and
cherry, which are susceptible to the disease. It is also unlawful to
plant certain ornamental trees and shrubs, such as, purple leaf plum,
purple leaf sand cherry, flowering peach, flowering almond, and all
flowering ornamental and flowering cherry, said Don Albright,
coordinator of operations with the US Department of Agriculture [USDA].
The disease is believed to have originated in Europe and was imported
during the 1980s and 1990s into Pennsylvania in the USA and Ontario
in Canada. It was discovered in Adams County [Pennsylvania, USA], and
around Niagara-on-the Lake [Ontario, Canada], in 1999.
To determine if the disease has spread beyond the quarantined areas,
Albright said, the USDA and the state Department of Agriculture and
Markets launched a 3-year survey. Residents of the affected towns and
nearby areas were notified by mail 13 Jul 2007 of the survey and its
purpose by the USDA and state Department of Agriculture and Markets.
The survey, which will include questionnaires and collecting leaf
samples, will contact residents as well as orchard and nursery
operators in areas up to 5 miles (8 km) around the quarantined areas.
It was started in June [2007] in Niagara County. Federal and state
officials hope to extend it eastward in the Lake Ontario fruit belt
to include Orleans, Monroe, and Wayne counties, and into the Finger
Lakes and Hudson Valley regions. "We did a survey of the areas within
5 miles (8 km) of the 2 sites and didn't find evidence that the
disease had spread," Albright said.
The plum pox virus is spread by aphids or by infected wood being used
for propagation purposes. Affected trees weaken and die in about 10
years. A healthy peach orchard typically has a productive life span
of 25 years or more, after which it is replanted.
The Niagara County quarantines encompass 4 square miles (10.4 sq km)
of Porter and 2 square miles (5.2 sq km) of Wilson in the northwest
third of the county. The disease was discovered one year ago [2006].
If no evidence is found that it has spread, Albright said, the
quarantines can be lifted in 2009.
The virus, which is not harmful to humans, only affects stone fruit
varieties -- fruits with pits -- but not apples, which is Niagara
County's biggest cash fruit crop. Peaches and plums, however, provide
more income per acre than apples, Albright said. Trees that are found
to be infected are ordered destroyed, with orchard owners compensated
for their loss, he said. Similar plum pox virus surveys have been
conducted or are under way in Pennsylvania and Michigan, Albright
said. The New York State Agriculture Experimental Station at Geneva,
NY, and Cornell Cooperative Extension are assisting with the survey.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus)
causes serious losses in many stone fruit species in the genus
_Prunus_. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible including
hops, pea, and tomato. Resistant stone fruit cultivars are available
and some strains of PPV do not infect certain _Prunus_ species. PPV
is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical inoculation,
grafting, in seed for some host species, but is not known to be
transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. PPV has been a
devastating disease in Europe since the early 1900s and is widely
distributed in Europe and some parts of Asia. It was only recently
detected in the Americas in the USA, Canada and, most recently, in
Argentina in 2003. So far, there have only been quarantine
interceptions reported from Australia and New Zealand where illegally
imported cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of
introducing the virus. Disease management includes control of the
vector insects and use of resistant host varieties.
_Potyvirus_ is the largest of the plant virus genera containing many
viruses that seriously affect a wide range of crop plants.
