A dead crow in Northridge and a mosquito pool in Rowland Heights have
tested positive for the West Nile virus, the 1st confirmed cases in
Los Angeles County this year, vector control officials said Friday
[26 Jan 2007].
But Robert Saviskas, the county vector control director, was quick to
downplay the significance of the findings because testing so early in
the year is unusual.
"There isn't much to compare it with to see if it's significant," he
said, adding that testing in the past has begun in the spring when
the virus is more likely to spread.
But he said increased funding allowed earlier testing, which could
indicate what the season will be like.
