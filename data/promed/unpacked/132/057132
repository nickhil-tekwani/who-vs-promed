Black streaked dwarf rice virus infects 28 provinces
----------------------------------------------------
Black streaked dwarf rice disease has hit 28 cities and provinces across
the country, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development [MARD] has
revealed. Since the disease was discovered in northern Thai Binh in 2009,
20 out of 25 northern cities and provinces, 5 out of 6 northern central
provinces, and 2 southern central provinces have been seriously infected.

Since early April 2010, the disease has rapidly spread throughout northern
regions and seriously affected fields in Lai Chau, Dien Bien, Lao Cai, Nam
Dinh, Hoa Binh, and Bac Giang. More than 4418 ha [11 000 acres] of rice in
northern Thai Nguyen, central Quang Binh, and central coastal Khanh Hoa
have shown signs of stunted growth, raising the total infected area of the
winter-spring crop [2010] to nearly 256 150 ha [633 000 acres]. Currently,
about 50 ha [124 acres] of the early spring-summer crop are infected. MARD
said the disease was likely to rapidly spread south.

Most of the infected areas are suffering from stunted, flattened rice
[plants], which will dramatically reduce productivity. Even fields without
signs of disease are at high risk of ill-quality rice. Deputy minister Bui
Ba Bong said it would take about 20 days to establish the effects of the
disease on the nation's rice industry. The disease can become an epidemic
if no effective measures are taken. He has urged agriculture departments to
destroy all infected areas, especially in the southern central region to
stop the disease. Authorities have been asked to help farmers spray crops
properly.

[Black streaked dwarf disease (BSDD) of rice due to _Rice black streaked
dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_) is known to cause serious crop
losses in South East Asia. Symptoms include darkening and distortion of
leaves, black streaked tumours along leaf veins, and severe stunting of
plants. It also affects some other graminaceous hosts including maize,
wheat, oat, and barley and is spread by planthoppers including _Laodelphax
striatellus_ and _Unkanodes_ species.

In 2009, the spread of a new virus associated with BSDD symptoms, but
transmitted by the white backed planthopper (WBPH, _Sogatella furcifera_),
which is not a vector of RBSDV, was reported from southern China and
northern Viet Nam. The new virus has been tentatively named Southern rice
black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV). RBSDV and the closely related _Maize
rough dwarf virus_ (MRDV) have both been classed into the serogroup 2 of
_Fijivirus_, and SRBSDV appears to belong to the same group.

Disease management for rice viruses includes cultural practices, vector
control, and use of cultivars with resistance to the virus, the vector, or
both. However, since genetic traits for resistance against the new SRBSDV
have not yet been analysed, insecticide sprays against the vector, as
suggested above, are currently the only available avenue. The new SRBSDV
and an increase in WBPH numbers are a major concern in the region where the
crop is already frequently affected by other diseases including several
viruses (for example, ragged and grassy stunt).
