[Before this report, these outbreaks were restricted to ferret badgers (_Melogale moschata_). Ferret badgers are carnivorous species of the mustelid family. The Formosan gem-faced civet (_Paguma larvata taivana_) is also a carnivore (that is, Order Carnivora), but it belongs in the viverrid family. This case represents the 1st one in a wildlife species other than the ferret badger, although there have been reports in dogs (see ProMED posts # 20130910.1934959 and 20130920.1958902). A picture of this civet can be accessed at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Paguma-larvata-masked-palm-civet-kaeng-krachan-national-park.jpg.
