Pig farmers in Scotland face the challenge of a new disease with
potentially disastrous financial implications, following confirmation of
the first case of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS).
PMWS is a wasting disease closely associated with a similar problem,
dermatitis nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), which has been found in the
Scottish herd in recent years.
Dr Dave Strachan of the Scottish Agricultural Colleges veterinary
investigation center in Aberdeen, who has studied the disease closely,
said: "Its a very nasty condition and is hard to get rid of. The cause of
PMWS has yet to be fully worked out, but it affects piglets between 6 and
12 weeks, most commonly at weaning. It has no effect on adult pigs.
"The symptoms are a failure to gain weight and since it appears to suppress
the immune system, the pigs are prone to a whole range of other problems
including scours and a general lack of thriftiness."
PMWS was first noticed in Canada in 1991 and spread to a range of countries
including the US, France, Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands before being
confirmed for the first time in the UK in late 1999. There have been
large-scale outbreaks in East Anglia and Yorkshire over the last 18 months
with more than 400 reported incidents, usually in tandem with PDNS.
Mortality can be as high as 20 percent.
Another problem with the disease is it is very persistent and can be
present on pig units for between 6 months and 2 years. The Meat and
Livestock Commission figured a severe outbreak would force up the
production break-even price by 10-15 GBP per kilogram of deadweight.
Prevention rather than cure is the key, according to Dr Strachan:
"Biosecurity is certainly the word and I think farmers should try to keep
mixing of different batches to a minimum. It would also be advisable to
quarantine all replacement pigs for a month."

[There is mounting evidence the syndrome is caused by a virus called
Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV-2). This is related to the circovirus that
causes Chicken Anemia Virus, which can cause similar signs in chickens.
These are some of the smallest viruses, and are notable for their
resistance to many disinfectants. The loss of passive antibodies around
the late nursery period corresponds to the time of virus infection.
Mortality rates of infected pigs may be much lower than originally
reported. Consequently, Circovirus II is moving closer to being identified
as the causative agent.
This is a difficult disease to diagnose accurately. Due to the multiplicity
of organs involved, the non-specific signs and the effects on the immune
system, other concurrent diseases are common (including PRRS (porcine
respiratory and reproductive syndrome), Glassers Disease, _Streptococcus
suis_, _Salmonella_ spp., Enzootic pneumonia, suppurative bronchopneumonia,
etc.). Care is needed not to miss the syndrome due to masking by these
other more obvious diseases.
Clinical signs can be suggestive, but diagnosis is based on multiple
post-mortems and especially histology. Lymphocytic depletion and
interstitial pneumonia are 2 common signs. PCV-2 can frequently be
demonstrated by specialized techniques. Clinical signs also include
anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, rough hair coat, and a gaunt appearance.
Currently there is no treatment for PMWS. Prevention is the key. However,
because it is resistant to many disinfectants, it may be persistent on a
farm for a long period of time. ­ Mod.TG]
