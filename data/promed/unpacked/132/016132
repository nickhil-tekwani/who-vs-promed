Oklahoma State Department of Health officials say there has been a syphilis outbreak in Lawton and the surrounding areas. [The city of Lawton is the seat of Comanche County, in the state of Oklahoma.] Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease, is a curable bacterial infection. Officials did express concern, however, that the disease could spread to counties beyond the initial area.

"The good news is syphilis can be identified by examination and testing, cured with antibiotics, and through disease investigation, the spread of syphilis can be stopped," said Comanche County Health Department regional director Brandie O'Connor. "We want to encourage people to seek testing and treatment if they have been having unprotected sex. Free, confidential testing and treatment are available at local county health departments. The people at high risk for syphilis due to this specific outbreak include men who have sex with men, people who have multiple sex partners, IV drug users, and people who have sex with anonymous partners, including those met online," O'Connor said.

The disease can be spread through sex -- or kissing, if the infected person has a sore on the mouth. Untreated syphilis can cause damage to major organs and cause birth defects or infant death. Symptoms include a painless lesion on sexual organs, red or brown rashes on the hands and feet, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, and fatigue.

Comanche County officials say there has been a 300 per cent rise in cases of syphilis over the past year. For more information, call the Comanche County Health Department at 580-248-5890.

[The state of Oklahoma can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2888408,7617. Comanche County in southern Oklahoma can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/oklahoma-county-map.gif. The city of Lawton, with a population was 96 867, making it the 5th-largest city in the state of Oklahoma, is located about 87 mi (140 km) south west of Oklahoma City, the capital and largest city of the state (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawton,_Oklahoma). Fort Sill Military Reservation, located nearby, is the largest employer in Lawton.

The news report above characterizes the outbreak in Lawton as occurring in "men who have sex with men, people who have multiple sex partners, IV drug users and people who have sex with anonymous partners, including those met online."

ProMED-mail has posted reports of the recent increased incidence of syphilis in many countries that is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and characterized by high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf.

The increased incidence of syphilis occurring among MSM is frequently characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection (see prior ProMED-mail posts in the "see also" section below). A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV infected MSM (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642). However, the news report above fails to mention the frequency of HIV co-infection or condom use behavior among those with syphilis, or any association with Fort Sill. Such information is essential so that we can effectively target efforts to limit potential spread. A more detailed description of the cases would be appreciated. - Mod.ML]
