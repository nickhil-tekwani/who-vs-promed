A New type of bluetongue found in the Netherlands
-------------------------------------------------
The type of bluetongue detected earlier this week in eastern
Netherlands appears to be type 6 [BTV-6].

The voluntary vaccination campaign undertaken in the Netherlands
[since the early summer of 2008. - Mod. AS] has been targeting BTV-8.
BTV-6 is found, among others places, in Central America and Africa.
Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV), Gerda Verburg,
has announced a so-called 'containment zone' of some 50 km around the
infected farms, where restrictive rules are imposed.

This afternoon [24 Oct 2008], the EU reference laboratory in the
United Kingdom has confirmed the presence of Bluetongue serotype 6 virus.
The measures published last Monday [20 Oct 2008] will be replaced by
a new scheme, which applies to all ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats.

Measures
--------
The containment zone of 50 km around the [4] infected farms [in the
provinces Overijsel and Gelderland, East Netherlands, bordering
Germany. - Mod.AS] is shown in the attached map [click on
'Kaart insluitingsgebied blauwtong type-6'
at
<http://www.minlnv.nl/portal/page?_pageid=116,1640321&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_file_id=31522>.
-Mod. AS].

Animals for slaughter are allowed to be transported from the
containment zone within the Netherlands, only from farms where no
outbreak has occurred for 30 days. Stricter conditions apply to
breeding and production animals: such animals will be allowed movement
only if kept on midge-free holdings and following a negative test.
Transport abroad is prohibited. For pregnant breeding and production
animals, which must be vaccinated before their insemination, this
means that no export may take place [since no BTV-6 vaccine is
available/applied currently in the Netherlands. - Mod.AS]. Export from
other parts of the Netherlands is allowed, subjected to the same
conditions required for transport of animals from the containment zone
into the rest of the country.

These measures go into force on 24 Oct 2008, at 19.00 and remain in
force until further risk of spread of BTV-6 has faded. The General
Inspection Service (AID) controls the transport measures.

The European Union and the authorities of the neighboring countries
have been informed.

There is, at present, no vaccine against BTV-6 available in Europe.
Such vaccines are applied in the BTV-6 infected areas elsewhere
[namely in other parts of the world. - Mod.AS]. It is still unclear
whether in the short term such vaccines can be applied in the
Netherlands. The availability of such vaccines worldwide, their
applicability and quantities are being checked.

[Notably, both primary outbreaks of BTV in northern Europe, namely
BTV-8 in summer 2006 and the current outbreak of BTV-6, seem to have
taken place in the Netherlands.

The identification of the new serotype underlines the importance of
forwarding samples to OIE reference laboratories. The IAH at
Pirbright, which has carried out the current identification, has been
engaged in BT research since the early 1960's; its collection of BT
virus isolates is available on-line at
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins//ReoID/BTV-isolates.htm>.

We are grateful to Sabine Zentis for bringing the new finding to our
attention.

Besides Central America and Africa, mentioned in the Dutch press
release as regions where BTV-6 has been recorded in the past, this
serotype has been detected in the past also in the Middle East.
Israel, where surveillance for bluetongue has been ongoing
continuously since 1968, has reported BTV-6 in sheep in 1972, 1973,
1974, 1983 and 1986. Such findings obviously represented virus
circulation within the region (Eastern Mediterranean). BTV-6 has been
included, since 1975, in the quadrivalent (live attennuated) vaccine,
produced by the Onderstepoort laboratories in South Africa, which has
been routinely applied in susceptible breeds of sheep in Israel.

We are grateful to a Dutch subscriber who has kindly submitted the
following comment in response to ProMED-mail's request for information
in posting 20081021.3331 pertaining to the BT-related measures
recently imposed in the Netherlands. In contrast to the information in
the UK 'Farmers Weekly' of 21 Oct 2008, no breeding ban of ruminants
has been declared by the Dutch authorities. Correct information is
given in the official document of the
Dutch Ministry of Agriculture at
<http://www.minlnv.nl/cdlpub/servlet/CDLServlet?p_file_id=31423>http://www.minlnv.nl/cdlpub/servlet/CDLServlet?p_file_id=31423>
which addressed, in article 3.5, 1st paragraph, the current
limitations on export of semen, ova and embryos from ruminants,
referring to the conditions of Article 8, Regulation (EC) No.
1266/2007. These measures have now been replaced by the new measures
specified in the press release above. - Mod.AS].
