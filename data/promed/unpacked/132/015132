Al-Quds al-Arabi in Arabic 10 Mar 04: Iraqi Communist Party Says Yazidi
Sect Facing 'Genocide'
------------------------------
A statement by the Iraqi Communist Party has said that the Yazidi sect in
northern Iraq is facing a terrible genocide that began 2 days ago as a
result of the poisoning of its region and farms.
The statement added: "In the village of Fanik [as transliterated], so far,
400 cases of poisoning have been recorded -- most of which are in a
critical condition. The Kurdish authorities, however, have shown no
interest. The matter has gone as far as affecting the physician of the only
hospital in the village, who died of poisoning yesterday morning.
"We appeal to you and to the international conscience to intervene in order
to put an end to this genocide against a peaceful sect which has never
harmed anyone or interfered in other people's affairs, and has only
practiced its religious rites which are peaceful in their nature. The
Yazidi sect is the only remnant of the religious and ethnic groups of the
Sumerian civilization. Its rites contain all the meanings and elements of
the ancient civilization of the 2 rivers.

Since yesterday numerous people have been admitted to the hospital of Dhawk
Province from the Khank assembly, which is close to Dhawk city. 300-400
cases of poisoning arrived at the hospital from the Khank assembly, which
is inhabited by a majority of Yazidis.
It is believed that terrorists poisoned the water aiming to kill Yazidis,
especially after pamphlets were posted on the walls of Mosul and other
places by terrorists.

[Neither of these articles gives any details about the clinical signs and
symptoms. However, clearly there is some time of mass poisoning. Whether it
is intentional -- as something being put in the water as an act of
terrorism, or through an outbreak of an infectious disease -- is unclear. -
