The Zambian government will allow trophy hunters to kill 2000 hippos in a 5-year cull. In 2016, the government announced a plan to kill 400 of the animals per year, claiming there was a risk of an anthrax outbreak. They then backed down from this original plan, but animal rights campaigners claim they have restarted the cull under the guise of a wildlife management tool.

However, charity Born Free says there is no scientific evidence to support a cull, reports The Daily Mail. They say Zambia's Department of Parks and Wildlife (DNPW) has failed to provide "credible, scientific evidence to show that such an indiscriminate hippo cull of healthy animals would provide a future outbreak of anthrax. The cull has been promoted to trophy hunting companies, with one South African firm offering a 6-night expedition with '5 hippos per hunter'," reports The Daily Mail.

Hippos are classed as "vulnerable" by the World Wide Fund for Nature, and their numbers are under growing pressure in Africa.

[Such a cull was proposed back in 2016 but not followed through (13 Oct 2016 Anthrax - Zambia (07): (MU) hippopotamus, human 20161013.4557767; see other links listed in 18 Nov 2018 Anthrax - Zambia (06): (MU) hippopotamus, susp. 20181118.6152733). While of uncertain value, it may be interesting to see what happens. The only controls for this sporting effort will be other hippo herds elsewhere in Zambia, but it is doubtful that they are all at the same risk level. And then whatever happens it will be quoted to support the views of this or that commentator. If nothing else, it would be of value to get blood samples from each of the future hippos culled and have their antibody titres checked. Initially it should indicate any level of post-outbreak herd immunity, and how this might fade over time as years intervene. - Mod.MHJ
