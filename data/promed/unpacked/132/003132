BORDETELLA HOLMESII, PERTUSSIS-LIKE ILLNESS - CANADA (ONTARIO)

Drs. David Fisman and Frances Jamieson report:
"Between January and May 2007, the Ontario Central Public Health
Laboratory (CPHL) has identified 5 isolates of _Bordetella holmesii_
in individuals being tested for pertussis. An additional isolate had
been identified in August 2005. The CPHL performs parallel culture
and real-time PCR [polymerase chain reaction] (using the IS481
target) on all specimens submitted for pertussis testing, and also
serves as a reference laboratory for regional public health
laboratories. Colonies suspicious for _Bordetella_ spp. are
subcultured for purity, and then definitively identified through
direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and serum agglutination (for _B.
pertussis_ and _B. parapertussis_). Isolates that do not react with
DFA and agglutination reagents are identified by cellular fatty acid
(CFA) analysis (Sherlock, MIDI Inc, Newark, DE), and biochemical
profile. Isolates are also tested by real-time PCR for the presence
of IS481 and IS1001.
Of 6 isolates, 5 were from individuals in the Greater Toronto Area
(GTA), Canada's largest metropolitan area with a population of
approximately 5.5 million people in 2006. The 6th isolate was from an
individual in the a health region approximately 70 miles (about 113
km) northwest of Toronto. In addition to being culture-positive and
phenotypically identified as _B. holmesii_, 4 nasopharyngeal swab
specimens tested positive by PCR for IS481. PCR using the IS481
target will detect _B. holmesii_, as this organism also contains the
IS481 insertion sequence.
There were 3 male and 3 female source patients. All were adolescents
(age range 11 to 17) at the time of presentation. As such, this group
may have received primary vaccination against pertussis with a whole
cell vaccine that is believed to have been poorly immunogenic. Most
pertussis test specimens received by the laboratory are obtained from
source patients under 10 years; for example, from January 2005 to the
present the lab received 4008 pertussis specimens from children under
10, and only 615 for those aged 10 to 19. The P-value for all 6 _B.
holmesii_ isolates having come from the latter group is smaller than
0.001, and the lower bound confidence limit for the relative risk is
7.2 (the RR itself is undefined, as no isolates came from children under 10).
Primary care providers who submitted the specimens were contacted.
All 6 individuals presented with cough illness. Duration of cough
prior to presentation was 3 days to 2 weeks. Cough was described as
"slightly productive" or "wet" in 2 individuals, and dry in others.
Four individuals had a history of paroxysmal cough or coughing "until
chest was sore". No post-tussive vomiting, no whoop, and no fever
were reported in any of the 6. All 6 are reported to have had normal
physical examinations; 2 individuals had chest radiographs, both of
which were normal. It was volunteered that 2 of the cases (both in
the GTA) had history of "pertussis exposure" (at school or summer
camp). Macrolide therapy was given to 5 of the 6 (3 received
clarithromycin; 2 received azithromycin).
It is possible that _B. holmesii_ is a true cause of pertussis-like
illness, and interestingly, the link between B. holmesii and teens
has been seen in Massachusetts as well. A dispatch in Emerging
Infectious Diseases described this microorganism as being isolated
primarily from adolescents with cough (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/Ncidod/eid/vol5no3/yih.htm>).
_B. holmesii_ has also caused bacteremia in asplenic individuals (see
Shepard CW et al., Clin Infect Dis 2004; 38: 799-804).
Our identification of this microorganism has been possible due to our
laboratory's ongoing performance of both PCR and culture on submitted
specimens. We would be very interested in "comparing notes" with
colleagues in other jurisdictions in terms of their experience with
this microorganism, and their thoughts related to whether or not _B.
holmesii_ is a true pathogen. We thank ProMED-mail in advance for
consideration of posting this description, and we hope that this
stimulates discussion on ProMED-mail. We would also be delighted to
hear from colleagues directly, via e-mail.

[In the winter of 2005-6, Toronto experienced an outbreak of
pertussis (see ProMED-mail Pertussis - Canada (ON) 20060209.0431),
mainly in children under 4 years of age. The immunization status of
the cases was not specified in this report, but most of the cases
were noted to have only mild symptoms. Whether any of the cases were
due to _B. holmesii_ is not known. _B. holmesii_ was formerly
designated as nonoxidizer group 2 by the CDC (US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention), and 1st described in 1995. This organism was
initially described as causing sepsis in severely compromised
patients. However, Yih et al ( see
<http://www.cdc.gov/Ncidod/eid/vol5no3/yih.htm>) reported this
organism caused a pertussis-like illness, mainly in adolescents and
young adults in Massachusetts in 1995-8. The Massachusetts State
Laboratory found that cephalexin, the antibiotic commonly
incorporated into Bordet-Gengou and charcoal agar for the recovery of
_Bordetella_ spp. from respiratory specimens, is inhibitory for
growth of _B. holmesii_. The authors thought that this explained why
_B. holmesii_ was not isolated previously from respiratory specimens
in patients suspected of having pertussis (see Mazengia E, Silva EA,
Peppe JA, et al J Clin Microbiol 2000; 38:2330-3). Perhaps Drs.
Fisman and Jamieson could comment whether this explanation was
involved in the Toronto experience. - Mod.ML]
