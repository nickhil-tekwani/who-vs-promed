-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1957, having recently arrived to take a position at the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory in Panama City, Republic of Panama, I went into the rain forest on a local field trip. During the trip I examined an active "Bat Tree." As a consequence, I developed a case of histoplasmosis that came very close to killing me, requiring long hospitalization and recuperation. Considering the number of "Eco" trips that are now taken to Panama, Costa Rica, and similar localities, I wonder if participants do, or should receive a specific warning to avoid disturbing bats and their immediate environment.

[Histoplasmosis occurs worldwide and is endemic in the Midwestern and central United States, Mexico, Central and South America, parts of eastern and southern Europe, parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia. _H. capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_ is found in central and western Africa.

Although rare in travelers (less than 0.5 percent), inhalation of spores (conidia) found in soil contaminated with bat guano or bird droppings aerosolized during activities that disturb the contaminated soil, such as spelunking, mining, construction, excavation, demolition, roofing, chimney cleaning, farming, or gardening, can lead to clusters of cases with attack rates of greater than 50 percent. Histoplasmosis can occur among workers, as well as among persons not directly involved in the soil-disruption process, including travelers in the area because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet in air currents.

In addition to imported histoplasmosis in travelers returning home from an endemic area, immigrants or expatriates from endemic areas may experience reactivation of latent disease if they become immunosuppressed due to HIV infection or other underlying conditions (Norman FF, et al. Imported histoplasmosis: two distinct profiles in travelers and immigrants. J Travel Med. 2009 Jul-Aug;16(4):258-62).

The U.S. CDC advises that people at increased risk for severe disease, e.g., those who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or are immunosuppressed, should be advised to avoid high-risk areas, such as bat-inhabited caves (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/histoplasmosis.htm). If exposure cannot be avoided, travelers to areas of endemic histoplasmosis who visit caves or areas with high concentrations of bird or bat excrement, or who perform dust-generating activities, should be advised to decrease dust generation in infested areas by watering the areas and to wear masks and special protective equipment
