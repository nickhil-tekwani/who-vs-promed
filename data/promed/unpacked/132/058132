On 11 Oct 2019, an attending veterinarian confirmed 2 Ventura County horses tested positive for equine influenza. The 1st, a 2-year-old Warmblood gelding, experienced onset of clinical signs, including coughing, fever, and nasal discharge, on 8 Oct 2019.

The 2nd, a yearling filly, first showed clinical signs of coughing, enlarged submandibular (under the jaw) lymph nodes, fever, and nasal discharge on 9 Oct 2019.

The vaccination status of both horses is reported as unknown, and both are recovering.

Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease affecting horses, ponies, and other equids, such as donkeys, mules, and zebras. The virus is spread via saliva and respiratory secretions from infected horses. Horses are commonly exposed via horse-to-horse contact; humans picking up the virus on their hands, shoes, or clothes; tack, buckets, or other equipment; and aerosol transmission from coughing and sneezing.

Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106 deg F/41 deg C); a dry, hacking cough; depression; weakness; anorexia; serous (watery) nasal discharge; and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Consider monitoring your horse's health at shows by taking his temperature daily, which can help you pick up on signs of infection early and take appropriate measures to reduce disease spread.

Vaccination is an important and inexpensive way to protect your horse. US Equestrian requires proof horses have had an equine influenza vaccination within the 6 months prior to attending organization-sanctioned competitions or events. Your veterinarian can help you determine what other vaccines your horse might benefit from.

In addition to vaccination, following strict biosecurity protocols can help reduce your horse's chance of developing disease. Such measures include quarantining new equine arrivals at barns, disinfecting buckets and equipment, and preventing nose-to-nose contact between horses.

The Washington State Veterinarian confirmed 2 horses had tested positive for equine influenza at a premises in Spokane County, Washington, on 15 Nov 2019. The 2 horses had onset of clinical signs on 10 Nov 2019 included coughing, fever, and nasal discharge. The horses were a 7-year-old Thoroughbred gelding and a 5-year-old warmblood mare.

Both horses were reported to be undervaccinated.

The Equine Disease Communication Center noted there are multiple veterinarians at the farm. The reporting veterinarian was going to talk to management and place a quarantine as there appeared to be other horses sick after a local show.

There is an effective vaccine against this disease. Please vaccinate your horse or horses. Be aware of how to put biosecurity into place, and practice strict biosecurity. It is more than washing your hands or boots. Quarantine any new animal, or any animal who has been away and is returning to the stable. Do not allow animals to share buckets, or share any other equipment among horses. Do not allow nose to nose contact as this can pass the disease easily. Be cautious of going to shows/exhibitions/rodeos/hunts, etc., and assess the risk before going. - Mod.TG]
