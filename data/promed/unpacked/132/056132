Farm Worker Illness Following Exposure to Carbofuran and Other Pesticides --
Fresno
County, California, 1998
In California, suspected pesticide-related illnesses and suspected
work-related illnesses and injuries are reportable conditions. On July 31,
1998, the Occupational Health Branch of the California Department of Health
Services (CDHS) received a report from the California Department of
Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) of a pesticide exposure incident in Fresno
County involving 34 farm workers. CDHS investigated this incident by
reviewing medical records of the 34 workers and interviewing 29. The
findings indicated that the workers became ill after early reentry into a
cotton field that had been sprayed with a cholinesterase-inhibiting
carbamate pesticide.
On July 31 at 4 a.m., a cotton field was sprayed aerially with a solution
containing as active ingredients 0.26% carbofuran (n-methyl carbamate),
0.05% abamectin (macrolytic lactone), and 0.05% mepiquat chloride (growth
regulator). Although carbofuran, when used on cotton, has a restricted entry
interval (REI) ** of 48 hours and requires both posting of treated fields
and oral notification of workers, neither warning was provided.
At 6 a.m., the 34 workers (age range: 13-64 years; median: 31 years) entered
the field to complete weeding begun the previous day. After weeding for
approximately 4 hours, the workers were transported to a second field 2-1/2
miles away that had been sprayed 2 days earlier with a solution containing
cyfluthrin (synthetic pyrethroid), diclofol (organochlorine), and mepiquat
chloride. The REI for these pesticides is 12 hours. Within approximately 1/2
hour of entering the second field, the workers began feeling ill and stopped
working.
Symptoms most commonly reported by the 34 farm workers were nausea (97%),
headache (94%), eye irritation (85%), muscle weakness (82%), tearing (68%),
vomiting (79%), and salivation (56%); the most commonly observed signs were
bradycardia (21%), diaphoresis (15%), and miosis (pupillary constriction)
(12%).
Thirty (88%) workers were transported immediately to a medical clinic; the
other four went home, showered, and sought medical care 3-17 days later. All
workers evaluated at the clinic were decontaminated by clothing removal and
showering and were sent to six area hospitals. Twenty-nine were evaluated
and released the same day. One worker was hospitalized overnight for
new-onset atrial fibrillation. All workers received hospital treatment for
symptoms, and most (28 {82%}) lost at least 1 day of work.

**No worker without prescribed protective clothing should enter a treated
area to perform a hand labor task until the REI expires. The length of the
REI depends on the specific pesticide but generally can be no less than 12
hours.

[MMWR Editorial Note
--------------------------------
Pesticide exposure can cause serious acute illness among farm workers. In
the
incident described in this report, workers entered a field well before the
end of a label-specified REI and incurred pesticide exposure that resulted
in moderately severe illness (as defined by the American Association of
Poison Control Centers {1}). The incident demonstrates that
1) posted and oral warnings based on the REI are necessary to prevent
illness among workers performing hand labor in fields recently treated with
pesticides and
2) failure to adhere to an REI can result in substantial morbidity among
exposed workers.
Because this incident demonstrates that sole reliance on these control
measures may be inadequate, the substitution of safer, less toxic
alternative pesticides should be adopted when feasible.
Prompt, appropriate medical attention, including decontamination by clothing
removal and showering, probably prevented more acute illness in this
incident. However, some exposed workers went home before decontamination,
increasing the potential for secondary contamination of children and other
family members. Secondary contamination can be reduced by developing in
advance appropriate procedures for decontaminating clothing, homes, and
vehicles (2). Illnesses among family members exposed to the workers were not
reported.
Although the incident involved exposure to several pesticides, the agent
with the greatest acute systemic toxicity is the broad-spectrum
insecticide/nematocide carbofuran. Carbofuran exposure was the probable
cause of illness based on biologic evidence (foliage and clothing samples
and urine metabolites), signs and symptoms of cholinergic excess (voluntary
and involuntary muscle movement, exocrine gland overactivity, and central
nervous system effects), and laboratory evidence of
cholinesterase depression. Although atrial fibrillation has been reported
with other
cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides (3), this is the first report following
carbofuran exposure.
In 1995, 248,000 lbs of cholinesterase-inhibiting carbamate pesticide were
used in California, primarily on alfafa, rice, table and wine grapes, and
cotton (4). During 1995, carbamate pesticides composed 1.8%, by weight, of
all pesticides used and alone caused 30 (1.9%) of pesticide-related
illnesses reported to CDPR.
Clinical diagnosis of carbamate toxicity is based primarily on known or
suspected history of carbamate use and presence of cholinergic symptoms and
signs (5). Isolated cases may be less recognizable, resulting in delays in
diagnosis and treatment. Because cholinesterase inhibition by carbamates is
rapidly reversible, cholinesterase testing may be unreliable in diagnosing
carbamate poisoning. The incident described in this report also illustrates
the importance of limiting the time between cholinesterase collection and
analysis, placing specimens on ice, and using the most appropriate analytic
techniques to conduct cholinesterase assays (6). Measurement of urinary
metabolites may be useful to confirm suspected carbamate-related illness,
but because this assay is highly chemical-specific and is performed only by
certain reference laboratories, it is not a practical tool for most
clinicians. Treatment of carbamate poisoning includes decontamination,
supportive care, and the use of atropine in severe exposures.
