FMD Cleared in Central Province
-------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has now been cleared in Central
Province, provincial veterinary officer Dr Mathews Kabeta has said.
Dr Kabeta said on Friday [20 May 2005] in Chibombo that the
veterinary department in the province was continuously carrying out
farmer sensitisation and vaccination programmes, which includes
dipping of animals. He, however, said corridor disease was yet to be
contained [see commentary].
"Though we have cleared FMD, there are still small traces of corridor
disease," he said.
Central and Southern provinces were hit by an outbreak of FMD in June
2004. This resulted in a ban in cattle movement to and from the 2
provinces 3 months later. The ban was only lifted on 21 Mar 2005,
though certain areas in both provinces were reported to still have
traces of the disease.

[FMD was duly reported by Zambia in its monthly reports to the OIE
during 2004. Until June, serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3 were
reported; from July onwards, only serotype SAT 1 was reportedly
recorded. Final data for 2004 and an update for the 1st semester of
2005, from all member countries including Zambia, might be expected
during the current General Session of the OIE in Paris (22-27 May
2005).
Corridor disease is a highly pathogenic disease of cape buffaloes
(_Syncerus caffer_) and cattle in eastern and southern Africa caused
by the protozoan _Theileria parva lawrencei_ and transmitted
primarily by the tick _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_; lesions and
symptoms are similar to those of East Coast fever.
Dipping cattle has no impact upon the control of FMD; however, it is
an important measure for the control of corridor disease. - Mod.AS]
