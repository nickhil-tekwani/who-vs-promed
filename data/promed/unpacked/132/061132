Re: Polk County Florida: Hepatitis A Outbreak
---------------------------------------------
[The following statement has been received from Dr. Stephen J. Nelson
regarding the second part of the ProMED-mail post: "Hepatitis A - USA:
update 20020509.4148". ProMED-mail apologizes for the error; the news
agency report was reproduced in good faith. - Mod.CP]
It was stated in the ProMED-mail post that: "Following the death of a
29-year-old woman in Bartow, Florida, from hepatitis A in February 2002,
investigators linked her death with a cook at John's Restaurant who had
also been diagnosed with the disease."
That's not accurate. The woman's death certificate does not list her death
as due to hepatitis A. The death certificate simply lists "acute renal
failure" and "hepatic failure." She had other long-standing underlying
liver problems, including alcohol abuse. Though she was positive for
hepatitis A, it is not listed as the cause of her death.
My office was not contacted (as is required by Florida law for any "disease
constituting a threat to public health") until 5 weeks after her death. By
that time she was buried in South Carolina. Without an autopsy, it is not
possible to identify which modality (hepatitis A or some other hepatopathy)
caused her death.
