Progress toward measles control - African region, 2001-2008
-----------------------------------------------------------
In 2001, the countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) African
Region (AFR) became part of a global initiative with a goal of
reducing the number of measles deaths by 50 percent by 2005, compared
with 1999. [The 46 African Region (AFR) countries are: Algeria,
Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde,
Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles,
Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland, Togo, Uganda, United Republic
of Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. - Mod.CP]

Recommended strategies for measles mortality reduction included 1)
increasing routine coverage for the 1st dose of measles-containing
vaccine (MCV1) for all children, 2) providing a 2nd opportunity for
measles vaccination through supplemental immunization activities
(SIAs), 3) improving measles case management, and 4) establishing
case-based surveillance with laboratory confirmation of all suspected
measles cases (1). Before introduction of MCV throughout AFR,
approximately 1 million measles cases had been reported each year in
the early 1980s (2). After strengthening measles-control activities,
annual reported cases declined to an estimated 300 000-580 000 during
the 1990s. This report summarizes the progress made during 2001-2008
toward improving measles control in AFR. During 2001-2008 estimated
MCV1 coverage increased from 57 percent to 73 percent, SIAs
vaccinated approximately 398 million children, and reported measles
cases decreased by 93 percent, from 492, 116 in 2001 to 32, 278 in
2008. By 2005, global measles deaths had decreased by 60 percent, and
the AFR goal had been achieved (3); AFR adopted a new goal to reduce
deaths by 90 percent, compared with 2000, and that goal was achieved
in 2006 (3,4). However, inaccuracies in reported vaccination coverage
exist, surveillance is suboptimal, and measles outbreaks continue to
occur in AFR countries. Further progress in measles control will
require full implementation of recommended strategies, including
validation of vaccination coverage.

Since the 1980s, AFR countries have reported measles vaccination
coverage and the number of measles cases each year to the WHO African
Regional Office (AFRO), using the WHO and United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) Joint Reporting Form. These data are collected through
administrative reports from routine vaccination programs and SIAs and
routine surveillance systems that provide aggregated case counts
based on clinical diagnosis. Estimates of routine coverage with MCV1
are based on review of coverage data from administrative records,
surveys, national reports, and consultation with local and regional
experts. Coverage achieved during nationwide SIAs against measles are
reported on the basis of the reported number of doses administered,
divided by the target population.

In 1999, as part of the measles mortality reduction strategy,
case-based surveillance with laboratory testing for all suspected
measles cases was introduced with support from WHO AFRO. A suspected
measles case is defined as 1) any person with generalized
maculo-papular rash and fever plus cough or coryza or conjunctivitis
or 2) any person in whom a clinician suspects measles. Each suspected
measles case should be reported using an individual
case-investigation form, and a blood specimen should be collected and
sent to the laboratory for measles-specific immunoglobulin M testing.
Laboratory confirmation of individual cases is discontinued after an
outbreak has been confirmed as measles. An outbreak is confirmed when
3 or more measles laboratory-confirmed cases are detected in a health
facility or district in 1 month; subsequent cases are confirmed by
epidemiologic link. An epidemiologic link is defined as a suspected
measles case that did not have a specimen collected for laboratory
testing and is linked in person, place, and time to a
laboratory-confirmed case (that is, in a patient living in the same
district or an adjacent district with a patient with
laboratory-confirmed measles where a likelihood of transmission and
onset of rash in the 2 patients within 30 days of each other exists)
(5). Case-based surveillance data from AFR countries are shared
regularly with WHO AFRO. Data quality is monitored using annualized
performance indicators that include the 1) percentage of districts
reporting one or more suspected case with a blood specimen (target:
greater than 80 percent) and 2) non-measles febrile rash illness rate
(target: more than 2 cases per 100 000).

Routine vaccination activities
------------------------------
In AFR, MCV1 is administered through routine services to children at
age 9 months. According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, AFR MCV1
coverage increased from 57 percent in 2001 to 73 percent in 2008. In
2008, among the 46 AFR countries, 3 (7 percent) had MCV1 coverage of
less than 60 percent, 13 (28 percent) had coverage of 60-69 percent,
11 (24 percent) had coverage of 70-79 percent, 10 (22 percent) had
coverage of 80-89 percent, and 9 (20 percent) had coverage of at
least 90 percent (data tabulated in the original text). As of 2008, 5
(10 percent) countries provided a 2nd dose of MCV (MCV2) through
routine services: South Africa and Swaziland reported MCV2 coverage
of 70 percent, Lesotho reported MCV2 coverage of 80 percent, and
Algeria and Seychelles reported MCV2 coverage of more than 95 percent
in 2008.

SIA results
-----------
SIAs provide a 2nd opportunity for measles immunization to all
children, including those not vaccinated with MCV1 and those
previously vaccinated; approximately 15 percent of children
vaccinated with a single dose at age 9 months will not develop
immunity to measles. The SIA strategy generally consists of a
one-time catch-up SIA, targeted to a wide age range, which aims to
reduce susceptibility to measles in the population. This is followed
by periodic follow-up SIAs targeting children born since the last
SIA, thus reducing the accumulation of susceptible children in new
birth cohorts.

Before 2000, 7 (15 percent) AFR countries (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe) had completed a
catch-up SIA, and Namibia and South Africa had completed a follow-up
SIA (6). By the end of 2008, 43 AFR countries (all except Algeria,
Mauritius, and Seychelles) had completed a catch-up SIA, and all but
Comoros and Guinea-Bissau had completed at least one follow-up SIA
(data tabulated in the original text). During 2001-2008,
approximately 398 million children were vaccinated during measles
SIAs in AFR: 237 million (60 percent) during catch-up SIAs in 34
countries, and 161 million (40 percent) during follow-up SIAs in 39
countries. 9 countries (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Tanzania)
conducted nationwide SIAs in phases covering different geographic
areas implemented over a period of at least 2 years.

Measles surveillance
--------------------
By December 2008, all AFR countries except Algeria, Comoros, Guinea
Bissau, Mauritius, Sao Tome & Principe, and Seychelles had
established measles case-based surveillance in accordance with the
WHO AFRO measles surveillance guidelines (5). In 2008, of the 40
countries with case-based surveillance, 21 (53 percent) met the
target of more than 80 percent of districts reporting one or more
suspected cases; 24 (60 percent) had a non-measles febrile rash
illness rate of more than 2 cases per 100 000 population; and 16 (40
percent) met both targets.

Monitoring measles incidence
----------------------------
Following implementation of the measles mortality reduction
strategies during 2001-2008, including introduction of case-based
measles surveillance, the number of reported measles cases decreased
93 percent, from 492 116 in 2001 to 32 278 in 2008 (illustrated
graphically in the original text). Average annual measles incidence
in AFR decreased 66 percent, from 50.2 per 100 000 population during
2001-2004 to 17.2 during 2005-2008 (data tabulated in the original
text). Despite this decrease, during 2005-2008, 14 countries reported
outbreaks. Outbreak field investigations conducted during 2003-2007
in South Africa (1676 cases, 2003-2005) (7), Kenya (2544 cases,
2005-2007) (8), and Tanzania (1533 cases, 2006-2007) (9) found that
failure to vaccinate was the primary cause. In 2008, outbreaks also
contributed to annual case counts in Burkina Faso (395), Cameroon
(495), the Democratic Republic of Congo (12,461), Ethiopia (3,511),
Niger (1,317), and Nigeria (9,960) (2).

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
In 2008, after implementation of the measles mortality reduction
strategy, routine measles vaccination coverage in AFR reached 73
percent, SIAs were conducted in nearly all AFR countries, and
reported measles cases decreased to a historic low of 32 278.
According to previously published WHO estimates, by 2006 AFR had
achieved approximately 90 percent reduction in measles deaths,
compared with 2000 (3). However, despite this progress, vaccination
coverage reports remain imprecise, disease surveillance remains
suboptimal, and outbreaks continue to occur, even in countries that
reported implementation of all recommended components of the measles
strategy. Available mathematical models likely overestimate the
disease burden and underreporting of measles cases is common, even
with high-performing surveillance systems; therefore, caution is
recommended when drawing comparisons between reported incidence of
measles and estimates of measles deaths generated from models.

SIAs are recommended to provide a 2nd opportunity for immunization
and increase the likelihood of vaccinating hard-to-reach children.
SIA coverage usually is estimated by an administrative method relying
on the reported number of vaccine doses administered and available
target population denominator data, both of which often are
imprecise. For example, during 2001-2008, several countries reported
vaccinating more than 100 percent of children targets in SIAs.
Improved methods for determining the actual target population size
for SIAs are needed; reported coverage also should be routinely
validated by independent surveys. In addition, detailed field
investigations of outbreaks should be undertaken to identify post-SIA
risk factors for measles, and help refine vaccination strategies.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations.
First, a change in measles surveillance methods might result in
underestimates or overestimates of the disease burden over time. For
example, in 1999, AFR countries routinely reported an aggregated
number of clinically diagnosed measles cases; however, after
implementation of measles case-based surveillance, by 2005, most
countries had changed to reporting laboratory-confirmed measles cases
(6). Second, although the case definition for suspected measles
remained the same, the change in measles reporting practices might
have led to either underreporting, because of the additional
resources needed to complete individual case investigations and
collect blood samples, or overreporting because of overall efforts to
strengthen measles surveillance.

In light of progress made toward reducing measles deaths, a more
advanced goal was proposed recently for the region with several
recommendations to improve vaccination coverage and surveillance
performance. The AFR measles technical advisory group met in May 2008
and recommended that AFR countries aim to meet the following targets
by 2012: 1) reducing estimated measles deaths by 98 percent, compared
with 2000 estimates; 2) reducing measles incidence to less than 5
cases per 1 million population per year; 3) achieving at least 90
percent routine MCV1 coverage nationwide and more than 80 percent in
all districts; 4) achieving more than 95 percent SIA coverage in all
districts; and 5) attaining 2 primary measles surveillance
performance indicator targets (a non-measles febrile rash illness
rate of more 2 cases per 100 000 population per year and one or more
suspected measles case investigated with blood specimen in more than
80 percent of districts per year); and 6) routine reporting from all
districts (10). The group also recommended that AFR countries
consider introduction of MCV2 in the routine vaccination schedule if
MCV1 coverage of more than 80 percent has been achieved and
maintained for at least 3 consecutive years and at least 1 of the 2
primary measles surveillance indicator targets has been achieved and
maintained for at least 2 years. For countries adopting a 2-dose
routine measles vaccination schedule, continued follow-up SIAs were
recommended for all new birth cohorts every 3-5 years until national
MCV2 coverage of at least 90 percent is sustained for at least 2
years (10).
