With regard to the comment "I wonder what effect the hurricane has
had on the local bird populations, remembering that passeriformes and
columbiformes are reservoir hosts of SLE (St. Louis Encephalitis),
while corvids are reservoir hosts for West Nile virus. - Mod.MS"
[from ProMED-mail post 20050914.2714], it is helpful to refer to
Komar et al., "Experimental Infection of North American Birds with
the New York 1999 Strain of West Nile Virus"
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no3/02-0628.htm>,
in which it is concluded, with respect to West Nile virus, that "An
analysis of our data shows that passerine birds, charadriiform birds,
and at least 2 species of raptors (American Kestrel and Great Horned
Owl) are more competent than species evaluated from the following
orders: Anseriformes, Columbiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes,
Piciformes and Psittaciformes. Indeed, many birds of the latter
orders were found to be incompetent for transmission."
Table 10, "West Nile virus reservoir competence index values derived
for 25 species of birds"
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no3/02-0628_tables.htm#table10>,
is particularly instructive.
