With the outbreak of epidemic dropsy in India; the Nepali government,
press, and public including medical [personnel have been alerted. More
than the alertness, there is a panic, which is understandable because
whatever is banned in India will ultimately supplied to Nepal as we have
open border with India.
[The National Food Laboratory is testing the samples of oils and have
found positive results by thin layer chromatography tests in at least 3
samples. Similar to India, the laboratory also identified some of the oils
adulterated with mineral oil.
In this context from the medical point of view, I have few questions
related with this problem:
- Is there any accepted diagnostic clinical criteria?
- Is there any laboratory test to confirm the diagnosis of Epidemic Dropsy?
or to confirm the presence of Sanguinarine or Dehydrosanguinarine?
What is the lethal dose of Argemone mexicana?
Is there any quantitative test to measure the amount of argemone oil in
mustard oil?
What is the sensitivity and specificity of:
-Nitric acid test,
-Ferric Chloride Test,
-Thin Layer Chromatography.
Is there any possibility that Thin Layer Chromatography test can detect
very minimal amount of argemone, which is not significant from public
health point of view? If so, it will be just aggravating the panic.
India has experienced couple of epidemics, so I believe there are experts
on the subject in Indian Doctors Community. I expect to receive the
information, comments.

[It appears that the problem of food adulteration may be spreading well
beyond the initial focus in Delhi. It is obviously important that those
who have been managing the problem in Delhi share what they have learned
about detection of contamination and treatment of symptoms as widely as
possible. - Mod.ES
