Over half, or 64 per cent, of the mosquitoes recently tested in the southern port city of Busan [Pusan] were found to be carrying the Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV], prompting the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [KCDC] to issue a nationwide alert late last week [week of 1 Jul 2013].

Officials say climate change is helping the virus-infected mosquitoes breed [probably referring to increased temperatures speeding larval development. - Mod.TY] Symptoms of the disease include headaches, fever, and convulsions, and in extreme cases, coma [and death]. Children are at higher risk, so officials advise parents to make sure young kids are vaccinated.

As the mosquitoes are most active until the end of October, the KCDC advises people to use mosquito nets indoors and limit the amount of time they spend outside. When outdoors, the use of long-sleeved clothing and mosquito repellent is recommended.

[Japanese encephalitis virus is endemic in the Korean Peninsula, with most human cases occurring in late summer and fall. Finding 64 per cent of the mosquitoes JEV positive this early in the season is a very high proportion. However, the total number of mosquitoes tested is not stated, so it is not possible to know if the sample is very small or large. Also, the number and distribution of the areas sampled is not stated either. Nevertheless, the virus is present in mosquito vectors so the health authorities are prudent in issuing their warning to avoid mosquito bites and for children to receive the vaccine.
