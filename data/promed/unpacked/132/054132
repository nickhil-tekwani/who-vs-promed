A comment on transmission of infection
--------------------------------------
[Dr Toovey's comment refers specifically to the observation contained in
part (4) of Richard Frankel's comments in "Respiratory infections, fatal,
gorillas - Africa (02)," stating that "CDC uses 3 feet as a guideline for
droplet transmission. Aerosol transmission is unlikely outdoors. Even if
one were concerned about aerosol transmission, one airplane study of
tuberculosis suggested that the risk is small more than 2 rows from the
index case." - Mod.CP]
Without commenting specifically on the risk of gorillas being infected by
human visitors, it is probably misleading to extrapolate from studies on
the transmission of TB and other droplet spread infections in pressurized
civilian passenger aircraft. These aircraft typically distribute air in the
passenger compartment in a laminar flow pattern, effectively limiting
distribution, unlike the situation in a near contact with a gorilla. See: A
Mangili, MA Gendreau. Transmission of infectious diseases during commercial
air travel. Lancet 2005; 365: 989-96.

re: susceptibility of apes to human pathogens
---------------------------------------------
The readers of ProMED-mail might be interested to know that a synopsis on
the matter of transmission of human pathogens to mountain gorilla's (Ape
Tourism and Human Diseases: How close should we get?) can be found at
<http://www.mountaingorillas.org/files/ourwork/Homsy_rev.pdf>.
The publication includes an overview of documented evidence of
susceptibility of apes to human pathogens.

re: recommended separation distance
-----------------------------------
I wish to respond to an issue raised in the post: "Respiratory infections,
fatal, gorillas - Africa (02) 20050719.2083." One of the questions asked by
Richard I Frankel in his comment on "Respiratory infections, fatal,
gorillas - Africa" is that: "The 7 meter distance is announced but not
observed. We were certainly closer than that much of the time. But what is
magic about 7 meters?"
For many years, the regulation distance to be maintained between gorillas
and tourists (and researchers) was 5 meters. In 1999, Jaco Homsy, MD, MPH,
carried out a Critical Review of the Rules and Regulations Governing Park
Management and Tourism for the Wild Mountain Gorilla, _Gorilla gorilla
beringei_. One of the recommendations resulting from this study was that
this distance should be increased to 7 meters: Dr Homsy's report, "Ape
Tourism And Human Diseases: How Close Should We Get?" can be downloaded
from the website of the International Gorilla Conservation Programme:

[This is the same document referred to by Dr Stenvers in the preceding
comment. It is an 86 page document that deals comprehensively with the risk
of spread of human disease to apes and, among other things, tabulates known
information on the susceptibility of apes to human viruses and vice versa.
The content is too detailed to summarize adequately here, and interested
readers should refer to the original text - Mod.CP]
