MAD PIG DISEASE (02)
====================

Subject: mad pigs: Hansen letter to Sundlof

The seven page letter putting together the scientific case for mad pig
disease (PSE) in the United States is now online at:
www.mad-cow.org/mad_pigs.html
It is fax-to-OCR and there are probably a few residual typos. I have
written some of the veterinarians mentioned in the letter and hope to post
their responses at the same URL. I don't have any particular opinion at
this point, but I can say that Hansen has put together a rather strong
letter.

[Having once been attached to what was probably THE best veterinary
pathology department for porcine neurologcal diseases as well as for other
livestock species ... the CVL at New Haw, UK, otherwise known as "Weybridge"
and please note I wrote "was". As a resident in the USA I can make no claims
for today ... I am fully aware that the pathology of neurological disease is
not simple and signs can be confusing and confluent. Also well recorded
diseases appear and disappear ... who has seen a "Rocking Horse lamb" in the
past 30 years?
So I ask that the veterinary pathologists in our membership read the above
document and maybe some will be willing to comment.
Also, these 1979 pigs were observed at a slaughter plant in Albany, NY, not
a thousand miles from a number of very competant US & Canadian veterinary
colleges. Have any pathologists from those colleges anthing to add?
