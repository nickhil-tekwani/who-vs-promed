The city of Cape Town is taking the initiative in the fight against
measles. The city has been the epicentre of a measles outbreak
affecting the Western Cape area. Over 1000 new cases have been
reported in the last 15 months. These have resulted in over a dozen
deaths including that of one adult.

The drive will seek to immunise over a million children in schools,
creches and clinics all across the city. The 1st round of the
campaign, starting next week, will focus mostly on children between
the ages of 6 months to 15 years. Officials have stressed that all
children should be brought for shots even if they are otherwise
up-to-date with their routine immunisations.

Officials have also decided to aim another round at older age groups
as there have been cases of infection reported outside the normal age
group for measles.

[The number of measles cases in Western Province has almost doubled
since the National Institute for Communicable Diseases on 12 Feb 2010
reported that there had been 517 confirmed cases of measles in the
Western Cape. The number of deaths (at least 12 children and one
adult) indicates that the outbreak is far from contained and the
prevailing situation merits the comprehensive vaccination response
envisaged. Travellers intending to visit the province, and Cape Town
in particular, should ensure that their vaccination status is appropriate.
