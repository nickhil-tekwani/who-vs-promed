Response activities
-------------------
- Lassa fever alert letters sent to States
- The national emergency operations centre alert mode level 2 activated for effective multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of Lassa fever response
- Lassa fever preparedness assessment carried out for 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT)
- State public health emergency operations centre activated in affected States
- The 7 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time
- Confirmed cases are treated at identified treatment centres across the states
- Dissemination of reviewed case management and safe burial practices guidelines
- Dissemination of reviewed IPC guidelines and health facility IPC advisory
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies
- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment
- Distribution of medical response commodities to states and treatment centres
- Deployment of national rapid response teams to Nasarawa, FCT, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Oyo, Taraba, and Benue

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only

[There were 33 new confirmed and 257 new suspected Lassa fever (LF) cases in week 10 (7-13 Mar 2022), indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is decreasing. There was one death among the confirmed cases for week 10, 2022. Fortunately, there were no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 10).

The report above confirms that Edo, Ondo, and Bauchi states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected increased to 23 so far this year (2022), and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case is 87.

Nigeria is now in a period where case numbers begin to decline. Case numbers are decreasing and likely to decrease further in the coming weeks. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred between weeks 3 and 11 in recent years and peaked in weeks 7-9 this year (2022).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn from this and previous reports that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states in Nigeria using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:

One hopes that the ongoing public information campaign will help the local population to avoid the entry of these reservoir rodents into their houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY]

[2] CDC travel advisory
Date: Sat 19 Mar 2022
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/cdc-issues-travel-notice-for-nigeria-due-to-lassa-fever-outbreak-68860/


The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issues a travel notice this week for Nigeria due to a Lassa fever outbreak in the country.

The outbreak has been reported in the following states: Ondo, Edo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Kogi, Taraba, Enugu, Benue, Gombe, Nasarawa, and Delta.

Since the beginning of the year through 13 Mar [2022], the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has reported 630 confirmed Lassa fever cases (3079 suspected cases) and 112 deaths among the confirmed cases.

Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever spread through contact with infected rodents or their urine or droppings. Lassa fever can also be spread from person to person through contact with an infected person's bodily fluids.

Symptoms of Lassa fever (fever, chills, headache, and fatigue) develop 1-3 weeks after infection. About 20% of people infected with Lassa fever develop severe illness that can lead to hemorrhaging (bleeding), respiratory distress, vomiting, facial swelling, pain in the chest, back, and abdomen, and sometimes death.

CDC advises to prevent Lassa fever, travelers to Nigeria should avoid contact with rodents, as well as food and materials that could be contaminated with rodent urine or droppings.

Travelers should seek medical care immediately if they develop (during or after travel) fever, chills, headache, bleeding, general body aches, vomiting, or trouble breathing. Treatment with an antiviral medicine called ribavirin is most effective during the early stages of illness.

[Cases of Lassa fever occur in Nigeria throughout the year, usually peaking in epidemiological weeks 3-11. This year (2022) case numbers have peaked between weeks 7-9 and currently are declining rapidly. Even though the risk of Lassa fever virus infection is less than it would have been 2-3 weeks ago, it is not zero so exercising the precautions that CDC recommends is prudent. - Mod.TY
