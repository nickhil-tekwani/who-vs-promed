Molecular identification of _Theileria_ parasites of northwestern Chinese Cervidae
----------------------------------------------------------------------
_Theileria_ and _Babesia_ protozoan parasites are transmitted mainly by tick vectors. These parasites cause heavy economic losses to the livestock industry, as well as affecting the health of wild animals in parasite-endemic areas.

Identification of infectious agents in wild animals is not only crucial for species preservation, but also provides valuable information on parasite epidemiology. Here, we conducted a molecular surveillance study in Northwestern China to assess the prevalence of blood pathogens in cervids.

Methods
-------
PCR analysis and microscopic evaluation of blood smears to detect _Theileria_- and _Babesia_-related diseases in Cervidae were conducted, in which 22 blood samples from red deer (n =22) in Qilian Mountain and 20 from sika deer (n=20) in Long Mountain were collected and tested for the presence of _Theileria_ and _Babesia_.

The 18S rRNA gene was amplified, and selected polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive samples were sequenced for species identification.

Results
-------
PCR revealed that 9.1% of the Qilian Mountain samples and 20 percent of the Long Mountain samples were positive for _Theileria uilenbergi_; 90.09 percent of the Qilian Mountain samples (n=22) were positive for _T. capreoli_, but all of the Long Mountain samples (n=20) were negative for _T. capreoli_; no other _Theileria_ or _Babesia_ species were found. PCR showed that _T. uilenbergi_ and _T. capreoli_ were present in red deer in Qilian Mountain, while only _T. uilenbergi_ was found in sika Deer in Long Mountain. The 18S rRNA gene sequences were aligned against the corresponding GenBank sequences of known isolates of _Theileria_ and _Babesia_ and subjected to phylogenetic analysis.

The phylogenetic tree showed that the newly isolated _Theileria_ spp. could be classified as belonging to 2 clades: one group belonged to the same clade as _T. uilenbergi_, the other to a clade containing _T. capreoli_.

Conclusions
-----------
Our results provide important data to increase understanding of the epidemiology of Cervidae theileriosis, and will assist with the implementation of measures to control theileriosis transmission to Cervidae and small ruminants in central China.

_Theileria_ and the closely related genus, _Babesia_, exhibit complex life cycles that involve mammalian intermediate hosts and hard ticks as the definite hosts. _Theileria_ is an obligatory intracellular parasite that infects leukocytes and erythrocytes in the intermediate host, unlike _Babesia_, which only infects erythrocytes. Several _Theileria_ and _Babesia_ parasites infect cervids.

This report represents the 1st study that looked at these pathogens in deer from northwestern China. They found _Theileria_, but failed to find evidence of _Babesia_.

In China, _T. uilenbergi_ is transmitted by the ticks _Haemaphysalis qinghaiensis_ and _H. longicornis_, while _T. capreoli_ is probably transmitted by _Ixodes ricinus_.
