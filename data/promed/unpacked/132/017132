Authorities from the Ministry of Health (MINSA) in Los Santos, Panama, today [24 Jun 2012] confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in a 39 year old woman from the Agua Buena de Canas community, Tonosi district [Los Santos province].

The confirmation was announced by Kenia Zambrano, regional MINSA Director in Los Santos, who said that the patient was in stable condition in the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital in Las Tablas city.

This is the 8th case registered in the Los Santos province so far in 2012. The 1st 5 cases of the disease were registered in January, then one reported in February, followed by another in March, and then this last confirmed case in June. Coincidentally, all the cases have been registered in Tonosi district, but the authorities have not established, or at least not stated, the possible relationship among them.

According to specialized technical literature, hantaviruses are a genus of an RNA virus group that are transmitted by infected rodents and generally produce 2 types of disease: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or pulmonary syndrome [this latter in the Americas].

[The hantavirus most likely responsible for these cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20081027.3389, hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease. Fortunately, this latest individual is in stable condition and, one hopes, will survive.
