Center for Health Protection (CHP), Hong Kong investigates case of mad honey poisoning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [22 Dec 2022] investigating a case of mad honey poisoning, and reminded the public to buy honey from a reliable source or apiary.

The 28-year-old male patient developed bradycardia, hypotension, abdominal pain, dizziness, nausea and vomiting around 2.5 hours after consuming honey on 17 Dec 2022. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital on the same day [17 Dec 2022] and was admitted for treatment. The patient was in a stable condition and was discharged on 19 Dec 2022. His clinical diagnosis was mad honey poisoning.

Grayanotoxin was detected in the honey remnant and the patient's urine sample upon testing.

Initial enquiries revealed the patient brought the home-made honey from Nepal. Investigations are ongoing.

"Mad honey poisoning is caused by ingestion of honey containing grayanotoxins derived from plants belonging to the Ericaceae family, including rhododendrons. Grayanotoxins are neurotoxins which can affect nerves and muscles. Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, weakness, excessive perspiration, hypersalivation and paraesthesia shortly after ingestion. In severe cases, hypotension, bradycardia or shock may occur," a spokesman for the CHP explained.

Members of the public are reminded to take heed of the following preventive advice:
• Buy honey from a reliable source or apiary;
• Discard honey with a bitter or astringent taste -- grayanotoxin-containing honey may cause a burning sensation in the throat; and
• Pay special attention to honey from Nepal and the Black Sea region of Turkey as there have been grayanotoxin poisoning cases connected with honey from these areas.

[As mentioned in the article the toxic agent is grayanotoxin and it is most often found in the common plants and their varieties of rhododendron. Some of those varieties of the rhododendron species include _R. luteum_, _R. ponticum_, and _R. simsii_.

Rhododendrons are evergreen flowering plants that grow in temperate, mountainous areas around the world, and contain chemicals called grayanotoxins.

Grayanotoxins are neurotoxic compounds which are cyclic diterpenes. These exist in varying concentrations and varieties, depending on the particular rhododendron species and the time of year. More than 25 types of grayanotoxins exist in the various rhododendron cultivars and species. These chemicals make their way into the honey of bees feeding primarily on rhododendrons during the late spring or early summer in many regions around the world.

Grayanotoxins, regardless of how they are consumed, in honey or as part of the plant causes a change in the human body by binding to voltage-gated sodium ion channels in cells. This keeps the channels from closing.

This can result is a state of depolarization where the sodium ions are flowing freely into the cells, and thus, calcium influx is on the rise. The increase in calcium stimulates the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine excess causes a cholinergic syndrome. This is a set of symptoms known by their toxicology acronym, SLUDGE: Salivation, Lacrimation (crying, tearing), Urination, Defecation, Gastrointestinal distress, and Emesis (vomiting). In lower or low moderate doses, it's known to cause heart rate and blood pressure to drop, and in high enough doses it could kill you, though there seem to be few reported cases of death from mad honey in the literature. However, these situations can turn serious quite quickly and require medical care. Please use only known sources of honey from sources who are aware of the toxicities from these plants.

In very small amounts grayanotoxin can cause hallucinations and in some countries it is sought out for this reason. This is practiced in some countries but is uncontrolled and can result in toxicities and death.

Medically, trials have suggested grayanotoxin-containing preparations could help with hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and even cold sores. This is still very experimental and under investigation. It is unwise to attempt to treat anything with an unknown dose or concentration. - Mod.TG
