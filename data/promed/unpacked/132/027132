[Measles] has been controlled in the country for 20 years, and it is possible that its return is due to the suspension of vaccinations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bolivia registered its 3rd measles case in the Santa Cruz region, the largest in the country, and now there are 3 suspected cases, and so the health authorities initiated a checkup of neighborhoods in this city.

The Director of Departmental Health Services (SEDES), Marcelo Rios, said this Saturday [28 Nov 2020] in a press conference that the 3rd case is a 16-month-old boy who was medically attended to this past week in a regional health center.

The child presented with symptoms such as fever and dehydration, so tests were carried out to determine the diagnosis, and on Friday [27 Nov 2020] the laboratory results confirmed this as a measles case, according to Rios.

"This is the 3rd case in the country after 20 years of controlling the disease," stated the director.

The child's case worsened because he presented with "moderate malnutrition," and there are 3 suspected cases for which the authorities are "doing an investigation. They will do chronological follow up for the past 2 weeks in order to find the focus of infection," said Rios.

The other 2 cases were reported in April [2020], the 1st was a pregnant woman who was part of Santa Cruz's health personnel, and the 2nd was a child who the doctor attended to who it is believed infected the woman.

The director explained that this disease is highly contagious, and just one ill person can infect up to 18 people, so epidemiological surveillance is being activated, with checkups in the neighborhood of the house of the recently diagnosed child.

This Saturday [28 Nov 2020], at least 242 blocks were checked to detect possible cases and also to vaccinate children who have not yet been vaccinated; there are at least 10 000 doses [available], said the director. Also, all personnel in contact with the child and all the children admitted to this hospital were vaccinated, Rios stated.

Measles is a viral disease that can be transmitted by droplets suspended in air expelled from the noses or mouths of infected people.

In Bolivia, the last measles case was reported in 2000.

[It is unfortunate to learn that measles has returned to Bolivia after such a lengthy absence. The prompt response in follow up to the recent case is encouraging, and one hopes it will detect any additional cases that may be occurring and identify areas where vaccination can take place.

The adult case that was diagnosed in April 2020 was a 29-year-old pediatrician who had been vaccinated as a child (see Measles update (13): corr. 20200428.7273471). In that posting, Mod.LK noted that published medical research indicates that vaccine failure due to waning immunity can occur, despite multiple doses of measles vaccine. Measles vaccine-acquired immunity is reported to wane in at least 5 percent of cases within 10 to 15 years after vaccination. Moreover, exposure to natural measles may be necessary for the maintenance of protective antibodies in vaccinated persons.

The Vaccine Research Group at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic reports that up to 10 percent of persons who receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine "fail to develop protective humoral immunity, and those antibody levels wane over time, which can result in infection" (National Vaccine Information Center https://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Measles/measles-vaccine-effectiveness.aspx).

The decline in measles vaccination in Bolivia and around the world is understandable in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic that is taking all the attention of care providers and supporting laboratories. However, the decline in measles vaccination began before the pandemic. It would be important to understand where the barriers are to effective vaccination that would bring coverage up to the needed 95% of the population. One hopes that once the current COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, attention and efforts will again turn to bringing the percentages of children vaccinated up to the levels necessary to avoid cases and outbreaks of that disease. - Mod.TY
