[On 25 Nov 2014, India reported an event of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the state of Kerala. HPAI serotype H5N1 was identified. To date, 4 outbreaks have been reported and all affected birds were ducks -- susceptible: 387 928; cases: 18 554; deaths: 18 554; destroyed: 369 374.

The updated data and map are available in the last follow-up report sent to the OIE on 17 Dec 2014; see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000016766_20141217_164912.pdf.

Regarding the current report, it would be interesting to know the exact avian species that was affected. Based on a report from the media: "Bird flu has been confirmed in one of the 30 domesticated geese that died at Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh. Of the 6 samples sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory in Bhopal, one has tested positive for the dreaded avian influenza (H5N1). The Bhopal lab has communicated its findings to the Chandigarh-based northern region office of the Central Poultry Development Organisation. The samples were sent to Bhopal after more than 2 dozen geese (ducks) had died under mysterious circumstances at the lake in the past 2 weeks. Sources in the Department of Animal Husbandry (under the Ministry of Agriculture) told The Tribune that some samples (from Chandigarh) had tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1." Also included is a photograph of the dead goose found at Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh. See media report at http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dead-goose-tests-positive-for-bird-flu-in-chandigarh/19605.html.

However, the official report sent to the OIE mentions that the species affected in this event are "ducks in captivity". While ducks and geese belong to the same phylogenetic order (Anseriformes) and family (Anatidae), neither swans nor geese are considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck). Geese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe Anserini of the family Anatidae. This tribe comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese), Branta (the black geese) and Chen (the white geese) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose).

Clarity on what species was actually affected would be useful to have.
