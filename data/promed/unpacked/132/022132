Comment
-------
Screening before travel might miss people who reactivate their hypnozoites
due to their travel (stress). Dr. R. Behrens/London has done interesting
work about the impact of travel on reactivation of malaria, which he
reported upon at CISTM 5 (Geneva 1997) and CISTM 6 (Montreal 1999).
Awareness focused on partially immune and therefore probably asymptomatic
patients should be raised in all people providing health care to refugees or
asylum seekers from highly endemic malaria areas.

[Yes, I heard the presentation in Venice and it is an interesting
hypothesis. What I pointed out in the previous posting was that most
immigrants from a highly endemic area in tropical Africa would be parasite
positive, and it would be relevant to diagnose and treat all upon arrival
instead of waiting until they fell sick, probably outside the centre of
arrival where adequate facilities and expertise for diagnosis and treatment
would be difficult to find. - Mod.EP
