[I have been sitting on this, hoping that we would get a report from the
field on the final diagnosis. Since we have not, here is some more
information. - Mod.JW
Mycotoxins (like aflatoxin) can grow in various nuts and seeds. An
excellent summary of Mycotoxins can be obtained from CAST -- the Council
for Agricultural Science and Technology in Ames, Iowa (515-292-2125). It
costs $15.00 but is well worth it; it was edited by the top US
mycotoxicologist, Dr. John L. Richard, Ph.D, now emeritus, but available at
314-583-8600. Dr. Richard is updating this monograph to include newer
mycotoxins (like that of _Stachybotrys atra_).
The definitve text on "Fungi on Plants and Plant Products in the United
States" is also available through APS Press (The American Phytopathological
Society, St. Paul, MN. (sorry, no e-mail or telephone). This gicondous
work is over 1,200 pages, and lists mycotoxins. Both CAST and APS are
somewhat dated (i.e. 1989).
For general interest/update, please see "Mycotoxins and Public Health: A
Review", J. Public Health Management Practice, 1997, 3(3), 61-69, by
Malloy, CD and Marr, JS.
[Regarding the alternative diagnosis wouldn't organophosphates and
carbamates (in addition to causing diarrhea) produce tell-tale mydriasis,
excess sweating, bradycardia, etc ... that would have overshadowed the GI
symptoms?
