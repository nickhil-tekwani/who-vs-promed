The Health Department is reminding people to take extra care to avoid
mosquito bites following a number of confirmed cases of mosquito borne
viruses across the state [Western Australia].

There has been Murray Valley encephalitis again detected in the
Kimberley and Kunjin virus in the Wheatbelt. There have also been
confirmed cases of Ross River and Barmah viruses found between Perth
and the south-west.

Medical entomologist Peter Neville says people need to be alert. "All
of these diseases [virus infections] can have numerous symptoms
including muscle aches, joint aches, headaches, and some of them can
potentially be fatal," he said.

Mr Neville says there are a number of steps that can be taken to
prevent being bitten. "People don't need to alter any holiday plans
over the Christmas period, but it's important to avoid outdoor
exposure around dawn and dusk," he said. "Wear protective long loose
fitting clothing and also apply personal repellents containing DEET or
picaridin."

[No mention is made of unusual rainfall in Western Australia in the
above report. However, mosquito populations are increasing with the
onset of summer weather, bringing the increased risk of the
mosquito-borne viruses mentioned above. Vector control across this
large area would likely be impractical, so avoidance of mosquito bites
is a prudent way to avoid infection. These viruses are widely
distributed across the southern Australian states, where human and
equine cases occur. The last reported Western Australia cases were
reported in April this year (2011) (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110414.1173).
