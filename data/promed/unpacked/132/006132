Dr. Jose Mendoza, Health and Social Development Vice-Minister, denied the
information given by the Mayor of Guanare, Mr. Rafael Calles, who stated
that 8 persons died in his community because of yellow fever.
The Health Officer reiterated that only 5 persons had a positive diagnosis
for yellow fever in Portuguesa State, and that 3 of them died. "This is the
official statement" he said.
Dr. Mendoza recalled that "2 weeks ago an outbreak was reported, and since
then, no new cases have been detected. This outbreak did not expand, and
all the State population had been vaccinated."
He also pointed out that investigations are still being carried out and
that it is possible that another positive case may be found when the
investigation is over, "but in case we learn of another affected person,
he/she will be counted as part of the past outbreak that we already
controlled."
Last reports from the Ministry of Health and Social Development indicate
that there are 5 confirmed cases of yellow fever, 9 cases that had been
ruled out and 3 cases that are still under investigation. "In the next few
days results will be available", said Dr. Mendoza.
Dr. Mendoza emphasized that the Panamerican Health Organization states that
Venezuela is a model country for yellow fever control, since in 2001 an
epidemiological surveillance system for febrile illnesses accompanied by
jaundice was implemented, and thanks to this it was possible to detect
yellow fever cases throughout Venezuela.
"The point is that from the late 70s until the late 90s no epidemiological
surveillance for yellow fever was carried out, since the public health
system was being [dismantled]; but now we do not only detect such cases,
but we are also capable of effectively managing any outbreak," he said.
The officer recalled that in 2003 Colombia had a sanitary emergency due to
yellow fever, and more than 100 persons were reported as affected.
"Venezuela was able to effectively control the situation, and they also
offered vaccines to their neighboring country."
Dr. Mendoza reiterated: "We deny the information given by the Mayor of
Guanare. We also remind [the public] that the Ministry of Health and Social
Development is the only institution capable of reporting and verifying
(yellow fever) cases".
Rafael Rangel National Hygiene Institute, an institution attached to the
Ministry of Health and Social Development, is the site where diagnostic
testing for all yellow fever suspected cases is performed, and it is
capable of ruling out or confirming this condition.
It is worth remembering that yellow fever, leptospirosis, dengue fever and
Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever are endemic in Portuguesa State; therefore,
suspected cases require a thorough clinical and epidemiological assessment.
People who need to travel to this area or to any other endemic area, such
as Bolivar or Amazonas states, must be vaccinated before traveling.

[The statement by the ministerial health authorities of a country -- rather
than another source within the same country -- should be authentic,
reliable and authoritative. The current official announcement by Health and
Social Development Vice-Minister of Venezuela was meant to correct the
inaccurate death figures given recently by the Mayor of Guanare (see also:
