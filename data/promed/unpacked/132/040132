The Dagestan News Agency has reported that according to
Rospotrebnadzor [the Federal Service for Customer Protection and
Human Welfare], 15 human rabies cases were registered in Russia
during 11 months of 2010. Similarly, there were also 11 human rabies
cases in the preceding year (2009). The main reasons for development
of clinical signs of rabies in humans were refusal of immunization
due to ignorance of its necessity, or incompletion of the vaccination
schedule, or its disruption by irregular behavior during immunization
(such as a consequence of alcoholism).

The sole human rabies case in Dagestan in 2010 was a visitor from
Kalmykia who sought treatment at a hospital in Makhachkala [the
capital of Dagestan] after signs and symptoms of rabies virus
infection were apparent. Another rabies case was registered in a
resident of Dagestan who had been visiting the Yamalo-Nenets
Autonomous Okrug [The location of this region can be viewed at
<http://www.russianlessons.net/russia/yamalo-nenets/>. - Mod.CP]. The
epidemiological investigation of both cases identified bite by a
domestic dog as the source of the infection. In both cases, the dogs
died soon after the attacks. These circumstances are indicative of
general lack of rabies risk awareness in the population of Dagestan.

18 territories in Dagestan were designated rabies high-risk areas in
2010. This represents an increase of 8 territories since 2009. In
66.7 percent of animal rabies cases, farm livestock were involved,
16.7 percent of cases were stray cats, 11.1 percent of cases were
wild animal (wolves, foxes) and 5.6 percent of cases involved
domestic dogs. A total of 5998 people sought prophylactic rabies
immunization in 2010 (221.2 per 100 000 population) compared with
7207 people in 2009 (268.1 per 100 000 population).
