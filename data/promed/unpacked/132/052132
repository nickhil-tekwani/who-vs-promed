A 27 year old man in eastern Cambodia has died of bird flu [avian influenza
A(H1N1) virus infection], the country's 1st fatality this year [2010] and
its 8th since the virus started to sweep through Asia almost 7 years ago.

Cambodia's Health Ministry said in a statement issued jointly on Wed 21 Apr
2010 with the World Health Organization that the man in Prey Veng province
had died on Sat 17 Apr 2010. It was the country's 10th human case of the
disease.

The statement says there have been 494 laboratory-confirmed cases of the
disease in 15 countries since 2003, with 293 fatalities. The Cambodian
man's death was the 11th worldwide this year [2010].

The Health Ministry said it was investigating the case, and stepping up a
campaign for preventative health measures.

Another Cambodian man was killed by bird flu virus [avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection], still a threat to this impoverished South East
Asian nation, WHO and Cambodian health minister warned on Wed 21 Apr 2010.

A 27 year old Cambodian, from the eastern province of Prey Veng, died on 17
Apr 2010 as a result of respiratory complications after contracting [avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection], according to a joint statement seen by
DAP.

The government urged the locals to report suspicious deaths of poultry to
the assigned contact persons so that the experts could take initial
preventative action before escalating. "Avian influenza H5N1 is still a
threat to the health of Cambodians. I urge communities to be on the
look-out for sick poultry and to report poultry die-offs to the ministry of
health and agriculture hotlines so that they can be investigated before
people start to get sick," said health minister Mam Bun Heng in a joint
statement with WHO.

The latest death brought the country's death toll from the deadly virus to
8 out of the 10 confirmed cases of H5N1, said the release. The ministry of
health's officials are now sending experts to the affected area to conduct
an investigation to identify the man's close contacts and to initiate
preventative treatment as required, it said. "Health officials are also
coordinating with the ministry of agriculture, forestry and fisheries teams
who are investigating possible poultry deaths in the area," said the press
release.

[There have been relatively few human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus infection in Cambodia up to the present, but mortality has been high
(80 per cent). There were 4 cases in 2005, 2 cases in 2006, and single
cases in 2007, 2008, 2009 and now in 2010. All the cases in 2005, 2006 and
2007 were fatal, and the single case recorded this year [2010] also had a
fatal outcome.
