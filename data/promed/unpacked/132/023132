Grey-Bruce public health officials are trying to find a link in a
cluster of genetically similar cases of _E. coli_ 0157 which has
sickened 8 people over the past several weeks.

"We're looking at their food history, where they've been traveling,
some of their activities in order to determine if there's any linkage
between the cases. At this point, we have not been able to identify
any particular link," Angela Newman, program manager at the Grey Bruce
Health Unit, said Mon 22 Aug 2011.

The people who have contracted the bacteria, the same type of _E.
coli_ that caused the 2000 tainted water tragedy in Walkerton
(Ontario), range in age from 6 to 85. Some of the victims are still in
hospital, but are "on the mend," Newman said. Some were "pretty ill."

No new cases have been reported to public health since the 13-14 Aug
2011 weekend. Newman said the cases are considered a "cluster" because
the bacteria are genetically the same in each case. The cases have all
been reported to public health by physicians in the area, with the 1st
report made in early July 2011.

"It's not as if we have everybody in the same household, or a daycare,
or everybody attended a wedding, or something like that. It's people
that live in different areas, some actually live outside of the
Grey-Bruce area. We're just looking at those other things they may
have in common," Newman said. The health unit has been looking for
links for about a week, she said.

"It's more cases than we normally see," she said. "When you have more
cases, you need to look into it and see if there's some kind of event
happening that's causing it or is it just sporadic cases that are
happening at the same time."

[It is not stated, and probably not the case, whether the outbreak
strain here is identical to the veal liver strain. Although no link
between cases has been so far elucidated, there is one waiting to be
found. Although initially linked only to undercooked ground beef,
outbreaks of this organism have been associated, among vehicles, with
fresh produce such as sprouts, tomatoes, strawberries, and spinach;
waterborne outbreaks from potable water or lakes and streams; and
petting zoos without the direct ingestion of food or water.

With regard to fresh fruits and vegetables that are eaten without
cooking, it is often said that aggressive washing and/or surface
decontamination will markedly minimize the number of cases. This may
not be entirely true as increasing evidence has been reported that
enteric pathogens such as _E. coli_ O157 and _Salmonella enterica_
serotypes can be internalized. As an example, Deering and colleagues
(1) have recently reported the internal location of _E. coli_ O157
with bacterial growth in many parts of the mung bean plant after a
brief seed contamination event. The same group of investigators have
reviewed the topic related to _E. coli_ O157 and salmonellae (2).
