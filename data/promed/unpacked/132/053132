Wildlife researchers want to know what's killing thousands of walleye
in Lake Erie that have been washing up on beaches along its western
shore.

It's a big concern for anglers who come from across the Midwest and
beyond to catch the lake's most popular sport fish.

The best guess is that the die-off can be blamed on natural causes
stemming from the stress of spawning and the cold, stormy spring, said
Roger Knight, Lake Erie fisheries program manager for the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources.

"It all kind of fits that picture," he said. The worst is likely
over, said Knight, who flew over the lake earlier this week and didn't
see a huge number of dead fish. "It probably started a while ago," he
said. It's difficult to know how many walleye have died, but Knight
estimated it was in the thousands based on phone calls coming into his
office. Most have been around the Lake Erie islands and between Toledo
and Port Clinton.

Whatever is killing them isn't a danger to people who catch and eat
walleye out of the lake, Knight added.

The walleye may be one of the most important resources for towns
along Lake Erie's western shore.

Fishing brings in close to USD 500 million in spending on equipment,
food, fuel, and hotels, according to the American Sportfishing
Association. This weekend [14-15 May 2011], about 250 professionals
and amateurs are participating in a tournament in Port Clinton.

Towns celebrate the tasty fish in a variety of ways. In Port Clinton,
they lower a fiberglass walleye from a crane every New Year's Eve, and
Toledo's minor league hockey team is called the Walleye.

That's why any sign of trouble for the walleye is taken seriously
along Lake Erie.

"When you see 6 or 8 [dead] fish in a certain area, that's not
right," a professional angler from Minnesota told The News-Herald of
Port Clinton. Charter captain Dave O'Neal told the newspaper his
customers were concerned.

Knight doubts the die-off will have any lingering effect on the
lake's walleye population. There are about 20 million walleye in Lake
Erie, and up to 30 percent can die in year, he said.

Most of the dead walleye have a lot of fungus, another sign that is
typical after spawning, Knight said. Walleye expend a lot of energy
during spawning, and that leaves them vulnerable to disease and death,
he said.

Researchers also are testing the fish for viruses to determine if
that could be the cause, he said.

[Walleye are very tasty fish, and do indeed represent big business in
the sportfishing and tourism industries. However, it may be that they
are an eye into the health of Lake Erie.

In all likelihood it is post spawning stress. Diseases would more
likely affect a number of other species as well.

We look forward to what the researchers and the diagnosticians have
to say.
