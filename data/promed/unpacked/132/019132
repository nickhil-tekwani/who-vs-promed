There are 12 confirmed cases legionnaires' disease in 8 men and 4 women
aged from 36 to 76 years (median age 55 years), associated with an outbreak
in Hereford, in the west of England, close to the Welsh border (1). Dates
of onset of illness range from 8 Oct to 9 Nov 2003. One 76-year-old man has
died. Cooling towers and other aerosol generating equipment are being
sampled and treated. An outbreak investigation is underway.
Any cases of legionnaires' disease with onset since 1 Oct 2003, in patients
who visited Hereford in the 14 days before onset, should be reported to

3 new cases of Legionnaires' disease
---------------------------------------
3 new cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed during an outbreak
in Hereford, bringing the total number of infected patients to 15. Health
officials said the increase in cases on Fri, 14 Nov 2003 was "consistent
with the incubation period of this infection".
They said the heightened state of awareness among local GPs and hospital
staff was helping to diagnose and treat cases quickly. The latest cases are
a woman aged in her 90s, a man in his 60s and a man in his 70s.
Vigorous efforts to identify the source of the outbreak continue across the
Hereford region with investigations centered on a cooling tower at a
Bulmers' cider plant in the city. Initial tests raised the suspicions of
health officials hunting for the source of the outbreak.
Bulmers said there was no direct evidence linking the outbreak to the
company and added there was no risk to the public from drinking its products.
Herefordshire Council said more tests were being carried out to try to find
out whether the Legionella bug was present at Bulmers. But it said that,
even if Legionella was confirmed, it did not necessarily link Bulmers to
the current outbreak.
Dr Mike Deakin, county public health director said: "The possible
identification of a potential source does not change our approach.
Investigations will continue and our advice to people in Herefordshire does
not change. We would remind everyone that Legionnaires' disease cannot be
passed from person to person and it is safe to visit Hereford."
Bulmers said it was co-operating fully with the task force investigating
the outbreak in Hereford.
The firm said an evaporation unit had been closed as a result of the
samples taken from the cooling tower. It said this was only a precautionary
measure.

[Indeed, even if _Legionella pneumophila_ bacilli are isolated from an
evaporation unit or other aqueous reservoir, the finding does not establish
cause and effect unless the typing of the strain is identical to the
culture strain. - Mod.LL]
