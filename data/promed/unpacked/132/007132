The Philippine Health Secretary has announced that dengue fever in the
Philippines has killed 300 people dead and affected 19 000 so far. He
further suggested that the peak incidence has passed, in the months of
August and September.
The Philippines declared an epidemic of dengue fever in five areas last
month after the disease killed more than 200 people.
The health department also classified 18 other areas, including the capital
Manila, as "hot spots" but not epidemic zones.
The Secretary said that despite the decreasing number of new dengue fever
cases, the health department was intensifying its anti-mosquito information
campaign. He said government hospitals have been asked to be prepared to
deal with dengue fever victims.
