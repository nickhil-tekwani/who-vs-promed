ZURICH, Switzerland -- A Swiss cat could be suffering from an illness
related to BSE, possibly from eating contaminated cat food. The 6-year-old
cat's condition, known as feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE), is the
first case in Switzerland, Swiss authorities told Reuters.
A total of 90 such cases are known in Britain, with the first registered in
1990, they said.
While the exact cause of the 6-year-old cat's condition is unknown,
authorities assume the cat was infected after eating food containing raw or
insufficiently heated animal brain tissue or bone marrow. The cat was put
down because it was suffering from severe disorders of its central nervous
system. The FSE case was diagnosed at the animal neurology centre of the
University of Berne.
In Norway a cat was found to be suffering from the disease in 1995 and
Liechtenstein had one case in 1996, they said. Several big cats in zoos
like pumas, tigers, and lions, have also been diagnosed with the illness in
other countries, authorities said. They said the disease could not spread
from cats to humans and noted that no cases had been detected in dogs.
Meat and bone meal (MBM) is an inexpensive source of protein made from
ground-up cattle and other types of livestock, and not always separated by
species. Experts say as long as the BSE does not affect the animals used to
make MBM, the material is safe in food for cats and dogs. In Europe, MBM is
believed to have transmitted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) after
infected cattle were ground up and mixed into feed for herds in Britain and
on the continent.

[The continuation of FSE in the UK after domestic catfood producers had
removed CNS tissues from the mix was traced to imported catfood from
Europe; see above postings. One must ask why this Swiss cat was diagnosed
correctly and why only one case. And French cats have been exposed,
presumably, and elsewhere. It is of interest that dogs, on much the same
diet, continue to fail to demonstrate a CSE. Maybe they do but never meet a
neuropathologist. - Mod.MHJ
