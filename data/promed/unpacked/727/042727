Four mountain lions in north west Wyoming have died of bubonic plague,
prompting specialists to warn people of the risks to hunters and domestic
cat owners.
A female cougar and its kitten found dead this fall tested positive for the
disease, and a 3rd lion died of the plague in the greater Yellowstone area.
A 4th cougar died of the plague in 2005. The mountain lions were all
collared and part of a research project.
Ken Mills, a professor in the University of Wyoming College of
Agriculture's Department of Veterinary Sciences, said researchers aren't
sounding alarm bells just yet, but want people to be aware the disease is
out there if they or cats exhibit symptoms. The disease is treatable by
antibiotics. "Is this an indication we have a more active plague at this
time? It could be," Mills said.
People and cats get the bubonic plague mainly through flea bites, where the
flea has been infected by biting an infected rodent, such as a prairie dog,
gopher, or squirrel. Infected people and cats have swollen lymph nodes and
a fever. The disease can also be pneumonic, which tends to be much more
serious, and is exhibited by respiratory infection. People catch that
plague by directly breathing in the bacteria from infected cats that are
coughing and sneezing, Mills said.

are also called pumas, or mountain lions, but all are _Puma concolor_. The
bacterial agent responsible for plague is _Yersinia pestis_. If these
animals are dying of this disease, then the disease is out there and owners
should keep an eye on their pets, especially cats, for any swellings. Most
often the swellings will be around the jaw line or neck. - Mod.TG]
