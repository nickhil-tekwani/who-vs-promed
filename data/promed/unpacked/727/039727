A virus which is potentially deadly to rabbits has been discovered in animals in Northern Ireland. Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus 2 (RHDV2) was detected in samples from 2 rabbits which were submitted for testing on [23 Jun 2020]. Testing was carried out by the government-supported Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI).

While the disease is contagious between rabbits, it cannot be spread to humans.

Neil Reid, a senior lecturer in conservation biology at Queen's University, said it was likely the disease was widespread across the island of Ireland.

A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Environment, and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said the disease had also been detected during testing in 2019, with one sample returning a positive result out of 3 rabbits which were submitted under passive surveillance. Passive surveillance refers to a system where cases are brought to the attention of the department by people dealing with animals, rather than the disease being searched for.

It was the 1st time the virus had been discovered in Northern Ireland. It was also found in the Republic of Ireland last year [2019]. In a response to a parliamentary question, the then Irish Minister for Culture, Heritage, and the Gaeltacht Josepha Madigan said the virus is "known to be highly contagious" and that "environmental contamination presents significant difficulties in terms of any biosecurity responses".

Speaking to BBC News NI, Dr. Reid said: "We have poor data by which to track change in rabbit and hare numbers in Ireland but mammal sightings during the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) suggest rabbits may have declined by 32% in Northern Ireland and 64% in Great Britain since the mid-1990s.

"Irish hares are also susceptible to RHDV2. Their numbers declined substantially throughout the 20th Century and are now comparatively low at 3 hares per sq.km." Dr. Reid said the decline in numbers was likely due to a combination of factors, including other diseases like myxomatosis in rabbits, land use change, farming practices and potentially climate change.

"We don't know the demographic impact of RHDV2 on rabbit and hare populations in Ireland as it has only been detected recently, but there is evidence of further localised declines in numbers in Great Britain," he said. "Rabbits and hares sit in the middle of the food chain and would be eaten by many predators, so change in their numbers has ecological consequences.

"RHDV2 infected rabbits may die in their warrens and may not be found, whilst people finding carcasses aboveground may not necessarily submit them for testing as few are aware of the disease. I suspect RHDV2 is present throughout Ireland and is likely to have been present before recent detections."

Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus, the virus from which this strain is derived, was 1st discovered in China in 1984. According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), RHDV2 was 1st found in France in 2010, and has become the prevalent strain of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease in Europe. In the 10 years since the discovery of RHDV2 it has "rapidly spread to Europe and Mediterranean basin causing significant losses in farmed and wild rabbits in many countries".

Symptoms may include lethargy, loss of weight, and bleeding from the nose and mouth. The virus is known to spread in both domestic and wild rabbits, and has also been found to have jumped species to hares.

Last year [2019], the disease was linked to the deaths of hares in England.

A spokesperson for DAERA told BBC News NI that RHDV2 is not a notifiable disease in Northern Ireland - meaning by law it is not required to be reported to the department. "As such, there is no active surveillance programme undertaken by the department," the spokesperson said. "However, given it is a World Organisation for Animal Health notifiable disease, should RHDV2 be confirmed through passive surveillance or reporting, DAERA reports it to OIE.

"Members of the public, particularly farmers, landowners, vets and pet owners are asked to be alert to any signs of disease in animals and should advise local DAERA Divisional Veterinary Office if they suspect any signs of disease in animals."

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes. Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

RHD-2 is a variant form of the original RHD-1 virus and differs in the following ways.

- Rabbits infected with the RHD-2 virus typically DO NOT show the symptoms that are common with RHD-1 infection so it is far more difficult to diagnose from simple observations.
- Death from RHD-2 occur later and over a longer period of time than RHD-1: typically this is 3-9 days following infection and can last up to 5 days, instead of 2-6 days infection and lasting 3-4 days as generally observed with classical RHD-1. Although this is marginal it is important to note from a quarantine perspective.
- Only following post-mortem examination will initial diagnosis be possible, however further tests are required to definitively confirm RHD-2 which is now recommended for unexplained deaths.
- In mainland Europe, RHD-2 is now very common particularly in France where it was 1st identified in 2010 and spread country-wide where it was mainly transmitted through the wild rabbit population with cross-over with domestic rabbits. In Italy it has not spread very wide given the differences in wild rabbit population density. A research study has been published that describes the proliferation in RHD-2 in France since 2010 and of relevance to the current situation in the Great Britain and Ireland.

RHD-2 is a genetically and antigenically different from RHD-1, and the immunogenic differences occur at the serotype level, for which vaccination against both variants is needed.

These viruses, which have been circulating in pet rabbits, have now reached wild populations in Ireland. The impact of this pathogen in these populations is a concern for the conservation of wild rabbits. Continued surveillance should be implemented to assess this impact. - Mod.PMB
