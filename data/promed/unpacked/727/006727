The Department of Animal Health declared an epidemic of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in 3 communes of the Mekong Delta provinces of Vinh Long, and Tra Vinh, and the H5N6 avian flu on flocks of quail in Tinh Ha Commune in the central province of Quang Ngai's Son Tinh District.

Deputy health minister Nguyen Thanh Long yesterday [25 Dec 2014] sent an urgent dispatch to chairpersons of people's committees nationwide asking to step up efforts to prevent bird flu and diseases in upcoming Tet (Lunar New Year) [19 Feb 2015] holidays when weather is conducive to outbreaks of [avian influenza].

As per the dispatch, the deputy health minister ordered local administrations to implement proper measures preventing winter disease, especially flu A/H5N1 and flu A/H5N6.

Local governments should coordinate with health sector and animal health department to manage food safety. They should conduct inspection of food safety and hygiene as well as issue harsh penalties on violators. Health workers must work around the clock during the holidays to control the urgent cases and provide timely treatment to patients.

The Health Ministry also proposed that the departments of agriculture and rural development enhance supervision in a bid to [detect outbreaks of diseases early and stop the spread of avian influenza.] Related agencies should liaise to tighten control of sales and transportation of diseased poultry out of the affected communes.

[HPAI H5N6 caused 7 outbreaks in Viet Nam earlier this year (2014). The event started on 22 Apr 2014 and was declared resolved on 6 Oct 2014. The relevant immediate and follow-up OIE reports, and an interactive map, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=15802.

The current HPAI H5N1 event started 29 Nov 2014, so far involving 4 outbreaks; the reports and a map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16728.

HPAI H5N1 has been circulating in Viet Nam, causing several major events, since 2003. During this period, 127 human cases of avian influenza have been reported, including 64 deaths (2 of them in 2014). The disease peaked in the 2 years 2004/2005 (90 cases, 39 deaths). Since then, control and prevention efforts of the animal health authorities were intensified, including vaccinations of poultry. - Mod.AS
