Simanjiro vaccinates 25 000 cows for RVF
-----------------------------------------------
More than 25 000 livestock in Simanjaro District, Manyara Region have
been vaccinated against the dreaded Rift Valley Fever (RVF).
A statement issued by the district livestock department said that
cattle, goats and sheep from Terrat, Engonongoi, Loswaki, Emboreet
and Loiborsoit were vaccinated in 2 phases. Simanjiro District
received 61 000 vaccination doses.
An NGO called VETAID supported the exercise by donating 5
refrigerators for storing the vaccines. The NGO has also been
assisting in repairing the dips as well as supplying some livestock
drugs.
The government has been striving to eradicate RVF, which originated
from Kenya and spread over several regions in the country killing a
number of people and livestock. The Prime Minister, Mr. Edward
Lowassa, told the Parliament on Friday [20 Apr 2007] that 89 people
died of RVF, 59 of them from Dodoma.
He said the government has stepped up efforts to vaccinate livestock
in all suspected regions. The government ordered 2 million
vaccination doses from South Africa, and 1.6 million have already
been distributed.

explanatory commentary on the Tanzanian RVF situation in animals,
included in archived ProMED-mail post 20070324.1024. One of his main
remarks addressed the vaccination of exposed livestock during the
peak of an outbreak, a procedure regarded by him to be highly
contraindicated. - Mod.AS]
