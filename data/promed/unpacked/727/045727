[It is now 16 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's [Sun 19 Apr 2020] report, there are 7 new reports of locally transmitted infection, 6 in Heilongjiang and one in Guangdong. It has now been 26 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 15 days or so.

According to the report above, a total of 82 747 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4632 deaths, representing an increase of 12 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (18 Apr 2020) report, and there were no newly reported deaths. 2 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to be reported daily but are decreasing. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 49 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 5 in imported cases. There were no conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 990, 184 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concern are the imported cases returning to China.

From the English language update (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) for 19 Apr 2020:
According to a survey people are concerned about going back to normal life which will involve massive close contacts after termination of enhanced social distancing measures, due to the shock and lessons learnt from last February and March [2020].

- A survey of 1000 people conducted by a team from Seoul National University highlighted that 65.6% of the response said 'yes' to, "The risk of infection will increase to my family and I if we go back to our everyday routine such as going to work or school after termination of enhanced social distancing measures" ('No' was 10.4%).
- On the other hand, 72.1% said 'yes' to a question asking their willingness to accept the 'new normal life' which is embracing social distancing in daily lives.
- When they were asked about areas to improve in order to create an environment that incorporates routine life and social distancing, 32.9% answered; "cultivating social norm and culture that promotes social distancing as part of our everyday routine" was important. In addition, 24.9% also stated the systematic provision which allows people to "stay at home when they are sick" was important.

KCDC stated that although the number of confirmed cases is recently declining, this is due to social distancing efforts up to the previous week. Therefore KCDC is keeping a close eye on possible cases that may occur in the upcoming week due to the recent events such as the general election and Easter Sunday celebration.

[4] Iran: 82 211 total cases, 5118 deaths
Date: Sun 19 Apr 2020
Source: Bourse and Bazaar, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.bourseandbazaar.com/news-1/2020/4/19/iran-says-virus-deaths-rise-by-87-to-5118


Iran on Sunday [19 Apr 2020] announced 87 new deaths from the novel coronavirus [COVID-19] in the past 24 hours, raising the official toll to 5118, as it takes steps to reopen the economy. It is the 6th consecutive day that Iran has announced a death toll under 100, though Sunday's toll was 14 higher than the day before.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 1343 new infections had been confirmed, taking the total to 82 211. Of those admitted to hospital, 57 023 have recovered and been discharged, while 3456 remain in critical condition.

Iran has struggled to contain what is the Middle East's deadliest COVID-19 outbreak since reporting its 1st cases on [19 Feb 2020].

On Saturday [18 Apr 2020], Iran allowed some "low-risk" businesses in the capital Tehran to reopen, after approving similar measures in other provinces last week. "Medium-risk" businesses could reopen Monday [20 Apr 2020], President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday [19 Apr 2020] after a meeting of the national coronavirus taskforce. He did not elaborate on the types of businesses considered "medium risk" or whether the measure covered the whole country, but said those businesses would have to close by 6 pm.

In a bid to halt the spread of the coronavirus, Iran had ordered the closure of non-essential businesses and imposed inter-city travel bans, but refrained from imposing an official lockdown. The reopening of the economy has drawn criticism from health experts and even some government officials.

[Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 4218 newly confirmed cases reported today (19 Apr 2020) and 4499 cases reported yesterday (18 Apr 2020), maintaining the plateau levels of 4000-5000 cases newly confirmed each day.

As of today [19 Apr 2020], totals of 195 944 cases and 20 453 deaths have been reported, up from 191 994 cases and 20 043 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (18 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 138.61, slowly decreasing over the past 11 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 138.61 today [19 Apr 2020]. Spain has the highest case count in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 195 944 cases, approximately 70 070 (38.8%) have been hospitalized and 7668 (3.9%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data.

La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country, the most affected communities by population-based rates, are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
