Wildlife officials are alerting people to a diseased deer killed in Montgomery County.

On Wednesday [12 May 2021], the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources announced a deer killed in the county and brought to a taxidermist in late November 2020 has tested positive for chronic wasting disease. At the time of kill, the hunter did not notice any outward signs of disease, and the deer appeared to be in good condition, according to DWR.

The department does not believe this case is linked to any prior CWD cases, as the closest documented case was more than 160 mi [97 km] away in Madison County.

During the 2020-2021 deer hunting season, cooperating taxidermists submitted samples from over 2600 deer, and the only CWD detection to result from this statewide effort was this Montgomery County deer, according to DWR.

As part of the department's CWD Management plan, a new disease management area has been created and includes Floyd, Montgomery, and Pulaski counties.

Actions to control the spread of the disease are now in effect and include the following:

- Ban on white-tailed deer fawn rehabilitation in those counties
- Restricted transport of whole deer carcasses and any parts containing brain or spinal cord tissue out of those counties
- Ban on feeding of deer year-round in Bland, Carroll, Craig, Floyd, Franklin, Giles, Montgomery, Patrick, Pulaski, Roanoke, and Wythe counties, and in the cities of Radford, Roanoke, and Salem.

In these 3 counties, DWR will also be making the following recommendations at a 27 May [2021] Board of Wildlife Resources meeting:

- Adding both an early and a late antlerless-only deer seasons in an approximately 40 sq mi [104 sq km] Disease Focus Zone, located in the vicinity of the CWD detection
- Extending the general firearms deer season from 2 to 4 weeks in Montgomery and Pulaski counties, matching Floyd's existing general firearms season
- Removing antler point restrictions from the Fairystone quality deer management area

CWD has been confirmed in 26 states and 3 Canadian provinces and in Virginia, and DWR reports a total of 109 deer have tested positive for the disease since 2009.

The incurable disease, found in deer, elk, and moose in North America, is a slow-acting and progressive neurologic disease that ultimately results in death of the animal. It can be spread through the urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals.

While there's no evidence that it can be transmitted naturally to humans, pets, or livestock [with the exception of pigs], the CDC recommends hunters test all deer harvested from known CWD-positive areas, wait until test results are received prior to consuming the meat, and do not consume any meat from animals that test positive for the disease.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been discovered in deer breeding facilities in both Matagorda and Mason counties. This marks the 1st positive detection of the disease in each county.

An epidemiological investigation found both deer breeding facilities had received deer from the Uvalde County premises confirmed positive with CWD on 29 Mar 2021. Postmortem tissue samples were submitted by the permitted deer breeders to assist Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) and Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) with the epidemiological investigation. The National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, has since confirmed CWD in those tissue samples.

TPWD and TAHC officials have taken immediate action to secure all cervids at the Matagorda County and Mason County deer breeding facilities and plan to conduct additional investigations for CWD. In addition, other breeding facilities and release sites having received deer from these facilities, or shipped deer to these facilities during the last 5 years, have been contacted by TPWD and cannot move or release deer at this time.

On 31 Mar 2021, TPWD and TAHC reported 2 CWD confirmations at breeding facilities in both Hunt and Uvalde counties. The Hunt facility underwent further DNA testing to confirm animal identification and origin, and on 12 May [2021] the DNA test results confirmed the deer's connection to the premises.

TPWD and TAHC continue to work together to determine the extent of the disease within all the affected facilities and evaluate risks to Texas' free ranging deer populations. Quick detection of CWD can help mitigate the disease's spread.

"Regrettably, the gravity of this situation continues to mount with these new CWD-positive discoveries, as well as with the full understanding of just how many other facilities and release sites across Texas were connected to the CWD positive sites in Uvalde and Hunt Counties," said Carter Smith, Executive Director of TPWD. "Along with our partners at the Texas Animal Health Commission, we will continue to exercise great diligence and urgency with this ongoing investigation. Accelerating the testing at other exposed facilities will be critical in ensuring we are doing all we can to arrest the further spread of this disease, which poses great risks to our native deer populations, both captive and free-ranging alike."

CWD was first recognized in the U.S. in 1967 and has since been documented in captive and/or free-ranging deer in 26 states and 3 Canadian provinces.

In Texas, the disease was first discovered in 2012 in free-ranging mule deer along a remote area of the Hueco Mountains near the Texas-New Mexico border and has since been detected in 228 captive or free-ranging cervids, including white-tailed deer, mule deer, red deer, and elk in 13 Texas counties. For more information on previous detections visit the CWD page (https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/diseases/cwd/tracking/) on the TPWD website (https://www.tahc.texas.gov).

CWD is a fatal neurological disease found in certain cervids, including deer, elk, moose, and other members of the deer family. CWD is a slow and progressive disease. Due to a long incubation, cervids infected with CWD may not produce any visible signs for a number of years after becoming infected. As the disease progresses, animals with CWD show changes in behavior and appearance. Clinical signs may include progressive weight loss, stumbling or tremors with a lack of coordination, excessive thirst, salivation or urination, loss of appetite, teeth grinding, abnormal head posture, and/or drooping ears.

To date there is no evidence that CWD poses a risk to humans or non-cervids. However, as a precaution, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recommend not to consume meat from infected animals. For more information about CWD, visit the TPWD website (https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/diseases/cwd/) or the TAHC website (https://www.tahc.texas.gov/animal_health/elk-deer/#cwd).

["Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a neurological disease in deer, elk, moose, and other members of the deer family, known as "cervids." The disease was first recognized in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado and has since been documented in captive and free-ranging deer in states and 2 Canadian Provinces. The 1st case of CWD in Texas was discovered in 2012 in free-ranging mule deer in an isolated area of far West Texas.

"This disease presents numerous challenges for state wildlife agencies across North America. Of concern is the potential for decline within deer, elk, or other susceptible cervid populations. In addition, CWD could have indirect impacts on hunting, hunter participation, and economic benefits derived from big-game hunting. In Texas, hunting is a USD 2.2 billion economic engine, supporting many rural towns across the state.

"Because eradication is thought to be impossible once CWD becomes established in a population, it is imperative that a sound CWD management program is established to reduce the severity of implications resulting from the disease. Of course, disease prevention is the best approach to protect cervid populations and prevent social and economic repercussions. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) and Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) have developed a cooperative CWD management plan to guide both agencies in addressing risks, developing management strategies, and protecting big game resources from CWD in captive or free-ranging cervid populations."

Chronic wasting disease continues its march across much of North America and parts of Europe. Thus far, no method of effective control/prevention has been found. Slaughtering animals in regions where positive animals exist may temporarily reduce the number of positives, but ultimately the disease marches on. Sadly, our scientists are apparently no closer to a treatment or prevention for this disease. - Mod.TG]
