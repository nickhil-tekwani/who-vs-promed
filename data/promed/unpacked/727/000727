2 [more] Chinese provinces ended their emergency response to the H7N9 bird flu on Friday [17 May 2013] after no new human infections were reported in the past 21 consecutive days, authorities said. The provincial governments of Jiangsu and Shandong, both in eastern China, have announced an end to the level-IV emergency response to the H7N9 avian influenza outbreak.

Shanghai Municipality ended emergency response measures on 10 May 3013, and Zhejiang Province ended them on Thursday [16 May 2013].

Medical observations for those who had close contact with H7N9-infected patients have also ended in these provinces:

Since Jiangsu diagnosed the 1st case of H7N9 on 21 Mar 2013, a total of 27 human cases of the new strain of avian influenza were reported in the province. 8 of these patients died, 13 recovered and 6 remain hospitalized, according to a statement issued by the provincial government.

In Shandong Province, only 2 cases of H7N9 were reported. Both patients recovered and no new cases have been reported for 21 consecutive days.

Health authorities in both provinces said they will continue to enhance control over the H7N9 virus and exert efforts to raise people's awareness on H7N9 prevention.

As of Mon 13 May 2013 the Chinese mainland had reported a total of 130 confirmed H7N9 cases. 35 of these cases ended in death, and 57 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission, which did not account for the remainder of cases [?].

[2] Transmission potential

A China-World Health Organization (WHO) joint report [see ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (81): China CDC/WHO H7N9 Mission Report 20130518.1722238] said the H7N9 bird flu virus has a higher potential for human-to-human transmission than any other known bird flu virus. The report, compiled after WHO's week-long field assessment of the influenza, was publicized by China's National Health and Family Planning Commission on Saturday [18 May 2013]. It said the H7N9 virus, compared with other bird flu viruses, has infected more in a shorter time, and some H7N9 viruses have shown genetic alterations which means they have adapted to be more contagious than other avian influenza viruses.

In addition, WHO offered the Chinese government several suggestions, including staying alert despite the virus' seasonal weakening during the summer, as the virus poses grave hazards and a lot of its basic information is still not known. The report admitted there are still uncertainties surrounding this fresh strain of virus, asserting that exposure to live poultry is a major risk factor.

WHO last month [April 2013] sent a joint mission of experts to China to survey areas affected by H7N9 in Shanghai and Beijing for a week-long assessment of the influenza. From late March [2013], when the 1st H7N9 case was reported, to 13 May 2013, the Chinese mainland had reported a total of 130 confirmed H7N9 cases. 35 of these cases ended in death, and 57 patients have recovered and been discharged from the hospital, according to official statistics.
