Rare TB form [was] diagnosed in woman from India who traveled to McHenry County [Illinois].

A woman with a rare, hard-to-treat form of tuberculosis visited family in McHenry County after arriving at O'Hare International Airport in April [2015], and also traveled in Missouri and Tennessee, according to health officials who are trying to track down people who came in close contact with her.

The woman sought treatment at an undisclosed hospital in the Chicago [Illinois] area, where she was admitted to an isolation unit, and then was transferred to a National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. Her condition was reported as stable.

The woman has an extremely [extensively] drug-resistant form of the disease called XDR TB, which is impervious to most TB drugs. 3 to 4 cases are reported each year in the United States, on average.

TB is not as easily spread as diseases like the flu or measles. But it is a dangerous illness, especially for people with weakened immune systems, and health officials are taking the situation seriously, Skinner said.

Health officials in Illinois are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] to find people with whom the woman may have had prolonged direct contact, in close quarters, according to CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. Debra Quackenbush, a spokeswoman for the McHenry County Health Department, said some of the people who came into close contact with the woman have been interviewed and are being monitored. She did not believe the general public was at risk.

Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria spread from person to person through the air. It usually affects the lungs and can lead to symptoms such as chest pain and coughing up blood. TB has been declining in the United States. But globally, each year it sickens about 9 million people and is a cause of 1.5 million deaths.

An Indian woman with a rare, drug-resistant form of tuberculosis traveled through Middle Tennessee during her recent visit to the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. The CDC is now working to identify individuals who may have been exposed.

The CDC released a statement Monday [8 Jun 2015] that said the woman traveled from India to Chicago [Illinois] in April, and after arriving in Chicago, she traveled in Missouri and Tennessee.

The woman then returned to Chicago and received treatment at a hospital where she was diagnosed with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR TB. She was then transported by air and ambulance to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, where she is now in a respiratory isolation room.

According to the CDC, because XDR TB is multidrug resistant, many usual TB treatments are ineffective. "Because XDR TB is resistant to the most powerful 1st-line and 2nd-line drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective and often have worse treatment outcomes," according to the CDC website. The risk of acquiring XDR TB in the US is usually relatively low, but the CDC noted the disease can spread with ease.

The CDC will obtain a flight manifest and notify passengers who traveled with the woman and is working with the Illinois health department to trace potential contacts.

At this time, the woman has not been identified.

The Tennessee Department of Health has been advised of the woman's visit to Middle Tennessee and has been involved in the investigation to determine whether she was infectious during her visit and with whom she was in close contact, according to the department's Director of Communications and Media Relations Woody McMillin. McMillin said Tuesday afternoon [9 Jun 2015] that to his knowledge the woman did not pass through Nashville [Tennessee] and that she traveled to the state by car.

"Public health is always a priority for us," McMillin said of the state health department. "It's probably among our more important roles. In the case of a communicable disease, we use contact tracing to identify people who might have been exposed to an illness or disease to determine if they need to come in for testing."

TB germs are spread through the air when one person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings, according to the CDC, and people nearby breathe in the bacteria and become infected.

[ProMED-mail thanks Darren Addy of Alda Nebraska (<cheekygeek@gmail.com>) for also submitting a report on this patient with XDR-TB.

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a form of tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least isoniazid plus rifampin, the 2 most potent 1st-line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) is a form of TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of the 3 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

Inadequate or improper use of the anti-TB medications favor the emergence of drug resistant organisms. Drug-resistant TB is also more common in people who develop TB disease again after having been treated for TB disease in the past, or come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common. Drug-resistant TB requires more extensive chemotherapy, involves drug therapy over more extended periods of time, is more often unsuccessful, is more expensive, and is more often fatal than drug-susceptible TB. XDR TB is more likely to be fatal in persons with HIV infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system.

The proportion of primary MDR TB cases disproportionately affects foreign-born persons in the United States. Since 1997, the percentage of US-born patients with primary MDR TB has remained below 1.0 percent. However, of the total number of reported primary MDR TB cases, the proportion occurring in foreign-born persons increased from 25.3 percent (103 of 407) in 1993 to 82.7 percent (81 of 98) in 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/statistics/TBTrends.htm).

XDR TB is uncommon in the US, where 63 cases of XDR TB have been reported between 1993 and 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/drtb/xdrtb.htm). Four cases of XDR TB (all occurring in foreign-born persons) have been reported in the US for 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6111a2.htm).

For a discussion of the risk of acquiring tuberculosis after exposure on an airplane, see my comments in ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis, airplane exposure - USA ex Germany 20090317.1081. A discussion of aircraft ventilation and the assessment required of exposed passengers and crew for acquisition of tuberculosis can be found in my comments in ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (05) 20071130.3861. - Mod.ML
