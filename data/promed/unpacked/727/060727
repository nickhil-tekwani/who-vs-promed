-----------------------------------------------------------------
Various programs in eastern Sierra Leone, where Lassa fever is
hyperendemic, have recommended (and sometimes supplied) cats as a
control measure. Cats would seem easier to acquire and maintain as
domestic pets than [mongooses]. It is a logical step (and there is no
evidence that cats or mongooses carry or transmit Lassa virus -- a
question that often comes up), but has never been objectively evaluated.

[ProMED-mail thanks A-Lan Banks for responding to the moderator's
request for information identifying those Nigerian states in addition
to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) where Lassa fever has been
reported. The states of Ondo and Edo lie to the southwest of the FCT
and Nasarawa, but are not contiguous with them.

These states can be located on the administrative map of Nigeria at
