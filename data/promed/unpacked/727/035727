A tick implicated in the spread of equine piroplasmosis in horses and babesiosis in dogs is slowly but steadily spreading within the Netherlands and Belgium, according to researchers.

The research team has reported its findings with respect to _Dermacentor reticulatus_ ticks. Populations of the tick were discovered in the Netherlands in 2004 following several fatal cases of babesiosis in dogs, caused by a protozoan parasite, _Babesia canis_.

The same tick has been implicated in the emergence in horses of piroplasmosis in the Netherlands, which is considered one of the most important protozoan parasitic diseases affecting horses, mules, and donkeys. In the case of horses, the disease is caused by _Babesia caballi_ and _Theileria equi_.

The researchers conducted surveillance work with _D. reticulatus_ ticks collected from 11 locations between 2011 and 2013. They were also collected from different hosts between 2007 and 2013.

A total of 1368 _D. reticulatus_ ticks were collected from 4 previously known field locations and from 5 new locations in the Netherlands and from 2 sites in Belgium (one old and one new location).

A total of 855 ticks collected from 8 locations in the Netherlands and 2 locations in Belgium were tested.

14 ticks (1.64 percent) collected at 4 field locations (Dintelse Gorzen, Rozenburg, Slikken van de Heen and St. Philipsland) were positive for _B. canis_.

Two ticks were positive for _B. caballi_. One of the ticks was in Dintelse Gorzen in the Netherlands, and one was in De Panne in Belgium.

In further work, a further 1092 _D. reticulatus_ ticks were collected between 2007 and 2013 from 40 dogs (132 ticks), 2 ticks from 2 humans, 51 ticks from 15 horses, 2 ticks from 2 cats, and one tick from a roe deer, whereas most ticks (904) were collected from cattle.

None of the ticks collected from these hosts were infected.

"_D. reticulatus_ is continuing its spread into novel areas," Frans Jongejan and his colleagues reported in an open-access report published in the journal, Parasites & Vectors.

"The finding that some ticks are infected with B. canis and _B. caballi_ poses a threat to the resident dog and horse population and justifies year-round tick control measures," they said.

"Continued surveillance is required to monitor the distribution of _D. reticulatus_ and associated tick-borne diseases in the resident dog and horse population in the Netherlands and in Belgium."

The known range of the tick is from southwest England in the west to Central Asia up to the Yenisei river basin in Siberia in the east.

Recent evidence has pointed to the emergence of equine piroplasmosis in the southwest of the Netherlands. Subclinical _B. caballi_ infections and 2 acute clinical cases of _Theileria equi_ -- another protozoan parasite that causes equine piroplasmosis -- were diagnosed in resident horses with a sero-prevalence of 1.3 percent among 300 horses in the southwest of the country.

Jongejan was joined in the research by Moniek Ringenier, Michael Putting, Laura Berger, Stefan Burgers, Reinier Kortekaas, Jesse Lenssen and Marleen van Roessel, all from the Utrecht Centre for Tick-borne Diseases, which is part of Utrecht University in the Netherlands; Michiel Wijnveld, from the Medical University of Vienna, in Austria; and Maxime Madder, with the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Belgium and the Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases at the University of Pretoria in South Africa.

[The 1st occurrence of (subclinical) equine piroplasmosis in Dutch horses was reported to the OIE in February 2011 (posting 20110218.0538). The report included the following note: "As part of a prevalence survey, there is an epidemiological survey conducted on the prevalence of equine piroplasmosis in the Netherlands." Reportedly, no vaccination or treatment of the animals was prescribed as "control measures." Subscribers are referred to the commentaries by Mod.PC and Mod.JW in the said posting. - Mod.AS
