I am one of the researchers working on this undiagnosed disease in SA wombats and wish to provide some updates in response to the interest the topic has received and questions posed by readers.

We believe this disease in Murraylands Southern Hairy Nosed wombats is multifactorial and largely due to severe chronic nutritional stress in these animals. In the areas in which affected wombats are found, very few native grasses and regular feed sources remain, and the habitat is dominated by _Carrichtera annua_, _Asophodelus fistulosus_, _Marrubium vulgare_, and _Heliotropium europaeum_.

In some juvenile wombats examined, we have found poor body condition, extensive bilaterally symmetrical dorsal and lateral alopecia, jaundice, and severe haemorrhagic and exudative dermatitis of sun exposed areas (dorsal thorax and abdomen, rump, and dorsal head, particularly ears and periocular skin) with sparing of the ventral and inner legs.

Microscopically, skin lesions are characterised by severe superficial dermal neutrophilic vasculitis, superficial dermal thrombosis and haemorrhage, and ischaemic necrosis of the epidermis and superficial dermis. There is significant pigmentary incontinence in skin from these animals, perhaps rendering them more susceptible to photosensitisation.

Liver lesions in these animals were characterised by severe periportal to bridging fibrosis, bile ductile proliferation, megalocytosis, anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, and there was histological evidence of secondary bacterial hepatitis.

Differential diagnoses included pyrollizidine alkaloid toxicoses, aflatoxicosis, and other plant toxins. Liver lesions were submitted to the Joint Pathology Centre (previously Armed Forces Institute of Pathology) in Washington for a 2nd opinion, who subsequently reported the same histopathological findings and differential agents.

Of the PA containing plants found in the region from where affected wombats have been found, only _Heliotropium europium_ was found to be present. We have subsequently had these plant specimens confirmed as _Heliotropium europaeum_ by the South Australian Herbarium. We are also collaborating with toxicologists from the University of Queensland, who are presently examining plant samples as well as wombat stomach, liver and faecal samples for toxic alkaloids. Investigations are ongoing.

Importantly, not all wombats with alopecia have been found to have liver lesions. We are concerned for chronic nutritional stress as a cause for alopecia (as also suggested by David Thomson), as many skin lesions are non-inflammatory and appear more typical of metabolic or hormonal disruptions to hair growth cycles. We are also finding other problems not consistent with hepatotoxicity alone. Hormonal disturbances and other toxicities have not yet been excluded and remain in the differential diagnoses. Investigations are continuing and will be published in the near future. We have not found any evidence for sarcoptic mange in the animals examined so far.

We thank ProMED subscribers for their interest and will keenly take all comments and suggestions on board in our investigations. We are happy to be contacted by interested persons at the address below.

[We appreciate Lucy taking the time to update us on the wombats. This information does provide some clarity, but we do hope this dreadful situation is reversed, treated, or overcome quite quickly.
