A disease which affects goats has been found in Northern Ireland for the 1st time. It was picked up in an animal on a holding in Country Londonderry during routine surveillance. The premises where the condition was detected was placed under restriction and other animals slaughtered.

There are around 3800 goats in Northern Ireland, and farmers have been urged to be vigilant by chief vet Robert Huey. Most goats are found in small numbers on farms, but there are some commercial meat and dairy herds.

The infected goat had been imported from Great Britain and is believed to have brought the infection with it.

Caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) can affect the animal's productivity and condition. The main symptom is lameness, but it can also cause loss of hair and can affect kids' ability to stand and walk. Most goats are infected at an early age from mother's milk, remain virus positive for life, and can transmit the virus.

CAE is not a disease which can be transmitted to humans.

Tests are continuing to ensure that there has been no further spread of the disease.

[Caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) is a persistent, incurable lentivirus infection of goats. The virus is closely related and often grouped together with the virus causing maedi-visna (MV) of sheep as the "small ruminant lentiviruses." Both diseases are OIE-listed, included commonly in Chapter 14.5, "Maedi-visna" of the Terrestrial International animal-health Code (https://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_maedi_visna.htm). The diagnostic methods of both diseases, recognised for international trade, are addressed in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2019, Chapter 3.7.2 "Caprine arthritis/encephalitis and Maedi-visna," available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.07.02_CAE_MV.pdf (the current version was adopted in May 2017).

The distribution of CAEV is highest in industrialised countries and seems to have coincided with the international movement of European breeds of dairy goats. Clinical and subclinical MV and CAE are associated with progressive, mononuclear cell inflammatory lesions in the lungs, joints, udder and central nervous system. Indurative mastitis is common in both host species, and its economic significance may be underestimated. Polyarthritis, manifested by lameness, is the main clinical sign in goats. Encephalitis occurs primarily in kids aged between 2 and 6 months following CAEV infection (transmitted predominantly through colostrum from their dams), but careful differential diagnoses need to be conducted to rule out other syndromes or infections in kids.

MV and CAE are characterised by lifelong persistence of the causal agent in host monocytes and macrophages and a variable length of time between infection and induction of a serologically detectable antiviral antibody response. Most infected sheep and goats do not exhibit clinical disease but remain persistently infected and are capable of transmitting virus. The disease is not zoonotic.

In a survey in Britain, nearly 5 goats in every 1000 sampled tested positive for CAE.

The current case in Northern Ireland was detected in a female Boer goat, as part of the annual sheep & goat health serological survey. This is the 1st recorded case of CAE in Northern Ireland (NI) which did not arise from a post import check test. The affected goat died on farm, and the remaining animals were slaughtered under DAERA (Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs) supervision.

Boer goats, initially bred in South Africa, are meat-type animals; see details and pictures at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer_goat. - Mod.AS
