An outbreak of a rare illness called Q fever, which is caught from infected
livestock, is being investigated in the Cheltenham area of Gloucestershire.
A total of 28 cases have been identified among local people, most requiring
hospital treatment.
Victims can suffer severe pnuemonia while others show no ill effects. Some
people recover without treatment. The infection is often caught by close
contact with farm animals but it can be also be blown through the air. A
team led by the Health Protection Agency is looking at how residents may
have caught the infection.
Epidemiologist Dr Deirdre Lewis said: "Q fever is generally a mild
infection but we know that it can cause complications, so we've been keen
to look into this as thoroughly as we can. We've not had any reported cases
of Q fever in Gloucestershire residents since 2002, so seeing 28, mostly
from the Cheltenham area, is unusual."
The evidence so far points to the period of risk being more than 3 months
ago. Most of the patients, who are aged between 40 and 70, are said to be
recovering well after falling ill earlier in the summer.
Q, standing for Query, fever, was so called originally because for many
years its cause was unknown. It tends to be more common around the lambing
season, although it can occur at any time of year.
"I appreciate that news of this outbreak will surprise some local people,"
said Dr Lewis. "They can be reassured that we're working hard to
investigate it."
An outbreak of Q fever in Solihull in 1989 led to 147 human cases.
Researchers have suggested that it was caused by a combination of outdoor
lambing and calving and particular weather conditions leading to the
infective organism being blown several miles to populated areas.

[ProMED-mail previously posted regarding the early part of this outbreak [Q
fever - UK (England): alert, RFI 20070723.2367].
_Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This
organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation, and is
highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may
produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill
50 per cent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).
Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including
other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not
usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats
and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are
excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly,
during birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic
fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a
mode of transmission (2).
The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large
cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).
Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from
air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental
material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are
often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be
required to cause infection.
Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration
of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other
modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human
transmission, are rare.

Cheltenham is in the west of England, in Gloucestershire, and can be found
on a map at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheltenham>. More information is
needed to assess how these individuals acquired this airborne infection,
which can spread over at least 1/2 mile. - Mod.LL]
