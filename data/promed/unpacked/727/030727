[1] Europe: Norway, cruise ship
Date: Mon 3 Aug 2020

At least 41 passengers and crew on a Norwegian cruise ship have tested positive for COVID-19, officials say. Hundreds more passengers who travelled on the MS Roald Amundsen are in quarantine and awaiting test results, the company that owns the ship said. The ship, which belongs to the Norwegian firm Hurtigruten, docked in the port of Tromso in northern Norway on Friday [31 Jul 2020]. Hurtigruten has halted all leisure cruises because of the outbreak.

"This is a serious situation for everyone involved. We have not been good enough and we have made mistakes," Chief Executive Daniel Skjeldamsaid in a statement on Monday [3 Aug 2020]. "A preliminary evaluation shows a breakdown in several of our internal procedures," he added. "The only responsible choice is to suspend all expedition sailings."

Norway's government has announced it will stop all cruise ships with more than 100 people on board from disembarking passengers for at least 14 days. And police said they were investigating whether any laws had been broken prior to the outbreak on the Roald Amundsen. "We have found grounds to open a case," a police official told Reuters news agency.

What happened on the ship?
The MS Roald Amundsen had been on a week-long voyage to Svalbard in the Arctic and was also reportedly scheduled to visit ports in England and Scotland in September [2020]. 4 crew members were admitted to hospital on Friday [31 Jul 2020] with coronavirus symptoms, shortly after the ship docked in the Arctic port of Tromso, and they later tested positive for the virus. Another 32 crew members on board were found to be infected. The staff who tested positive included German, French, and Filipino citizens. They were tested for the virus before leaving their home countries but did not quarantine before starting work on the ship, Hurtigruten said.

Almost 180 passengers were allowed to depart the ship on Friday [31 Jul 2020], leaving the authorities scrambling over the weekend [1-2 Aug 2020] to locate and test those who had been on board. All the passengers have now been contacted and told to self-isolate for 10 days, health officials said. 5 passengers have so far tested positive out of 387 who had travelled on the ship since [17 Jul 2020]. "We expect that more infections will be found in connection to this outbreak," said Line Vold, a health official.

The majority of passengers are reported to be Norwegians, but there were also travellers from Germany, Denmark, the UK, and the US on board.

What's the latest with the cruise industry?
The outbreak on the MS Roald Amundsen is the latest blow to an industry that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with shares in the major global operators falling dramatically since the start of March [2020]. Thousands of passengers were left stranded at sea earlier this year [2020] as ships were hit by outbreaks of the virus. The MS Roald Amundsen was itself stranded for several days in March [2020] after Chile refused it entry because it had confirmed COVID-19 cases on board. Similar incidents involving other ships occurred over the following weeks in various places around the world.

And while the industry has restarted in recent times, there have been other coronavirus-related setbacks. A crew member on a ship in the Pacific tested positive for the virus on Sunday [2 Aug 2020]. The Paul Gauguin was forced to suspend its journey when the case was detected by the ship's doctor, local media report. Passengers were told to stay in their cabins as the ship turned back to Papeete on the island of Tahiti, where all on board are being tested.

Ahead of resuming its operations, Ponant, the company that runs the Paul Gauguin, had reassured customers in a blog post that it had strict regulations in place that "go further than the international standards for the sector."

In any case, cruise companies are expecting strong bookings for 2021. They are reporting a combination of new bookings and people using vouchers they received for cancelled cruises that had been scheduled for this year [2020]. "We absolutely believe when we come out of this we will lean into our repeat cruisers," Christine Duffy, the president of Carnival Cruise line, told Reuters. "They really are the ambassadors for the cruise industry."

What's wrong with this picture? Has the situation globally changed since March 2020? On 1 Mar 2020, there were a total of 88 586 laboratory confirmed cases (80 024 in Mainland China and 8562 outside of Mainland China (see COVID-19 update (24): global, more imports, apps, USA silent transmission, WHO 20200301.7039103). By 31 Mar 2020 there were a total of 785 686 laboratory confirmed cases (81 518 in Mainland China, 704 168 outside of Mainland China) (see COVID-19 update (65): global, vaping, new country, WHO 20200331.7165184). As of yesterday (2 Aug 2020 21:58 EDT (GMT+4)), the global total of laboratory confirmed cases was 18 231 535, with the daily increase from 1 Aug 2020 of 219 733 cases (see COVID-19 update (342): USA overnight camp, selected countries, WHO, global 20200803.7639012). And since March 2020, we have identified asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic high viral loads associated with viral shedding as a source of "stealth" transmission of the virus; and we recognize that a negative PCR test does not carry 100% certainty the individual is not infected. We have also learned that ships are excellent incubators for transmission of this virus. So, given a quarter of a million new infections on a daily basis (recognizing the under-reporting/capturing is probably between 10 and 20 times (based on serosurveys), has it become safer to travel on a cruise ship since March 2020? - Mod.MPP

The MS Roald Amundson tested its crew members but did not quarantine them before allowing passengers to embark on its latest journey. This same ship had been stranded on a previous cruise in March 2020 due to positive COVID cases on board. Had the ship's operators learned nothing since March 2020? - Mod.LXL [This comment in the earlier version of the post was misattributed to Mod.MPP]

[2] USA: school openings
Date: Mon 3 Aug 2020 1:55 AM ET

The new academic year is underway in some parts of the United States, with the 1st few days of school showing just how fraught reopening classrooms can be. Already in some states, schools that decided to open for in-person classes are quarantining staff members and students, and even closing temporarily as positive cases are found. Traditionally, about 14 percent of the nation's children go back to school by the 2nd week of August, mostly in the South and Midwest, although this year [2020], some districts in those areas have postponed classes by a week or 2, or plan to start the year online.

Many schools in Indiana started on Thursday [30 Jul 2020]. On Saturday [1 Aug 2020], the superintendent of the Elwood Community School Corporation in the central part of the state sent a note thanking students and parents for "a great 1st 2 days of school!" But the optimistic tone quickly gave way: Staff members had tested positive, and the high school was forced to close its doors and move all students in 7th through 12th grades to online learning for at least a week.

And similar developments occurred across the country. Just hours into the 1st day of classes at Greenfield Central Junior High School, also in Indiana, the county health department notified the school that a student had tested positive. The student was isolated, and others who had been in proximity were forced to quarantine for 2 weeks. At a high school in Corinth, Mississippi, someone also tested positive during the 1st week back, and exposed students there were asked to stay home for 14 days. And in the Atlanta (Georgia) area, more than 200 employees of a single school district in Gwinnett County tested positive or were in quarantine last week [week of 27 Jul 2020] before classes even resumed.

Gwinnett County Public Schools is the largest school system in Georgia, with more than 180 000 students. Teachers returned to work last Wednesday [29 Jul 2020], in preparation for starting classes remotely on [12 Aug 2020]. But as of Thursday [30 Jul 2020], about 260 employees had been excluded from work because they tested positive or had potentially been exposed to the virus. Sloan Roach, a spokeswoman for the school district, said the majority of cases had been attributed to community spread, which is high in the county as 4000 new cases have been confirmed there within the last 2 weeks. "We have people who have called in to report who have not been at school or work," Ms Roach said, adding that positive cases were to be expected.

Other key developments in education:
- Gov Larry Hogan of Maryland on Monday [3 Aug 2020] issued an emergency order counteracting Montgomery County's health department, which on Friday [31 Jul 2020] said that all private schools needed to start the year remotely in the fall, just as public schools in the region plan to. Montgomery County is home to some of the nation's most prestigious private schools, including St Andrew's Episcopal School, attended by Barron Trump, the president's youngest child. Mr Hogan, a Republican, said the county's closure order was overly broad and "inconsistent with the powers intended to be delegated to the county health officer."

- In New Jersey, face coverings will be required for all students inside a school building, unless doing so would adversely affect a student's health, the governor said. Indoor "mask breaks" -- times built into the school day to allow students to take off their face coverings -- would not be allowed, though students will be allowed to take off their face coverings to eat lunch.

- On Monday [3 Aug 2020], negotiators for the Los Angeles [California] school district -- the 2nd largest in the nation -- and the teachers' union there reached a tentative agreement on how to structure distanced learning when the school year begins in 2 weeks. If the agreement is approved by both sides, students at all grade levels will have consistent learning schedules and teachers will be able to choose whether to work from home or from school, according to a joint statement from the Los Angeles Unified School District and United Teachers Los Angeles.

- The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is planning to fully reopen next week [week of 10 Aug 2020], but 30 tenured faculty members wrote an open letter to students published Friday [31 Jul 2020] in The Charlotte Observer pushing for virtual learning and encouraging students to stay home, saying, "It is not safe for you to come to campus -- to live in dormitories and apartments, to sit in classrooms, and to socialize with your peers in the way that college students usually do." The university responded by saying that its policies were as flexible "as guidance allows," and it encouraged professors who were worried about safety to talk with their deans about making accommodations.

[When there is still out of control ongoing community transmission is convening indoor group gatherings a prudent way to proceed? In states with a marked reduction in transmission, the pros and cons of the importance of socialization vs. risk of transmission have a different ratio than in areas with ongoing community based transmission.

I chose to post this to show the debates ongoing in a country with many areas of as yet uncontrolled community transmission.- Mod.MPP]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 3 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published a COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Progress Report. The report highlights the progress made from [1 Feb to 30 Jun 2020] under the 3 objectives outlined in the Strategic Response and Preparedness Plan: scaling up international coordination and support; scaling up country preparedness and response by pillar; and accelerating research and innovation.

- "Immune systems are compromised by malnutrition, especially in the case of children, leaving them vulnerable to infectious diseases, including COVID-19," said Salah Alshaoof, a nutrition and health professional at the WHO-supported therapeutic feeding centre in Yemen. WHO has provided support to 90 therapeutic feeding centres in Yemen with support from Italy and other donors.

- Robots are being used in Rwanda in the fight against COVID-19. The 5 human-size robots which were acquired through a partnership between the UNDP Rwanda Accelerator Lab and the Ministry of ICT and Innovation were launched in May 2020 at the Kanyinya COVID-19 Treatment Centre. As the Kigali International Airport in Rwanda will be reopened for commercial international flights from [1 Aug 2020], one of the robots -- Urumuri -- will be used to facilitate the faster screenings of passenger body temperature.

- Today [3 Aug 2020] we present a 'Subject in Focus' update: ["Supporting the COVID-19 response through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the Global Health Cluster."] A global epidemiological overview of COVID-19 for the week ending [2 Aug 2020], is also presented.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update: (Please note that once again there is weekend reporting artifact as some key countries vis-à-vis, ongoing transmission are not reporting over the weekend and the data are reported to WHO as of 10 AM ET. Hence, "major changes", if observed, should take this into account before drawing conclusions).

- The Americas region reported 59.7% of the global newly reported cases and 68.5% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 9.6 million cases. The USA reported 38.0% of cases (58 388), followed by Brazil 29.5% (45 392), Peru 9.5% (14 691), Colombia 6.9% (10 673), Mexico 6.2% (9556), Argentina 3.4% (5241), and Chile 1.3% (2073).

- The European region reported 6.2% of the global newly reported cases and 4.8% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 34.0% (5394) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by (Spain 0% (0)), Romania 6.8% (1075), Kazakhstan 6.7% (1069), Israel 0% (0)), (France 0% (0)), Ukraine 6.2% (990), Turkey 6.2% (987), Uzbekistan 5.0% (788), the UK 4.7% (743), Poland 3.5% (548), Bosnia and Herzegovina 2.7% (421), and Kyrgyzstan 2.6% (410). While the proportion of cases represented by Russia is continuing to drop, the absolute numbers of cases are relatively stable in keeping with the increase in activity in Eastern European countries. Spain and France have not reported cases for 2 days and Israel for 3 days. All 3 countries have been undergoing increased transmission. Eastern Europe remains relatively active in the region.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.2% of the global newly reported cases and 6.8% of global newly reported fatalities. Iran reported 24.9% (2685), of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iraq 22.7% (2447), Pakistan 16.0% (1724), Saudi Arabia 12.6% (1357), Morocco 4.5% (486), Kuwait 4.3% (463), (Oman 0% (0)), Bahrain 3.2% (346), United Arab Emirates 2.2% (239) and Palestinian Authority 2.1% (225). Oman did not report any cases in the past 48 hours. Cases are increasing in Iraq, Oman, and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 5.1% of the global newly reported cases and 4.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 62.1% (8195) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 11.5% (1513), Ethiopia 5.4% (707), Kenya 5.2% (690), Algeria 3.9% (515), Madagascar 1.9% (255), and Nigeria 2.3% (304). Kenya is fairly active in the region, although South Africa is the dominant country in the region.

- The Western Pacific region reported 3.2% of the global newly reported cases and 0.60% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 60.7% (4953) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 24.5% (1998), Australia 7.9% (641), Singapore 3.8% (313), China 1.9% (158), Viet Nam 0.38% (31), and South Korea 0.28% (23). Japan and Australia continue an increase in transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 21.7% of the global newly reported cases and 14.4% of global deaths. India reported 94.8% (52 972) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Indonesia 2.7% (1519), and Bangladesh 1.6% (886). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (2 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 1.2% in the past 24 hours (weekend reporting artifact contributes to this apparent decrease in daily case count). The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with a daily case count today [3 Aug 2020] approaching 51 000.

In the past 24 hours, India reported 50 629 cases followed by the USA (48 527) and Brazil (17 988) -- significant reductions in daily case reports by the USA and Brazil. These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (51.3%). There were 4481 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, Brazil, Colombia, Spain, Russia, South Africa, Argentina, Mexico, and Peru, all known global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 4250 to 50 629. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: France, the Philippines, Bolivia, Iraq, Iran, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Israel, and Bangladesh, and their range of reported new cases is 1356 to 3376. After no reports for 2 days, Spain and France are on the top 20s lists.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 0.59%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 6.0%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or is this a reporting artifact? Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances.

Impression: Interpretation of major changes should keep in mind reporting artifact over the weekend. The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
