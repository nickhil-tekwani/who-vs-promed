It should be noted that if the virus present in these cases is the RHD virus 2-like variant (RHDV-2), then the current vaccines available, (based on RHDV) may not provide effective protection. Full identification of the causative virus is therefore essential.

[In summer 2010 a RHDV variant, deciphered on the basis of the major capsid protein (VP60) sequence and designated RHDV-2, was detected in France, following which it spread across mainland Europe. Subsequently, the availability of efficacious commercial vaccines that afforded protection against circulating RHDV strains enabled its control; however, in wild populations the effects of vaccination campaigns are considered inconsequential.

Since August 2013, an increased number of samples submitted for the investigation of RHDV were received in the Department of Virology, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Weybridge, Surrey, UK, eventually leading to identification of RHDV-2, as published in December 2014 (see Ref 1).

The following information on RHDV-2 is derived from the commentary of Mod.CRD in ProMED-mail's post 20150708.3494836:

"According to recent publications, the emerging lagovirus Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) has been described as a strain that infects not only rabbits but also hares. (http://tinyurl.com/pttjtp5).

RHDV2 is less virulent and with lower observed mortality rates than RHDV and RHDVa. However, the disease resulting from RHDV2 is longer in duration and will take a chronic or subacute course more often than RHD caused by the other viral strains. http://biome.biomedcentral.com/new-lagovirus-identified-as-cause-of-rabbit-haemorrhagic-disease/

Subscribers may want to refer to these 2 interesting articles which describe this new strain:

Laboratory tests to confirm the (suspected) diagnosis of the cases in Maidstone (Kent) as reported in ProMED-mail's recent post 20150820.3591864 are anticipated. In line with Dr Wight's appreciated comment, genotyping of the causative virus is needed.
