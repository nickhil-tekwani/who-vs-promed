[1] Exponential pandemic growth
Date: Mon 12 Apr 2021

The global coronavirus pandemic is still growing exponentially, the World Health Organization said on [Mon 12 Apr 2021], as it reported 4.4 million cases in the last week [w/e 11 Apr 2021], the 7th straight week of rising numbers.

The latest global figures represent a 9% increase in infections on last week and a 5% rise in deaths.

As lockdown restrictions were eased in England, the WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said "confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures" were prolonging the pandemic.

He said it might be months before the global situation was brought under control, and only then with concerted measures.

"We too want to see societies and economies reopening and travel and trade resuming," he told a news briefing, noting that there had been 7 consecutive weeks of rises in infections despite 700 million doses of vaccine being administered around the world.

"But right now, intensive care units in many countries are overflowing and people are dying and it's totally avoidable," he said. "The Covid-19 pandemic is a long way from over. But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the 1st 2 months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped."
Tedros said that restaurants and nightclubs were full and markets open and crowded in some countries, with few people taking precautions, despite continuing transmission. "Some people appear to be taking the approach that if they're relatively young, it doesn't matter if they get Covid-19," he said.

His comments came as other officials said they were looking at ways to expand the production of Covid vaccines.

India has overtaken Brazil as the nation with the 2nd-highest number of infections worldwide after the US, as it struggles to contain its 2nd wave of the pandemic. The country, which has a population of 1.4 billion, has administered about 105m vaccine doses.

The WHO's team leader on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove, told the news briefing the pandemic was still growing exponentially.

"This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, when we have proven control measures," she said. "We are in a critical point of the pandemic right now."

Covid-19 has killed at least 2 937 355 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1000 GMT on Mon. At least 135 952 650 cases have been registered.

["...it is like a nightmare that we cannot wake up... After the health and economic devastation of COVID-19, mental health is the next big pandemic." Tulio de Oliveira (https://mobile.twitter.com/Tuliodna)

"We have now seen 7 consecutive weeks of increasing cases and 4 weeks of increasing deaths", says @DrTedros at @WHO presser on #covid19. "Last week was the 4th highest number of cases in a single week so far. This is despite the fact that more than 780 million doses of vaccine have now been administered globally. Make no mistake, vaccines are a vital and powerful tool, but they are not the only tool.

"Confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures, and their application are driving transmission and costing lives", says @DrTedros. "It takes a consistent, coordinated and comprehensive approach. ... With a concerted effort to apply public health measures, alongside equitable vaccination, we could bring this pandemic under control in months. Whether we do or not, comes down to the decisions and the actions that governments and individuals make every day."

[2] Route of inoculation of antibody cocktail
Date: Mon 12 April 2021
Source: STAT news [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/12/regeneron-antibody-cocktail-covid-simple-injection/


Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said [Mon 12 Apr 2021] that a single administration of its monoclonal antibody cocktail reduced the risk that volunteers exposed to Covid-19 would develop the disease by 81%.

The study enrolled 1500 healthy volunteers, each of whom shared a home with someone who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and randomized them to receive a single dose of its antibody treatment, given subcutaneously as 4 shots, or placebo. After 29 days, 11 patients in the treatment group developed Covid-19 compared to 59 on placebo. And for the subjects who got Covid-19 despite treatment, their symptoms resolved after 1 week, compared to 3 weeks for those on placebo. In 204 patients who had already tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the study's outset, the injection reduced their chances of progressing to symptomatic Covid-19 by 31%.

The results were made public in a press release, and will be published in a scientific journal or presented at a medical meeting at a later date.

Those results mirror similar results seen in a study conducted by Eli Lilly of its monoclonal antibody in nursing homes. One key difference: while in previous studies by both Lilly and Regeneron, antibodies had to be given intravenously, in this one Regeneron used a formulation that could be given with an under-the-skin injection. Lilly is also exploring a subcutaneous injection of its antibodies.

That's "a really, really big deal," said Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina and one of the study's lead investigators. He said that having to start an IV is "unequivocally" one of the barriers to using the antibodies either for treatment or prevention.

The other barrier? Awareness. "In order for these antibodies to be used for treatment and prevention and for treatment as prevention, we need the patients or their families familiar with the opportunity," Cohen said. "We need health providers to be familiar with these drugs and comfortable administering them."

And why do we need antibodies when there are already vaccines? Dan Barouch, the director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a key figure in the development of the J&J vaccine and another investigator in Regeneron's study said that the approaches are "complementary."

"As of now, there are still substantial numbers of people who are not fully vaccinated," Barouch said. What's more, some people, including those with compromised immune systems, might not generate enough antibodies one their own --- and could benefit from antibodies that are injected into their bodies.

In some circumstances, say, an outbreak at a nursing home, the monoclonal antibodies, which start working immediately, could be the better approach.

Adverse events occurred in 20% of those who received the antibody cocktail and 29% of those who received placebo. None of the antibody cocktail recipients were hospitalized, but 4 volunteers in the placebo group were. Injection site reactions occurred in 4% of those who received the antibody and 2% of those who received placebo.

Regeneron said 35% of study volunteers were Latino and 5% were Black. About a 3rd had at least one risk factor that would put them at high risk if they developed Covid-19. A 3rd were obese, and 38% were over 50.

[Subcutaneous injections rather than intravenous makes this antiviral treatment so much easier to administer allowing it to be used more readily. It seems most effective prior to symptoms following exposure; but is also effective after infection is recognized reducing chance of progressing to symptomatic disease. This therapeutic to be used in individuals who have or have not been vaccinated adds to the arsenal against severe COVID-19. - Mod.LK]
