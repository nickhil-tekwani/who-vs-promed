Anthrax virus [sic] infection is on the rise in Zimbabwe, with the Health Ministry recording 9 (human) cases - 4 in one week - in the first 2 weeks of January this year [2018]; The people are getting infected by the deadly virus, which causes skin, lung and bowel disease- after getting in contact with infected animals.

In its weekly surveillance report, the Health Ministry said; "4 new suspected cases of anthrax and no deaths, were reported during week ending [14 Jan 2018]. The cases were reported from Buhera District, Gokwe South District and Mazowe District. The cumulative figurers for anthrax were 9."

The Veterinary department confirmed that the infected people lived in an anthrax prone area.

"Animals might die without showing any signs. So people eat them thinking they have died of a snake bite or something else; the transmission happens when you have wounds and you handle the meat and the blood" Njaju, said.

Anthrax is a potentially lethal disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, an aerobic spore-forming bacterium that exists in a complex ecological cycle predominantly involving herbivorous mammals and human.

Last year [2017] Zimbabwe experienced an outbreak of anthrax in Binga where more than a dozen hippos succumbed to the disease.

[These human cases are widely spread out across the country, an anthrax prone region. Buhera is in what was Manicaland Province; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buhera; for Gokwe South District in Midlands Province, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gokwe_region; and for Mazowe in Mashonaland Central, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazowe_District. For a map of Zimbabwe showing the various provinces, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Zimbabwe.

These are just the 9 cases reported; the 9 people who managed to reach a local medical clinic and get antibiotic treatment. It is not unlikely that others died without treatment. While we have no reports of anthrax in Midlands Province in Zimbabwe, they are known to have occurred there. Just failed immediate reporting. - Mod.MHJ
