[The symptoms of the food poisoning are not stated but the
statement "lives ... are out of danger" suggests a significant illness. More
information regarding the cause of this outbreak would be useful.ï¿½
The Kurile Island chain is about 50 small islands belonging to Russia,

Russia. The southernmost islands are the subject of a territorial dispute with
