Virus Found in Westchester (N.Y.) and Connecticut
-------------------------------------------------
Westchester County (New (York) and parts of Connecticut are scheduled to be
sprayed with pesticides to prevent outbreaks of the West Nile virus after
tests showed that dead birds and mosquitoes were carrying the virus, county
and state officials said yesterday.
In Westchester County, the spraying was ordered after the State Health
Department reported on Friday that the virus had been found in 4 dead
birds, said Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Health
Department. The birds were found in Somers, Rye, Scarsdale and Purchase, Ms.
Tolchin said. On Tuesday night, trucks will spray a pesticide called Anvil
within a 2-mile radius of where the birds were found. If it rains, or if
there are not enough trucks to do the job, the spraying will be postponed,
Ms. Tolchin said.
In Connecticut, 9 mosquitoes found in Stamford on July 11 had the virus,
said Michele Sullivan of Connecticut's Department of Environmental
Protection. Parts of Stamford, Darien and New Canaan are to be sprayed
tomorrow from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. if it does not rain. The trucks will use a
pesticide called Resmethrin, Ms. Sullivan said.

[Ray Weinstein, MD, of Dale City, Virginia,(<AlaskaRay@aol.com>) has made
the following comment. Although my assessment in the previous post that West
Nile virus is still confined to the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut/Delaware
region may be substantially correct, it should not be forgotten that a dead
bird which tested positive for the virus has been found as far south as
Baltimore. - Mod.CP
