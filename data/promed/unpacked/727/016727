Epidemiological comments A national standstill is
in place and all horse gatherings have been cancelled.
Tracing and surveillance are being undertaken in all states and territories.
Most of the infected premises have been linked to
a 2-day horse event held near Maitland, NSW, on
18-19 August 2007. Investigations are underway to
determine whether any link exists with a
quarantine station in the greater Sydney area,
where some horses in quarantine have tested positive for equine influenza A H3.
Currently, vaccination is being evaluated as a possible control measure.
The index case and source of infection are yet to be determined.
Control measures
Measures already applied
Movement control inside the country
Screening
Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
Quarantine
Vaccination prohibited
Treatment of affected animals (Supportive therapy)
Measures to be applied

[This is really a rapidly spreading disease,
probably having much to do with the movement of
horses themselves. For background information on
equine influenza, see Mod.TG's commentary in posting 20060727.2077.
In addition, maps are available in each OIE
report and are located at the end of the reports.
The outbreaks include both New South Wales and
Queensland, covering a considerable distance
along the coast, which hypothetically may be due
to a 2-day event in New South Wales. - Mod.PC]
