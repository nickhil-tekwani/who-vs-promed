PLAGUE, FATAL - ALGERIA (02): UNCONFIRMED, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The information (rumor) about the outbreak occurred in mountainous
borders between Tizi Ouzou and Bejaia was given by the daily paper in
Arabic language "Echorouk" in its on-line edition of 6 Jan 2009
<http://www.echoroukonline.com/ara/national/31104.html>. No serious
source, health professionals, even more the reference laboratory for
plague in Oran (Laboratory for the Plague of the Institute Pasteur of
Algeria in Oran) or that of in Algiers (medical bacteriology) had to
take seriously these rumors.

Furthermore, I would remind you of another bibliographical reference
on the plague epidemic of 2003: Bertherat E, Bekhoucha S, Chougrani
S, et al: Plague reappearance in Algeria after 50 years, 2003. Emerg
Infect Dis. 2007 Oct [20 Jan 2009]. Available from

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Chougrani for his comments regarding the
report of an outbreak of _Yersinia pestis_. It is certainly possible
that this is not a plague outbreak. ProMED would certainly like to
have more information regarding the etiology of this reported
cluster, whether naturally occurring or not. - Mod.LL]
