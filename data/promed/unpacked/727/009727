Anthrax outbreak in a Swedish beef cattle herd -- 1st case in 27
years: case report
----------------------------------------------------------------------
After 27 years with no detected cases, an outbreak of anthrax occurred
in a beef cattle herd in the south of Sweden. The outbreak was unusual
as it occurred in winter, in animals not exposed to meat-and-bone
meal, in a non-endemic country. The affected herd consisted of 90
animals, including calves and young stock.

The animals were kept in a barn on deep straw bedding and fed only
roughage. 7 animals died during 10 days, with no typical previous
clinical signs except fever.

The carcasses were reportedly normal in appearance, particularly as
regards rigor mortis, bleeding, and coagulation of the blood.
Subsequently, 3 more animals died and anthrax was suspected at
necropsy and confirmed by culture and PCR on blood samples. The
isolated strain was susceptible to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and
ampicillin.

Subtyping by MLVA [multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat
analysis] showed the strain to cluster with isolates in the A lineage
of _Bacillus anthracis_. Environmental samples from the holding were
all negative except for 2 soil samples taken from a spot where
infected carcasses had been kept until they were picked up for
transport. The most likely source of the infection was concluded to be
contaminated roughage, although this could not be substantiated by
laboratory analysis. The suspected feed was mixed with soil and dust
and originated from fields where flooding occurred the previous year,
followed by a dry summer with a very low water level in the river
allowing for the harvesting on soil usually not exposed.

In the early 1900s, animal carcasses are said to have been dumped in
this river during anthrax outbreaks and it is most likely that some
anthrax spores could remain in the area. The case indicates that
atypical cases in non-endemic areas may be missed to a larger extent
than previously thought. Field tests allowing a preliminary risk
assessment of animal carcasses would be helpful for increased
sensitivity of detection and prevention of further exposure to the
causative agent.

There are precedents for river sediment being contaminated, but those
are usually from washing waters from tanneries and wool/hair mills.
And historically for 'champs maudits' in southern France from dumped
carcasses. The outbreaks in Victoria, Australia, were from suspected
historic 19th century burial sites that had been dug down to when
leveling pastures for irrigated grazing, and they had apparent
downstream spread. So as a working hypothesis it is fine with me.
Forage traditionally gets contaminated when the ground is muddy during
harvesting but dust could do the same, but it is very difficult to
confirm in the laboratory, whether with left-over forage or river
sediment. When one is lucky, it nails the cause hypothesis. My only
nagging doubt is that 100 years is a long survival period for spores.

We recently had positive sediment from a cattle water trough on a west
Texas ranch some 3+ months after the animals died. Frankly we were
very surprised. Water trough contamination has only been reported in
southern Africa, but we do have vultures in Texas; they keenly feed on
dead cattle and then need to bathe.

A very thorough investigation; the Swedish team is to be
congratulated. - Mod MHJ]
