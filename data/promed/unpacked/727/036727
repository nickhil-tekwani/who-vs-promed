I think some clarification is needed concerning the posting headed "Ryegrass
Staggers". While I am not situated in South Australia and have only an
interest in plant toxicity, I am sure that the disease is ryegrass toxicity,
not ryegrass staggers. Importantly, this disease is associated with
ingestion of toxins (corynetoxins) present in _Lolium rigidum_ (annual
ryegrass) and not _L. perenne_ (perennial ryegrass).
The toxins of _L. rigidum_ have a seemingly miraculous origin, in that they
are produced by the bacterium _Rathayibacter toxicus_, which infects _L.
rigidum_ via its vector, the nematode _Anguina funesta_.
Thus, this is a plant toxicity quite distinct (phytologically,
toxicologically, clinically, and geographically) from that due to endophyte-
infected perennial ryegrass.

I think you will find that this is annual ryegrass toxicity rather than
ryegrass staggers.

The recent article titled "Ryegrass Staggers - Australia (South Australia)"
refers to a warning for annual ryegrass toxicity, (ARGT), rather than
ryegrass staggers caused by affected perennial ryegrass, as discussed. ARGT
is generally more severe causing greater stock losses, and is caused by
ryegrass infected with nematodes and certain _Corynebacterium_ species.

[From the article we received, with limited clinical signs, it appeared to
be ryegrass staggers, not ARGT. Thanks to our many Australian readers who
wrote to alert us that the event involved Annual Ryegrass toxicity (ARGT)
instead of Ryegrass staggers. They are certainly different syndromes with
different causes and consequences. - Mod.TG]
