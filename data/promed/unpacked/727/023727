Far from having diminished, the measles epidemic raging in France
since 2008 up to the present has involved more than 5000 cases. Since
2005, the health authorities had failed to anticipate that this
resurgence of measles would restore measles to the status of a
notifiable disease.

The French measles elimination program was established in 2005,
including setting a target of 95 percent vaccination coverage by 2
years of age and an annual incidence of less than 0.1 cases per 100
000 inhabitants.

However, l'Institut National de Veille Sanitaire (InVS) [the National
Institute of Health Surveillance] recorded that measles virus
circulation intensified in early 2010, with over 3000 cases between
January and August with a peak incidence in April [2010]. In the 1st
8 months of 2010, the proportion of hospitalized cases, among
reported cases, is 34 percent. This high figure is accounted for by a
higher rate of notification of hospitalized cases and an increased
incidence in infants under one year of age and in young adults, where
the complications of measles virus infection are more common and more severe.

Since the epidemic began, 4 people have died of measles complications
(2 were neurological cases and pulmonary disease in the other 2
cases). The circulation of the virus is affecting the entire
metropolitan area of France, with a high incidence observed in
certain departments (over 15 cases per 100 000 inhabitants),
reflecting clustering of cases in particular situations. The regions
most affected are the Midi-Pyrenees (14.10 cases per 100 000
inhabitants), Poitou-Charente (10.40), Limousin (9.72), Central
(8.04), Languedoc-Roussillon (7.12 ), Pays de Loire (7.06), Paca
(6.17), and Ile-de-France (5.53).

This situation is the result of inadequate vaccination (90 percent
overall only in 2007, but very heterogeneous across regions). Prompt
reporting of suspected cases will enable the health authorities to
react by carrying out vaccination around single cases or groups of
cases to achieve ring-fencing and restrict dissemination of the virus
particularly to vulnerable groups such as infants and
immuno-compromised individuals.

[Severe outbreaks of measles virus infection have been observed in
early 2010 throughout Europe (Bulgaria, Spain, Ireland, Germany), but
France is the country most severely affected, as revealed by these
data from the INVS. Few cases were reported previously during 2007.
The incidence of confirmed cases was 0.95/1000 in 2008 (604 cases),
rising to 2.5/1000 cases in 2009 (1544 cases). During the 1st 5
months of 2010, 1972 cases were registered [see previous ProMED-mail report].

In June 2010, the NVS reported that between January 2008 and 31 May
2010, 4120 cases of measles had been recorded in France. Now the
figure exceeds 5000 cases, and the epidemic shows no signs of abating.
