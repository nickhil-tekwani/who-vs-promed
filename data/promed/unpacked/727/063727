More than 110 amenity trees will have to be removed following the discovery of the contagious fireblight in the area. The Horticulture and Plants Health Division of the Department of Agriculture confirmed the disease in samples from a number of dead street trees. Since fireblight can impact agriculture and nurseries, EU law requires countries to act when an outbreak is detected.

Tools will be disinfected after work to avoid any further contamination; all tree parts will be transported in sealed trucks to be incinerated. Replacement trees will be planted at a total of 36 locations identified within the city. A variety of tree species will be used to avoid monocultures which might be similarly affected in the future by a disease outbreak.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the Rosaceae family are affected, mainly the sub-family Maloideae (synonym Pomoideae), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and wild species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections. The pathogen has been included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend, forming black hooks. Some fruits may show lesions. Cankers appear on branches and trunks; trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers) and with plant material (including budwood).

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks is increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is fraught with risks (see also ProMED posts 20200629.7519826, 20190320.6377319).

Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk. The pathogen is considered a major biosecurity risk in areas where it does not yet occur. A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin-resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.

Due to the large number of both crop and non-crop reservoir species, it is important to include amenity, ornamental, and wild species in phytosanitation and monitoring, as reported above, to prevent outbreaks in crops.
