Due to adverse weather (warm and wet) a lot of vegetables, also white
cabbages, are affected by many diseases.

It is more and more difficult to buy white cabbage of good quality
and in consequence its price is increasing. Probably the price won't
stop at this level because one can observe quite high demand for
white cabbage at the moment.

[Warm and humid conditions favour many pathogens, particularly fungi,
leading to increased disease pressure on crops. It is not possible to
guess which particular diseases are referred to above.
