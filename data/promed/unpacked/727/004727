Without denying that MDR-TB is a serious issue in Central Asia and indeed
in the rest of the world, we would like to provide some perspective to the
message of Dr. Flewelling.
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), in cooperation with the Ministry of Health,
runs a tuberculosis programme in response to the immediate medical and
public health needs in the Aral Sea Area. Since July 1998 there is a DOTS
programme in Karakalpakstan (Uzbekistan) and in April 1999 MSF extended its
DOTS programme to the adjacent region in Turkmenistan, Dashoguz velyat
(province).
An evaluation of the DOTS programme for the period July 1998 - July 1999 in
two districts in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan, showed a case notification
rate of 129.3 per 100 000 in Kungrad district and 264.1 per 100 000 in
Muynak district, the latter being the district immediately bordering the
former Sea where socioeconomic conditions are worst. These figures include
all new TB patients in the two districts that were enrolled in the DOTS
programme, which is the majority of all new TB patients.
If we would apply the mean incidence of the two districts (157.5 per 100
000) to all 1 500 000 inhabitants of Karakalpakstan, we would arrive at a
figure of 2363 new patients. Recognising that incidence is not prevalence
it still remains fair to say that the number of people with active TB in
Karakalpakstan can be better expressed in thousands than in millions.
Fortunately, most of the patients respond well to regular DOTS treatment.
The early sputum conversion rate (after 2-3 months of treatment) is 74.6%.
The overall cure rate in our first cohort is 75.3% (n=81), with 91.3% of
new (first-time) sputum smear positive patients cured (n=23). The overall
failure rate is where we get concerned: 12.3%. [1 The rule of thumb is
that a failure rate of more than 10% is an indicator for possible drug
resistance. There may of course be operational explanations for treatment
failures, and resistance patterns may be other than MDR (which is strictly
defined as coexisting INH and Rifampicine resistance). Nevertheless, the
failure rate prompted MSF to set up a study to accurately estimate the
resistance patterns of _M. tuberculosis_ in the areas where we work. This
study will start as of May this year.
The survey among 881 individuals Dr Flewelling is referring to was designed
to estimate the psychosocial impact of the environmental disaster in the
Aral Sea Area. Of the respondents with environmental concerns (n=357) 60%
would consider to move because of the environment; of these, almost 66%
would consider to move out of Karakalpakstan.[2
These results give an impressive indication of the social and public health
impact of the environmental disaster in the Aral Sea Area. Indeed, there is
a potential threat and spread of MDR-TB in this area. A public health
response should be based on accurate data on disease outcomes and
demographic trends.
