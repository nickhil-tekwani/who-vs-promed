West Nile virus lineage 2 north western Italy: mosquitoes, horses
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On 10 Sep 2014, West Nile virus (WNV) lineage 2 was confirmed by the OIE Reference Laboratory (Teramo) for the 1st time in Piedmont (north western Italy). It was detected in a pool of mosquitoes (_Culex pipiens_) collected in Alessandria Province at the end of August [2014]. The pool was analyzed by real time RT-PCR at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Piemonte Liguria Valle d'Aosta (IZS PLVA).

After this finding, 2 other pools of _Culex pipiens_ tested positive for WNV lineage 2, one from the same area (date of confirmation: 19 Sep 2014) and one from the neighbouring region of Liguria (Genoa airport; date of confirmation: 23 Oct 2014) respectively. Clinical cases of West Nile disease in humans and animals have never been reported in north western Italy so far.

Starting in 2011, entomological and risk based virological surveillance in Piedmont and Liguria has been stepped up to support the activities mandated by the Ministry of Health at the national level for the early detection of virus circulation before onset of the disease in humans and horses.

Following confirmation of the 1st case, control measures were quickly implemented, coordinated by IZS PLVA and with the collaboration of both the veterinary and human local health services, as provided by national legislation.

Serological tests (ELISA IgM) were performed on equine blood samples taken within 4 km [about 2.5 miles] of the collection sites of the positive pools. IgM were detected in a blood sample collected from a horse living near the 1st of those sites (date of confirmation: 6 Oct 2014), suggesting recent contact with the virus. Other serological investigations on equids are ongoing.

Finally, beginning on 16 Sep [2014], preventive measures were applied to donors living in Alessandria Province to secure blood transfusion safety, as provided by Italian legislation. The enforcement of these same measures is expected in Genoa Province.

[Although the above is the 1st report of WNV lineage 2 in north western Italy, that lineage was found to cause equine and human cases in adjoining regions in north western and north central Italy last year (2013). In August 2013, a human outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) infection was caused by WNV lineage 2 in northern Italy in the Veneto region (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130922.1960638). On 12 Sep 2013, the CESME (National Reference Centre for Exotic Diseases) confirmed 3 clinical equine outbreaks in the regions of Emilia Romagna and Lombardy. Phylogenetic analyses carried out on samples of the organs of a euthanized horse identified the strain as WNV lineage 2 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130917.1948938). It seems likely that WNV has become endemic in Italy. The onset of colder weather has probably halted WNV transmission for the current year (2014) and it will be interesting to see if it reappears in northern Italy during the summer and autumn of 2015.

ProMED-mail thanks Cristina Casalone for the above report. These firsthand reports are very valuable. This one helps to round out an understanding of the geographic distribution of WNV in Italy.
