Measles outbreak in Camborne
----------------------------
Parents in the Kerrier district are being warned about the dangers of
measles following an outbreak of the infection at St John's School in
Camborne. Over the last 2 weeks, 2 schoolchildren aged 6 and 7 have
been confirmed with the illness, with another 8 local children
suspected of having picked up the infection. All affected children
are at home and recovering well from the infection. The school has
worked hard to keep all parents informed since the outbreak was confirmed.

The Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Primary Care Trust (PCT) and
Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Health Protection Team have been working
closely with the school since confirmation of the 1st case last week
[21-27 Apr 2008]. Information letters with fact sheets have been sent
to all parents, informing them of the outbreak, symptoms of measles,
and advising that any children who have not had the MMR [measles,
mumps, and rubella] jab, should be immunised as soon as possible.

Anyone wanting to check their child's immunisation history or book an
appointment for immunisation should contact their GP surgery. GPs in
the area have also been asked to look out for children with the
symptoms of measles which include a fever, cough, red and painful
eyes, swollen glands, loss of appetite, and a rash that tends to
follow 3 to 4 days after onset of the other symptoms

Felicity Owen, director of public health for Cornwall and the Isles
of Scilly, said: "Measles is a very infectious bug. With the large
number of cases in and around London, it's really only been a matter
of time before Cornwall had an outbreak of measles. Now that it has
arrived, we've got the chance to act quickly to minimise the spread
of this infection "I'd appeal to any parents who have not yet had
their children vaccinated to get them protected as soon as possible.
I give this advice as a health professional and as a parent because I
have had to ensure the same protection for my daughter. MMR doesn't
only protect children; it also limits the chances of the virus
spreading more widely, for example to children who are too young to
have the vaccine."

[This report confirms that the relatively poor uptake of MMR vaccine
in the UK is exposing unvaccinated children to risk of measles virus
infection in rural communities as well as those in more densely
populated urban areas.

The map of the counties of the UK at

Cornwall at the extreme southwest of the UK.

The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map the UK at

town of Camborne on the north coast of Cornwall close to the extreme
westerly end of the county. - Mod.CP]
