Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Japan
----------------------------------------
Information received on 14 Nov 2014 from Dr Toshiro Kawashima, CVO, Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo, Japan

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 3 Nov 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 13 Nov 2014
Report date: 13 Nov 2014
Date event resolved: 13 Nov 2014
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 16 Apr 2014
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Yasugi-shi, Shimane
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Nov 2014
Outbreak status: resolved (13 Nov 2014)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Tundra swan: _Cygnus columbianus_ (Anatidae) / - / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: 2 fecal samples from _Cygnus columbianus_ (tundra swan)

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: It was confirmed on 13 Nov 2014 that 2 fecal samples from _Cygnus columbianus_ (tundra swan) were positive for H5N8 influenza A virus. The samples had been collected by Kyoto Sangyo University on 3 Nov 2014. RT-PCR tests and virus sequencing were conducted and the result indicated that a HA0 cleavage site of the amino acid sequence was consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (positive results from fecal samples only and no clinical cases).

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Kyoto Sangyo University (private laboratory) / tundra swan / gene sequencing / 13 Nov 2014 / Positive
Kyoto Sangyo University (private laboratory) / tundra swan / reverse transcription-polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) / 13 Nov 2014 / Positive
Kyoto Sangyo University (private laboratory) / tundra swan / virus isolation / 13 Nov 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

Highly pathogenic strain of bird flu virus detected in Shimane
--------------------------------------------------------------
A highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has been found in Yasugi, Shimane Prefecture, the Environment Ministry said on Friday [14 Nov 2014].

The H5N8 subtype was detected in 2 samples of droppings from migratory Bewick's swans that were collected [3 Nov 2014], the ministry said. While investigating the infection route, the ministry has designated 10 km [about 6.2 miles] around the spot as an intensive wild bird monitoring area.

The Shimane Prefectural Government is warning local poultry farms to take infection prevention measures. Officials said that so far no dead wild birds have been found that appear to have had the disease. Ministry officials said birds infected with the virus abroad must have flown to Japan to pass the winter, since most Bewick's swans seen in the country migrate from Arctic areas. Meanwhile, Tottori Prefecture, which lies close to Yasugi, held a meeting on Thursday evening [13 Nov 2014] to encourage the monitoring of deceased wild birds and to provide information to residents.

It is the 1st time bird flu has been found in wild bird droppings since a case involving a wild duck in Wakkanai, Hokkaido, in 2010, according to the Environment Ministry. [Note: See epidemiological comments in Japan's follow up report No. 3, December 2010, available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/reports/en_fup_0000010074_20101221_124954.pdf. - Mod.CRD]

The H5N8 subtype is the same virus strain of bird flu that has spread in South Korea starting in January [2014] and was also detected at a poultry farm in Kumamoto Prefecture in April [2014], ministry officials said.

Chickens at a farm in Yasugi were infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype in November 2010.

[Bewick's swan belongs to the species _Cygnus columbianus_ (tundra swan), subspecies _Cygnus columbianus bewickii_ (http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Cygnus_columbianus_bewickii/classification/#Cygnus_columbianus_bewickii).

"The Bewick's swans are commonly found in the Palaearctic habitat zone which includes many places in Asia, Europe, northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.

"The Bewick swans spend their breeding seasons in coastal lowlands of Siberia and in September they fly to the wintering grounds. Birds living near the Taimyr Peninsula normally winter in the British Isles, in Denmark and in the Netherlands. Birds living in eastern Russia migrate through Mongolia in the coastal regions of Japan, Korea and southern China as well as in Taiwan."

Subscribers may also refer to the comments made by Mod.AS in ProMED-mail post 20140417.2412249: "The role of migratory birds in the current HPAI H5N8 epizootic has already become (similarly to previous HPAI epizootics in Asia and elsewhere, including HPAI H5N1) a matter of controversy. For a different, recently published opinion on the role of wild migratory waterbirds in the epizootic, see http://www.eaaflyway.net/wild-migratory-waterbirds-are-the-victims-of-bird-flu-not-the-cause/."
