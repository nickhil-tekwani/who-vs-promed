Outbreak of Campylobacteriosis Associated with a Long-Distance Obstacle Adventure Race -- Nevada, October 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 12 Oct 2012, the Nellis Air Force Base Public Health Flight (Nellis Public Health), near Las Vegas, Nevada, was notified by the Mike O'Callaghan Federal Medical Center (MOFMC) emergency department (ED) of 3 active-duty military patients who went to the ED during 10-12 Oct 2012 with fever, vomiting, and hemorrhagic diarrhea. Initial interviews by clinical staff members indicated that all 3 patients had participated 6-7 Oct 2012 in a long-distance obstacle adventure race on a cattle ranch in Beatty, Nevada, in which competitors frequently fell face first into mud or had their heads submerged in surface water.

An investigation by Nellis Public Health, coordinated with local and state health officials, identified 22 cases (18 probable and 4 confirmed) of _Campylobacter coli_ infection among active-duty service members and civilians. A case-control study using data provided by patients and healthy persons who also had participated in the race showed a statistically significant association between inadvertent swallowing of muddy surface water during the race and campylobacteriosis (odds ratio = 19.4; p less than 0.001). Public health agencies and adventure race organizers should consider informing race attendees of the hazards of inadvertent ingestion of surface water.

_Campylobacter_ is one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness in the USA. Most persons who become ill with campylobacteriosis get diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, and fever within 2-5 days after exposure to the organism. The diarrhea can be bloody and can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The illness typically lasts about one week. Most cases occur as isolated, sporadic events and are usually associated with eating raw or undercooked poultry or from cross-contamination of other foods by these items (1).

Initial Epidemiologic Investigation
-----------------------------------
Because of the 3 cases of hemorrhagic diarrhea and the suspected source of infection reported to Nellis Public Health by ED staff members on 12 Oct 2012, definitions were developed to identify additional cases. A probable case was defined as diarrhea (3 or more loose stools in a 24-hour period), any episode of bloody diarrhea, or a combination of other gastrointestinal illness symptoms (e.g., abdominal cramps, nausea, or vomiting) in a person who participated in the obstacle adventure race during 6-7 Oct 2012. A confirmed case was defined as a probable case in a patient who also had laboratory isolation of _Campylobacter_ from a stool specimen.

An additional 19 patients, including both military and civilian personnel, were identified through active reporting by clinical staff members throughout MOFMC, a retrospective review of ED logs from 6-16 Oct 2012, and announcements to the Nellis community that encouraged self-identification. These efforts resulted in the identification of a total of 18 probable and 4 confirmed cases of illness. The investigation was limited to the population of the Nellis community, primarily because of the short incubation period for _Campylobacter_, the time lags between the event, symptom onset, and investigative findings, and the lack of additional cases reported to the Southern Nevada Health District by civilian health-care providers.

Among the 22 patients, the mean time from exposure to illness was 3.3 days (range = 1-9 days) [Figure: for figure and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]. The most common symptoms were diarrhea (18 of 19 patients), cramps (14 of 18 patients), fever (10 of 18 patients), and nausea (10 of 17 patients) (Table 1). 20 of the 22 patients sought medical care, and 2 reported their illness directly to Nellis Public Health without seeking care. One person with chronic gastrointestinal illness was hospitalized and treated with supportive care and intravenous antibiotics. All 22 patients made a full recovery.

To obtain information about the outbreak source, a 72-hour food and drinking water history questionnaire, which included questions on surface water exposure, was used to interview the ill persons. An analysis of the questionnaire data indicated that muddy surface water was a possible source of infection.

Case-Control Study
------------------
A case-control study was conducted to identify the source of infection. 24 healthy controls consisting of both military personnel and civilians who had been race participants were identified through contact investigation of the 22 case-patients. Nellis Public Health developed a new questionnaire for this investigation and administered it by telephone. The questionnaire evaluated the 22 case-patients and 24 controls with regard to their water consumption, food consumption, and environmental water exposure during the obstacle race.

Analysis of the case-control study identified a statistically significant association with "inadvertent swallowing of muddy water while competing" and _Campylobacter_ infection (odds ratio = 19.4; p less than 0.001) (Table 2). No significant association (p less than 0.05) was found with drinking water or eating food provided by race organizers, full body submersion in surface water, or getting surface water or mud in the eyes or mouth.

Laboratory Testing
------------------
Nellis Public Health requested stool specimens from all 22 patients and recommended cultures for _Shigella_, _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_, and _E. coli_ 0157:H7, plus testing for Shiga toxin and a search for ova and parasites. Initially, 4 stool specimens were obtained and each tested negative for all organisms, including _Campylobacter_. Persistence in obtaining 7 additional stool specimens resulted in 4 laboratory-confirmed cases positive for _Campylobacter_ by growth on selective media, oxidase testing, and Gram stain at the MOFMC laboratory. These 4 isolates were identified as hippurate-negative _Campylobacter_ (not _Campylobacter jejuni_) by the Southern Nevada Health District Public Health Laboratory and further identified as _Campylobacter coli_ by CDC.

Further characterization of the 4 _C. coli_ isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using SmaI and KpnI, multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing at CDC, identified all 4 as the same strain. This _C. coli_ outbreak strain was pansusceptible to the antimicrobials tested on the CDC national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system panel, and was assigned PulseNet patterns DBBS16.0134/ DBBK02.0272 and sequence type (ST) 6159. All specimens tested for _E. coli_ 0157:H7, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, Shiga toxin, and ova and parasite testing were negative.

Public Health Action
--------------------
Because commercial obstacle adventure races often are marketed to military personnel, Nellis Public Health provided educational outreach to the base population regarding the risk for disease when competing in such events. Emphasis was placed on the importance of hand washing and avoidance of exposure (especially ingestion) to contaminated surface water to prevent disease. This investigation also highlighted the importance of outbreak investigators continuing stool specimen collection, culture, and serial testing, even after initial results are negative.

Discussion
----------
Inadvertent ingestion of muddy surface water contaminated with cattle or swine feces during a long-distance obstacle adventure course competition likely resulted in an outbreak of campylobacteriosis in 22 participants. 4 of the 22 had laboratory-confirmed infections with _Campylobacter coli_.

High-intensity and competitive muddy obstacle adventure course races have surged in popularity across the USA, drawing an estimated 1.5 million participants in 2012 (2). These military-style adventure races attract high numbers of active-duty military personnel, along with young, active, extremely fit civilians. Persons typically are advised of the risks of participating and required to sign a liability waiver. Races are commonly held on farmlands where animal feces increase the risk for zoonotic disease transmission. Primary and emergency care providers, as well as public health professionals, should be aware that obstacle adventure race events could pose a heightened risk for outbreaks from inadvertent ingestion of contaminated water or mud and might consider outreach to educate participants on the health risks from oral contact with contaminated surface water or mud.

Documented common-source outbreaks of campylobacteriosis (especially those caused by _C. coli_) are rare, but have been previously attributed to contact with nonchlorinated water contaminated with the feces of cattle, poultry, and swine (3). _Campylobacter_ is an important cause of acute zoonotic bacterial diarrhea across all age groups. An estimated 5-14 percent of diarrhea cases worldwide are attributed to this organism, and approximately 2.4 million human cases of campylobacteriosis occur annually in the USA (4).

Participation in obstacle adventure races is relatively common among men and women of the American military. These events typically are held in rural areas and often include man-made slurry fields (a mixture of soil or clay and water) as race "challenges." In areas commonly frequented by animals (5), topsoil used in the creation of slurry fields can be contaminated with feces from domestic fowl (6) or ruminants (7) or wild animals. Competitors who run or ride through such areas might unintentionally swallow sufficient numbers of organisms to cause clinical disease. Fewer than 500 _Campylobacter_ organisms are needed to cause illness (1). The race described in this report was held on a cattle ranch, and participants reported seeing cattle and swine on or near the course on race day. Obstacle adventure race planners should consider building slurry field challenges where animal fecal contamination is not likely.

Although contaminated food and drinking water are more common sources of _Campylobacter_ outbreaks, previous outbreaks have been associated with unintentional ingestion of contaminated mud or muddy water. Campylobacteriosis outbreaks were associated with 2 bicycle races in Norway in the 1990s, in which unintentional ingestion of dirty water splashing from bicycle wheels was implicated (8). Similarly, ingestion of mud was found the most likely cause of _Campylobacter_ outbreaks during mountain bike races in Wales in 2008 (9) and in British Columbia in 2010 (10).

Warning participants in outdoor sporting events who might be exposed to fecally contaminated water or slurry that potentially serious diarrheal disease can result if ingested, even inadvertently, could reduce exposures to these pathogens. Event organizers should consider including the risk for waterborne outbreaks in their participant waivers and advise participants to avoid drinking or swallowing unsafe water. Participants also need to be encouraged to seek appropriate medical care for postcompetition diarrhea, especially bloody diarrhea, and to inform medical personnel of their exposure. In addition, health-care providers need to be aware of the association between these adventure races and the risk for exposure to _Campylobacter_ or other pathogens via contaminated water, mud, or slurry so that appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment can be provided to ill participants.

[Although not common, clusters of campylobacteriosis, particularly _C. coli_, can be associated with athletic events associated with the risk of exposure to mud which might be contaminated with droppings of animal hosts of the organism. It is important to recognize this epidemiological association in the correct circumstances to show that campylobacteriosis is not solely foodborne. - Mod.LL
