Cholera - Guatemala 981109195541
Date: Tue, 10 Nov 1998 12:29:14 -0600
From: "Jack E. Turner" <jeturner@idworld.net>

First report (25 cases) was from the San Antonio Express News
[Texas, USA page 7A, dated 8 Nov. 1998, by an Associated Press
Reporter named James Anderson.
The correction (no cases) was posted on "The Wire," the AP's internet
service at http://wire.ap.org/?FRONTID=HOME&SITE=TXSAE , dated 9 Nov.
1998, under the South and Central America section. When I finally
got in to their site (about noon today) I found no reference to
either story.
