Abstract
--------
Background. Zoonotic simian foamy viruses (SFVs) establish persistent infections in humans, for whom the long-term consequences for health are poorly described. Here, we aimed to characterize blood-cell phenotypes and plasma biomarkers associated with gorilla SFV infection in humans.

Methods. We used a case-control design to compare 15 Cameroonian hunters infected with gorilla SFV (cases) to 15 controls matched for age and ethnicity. A flow cytometry-based phenotypic study and quantification of plasma immune biomarkers were carried out on blood samples from all participants. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare cases and controls.

Results. Cases had a significantly higher percentage of CD8 T lymphocytes than controls (median: 17.6% vs. 13.7%, P = 0.03), but similar levels of B, NK, and CD4 T lymphocytes. Cases also had a lower proportion of recent CD4 thymic emigrants (10.9% vs. 18.6%, P = 0.05), a higher proportion of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) expressing memory CD4 T lymphocytes (31.7% vs. 24.7%, P = 0.01), and higher plasma levels of the soluble CD163 scavenger receptor (0.84 vs 0.59 Âµg/mL, P = 0.003) than controls.

Conclusion. We show, for the 1st time, that chronic infection with SFV is associated with T lymphocyte differentiation and monocyte activation.

[Local hunters in Cameroon have contact with gorillas and other non-human primates that are hunted for bush meat. These non-human primates can harbor simian foamy virus, and the virus can be transmitted to humans from infected animals. Interestingly, a previous study reported that a joint US and Cameroonian team led by Nathan Wolfe found that SFV was infecting people in Cameroon from at least 3 different hosts: gorillas and 2 monkey species, mandrills, and guenons (see Simian foamy virus, humans - Cameroon 20040319.0774 and reference below).

Simian foamy virus is a retrovirus now classified in the genus _Spumavirus_ of the family Retroviridae. The effect of simian foamy viruses on the health of infected non-human primates and humans is poorly understood. The report above provides insights into the virus-human host relationship, with a higher percentage of CD8 T lymphocytes and lower CD4 thymic emigrants. - Mod.TY
