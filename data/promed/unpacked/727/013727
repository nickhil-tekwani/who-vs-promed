The Department of Conservation (DOC) says a _Salmonella_ epidemic among
sparrows appears to have jumped the species and could pose a threat to
native birds.
Thousands of sparrows have been found dead in recent weeks, especially in
Otago and Canterbury. The deaths are thought to be linked to a sharp
increase in the number of cases of [salmonellosis in humans.
DOC's chief technical officer of biosecurity, Geoff Hicks, says dead
sparrows have now been found in cities throughout New Zealand and there
are reports of wax eyes [birds dying.
Hicks says samples are being analyzed by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry to establish whether the wax eyes are affected by the same
organism. He says there is some evidence native birds are dying.
Hicks has warned people eating or handling food at cafes and outdoor
eateries to take extra care, as the sparrows could pass the disease on to
humans.
Canterbury's Medical Officer of Health, Mal Brieseman, says the disease
has been found in some ducks and quails, and may be passed on to humans
through droppings or indirect contact. He says it is possible some humans
have been in contact with the disease through dogs or cats which have
eaten or played with sparrows.
Doctor Brieseman says the strain of _Salmonella_ is unusual to New Zealand
and he thinks it may have been introduced from overseas.
The National Center for Disease Investigation is compiling the laboratory
results to determine if the sparrows all died from the same strain of
_Salmonella_.
Roger Poland, the Animal Health Information coordinator for the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries, says the results of all of the tests need
to brought together so the exact strain of _Salmonella_ can be determined.
The National Center for Disease Investigation will report its findings to
MAF by next Wednesday.
