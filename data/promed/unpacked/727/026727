An update on the Balclutha Horse Syndrome
1. Etiology
Under extensive investigation. Laboratory tests carried out in New Zealand
so far detected no presence of an infectious agent. Further laboratory
tests will be carried out both in New Zealand and overseas (Plum Island,
USA and Pirbright, UK) and MAF expects results next week.
2. Epizootiology
2.1 Host
Horses are the only species affected. However, they all remain in good body
condition, appear healthy, have normal temperature, normal blood profile,
eat and behave normally.
2.2 Other species examined
Clinical examination of cattle (both dairy and beef), sheep and deer at the
surrounding properties within 3,5 km surveillance zone on two occasions. No
similar changes have been observed in these species.
3. Distribution
A similar condition was reported in New Zealand in 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992
and 1993 and, in all cases it occurred in autumn as this one has. Extensive
laboratory examinations excluded the presence of exotic agents (e.g
negative serology for Vesicular Stomatitis in 1993 episode), however in all
episodes no conclusive diagnosis has been made.
It appears that the similar condition may have been observed in horses in
other parts of the World (mainly United States).
This investigation began with a report on 10 March 1998 from a local
practitioner who examined horses which had ulcers in the mouth at the
Telford Equine Unit, Balclutha, South Island. A MAF veterinarian was
immediately despatched to investigate the case. Initial investigation
revealed that 11 of 26 horses on the Telford
Equine Unit had ulcers on the tongue and gums. Another 2 horses have been
reported to have *vesicles* on the tongue and gums. Three horses on the
neighbouring property also had ulcers in the oral cavity. These horses were
in contact with the Telford Equine Unit horses.
Measured response procedures were put in place on 10 March 1998. These
procedures are used for suspected exotic diseases which have the potential
for slower spread and less dramatic impact on international trade in
animals and animal products. The response is characterised by containment
of the disease, collection and analysis of information.
The Telford Equine Unit was quarantined on 10 March 1998 and remains under
quarantine. Trace back investigations to properties where the Telford
horses originated found no horses with the condition. However, trace
forward investigations revealed that 3 horses which have moved from the
Telford Equine Unit to Christchurch (the South Island) and 3 horses that
moved to Portabello (Otago Peninsula, South Island) showed a similar
condition. One horse that went to Wanaka (the South Island) showed no signs
of the disease, but other 2 horses that have been in-contact with this
horse were affected.
There are now 10 infected properties with 2 epidemics in progress, one
based at the Telford Equine Unit, another based on an endurance event held
on Bank*s Peninsula near Christchurch from 4-7 March 1998. All cases are
associated with either the Telford Equine Unit or the Endurance event.
Tracing has not been completed on the Endurance event, which may turn out
to be associated with Telford.
4. Transmission
If an infectious agent is involved then it appears that transmission occur
by direct contact between horses. Grazing in the next paddock and sharing
common water troughs appears to be sufficient for transmission. One horse
has been infected after spending 2 hours with an infected horse, and
sharing its feed bucket.
MAF suspect that a horse that left the Telford Equine Unit and went to a
Wanaka property has infected another horse on that property. However, the
horse does not show any signs of the condition which may suggest that a
carrier state or in apparent infection may exist.
5. Clinical signs
The condition in affected horses is manifested within 2 and 8 days. On two
occasions horses with the condition have been placed with uninfected
horses, and the uninfected horses have shown the signs when examined at 5
and 7 days. The condition appears to affect horses of all ages (2 to 22
years) although no foals have been exposed. All sexes (mares stallions and
geldings) and all exposed breeds ( Standard bred, Thoroughbred, Arab,
Appaloosa, Hanoverian, Quarter horse, pony, Dutch Draught, Irish and half
Clydesdale) have been found affected.

a) Early stages of the condition
Subsequent investigations were carried out on a daily basis on horses at
the Telford Equine Unit.
It has been found now there are 27 out of 29 horses affected, while two
horses showed no signs of the condition. The condition is characterised
initially by symmetrical red spots which appeared on the gums or inner lips
and symmetrical red circular erosions around the tusks. The lesions are
found on the inner lips, gums and tongue and appear to progress in the
following order:
1) macules (1-3mm),
2) papules (1-3 mm),
3) erosions (2-3mm),
4) round or irregular ulcers (2-3mm).
*Vesicles* had been reported in two of 85 horses examined. In one case the
*vesicle* was found in lower gum behind the canine tooth. The mucosa was
dry and the lesion was small (2.5 mm), raised, pale, almost translucent and
looked as if it had fluid in it. A syringe with needle was used to extract
the fluid out of the lesion and the fluid withdrawn looked red in colour.
No macules, papules or erosions were seen in this horse. The *vesicle*
could have been due to trauma from prickles as thistle prickles have been
noted in the mucosa of the inside of the lip. The area where the *vesicle*
was seen is in a different area to where erosions were seen in the other
horses.
In another case three to four *vesicles* were reported to have been found
in the gum mucosa of one horse. The MAF investigating veterinarian was not
sure whether they were ruptured vesicles or trauma lumps. They had a yellow
ragged edge and were located in the area between the incisors and molars.
No intact *vesicles* were seen, when this horse was examined the following
day. MAF does not believe that vesicles are involved in this syndrome and
the above observations may have been incidental findings.
b) Later stages of the condition
At the later stage, ulcers and erosions increase in size, become irregular
in shape and may coalesce. Circular erosions on outside lips were
associated with hair follicles at the mucosal skin margin and ulcers of the
gums lips and tongue. Early and later stage lesions can appear concurrently
in the same mouth. All examined horses had erosions in the oral cavity, and
some of them had ulcers. No horses where lesions healed have yet been
noted although scar tissue has been noted in some horse. Three horses on
the Telford Equine Unit are being mouth mapped and photographed each day
to provide a record of lesion progression.
No lesions have been observed on other mucous membranes (vulva, penis,
conjunctiva, nasal mucosa) or skin.
Horses appear healthy and behave normally. They all are afebrile (37 to
38.3oC) to date. The new cases occurring on the 14/3/98 have had normal
temperatures for the previous 3 days. Three or four horses had possible
enlargement of submaxillary lymph nodes.
6. Diagnosis
A number of samples (primarily tissue scrapings) have been examined under
the electron microscope and no virus particles were seen. There has been
no cytopathic effect noted in cell cultures (Vero, Equine foetal
kidney,Bovine foetal lung and RK13) after 5 days incubation. No
chicken-embryo deaths have been noted after 5 days following inoculation of
10 day old embryos by the allantoic route. Sixteen EDTA blood samples have
been tested in the pestivirus antigen capture ELISA with negative results.
Buffy coats from the bloods have been inoculated onto Equine foetal kidney
and RK13 cells to check for herpes viruses. A further 8 scraping from oral
lesions have been received and are to inoculated onto Vero,equine foetal
kidney and RK13 cells.
Samples collected from affected horses are en route to the Plum Island, USA
and Pirbright, UK for further tests.
Food and water samples have been collected and laboratory tests are underway.
It is possible that condition is endemic in New Zealand. However, MAF will
continue with investigations in the attempt to establish the diagnosis and
will keep the Telford Equine Unit under quarantine until results from the
USA and the United Kingdom become available.
7. Differential diagnosis
Toxic causes, contact irritants, allergies, blister beetle or
photosensitivities have been ruled out. Plant or macro fungal toxicity is
not considered likely due to the absence of these agents on the Telford
Equine Unit. The lesions are not indicative of a primary bacterial infection.
MAF has organised that the samples collected from affected horses be sent
to Plum Island, USA and Pirbright, UK, for testing for Vesicular Stomatitis
and Vesicular Exanthema although these diseases are considered highly
unlikely to be involved for the following reasons:
a) Vesicular Stomatitis
Vesicular stomatitis has never been reported outside the Americas.
Vesicular stomatitis usually occur in spring.
Note: The condition noted in New Zealand on this and previous occasions is
has been noted in late summer/autumn.
Wilks C.R. (In Coetzer et all.:Infectious Diseases of Livestock with
Special Reference to Southern Africa, Oxford University Press, p.563-565,
1994) states that * Vesicular Stomatitis is a viral disease of horses,
mules, cattle and pigs, characterised by vesicular lesions in the oral
mucosa and the skin of the coronary band of the feet. Initial clinical
signs appear after 24-72 hours and manifest as salivation in cattle and
horses and frequently lameness in pigs. This is accompanied by fever
(40-41,5oC).
Within 24 hours of infection gross changes are apparent as raised and
thickened, blanched areas of the mucosa or skin. Vesicles are seen within
24 hours and appear as raised, circumscribed and fluid-filled blisters
measuring 5-20 mm in diameter. The vesicles are fragile and rupture within
hours to form deep red ulcers 20-30 mm in diameter bordered by gray tags of
necrotic epithelium. Erosions may extend and coalesce, leading to the
sloughing of large areas of epithelium, particularly of the tongue*.
It is MAF*s opinion that it is highly unlikely that the condition seen, and
described above in horses in New Zealand could possibly relate to infection
by the viruses causing Vesicular Stomatitis. Although preliminary
examinations by electron microscopy have not detected presence of
rhabdovirus, MAF will wait for the official laboratory results from Plum
Island and Pirbright.
b) Vesicular Exanthema
Vesicular exanthema has been diagnosed for the first time in 1932 in the
USA where the disease was finally eradicated 1956. Meanwhile, it has been
diagnosed in Honolulu (1946, 1947, 1949) and in Iceland (1995). In all
these cases it is believed that the infection was introduced from the USA.
The last recorded outbreak of Vesicular Exanthema occurred in 1976 in
California, USA.
Thomson C.R. (In Coetzer et all.:Infectious Diseases of Livestock with
Special Reference to Southern Africa, Oxford University Press, p.774-776,
1994) states that * apart from being found in marine animals, pigs and mink
fed on seal meat, caliciviruses [broadly classified as Vesicular Exanthema
of Swine (SVS) and San Miguel sea-lion viruses(SMS) have also been
recovered from or identified in snakes, toads, five specimens of primates
and cattle. Antibodies have been detected in the sear of feral pigs,
donkeys, water buffaloes, foxes, five species of whales and humans. Horses
and monkeys are apparently susceptible to experimental infection with
vesicular Exanthema of Swine virus, although this finding conflicts with
earlier reports. Feline caliciviruses which cause an important disease in
cats are distinct from the VES and SMS viruses*.
VES is an acute febrile disease, primarily of pigs and characterised by
fever (40,5-41,5oC) and in appetence.
Note: All horses examined in the present investigation in New Zealand have
been found to be afebrile.

MAF believes that extensive laboratory examinations carried out at the
Central Animal Health Laboratory, Wallaceville on various cell cultures and
embryonated eggs will yield an infectious agent, if present. Paired sera
from all affected horses will be tested against the range of possible
causative agents (e.g. EHV types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).
