Keeping Your Cat Safe From Rabies
---------------------------------
Cats are victims of rabies more than any other domestic pet in the
U.S. Know the signs to protect your pet. In a less-than-heartening
sign of spring, the New York City Department of Health and Hygiene
confirmed the city's 1st case of rabies in a feline for 2010.

The statement was released on 12 March 2010, and documents the 69th
case of rabies in the 5 boroughs this year. However, those 1st 68
cases were all documented in raccoons.

"Since 1992, when raccoon rabies first appeared in New York City
(NYC), there have been 12 cats that have tested positive for rabies.
10 were strays. There has not been a rabid dog reported in NYC in
more than 50 years," the released statement outlined. "There
continues to be an outbreak of raccoon rabies in and around Central
Park in Manhattan for which a Trap, Vaccinate and Release program has
been implemented to help prevent the further spread of the virus."

While the Big Apple might be a long way off from where your pets hang
out, this case is a classic illustration of which domestic animals
are most at risk: cats. Obviously, any pet that is not vaccinated
against the virus is at a higher risk for infection. But because cats
are often allowed to roam outdoors, they are more likely to encounter
an infected wild animal, or an infected stray dog or cat.

Feral cat colonies remain a reservoir host for the rabies virus,
despite widespread vaccination programs, the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) reports. The ASPCA also
points out that rabies is reported in cats more than in any domestic
species in the United States.

So what can you do to keep your feline friend, yourself, and your
canine companion safe?

1. Avoid contact with wild animals.

2. Make sure your pets -- dog or cat -- are up-to-date on their
rabies vaccinations.

3. Avoid leaving your pets outdoors unattended and feed them inside.

4. Avoid trying to separate animals that are fighting.

5. Contact the veterinarian if your pet has been in contact with an
animal that might be rabid.

Rabies is perhaps one of the best-known animal viruses, mostly
because of the fear it incites. As there is no cure for the disease,
once signs appear, it is close to 100 percent fatal. The good news is
that being bitten by a rabid animal does not mean the pet will always
become infected. Humans, cats, and dogs are only mildly susceptible
to the disease, and officials estimate that about 15 percent of
exposed people will contract the disease.

If you are a veterinarian or someone who works closely with wildlife
or animals, check with your doctor to see if you are considered a
"high-risk person" for whom a vaccine is available. But for the rest
of us, the most important precautions are: always handle a pet that
might have been bitten by a rabid animal with gloves, see your doctor
immediately to get a series of vaccines if you do get bitten, and
call animal control if you see an animal displaying unusual behavior
-- such as nocturnal animals out in the day, or animals with
unabashed fear of humans.

Officials at the ASPCA also suggest that cat owners become more
rabies-aware -- citing knowledge as the 1st step to prevention -- and
released this information to Zootoo Pet News:

What are the general signs of rabies?

Animals will not show signs immediately following exposure to a rabid
animal. Signs can be varied and can take months to develop. Classic
signs of rabies in cats are changes in behavior (including
aggression, restlessness and lethargy), increased vocalization, loss
of appetite, weakness, disorientation, paralysis, and seizures.

How is rabies diagnosed?

There is no accurate test to diagnose rabies in live animals. The
direct fluorescent antibody test is the most accurate test for
diagnosis, but it can only be performed after the death of the
animal. The rabies virus can incubate in a cat's body anywhere from
just one week to more than a year before becoming active. When the
virus does become active, signs appear quickly.

What if my cat is up-to-date on vaccines and encounters a rabid animal?

A cat who is up-to-date with his vaccinations and who has been bitten
by a possibly rabid animal should also be given a rabies booster
vaccine immediately and kept under observation for 45 days. [This is
a relatively standard time across many states and is recommended in
the Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control, 2007,
published by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians

[Merritt Clifton was asked to provide a response to the article, as
he has had much experience with raccoons and feral cats, especially
in the face of rabies outbreaks. - Mod.TG]

Cats, feral or otherwise, may become rabid from contact with bats,
raccoons, or skunks, in that order of likelihood.

Bats are the most frequent vector for cats becoming infected because
cats cannot resist playing with dead and dying bats if they fall to
the ground. Cats normally don't catch healthy bats because cats don't
fly and bats rarely land, other than to hang upside down from places
where cats cannot go, so if you see a cat with a bat, it is wise to
presume that the bat may be rabid and that the cat is at risk.

Cats and raccoons normally co-exist without direct conflict. If there
is conflict, as when a particularly macho tom cat decides to
challenge a raccoon, the raccoon usually slugs the cat galley-west
with a forepaw, sometimes knocking out an eye, and that ends the
trouble. Some raccoons will scavenge road-killed cats, and some will
raid a kitten nest, but in my experience these are rare cases. More
often cats and raccoons will eat peaceably side by side at the same dumpster.

Cats and skunks co-exist so well that for several years in Quebec I
fed a skunk along with my woodshed cats, and never had any dispute
among them, except once when a randy young tom tried to mount the
skunk. The aftermath enabled me to catch the tom for neutering, after
he was thoroughly bathed in a solution of hydrogen peroxide and
dish-washing soap.

Cat contact with foxes is relatively unlikely, because foxes will eat
cats or kittens, if they get the chance, and most cats accordingly
avoid foxes and any habitat that smells of foxes. This is also
important to know because the likelihood of a cat becoming rabid is
directly related to the species the cat might encounter. If you have
rabies among bats, raccoons, or skunks in proximity to either feral
cats or wandering pet cats, you have to assume that the cats are at high risk.

Fortunately it isn't all that hard to trap, vaccinate, and sterilize
feral cats. Returned to their habitat afterward, they form an
effective vaccinated barrier against roaming pet cats becoming
infected. This is because roaming pet cats are most likely to be
roaming for social reasons. They go looking for other cats. If they
find other cats, they hang out with them. If those cats are
vaccinated, they are safe.

If roaming pet cats don't find companionship in one place, they will
wander on to another, and the more they wander, the greater their
chance of encountering rabid wildlife.

Conversely, if you trap out the feral cats but do not return them to
their habitat, the food supply that they formerly consumed will
become available to other species, who may be potential rabies
vectors. For example, if cats abandon a good supply of mice, and
foxes can expand into the vicinity, you may get foxes and then fox rabies.

If cats abandon a good supply of edible refuse, raccoons may take it
over completely, instead of just sharing it. If feral cats are
regularly fed kibble by someone who doesn't stick around to ensure
that cats consume it, and then the cats are removed, skunks may take
over the kibble supply.

Only if you remove the food source at the same time as the cats are
you likely to actually eliminate the risk of having a rabies vector.

[This moderator wishes to thank Merritt Clifton for his insights on
the feral cat, raccoon, and skunk interactions.

While New York City is trapping and vaccinating the raccoons, there
is concern they could be vaccinating raccoons that are incubating the
disease. My experience has been that raccoons exposed to the rabies
virus are quickly and noticeably affected. However, this may not be
the case for all raccoons, and it may be affected by the strain of
rabies. Nevertheless, ProMED-mail would like to hear from officials
in New York City who designed and implemented the plan of trap,
vaccinate, release and how they are preventing vaccinating a raccoon
which is incubating the rabies virus disease? - Mod.TG]
