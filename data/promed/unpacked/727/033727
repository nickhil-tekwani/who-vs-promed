The viral infection Japanese encephalitis has claimed more than 500
lives in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar so far this year [2009], with
children facing the brunt of the disease.

According to a union health ministry document, Uttar Pradesh is the
worst affected with 23 of its districts having been declared endemic.
"23 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh are endemic to Japanese
encephalitis," the document said, adding that till 16 Nov 2009, 476
people have died due to the disease in the state.

In Bihar, the number of deaths is at least 30 this year [2009]. Over
140 are still undergoing treatment for this viral disease in the
state.

Domestic pigs and wild birds are reservoirs of the Japanese
encephalitis virus. The virus is transmitted by infective bites of
female mosquitoes, mainly belonging to _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_,
_Culex vishnui_, and the _Culex pseudovishnui_ group.

The disease gets its name as the virus was first detected in Japan.

The ministry document said that 7 districts in Gorakhpur and Basti
division in Uttar Pradesh -- Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Deoria,
Maharajganj, Sant Kabir Nagar, Basti, and Siddarth Nagar --
contribute over 90 percent of the Japanese encephalitis deaths in the
state.

Official statistics said that last year [2008], 537 people lost their
lives due to the disease in the state. The ministry also believes
that it is children in the age bracket of 1-15 years who are facing
the maximum difficulty due to the disease.

To curb the spread, the health ministry claims that it has vaccinated
83 percent of the children belonging to the high risk group in 21 of
the 23 endemic districts of Uttar Pradesh.

One of the major problems facing Uttar Pradesh is wastage of vaccine
due to its over-exposure to heat. This year [2009] alone, the state
refused to use over a million doses of such vaccines due to the same
problem.

[Northeastern India, and especially Uttar Pradesh state, has had a
difficult time with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections in
2009. Interestingly, this report does not mention the virologically
undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome as have previous reports from
Uttar Pradesh over the past 3 months. The comments on failure to
maintain a cold chain for the vaccine are troublesome. Loss of over a
million doses of JEV vaccine is unfortunate, indeed, given the
ongoing outbreak in the state. No mention of sequelae in survivors
has been given in any JEV reports from India this year (2009).
