China's agricultural authorities said Thursday [4 Apr 2013] the infectious H7N9 avian flu virus has been detected from pigeon samples collected at a marketplace in Shanghai, as the country reported its 4th death from H7N9 infection.

The samples were collected at a marketplace selling agricultural products in the Songjiang District of Shanghai and tested H7N9 positive by the national avian flu reference laboratory, according to a statement by the Ministry of Agriculture.

After gene sequence analysis, the national avian flu reference laboratory concluded that the strain of the H7N9 virus found on pigeons was highly congenetic with those found on persons infected with H7N9 virus.

The ministry has ordered beefed-up monitoring of H7N9 bird flu virus in more areas.

Also on Thursday [4 Apr 2013], 3 more suspected H7N9 cases were reported in Shanghai, where 3 H7N9 human infection cases have been confirmed. China has thus far confirmed 11 human cases of H7N9 infections.

China's health authorities have promised transparency and cooperation to the World Health Organization (WHO) in regards to human infections of the new strain of bird flu.

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday [3 Apr 2013] that no human-to-human transmission of H7N9 has been discovered, and no epidemiological connection between these cases has been found.

[The presence of this virus in pigeons would indicate that the virus is easily available in the bird population, whether of domestic flocks or peri-domestic wild birds in an urban or rural environment. - Mod.MHJ]

[Now the question is: did the poultry get it from the pigeons or the other way round? Were the pigeon samples feces or internal organs?

Pigeons could be eliminated around wet markets by laying down poisoned corn bait. I doubt there would be an outcry from animal rights activists, given the circumstances.

But see:
"Instead of attacking wild birds for our new disease problems, a far more cost effective approach should focus on keeping wild animals separate in the places where they often commingle: in wildlife markets and international trade, according to wildlife health experts from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in a [2007] issue of the prestigious Journal of Wildlife Diseases."
