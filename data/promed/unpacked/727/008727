we are conducting a field study for a new 10 minute direct specimen
diagnostic test kit (ImmunoCard STAT! STEC O157 _E. coli_). If your lab is
involved in an outbreak or has samples from a RECENT outbreak, or gets
these types of specimens routinely with a reasonable incidence of O157,
please contact:
