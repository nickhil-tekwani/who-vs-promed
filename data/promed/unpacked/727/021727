[Crises due to armed conflict, forced displacement, and natural disasters result in excess morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases in displaced and refugee populations. Refugees are at particular risk for transmittable diseases for a variety of reasons. The circumstances of their journey often make it impossible to take the simplest measures for hygiene, such as regular hand washing. Refugees regularly flee in smaller or larger groups, many live in extremely confined conditions or refugee camps with many other people sharing a small space. In the countries of arrival, they are often housed in collective accommodations that seem to facilitate the spread of infectious and parasitic diseases. High prevalence rates of scabies infestation, reports of outbreaks of measles and varicella, and protozoa infections have been described in this population. Acute respiratory infections are among refugees' most common reasons for seeking primary medical care.

Currently, the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a particular risk to marginalized populations, as a result, migrant and refugee populations are over-represented in terms of COVID-19 prevalence and mortality. Therefore, equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines should be the goal. When refugee camps are experiencing outbreaks, its spread can be very rapid. High prevalence rates for acute respiratory infections found in migrants and residents of refugeee camps strongly suggest the need to strictly implement measures such as hand hygiene and distance rules to avoid infections, especially with COVID-19, along with prevention of overcrowding in refugee camps. - Mod.UBA
