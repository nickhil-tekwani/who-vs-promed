Circling high over Lake Onalaska, 2 eagles fought over an American
coot in one of the eagles' talons. The eagle lost its grip, and the
coot plunged into the water near Broken Gun Island. It bobbed to the
surface but made little effort to escape as the eagles swooped
overhead. "He's probably sick and they know it. It's easy pickings
around here," said Calvin Gehri, a biological technician with the US
Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) La Crosse District.

The dying coot would soon join the thousands of dead waterfowl Gehri
and other refuge staff have collected along the shores of the
Mississippi between Dresbach, Minnesota, and northern Iowa.

More than 25 000 birds -- mostly coots and scaup -- have died on the
upper Mississippi River since 2002 as a result of eating faucet
snails that carry an intestinal parasite, according to federal
wildlife officials. From 2005 to 2006, there was a 16-fold increase
in bird deaths in pools 8 and 9. Last fall [2006], there were an
estimated 5000 bird deaths in the area between La Crescent,
Minnesota, and MacGregor, Iowa.

Faucet snails are found along the Mississippi between Nelson,
Wisconsin, and Fulton, Illinois, but the highest concentration of the
infected snails is in the La Crosse region. More recently, they've
been found downriver as well.

Wildlife experts are trying to figure out how to get rid of the
snails without affecting native snails. Last year [2006], the FWS
tried covering underwater rocks with sand and gravel in an attempt to
reduce the snails' habitat.

There aren't enough snails between Wabasha, Minn., and Winona to
create a large die-off of birds, said Mary Stefanski, Winona district
manager for the FWS. She said the problem snails tend to follow the
water downstream.

The exotic snails came to the Great Lakes region from Eastern Europe
in the late 1800s. The species got its name when it invaded municipal
water systems, Gehri said. It's unknown how the snails got into the
Mississippi, though most aquatic invaders are carried in ships' ballast water.

Wildlife staff 1st noticed a water bird die-off in Lake Onalaska in
2002, said Jim Nissen, La Crosse FWS district manager. Since then,
there has been a multi-agency effort to track down the faucet snail trail.

Scientists from the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health
Center and Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center are working
with local agencies to monitor the faucet snail population.
Professors and students from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse
and Minnesota State College-Mankato have conducted sideline studies
on distribution.

They've discovered that 2 varieties of trematodes, a kind of fluke
worm, infect the snails, which can host up to 100 of the parasites;
birds can get a lethal dose in less than 24 hours of feeding and die
within 3 to 8 days.

Infected birds die from blood loss, shock from a chemical imbalance,
or a stomach infection. Nissan said there's no way to save an infected bird.

"It's pretty sad when you see a sick one. They can't swim. They can't
dive," Gehri said. "Some are like a decoy and you can pick (them) up
with your bare hands. Some will maybe flock a bit, but they're so
sick it's all they can do."

As with most exotic species, eradication is difficult without
disturbing native species. But Gehri said the declining bird
population is cause for concern.

Last week, Gheri collected about 200 dead coots along the bank of
Broken Gun Island. On Thursday [25 Oct 2007], he picked up 160, a
fraction of the birds floating among wild celery and algae.

Carcasses dropped by eagles hung in trees on the island, and feathers
littered the shore.

Predatory birds are apparently immune to the parasite, scientists
say. About 25 eagles loomed above, waiting for a 2nd go at the coots
Gheri didn't pick up.

The dying coot that dropped from an eagle's talons slowly disappeared
around the island's corner. When Gehri circled the island, it was gone.

[Snails are often the intermediate host for parasites. The snails
seem to do well, but the individual that consumes the snail often
suffers greatly. Here is another case of the snail doing well.

What a challenge to try and find a way to harm the exotic snails, and
not the native snails. Perhaps a parasiticide to target the trematode?
