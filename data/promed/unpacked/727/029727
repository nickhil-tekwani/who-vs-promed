A research team that analyzed the strain of H3N8 influenza virus linked to a baby seal die-off in New England last year [2011, see ProMED-mail archived reports below] found that it originated in birds and has adapted to mammals, signalling a possible threat to humans and animals alike. The study, which appeared today [31 Jul 2012] in the mBio, the online journal of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), also revealed mutations that are known to make flu viruses more transmissible and able to cause severe disease. [Anthony SJ, St Leger JA, Pugliares K, et al. Emergence of fatal avian influenza in New England harbor seals. mBio 31 Jul 2012, http://mbio.asm.org/content/3/4/e00166-12.full.]

In December 2011, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced that an investigation of 162 seal deaths that fall revealed the H3N8 virus in samples from all 5 animals studied, the 1st time the strain had been linked to large-scale mortality in marine mammals. The infected seals had severe pneumonia and skin lesions, and most of them were less than 6 months old.

Influenza H3N8 is typically associated with wild birds, but in 2005, researchers found that a type of the strain that emerged in racing greyhounds had jumped from horses to dogs. The illness in dogs is generally mild and hasn't posed any known danger to humans. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of samples from the seals found that the virus was an avian subtype that was similar to one that has infected North American waterfowl since 2002 but has adapted to mammals with mutations that make it more transmissible and pathogenic. Scientists gave the new virus the provisional name influenza A/harbor seal/Massachusetts/1/2011. The group found mutations previously detected in H5N1 viruses that infected humans and wrote that the H3N8 virus in seals had acquired the ability to bind sialic acid receptors that are commonly found in mammal respiratory tracts. Though the mutations are required for cell entry and replication in mammals, researchers wrote that more studies are needed to assess their functional significance. Adaptations found in the study suggest the virus may be able to persist in seals and evolve into a new H3N8 clade, similar to what occurred with the canine and equine viruses, they reported.

The researchers concluded that natural emergence of a pathogenic virus that can transmit between mammals, and in a species that can be infected with multiple flu subtypes, is considered a significant threat to wildlife and human health. They added that monitoring viruses such as the H3N8 strain found in seals is crucial, because it can help scientists better predict the emergence of new strains and prevent future pandemics.

Ruben Donis, PhD, chief of the molecular virology and vaccines branch in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Influenza Division told CIDRAP News that the CDC received viral samples obtained from the seals several months ago and analyzed them with additional methods as part of its own risk assessment. He said overall, the virus appears to pose a low risk to humans with a low probability of causing zoonotic infections.

CDC officials have discussed issues surrounding the new virus with wildlife rescue teams and have emphasized precautions that personnel should take when working with the animals and requested that they obtain samples if they see seals that appear to have pneumonia. "We plan to keep in touch and follow up," Donis said.

Ian Lipkin, MD, director of Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity and coauthor of the mBio study, said in a university press release that the findings reinforce the importance of wildlife surveillance. "HIV/AIDS, SARS, West Nile, Nipah, and influenza are all examples of emerging infectious diseases that originated in animals. Any outbreak of disease in domestic animals or wildlife, while an immediate threat to wildlife conservation, must also be considered potentially hazardous to humans," he said.

[To put these observations in perspective, despite circulation of influenza A viruses of 16 HA types in billions of birds over a very long time span, the 4 pandemics in the last century have been restricted to influenza viruses bearing the HA types H1, H2 or H3. Decades ago, many experts predicted that influenza pandemics could be explained by "recycling" of a small number of HAs in new human generations. Most recently, this belief has been expanded to posit that the other HA types (including H5) are fundamentally incapable of adapting to humans, being selected against by biological constraints or unappreciated selection pressures.

Despite widespread influenza virus circulation and dynamic evolution of the human-animal interface, with many billions of quasi-species, mutations and gene constellations circulating, only 4 influenza pandemics have occurred in the last century, and in the 3 of those with a known viral origin, the viruses resulted from reassortment of pre-existing human or swine viruses, not by mutation or adaptation of existing avian viruses. This suggests that the _de novo_ emergence of a human pandemic influenza virus is an extremely rare event that is not easily achieved in nature. (From: Morens, Subbaro and Taubenberger, Nature doi:10.1038/natur11170, Nature 21 Jun 2012).

It remains to be seen whether the H3N8 virus, common in birds, which has appeared sporadically in canines, equines, and now in seals, will pose any greater threat to the human population.
