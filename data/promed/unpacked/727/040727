Anthrax discovery closes village hall in Borders
------------------------------------------------
Health chiefs investigating the death of a Scot from anthrax ordered the
closure of a village hall yesterday [17 Nov 2006] after the discovery of
spores of the killer disease.
A concert planned for Smailholm village hall, Roxburgh-shire, was last night
[17 Nov 2006] switched to a nearby parish church hall. NHS Borders said the
100-capacity, stone-built hall would be closed while its decontamination is
arranged. The hall was among a number of properties tested in the Borders
for anthrax after the death in July 2006 of Pascal Norris, who lived 30
miles away at the hamlet of Stobs, near Hawick. He made bongo drums using
animal skins as a pastime, and the hall was used by a Smailholm woman to run
classes in African drumming.
Kathleen Daniels, the hall's secretary, said: "Everyone is quite relaxed
about the whole thing." Health officials said the risk to the public was
extremely low.
A spokesman for NHS Borders said: "As part of the ongoing investigation,
samples were taken from a number of properties in the Borders. From the
testing of these samples, minute traces of anthrax spores have been detected
in Smailholm village hall. As a precautionary measure, the hall will be
closed to further use pending a decision on the appropriate decontamination
strategy for the property."

[The authorities are clearly investigating Norris's July 2006 death with all
deliberate speed, in this instance checking on sites where African drums may
have been beaten. As this village hall will have been used countless times
in the interim, the risk must be minimal, but decontamination is certainly
wise. It would be interesting to know whether this isolate was of the same
genetic strain as the earlier one associated with the July 2006 death. If
the drummers were using drums purchased independently or were drums made
earlier in the year by Norris, one might suspect it to be of a different
strain. - Mod.MHJ]
