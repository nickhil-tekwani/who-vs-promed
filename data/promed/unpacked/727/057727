Bird flu is here
----------------
The bird flu virus H5N1 was detected Friday [1 Feb 2008] in 2 chicken farms
in Gadap town that have now been sealed off, according to officials.

In view of the outbreak about 5000 chickens were culled and dumped as a
safety precaution while steps are being taken to slaughter more infected
chickens. Sindh poultry research director Dr Akbar Ali Soomro confirmed the
spread of bird flu.

Officials claimed that workers at the affected farm would be quarantined
for a week to check any spread of the disease. "Officials from the Ministry
of Food and Agriculture in Islamabad declared an alert across the country
and ordered authorities to check for any signs of bird flu in other parts
of the country," officials said. "We have sealed a one-kilometer area
around the affected farm. Chickens and people have been banned from moving
out of the area," they added.

In Pakistan, 8 cases of bird flu were confirmed in the North West Frontier
Province (NWFP) last December [2007]. Around 6 patients recovered while one
died and one remained under medical supervision in Abbotabad and Mansehra.

"This is the 1st ever presence of bird flu in Sindh. Previously it had been
declared prevalent in Islamabad, Abbotabad and Mansehra regions," Soomro said.

The reported outbreak of bird flu (H5N1) in Karachi will not pose any
threat to human health as the suspected birds have already been killed and
the site of incident has been disinfected and sealed, traders said Friday
[1 Feb 2008].

Staff report adds: Pakistan Poultry Association central convener Abdul
Maroof Siddiqui said that consumers' confidence in commercial poultry meat
would decline in case of a bird flu outbreak. Following quarantine, the
affected site has been disinfected and the remaining birds have been
killed. In Gadap, about 5000 birds were killed and buried in order to avoid
any danger of its spread to other farms, he said.

"Traditionally, there is no harm in eating chickens as we cook them at high
temperatures and, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), cooking
at high temperatures is safe," he said. "Presently, our breeding and layer
birds at the farms are regularly vaccinated.

"We cannot estimate the exact supply-demand and price ratio right now, but,
negative reports would cast negative sentiments on the customers and
traders," he said.

Mr Siddiqui said that poultry sales in Karachi have already declined by
around 20 per cent at the commercial consumer front, as around 60 per cent
of poultry clients are hotels and commercial food outlets, while 25 per
cent are domestic consumers.

18 teams formed to cope with bird flu in Pakistan
-------------------------------------------------
Federal Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Livestock Friday [1 Feb 2008]
issued a high alert to all the concerned departments after confirmation of
bird flu's presence in Karachi while a radius of one kilometer area around
the affected poultry farm in the city has been quarantined.

Commissioner for animal husbandry, MINFAL, RH Usmani said that 18 teams
have been formed across the country to cope with threat of bird flu. They
have been provided special dress, glasses, gloves and spray, he added. He
said one kilometer area surrounding the affected poultry farm in Gadap area
has been sealed and the transportation in and out of the farm has been
prohibited.

Samples from one more poultry farm in Gadap have been arrived and their
report will come out by tomorrow. Commissioner animal husbandry said all
precautionary measures have been taken after consulting the matter with
Islamabad's Administration. He said birds that fly into the country from
Russia every year in February carry along with them the bird flu virus.

An earlier report from Karachi had said that the Sindh government has
confirmed the presence of bird flu virus in poultry farms located in
Karachi's Gadap area.

Talking to Geo News, Sindh government's Poultry Research department
director Dr Ali Akbar today announced that the deadly H5N1 strain of bird
flu has been identified in Gadap and 5000 chickens have already been
culled. Earlier, the department had sent samples from the poultry farms to
the National research lab in Islamabad to confirm the presence of the
highly contagious avian influenza.

The emergency has been declared in the hospitals across the province and
isolation wards have been set up hospitals at Tehsil and District level in
the wake of the confirmation of the bird flu in a Gadap Town poultry farm.
The City District Government Karachi Friday [1 Feb 2008] took action on a
poultry farm suspected to have been infected by bird flu and buried more
than 2000 birds while the farm situated in Gadap Town has been sealed by
the authorities.

However, hundreds of birds were found dead in Thatta and Badin districts.
The chickens were killed in poultry farms suspected to have been infected
by H5N1 bird flu virus.

And a report from Peshawar says that Department of Livestock has been
issued special instructions for keeping a strict watch on bird flu in NWFP.

Secretary agriculture Arbab Shahrukh said it was also decided to shift the
poultry farms away from densely populated areas of Abbotabad and Mansehra.
Blood samples of chicken are being gathered from poultry farms across the
province, he said, adding teams at district level had also been set up to
take stock of the situation at poultry farms in each district. Arbab
Shahrukh said the shifting of poultry farms from populated locations will
be undertaken after ensuring all necessary facilities at the new locations.

Instructions are also being given to the people associated with poultry
industry that all precautionary measures be taken while killing the
infected birds. He said one person died in December last year [2007] by
contracting the fatal H5N1 virus.

[Pakistan submitted to the OIE its initial "immediate notification" on HPAI
H5N1 on 7 Feb 2007. Later, 8 follow-up reports have been submitted; the
last one, No. 8, on 12 Dec 2007. An update is anticipated.

Avian influenza update: 2 further swans positive for H5N1
---------------------------------------------------------
DEFRA has today confirmed that another 2 dead wild mute swans, collected on
28 Jan 2008 as part of wild bird surveillance in the same area in Dorset,
have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza.

This brings the total number of swans confirmed with H5N1 on the site to 9.
From today [Fri 1 Feb 2008], any further new cases will be published on
the DEFRA website at . Further cases in the
coming weeks would not be unexpected.

As described in the recent epidemiology report [see item 4, below],
evidence suggests that the level of infection in the mute swan population
is low, and there remains no evidence of spread to other wild birds or
domestic poultry.

DEFRA is continuing to keep the disease risk to domestic poultry and
control measures under review and will be assessing options for any changes
to the current restrictions in place, should evidence continue to point to
a low level of infection confined to the mute swan population.

Poultry keepers in the area are reminded of the requirement to house or
otherwise keep separate their birds from wild birds, and remain vigilant
for signs of disease, reporting any suspicions immediately. Our enhanced
surveillance of wild birds in the area is continuing including active
patrols to look for dead wild birds.

[The bottom line is that an active H5N1 disease outbreak is currently
present in the Fleet Reserve on the Dorset coast, with the highly
pathogenic virus circulating among wild mute swans and, probably, other
in-contact waterbirds. For scientific as well as political reasons, the
eradication of such outbreak by stamping out is not feasible, prescribing
one main applicable measure, namely the prevention of contact between fauna
and domestic fowl; the alternative measure is preventive vaccination of
poultry (the definition of which is included in the commentary to item 4,
below).

And it remains for us to hope that the involved free-roaming wild birds in
the Reserve maintain a sedentary behaviour. - Mod.AS]

DEFRA (2008). Highly pathogenic avian influenza Â­ H5N1 in swans in Dorset.
Epidemiology report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executive summary
------------------
1. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was confirmed in Great Britain
on 10 Jan 2008, when tests had shown that virus strain type H5N1 (HPAI
H5N1), was present in the carcases of 3 wild mute swans (_Cygnus olor_).
These carcases were collected on 7 Jan 2008 from the Fleet Reserve on the
Dorset coast, and examined as part of Great Britain's avian influenza wild
bird surveillance programme. [The above date probably relates to the point
in time when the 3 dead swans were submitted by Swannery's staff to the
International Reference Laboratory for AI at the Veterinary Laboratories
Agency (VLA) at Weybridge. According to article 6 of the report's full
text, the 1st 2 swans were collected alive by the Swannery staff and
euthanized on 27 and 31 Dec 2007, respectively. One had a leg injury and
the other was emaciated. The 3rd swan was found dead on 4 Jan 2008. The 3
birds were ringed and are therefore known to have hatched locally in 2006
and 2007. - Mod.AS]

2. HPAI H5N1 was later detected in carcases of 3 further mute swans
collected from the same area. No infection has been identified in any other
individual or species of wild bird in Great Britain since April 2006, when
an infected whooper swan (_Cygnus cygnus_) was found dead, washed up in
Cellardyke harbour in Scotland.

3. Analysis of the virus indicates that it is related to contemporary
viruses from continental Europe and is most closely related to a cluster of
isolates recovered in mid to late 2007 from wild and domestic birds in the
Czech Republic, Romania and Poland. [According to article 19 in the full
report, "the viruses from the swans are closely related to each other, and
more closely related to viruses from Europe (the Czech Republic, Romania
and Poland) than to those recovered from the recent outbreak in turkeys in
Suffolk". - Mod.AS]

4. Expert ornithological advice indicated that swans, or other wild birds,
particularly wildfowl from the same population, would move within the
Fleet, between the 2 Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)
reserves at Lodmoor and Radipole and up to 3km [1.86 miles] inland, and
thus potentially place domestic poultry at risk of infection within this
area. This led to the delineation of the Wild Bird Control Area (WBCA).

5. Wild bird surveillance has been increased in the area and apart from the
swans reported above, no other evidence of avian influenza infection has
been found in the wild bird populations.

6. This is a region of relatively few domestic poultry, and surveillance
activities focussed on the domestic poultry within the WCBA are complete.
No evidence of spread of HPAI H5N1 to the domestic poultry population has
been found.

7. The source of infection for the swans has not been identified, however
the most plausible hypothesis is that it was introduced by one of the
migratory wild birds that make up part of the population on the Fleet
during the winter.

8. The Health Protection Agency have been informed of the incident and have
provided advice on the potential human health risk, which is not considered
further in this report.

[Subscribers are encouraged to read the full text of the report, which is
accompanied by maps and pictures. Particular attention is due to the data
provided by the Ornithological Expert Panel (OEP), which comprises a group
of specialists in wild bird ecology drawn from all major ornithological
organisations, and ornithological experts from Defra and the Devolved
Administrations. The OEP indicated that the inland area is relatively dry
as a result of which this wetland area is fairly isolated. Most of the
wildfowl are unlikely to move inland to feed as the land is rolling hills
rather than lowland pasture which would attract grazing wildfowl. The
location and behaviour of gull populations suggest that some gull movements
inland do occur but the main roosts are at sea. Expert opinion indicates
that the likelihood of longer distance (>3km) transfer of infection inland
is low.

The investigators concluded (article 59) that "introduction by an infected
migratory bird remains the most likely explanation as to the source of
infection for the Abbotsbury swans. The migratory wild bird population is
large and mobile, and therefore detection of a low level of infection in it
is challenging. Such infection has not been detected, however other
potential sources have been investigated and found to be less plausible."

The mentioned "other potential sources" were the following:
1. infected domestic poultry waste product, from the GB or overseas
2. contaminated feed
3. infected domestic poultry in Great Britain.

The report includes the following "summary of epidemiology":
"64. HPAI H5N1 infection appears to be confined to the mute swan population
located on the Fleet wetland reserve. The evidence suggests that the virus
has been present in this population at a very low level, with the incidence
detected to date being 0.8 per cent. Further cases are likely to be
detected if they occur, as the infection commonly causes disease and death
in this species.

65. There is no evidence of spread from the swans into any other
population, in particular to the domestic poultry most likely to have been
exposed to the infected population, suggesting that this would be an
unlikely or rare event. The source of infection for the mute swan
population remains undetermined."

Since the publication of the report, additional dead mute swans have been
found infected, apparently as predicted by the authors.

Though the report provides data on swan mortality records as summarised by
the Swannery during 2005-2007 (see figure 2), showing that the mortality
pattern during the winter of 2007/08 was consistent with that in previous
years and that there had been no increase in mortality in the preceding
months, no data are available re sampling and testing of swans or other
waterfowl during the months and years before December 2007.

Has the virus been introduced recently? No previous introductions? No
(sub-clinical) endemicity? No similar situations in swan populations
elsewhere -- in Europe or beyond? - Mod.AS]
