Indonesia: 8th Human Avian Influenza Death Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia has had its 8th human death due to avian influenza
confirmed by a Hong Kong laboratory affiliated with the World Health
Organization, a senior Health Ministry official said on Sat 3 Dec
2005. Hariadi Wibisono told Reuters that the results [of diagnostic
tests] on the 25-year-old woman, who died earlier this week, made her
Indonesia's 8th confirmed death from H5N1 avian influenza virus
infection. "We got the result this morning. She was positive," said
Wibisono, who heads a department charged with eradicating
animal-borne diseases.
Officials have previously said the woman had contact with dead
chickens before being admitted to a Jakarta hospital. Another 5
people [in addition to the other 7 fatal cases] have been confirmed
to have contracted the virus in Indonesia but have survived.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain is endemic in poultry in parts of
Asia, where it has killed more than 60 people.
Experts fear H5N1 could mutate into a form that passes easily among
people, just like human influenza. If it does, millions could die
because they would have no immunity. Most human bird flu cases in
Asia have been blamed on direct or indirect contact with infected chickens.

Viet Nam: Nurse Suspected of Contracting Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Vietnamese health officials said today [Sat 3 Dec 2005] that they
suspect that a nurse who cared for an avian influenza patient has
contracted the disease that has killed 46 people across Southeast
Asia. [The current death toll in East Asia since December 2003 is 69. - Mod.CP]
Dao Trong Bich, Deputy Director of the Medical Centre in Thai Thuy
District in northern Thai Binh province, said that the woman had
cared for a 21-year-old man who tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu
virus and that [she] remains in critical condition. The 41-year-old
nurse, also from Thai Binh province, was hospitalized on Thursday [1
Dec 2005] in Hanoi with a high fever, coughing and a lung infection,
typical avian influenza symptoms. Specimens have been taken from her
for testing, and results are expected this week, the doctor said.
She is in stable condition. If tests confirm it, she would be the 2nd
Vietnamese health care worker to be sickened by the bird flu virus.
Bich said health authorities are closely monitoring the health of 2
doctors and 2 other nurses at the center who had contact with the
21-year-old man. None have shown any symptoms, he added.
The 21-year-old man is at the center of a cluster of bird flu cases
that include his 14-year-old sister and 80-year-old grandfather, who
has the virus without showing any symptoms.

[This report should be interpreted with caution. It has not yet been
confirmed that the nurse in question has contracted avian influenza
virus infection, nor that 21-year-old patient cared for by the nurse
has been confirmed as an avian influenza case by laboratory testing.
The cluster of cases comprising the 21-year-old patient, his sister
and asymptomatic grandfather could merely indicate independent
infections contacted from a common source rather than presumptive
person-to-person transmission of infection. Further clarification is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
