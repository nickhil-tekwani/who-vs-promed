Jordan: Still vigilant against bird flu threat
-----------------------------------------------
The government remains alert to the threat of bird flu in light of
the new outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus in
neighboring Egypt, according to a Ministry of Health official.
The World Health Organization declared Jordan free of bird flu in May
2006, 2 months after the virus was detected in 4 turkeys in the
northern governorate of Ajloun. The discovery prompted a huge cull
affecting over 50 000 homebred birds.
Jordan's only human case of bird flu was found in an Egyptian laborer
in April 2006. A man, 31, was treated for the virus in the Karak
Public Hospital and was later discharged after making a full
recovery. He reportedly contracted the H5N1 strain before entering the Kingdom.

[Re: ProMED post 20061230.3658 Avian influenza, human (192): Egypt,
correction]
Another possible source of confusion is that one of the human cases
for which WHO lists "Egypt" as the country of record (Avian influenza
- situation in Egypt - update 3; 6 Apr 2006
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_04_06a/en/index.html>)
was confirmed from a man who was hospitalized and diagnosed with H5N1
in Jordan (cf. ProMED archive 20060404.1011 and the Jordan Times
article on this of 29 Dec 2006; see above). Neither the WHO nor
ProMED-mail reports on the H5N1 case in Jordan cited Egypt in the
title as the locality of origin for this case.
Given the fact that human-to-human transmission (H2H) of H5N1 was
documented in the 1st zoonotic outbreak of this disease in Hong Kong
in 1997, and that probable (H2H) instances have been documented also
in Thailand, Viet Nam, and Indonesia, it is important to report
accurately [both] the actual countries where cases have occurred, as
well as the countries where these cases are believed to have
originated, as has been the usual practice with most other diseases
reported in ProMED-mail.
