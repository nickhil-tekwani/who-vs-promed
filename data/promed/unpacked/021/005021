An outbreak of a tick-borne cattle disease has been confirmed in South Australia, following the deaths of 5 cattle in the state's South East.

Biosecurity SA says the disease, known as theileriosis, is endemic in high rainfall regions of New South Wales and Victoria, where deaths are uncommon and the disease is considered benign.

But South Australia's chief veterinary officer, Dr Roger Paskin, says when the disease moves to a new area, its effects can be more severe, although it's still considered a mild disease.

"You'll find, if you go and do testing afterwards, that in fact almost all of the herd is infected, but very few animals, usually those that are under high stress such as animals that are lactating, might become sick and a few of them might die.

"So even in a naive herd, the disease is still considered to be relatively benign."

Theileriosis is spread by ticks travelling on native animals, making quarantine of infected cattle an ineffective way of preventing the spread of the disease.

Biosecurity SA is urging farmers and veterinarians to keep a close eye on the health of their flocks.

[Theileria are protozoan parasites carried by ticks. When ticks carrying theileria feed on cattle, the parasite gets into their bloodstream and enters red blood cells. In some animals, sufficient red blood cells are destroyed to cause anaemia -- a reduction in the red blood cell numbers. This reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen and makes the animal ill.

A protozoan referred to as _Theileria buffeli_ has been present in Australia for around 100 years. It has been seen occasionally in blood smears of cattle from "ticky" country, but seldom caused any illness. It was considered a benign infection.

Generally ticks are the carriers (vectors) responsible for spread of theileria throughout the world. In New South Wales, the bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is suspected to be responsible, though other ticks could be involved. Small numbers (less than 10 ticks) are able to spread the infection. Many farmers on affected properties have not observed ticks on affected cattle. Experimentally lice and march flies have also been shown to transmit infection.
