My name is Dr. Carolyn James and I work on the Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) file at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). I am writing to address some information that was published on 2012-09-10 in the article [ProMED-mail] 20120910.1287614.

In the 4th paragraph a comment is made in reference to information provided by the CFIA and that, "(t)he exact number of horses infected has not been made available". This is not the case and I am providing a link to our public webpage that not only indicates the number of premises where positive equines have been confirmed, but also has maps that indicate which areas are affected and the actual number of EIA positive equines within them. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/eia/eng/1329698749489/1329703176989

Another fact that I would like to clarify is in regards to nomenclature. Technically a Coggins test is an agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test and this is run by our national retrovirology centre of expertise on samples that have previously screened positive on an EIA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. An exception to this would be if a horse required proof of a negative AGID test result to meet a particular country's import requirements. Historically the terms Coggins test and Coggins papers have been used to refer to all EIA testing but this is not accurate. The comment that all horses travelling to the United States require a negative Coggins test is not true; they do require proof of a negative EIA test result in the form of an EIA Test Certificate but, other than in a few rare circumstances, that determination is made using the EIA ELISA test.

Thank you and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
