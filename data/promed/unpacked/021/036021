Re: BLUETONGUE, BOVINE - ISRAEL: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------
In response to your RFI of Sun 5 Jul 2009, we have cleared the issue
with the OIE reference laboratory for bluetongue at the Institute for
Animal Health, Pirbright, UK.

A total of 6 blood samples from clinically suspected cows in the dairy
cattle operation in Kalya (north of the Dead Sea), and one blood
sample from a suspected cow in Almog (4 km, or 2.5 miles, north of
Kalya), all PCR-positive for bluetongue in our laboratory, were sent
by us for serotyping to Pirbright on 12 Jun 2009. The samples were
received there on 15 Jun 2009. All 7 samples were serotyped by the
reference laboratory as BTV-24. Their detailed reply, sent by fax on
23 Jun 2009, has not reached us for technical reasons.

We are grateful to the Pirbright laboratory staff for their speedy and
efficient handling of the matter.

[According to clinical data from the practitioner attending both dairy
cattle farms in Kalya and Almog, the clinical signs were rather mild,
the most prominent ones being fever (up to 41 C -- 105.8 F), ocular,
nasal and buccal involvement and reduction of the milk yield for 2-3
days. About 20-25 milking cows (out of 292) and fewer than 10 young
stock (out of 240) presented [symptoms]. In neighbouring Almog, only
one clinical case, in a post-parturition cow, was seen (and sampled).
We are grateful to Dr Nadav Galon, chief veterinarian, Hachaklait, for
providing the above information (For Hachaklait web-site see
<http://www.hachaklait.org.il/english.asp>).

Both farms are situated within the southern part of the Jordan valley,
just north of the Dead Sea -- which is, in fact, a part of the Great
Rift Valley, which extends from Lebanon in the north to Mozambique in
the south. Interestingly, an extremely severe BTV-24 outbreak was
reported in a more southern part of the Great Rift Valley, the Arava
Valley, namely in En (Ein) Hatzeva, 120 km, or 74.5 miles, south of
Kalya, in March 2009, causing an 80 percent case fatality rate in
sheep (for details, see ProMED post 20090621.2276).

Almog and Kalya, north-west of the Dead Sea, can be found in square 9
of the interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html>. En (Ein) Hatzeva
can be found in the north-east part of square 17 in the same
interactive map.

The very 1st identification of BTV-24 in Israel took place in the fall
of 2008. According to Israel's notification to the OIE, 6 outbreaks
were diagnosed, of which 5 affected sheep and one affected cattle.
See, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7737>.

This means that 3 orbiviruses which affect cattle have been identified
in Israel since 2006: EHD (serotype 7), in late summer/fall of 2006;
BTV-8 in November 2008; and BTV-24, in November 2008 (see
20090130.0412) and again in March-April 2009. BTV-8 and BTV-24 are
also serious sheep pathogens, with BTV-24 demonstrating, at least in
one case, exceptionally high pathogenicity in susceptible sheep. The
pathogenicity of BTV-8 in cattle, though reported from a single herd,
seems more serious than BTV-24.

The Jordan and Arava valleys (part of the Great Rift Valley) are
shared with the Kingdom of Jordan. It would be interesting to obtain
information on the disease situation there. - Mod.AS]
