16 people who were exposed to rabies by a raccoon are under the care
of a physician after the raccoon tested positive for the disease, the
S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) said today
[8 May 2008].

"The baby raccoon was found in the woods and was being cared for by
several people over the past several weeks," said Sue Ferguson of
DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health.

According to Ferguson, many of the exposures occurred during the
feeding of the raccoon, as caretakers came into contact with the
animal's saliva. Seven more people are being evaluated for possible
exposure risk.

"Anyone bitten, scratched or otherwise exposed to the saliva of a
rabid animal must undergo immediate measures to stop the virus from
reaching the brain, because once the rabies virus reaches the brain,
the disease is fatal to humans and animals," Ferguson said. "The
people who were exposed are receiving preventive inoculations.

"It is best to avoid contact with wild animals because one cannot
tell if an animal has rabies by looking at it," Ferguson said. "About
400 South Carolinians must undergo preventive treatment for rabies
every year, with most exposures from being bitten or scratched by a
rabid or suspected rabid animal. Wild animals carry the disease most
often, but domestic pets can contract rabies as well, and 20 domestic
pets were exposed as well, so we remind residents that the best
protection for people and their pets is to make sure pets are
regularly vaccinated against the disease, as is required under state
law. If you think you have been exposed to the rabies virus through a
bite, scratch or the saliva of a possibly infected animal,
immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water,"
she said. "Then be sure to get medical attention and report the
incident to DHEC."

This is the 1st confirmed rabid animal in Beaufort County in 2008.
Last year [2007], no rabid animals were confirmed in the county. In
2007, there were 162 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in South
Carolina. So far this year, there have been 45 confirmed cases in
animals in the state.

[The attraction of an orphaned baby animal tugs at the softness
buried in each of us and brings out the irresistible urge to help.
This explains how so many people became exposed to one animal. I am
still unclear about how the pets became exposed, but I suppose the
pets smelled or licked the animal. Since the animal was being cared
for by several people, this would suggest the raccoon was quite
small, probably bottle-feeding size, and they are amazingly cute at this stage.

SCDHEC seems to have initiated a public health awareness program and
vaccination awareness program of the animals. This news release does
not tell us how many of the exposed animals were vaccinated - Mod.TG]
