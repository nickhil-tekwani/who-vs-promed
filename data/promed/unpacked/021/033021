Emergence of a new recombinant Sydney 2012 norovirus variant in Denmark
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
We report here new recombinants between the norovirus II.4 Sydney 2012 and the II.4 New Orleans 2009 variants. This demonstrates that the II.4 Sydney 2012 variant is undergoing further diversification and suggests a potential for rapid evolution. We also provide primers, which allow the amplification and sequencing of both the current New Orleans 2009 and Sydney 2012 variants and the new II.4 New Orleans 2009/II.4 Sydney 2012 recombinants for more accurate surveillance and transmission tracking.

Background
----------
In the period between December 2012 and April 2013, a selection of norovirus (NoV)-positive samples which had been submitted to Statens Serum Institute (SSI) for diagnostic purposes were further characterised by typing sequences of the NoV derived polymerase (pol) and capsid (cap) genes. Based on their characteristics, the pol and cap sequences were respectively assigned to a particular NoV genotype within genogroup I (GI) or genogroup II (GII), including NoV GII, genotype 4 (II.4) variants where applicable. A number of samples tested concomitantly positive for the pol of one NoV variant and the cap of another. For example, the GII, genotype e (II.e) Sydney 2012 NoV pol/II.4 Sydney 2012 NoV cap sequences were co-detected in some samples, and in other samples the II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV pol/II.4 Sydney 2012 NoV cap sequences were co-detected. As this could potentially indicate the presence of recombinant NoV in such samples, primers for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay were designed to investigate if recombinants could be detected in the samples.

The NoV Sydney 2012 variant has since late 2012 attracted global attention and several countries have reported an associated increase in NoV cases and a rapid evolution of this variant. The earlier dominant New Orleans 2009 variant has been replaced by the Sydney 2012 variant in the United States. We provide here evidence for the emergence of recombinant Sydney 2012 variants and present primers to enable the amplification and sequencing of these variants.

New recombinants
----------------
Characterisation of NoV was done by typing of the NoV pol and cap regions. Typing of the pol region was conducted using a 1st round reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with the primers NV32,NV32a (forward primers)/NV36 (reverse primer), followed by a 2nd PCR using the primers NV33,NV33a (forward primers)/NV35,NV35a (reverse primers) [6,7]. The PCR primers in this assay were designed to anneal conserved regions shared by NoV of GI and GII and can amplify both NoV GI and GII viral sequences. Typing of the cap region consisted in a semi-nested PCR for either GI or GII viral sequences. In the 1st RT-PCR round, the primers G1FF/G1SKR for GI or G2FB/G2SK for GII [8,9] were used, followed by a 2nd round PCR using the primers GIFFN/G1SKR (GI) or GIIFBN/G2SKR (GII) [9,10]. This allowed us to retrieve and analyse the pol and cap genetic sequences derived from individual NoV positive samples submitted to SSI for routine diagnostics, and to respectively assign each sequence to a NoV variant. Co-detection in a sample of a pol sequence characteristic of one NoV variant and a cap sequence characteristic of another could suggest possible NoV recombinants.

The 1st sample with evidence of possible recombination had been sent to SSI on 21 December 2012. In the period from 8 December 2012 to 12 April 2013, a total of 34 samples were typed in both the pol and cap genes, and of these, 3 (9 percent) were II.4 New Orleans 2009 in both pol and cap, 10 (29 percent) were II.e Sydney 2012 in pol and II.4 Sydney 2012 in cap and 16 (47 percent) were II.4 New Orleans 2009 in pol and II.4 Sydney 2012 in cap, while the remaining 5 (15 percent) were other NoV types.

Interestingly, we did not observe any indications for a recombination of the II.e Sydney 2012 NoV pol and the II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV cap sequences, which could indicate a strong selection pressure against continued circulation of any NoV variant containing the New Orleans 2009 NoV cap.

Since the pol and cap typing produce 2 non-overlapping sequences, the possibility of patients having a double infection with both the II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV pol/II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV cap and the II.e Sydney 2012 NoV pol/II.4 Sydney 2012 NoV cap variants could not be excluded. Therefore, to confirm recombination, we designed a set of nested primers [see table at source URL above], allowing for amplification and sequencing of a contiguous genomic region containing both parts of the pol and cap regions used for typing, and the intergenic region.

According to the phylogenetic tree, the sequences which were typed as II.4 New Orleans 2009 pol/II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV cap or II.e Sydney 2012 NoV pol/II.4 Sydney 2012 NoV cap formed clusters with their respective reference sequences, whereas the sequences typed as II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV pol/II.4 Sydney NoV 2012 cap did not cluster together with any of these reference sequences. Most (8 of 13) of the recombinant II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV pol/II.4 Sydney 2012 NoV cap sequences were localised to a single cluster). The samples in this cluster were collected during a period of 86 days (from 26 Dec 2012 to 22 Mar 2013) and differ from each other by no more than 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These recombinants therefore probably arose from a unique recombinant, circulating in the Danish population during this period, which had been generated from a single recombination event.

A total of 8 selected NoV sequences from this study and the II.e pol/II.4 cap Sydney 2012 reference sequence (GenBank accession number: JX459908.1) were further analysed over a region of 1161 nucleotides using Simplot 1.3 [13] with a windows size of 200 and a 20 bp step using the New Orleans 2009 reference sequence (GenBank accession number: GU445325.2) as the query sequence.

Conclusion
----------
Recombination is a major diversifying factor in the evolution of several NoV genotypes and II.4 variants and might result in the emergence of more virulent variants. We report here the emergence of new recombinants of the Sydney 2012 NoV variant, which shows that this variant is undergoing further diversification. It remains to be determined how virulent the new recombinants will be, including their capability to escape the acquired herd immunity. We also here describe primers, which will allow for identification of both the II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV pol/II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV cap and II.e Sydney 2012 NoV pol/II.4 Sydney 2012 NoV cap and the recombinant II.4 New Orleans 2009 NoV pol/II.4 Sydney 2012 NoV cap variants for more accurate surveillance and transmission tracking.

[The authors report the appearance in Denmark of novel recombinants between the norovirus II.4 Sydney 2012 and the II.4 New Orleans 2009 variants. Their results demonstrate that the II.4 Sydney 2012 variant is undergoing further diversification and indicates a potential for rapid evolution. It will be interesting in due course to assess the virulence of these new recombinants, and to what extent this genome reorganisation will enable these new variants to evade developing herd immunity. - Mod.CP
