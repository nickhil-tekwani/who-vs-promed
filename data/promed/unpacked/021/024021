Ebola Situation Report - 26 Aug 2015
---------------------------------------

Summary
-------
There were 3 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 23 Aug [2015], all of which were reported from Guinea. No new confirmed cases were reported from Sierra Leone for the 2nd consecutive week. Overall case incidence has held at 3 confirmed cases per week for 4 consecutive weeks. In addition, the number of contacts under observation continues to fall, from over 800 on 16 Aug [2015] to approximately 600 on 23 Aug [2015] throughout 4 prefectures in Guinea and 2 districts in Sierra Leone. All contacts associated with the recent cluster of cases in Tonkolili, Sierra Leone, have now completed the 21-day follow-up period. However, there remains a significant risk of further transmission. All 3 cases in Guinea this week were reported from the capital, Conakry, and have generated a substantial number of high-risk contacts. One of the cases, who was detected after post-mortem testing of a community death, was one of 35 contacts to have been lost to follow-up in Conakry in the past 6 weeks.

All of the 3 confirmed cases reported from Guinea in the week to 23 Aug [2015] were identified in the Ratoma area of the capital, Conakry. The 1st case, a male taxi driver in his early 40s, was not a registered contact and is thought to have worked for a short time in Conakry whilst symptomatic. Efforts are ongoing to trace any passengers who may be contacts. A male health worker who was registered as a contact after treating the taxi driver at a private clinic subsequently also tested positive for EVD. Over 40 contacts from the private clinic and household have been identified so far. The remaining case, a woman in her early 40s, was a registered contact of a previous case in Conakry but was lost to follow-up. Investigations suggest she travelled outside Conakry to consult a traditional healer in the prefecture of Dubreka before her death. She was subsequently identified as an EVD-positive community death after post-mortem testing. 600 contacts were under follow-up on 23 Aug [2015] in 4 western prefectures (Conakry, Coyah, Dubreka, and Forecariah), compared with approximately 800 contacts in 3 prefectures the previous week.

No new cases were reported from Liberia in the week to 23 Aug [2015]. All contacts in Liberia have now completed their 21-day follow-up period. The last 2 patients with EVD in Liberia were discharged after completing treatment and testing negative for EVD for a 2nd time on 23 Jul [2015]. Surveillance continues to be strengthened, with approximately 800 samples tested for EVD in the week to 23 Aug [2015].

No cases were reported from Sierra Leone in the week to 23 Aug [2015], the 2nd consecutive week without a confirmed case. The last case to be diagnosed with EVD completed treatment and was discharged from an Ebola treatment centre on 24 Aug [2015] after testing negative twice for EVD. The number of contacts under follow-up has declined from 72 contacts across 3 districts (Tonkolili, Western Area Urban, and Western Area Rural) on 19 Aug [2015] to 29 contacts in Western Area Urban (Freetown) and Western Area Rural on 23 Aug [2015], after all contacts associated with the Tonkolili cluster of cases completed follow-up.

For the 1st time in 4 weeks, a new health worker infection was reported in the week to 23 Aug [2015]. The case was reported from Conakry, Guinea. There have been a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 512 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
------------------------------------
There have been a total of 28 005 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 23 Aug [2015], with 11 287 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). Three new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea in the week to 23 Aug [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

One new health worker infection was reported from Guinea in the week to 23 Aug [2015]. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 512 reported deaths (table 5).

26 Aug 2015 Nigeria: Ebola - Gombe raises alarm over S/Leone, Civ [Cote d'Ivoire] match in Lagos
http://allafrica.com/stories/201508261128.html
[President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to reverse the decision taken by the Nigeria Football Federation to host the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire in Nigeria. A sports administrator, Shaibu Gara-Gombe, on Tuesday [25 Aug 2015] in Lagos said there was a great danger in the decision taken by the NFF [National Football Federation].

24 Aug 2015: Sierra Leone's secret FGM [female genital mutilation] societies spread silent fear and sleepless nights
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/aug/24/sierra-leone-female-genital-mutilation-soweis-secret-societies-fear
[Traditional practitioners of female genital mutilation have established deep roots in Sierra Leonean culture and politics, creating a culture of fear among young women and posing a major obstacle to opponents of the custom.

A silver lining to the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone was a temporary ban on FGM. Before the Ebola outbreak, it is estimated that 88 percent of Sierra Leonean girls were cut, the 7th highest rate of the 28 countries in Africa where FGM is practiced. The World Health Organization defines FGM as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons". ... -more]

24 Aug 2015 Sierra Leone: Manhunt for missing Ebola suspects
http://allafrica.com/stories/201508250942.html
[There is a manhunt across Freetown to locate several high-risk Ebola contacts who have disappeared, according to an announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO made this revelation last Fri [21 Aug 2015] while giving an update on the current situation of the Ebola outbreak for the week ending 21 Aug 2015.

Manhunts for suspects are not a new phenomenon in the fight against the Ebola virus, as runaway patients have caused the virus to spread across the country. According to the WHO (World Health Organization) official in country, Dr. Anders Nordstrom, there are a total of 72 contacts who are being observed in 3 districts: Tonkolili, Western Area Urban, and Western Area Rural. All of the contacts are associated with the Western Area Urban chain of transmission.

In neighboring Guinea, about 45 suspects have also been lost to follow-up in Conakry over the past 6 weeks, said the WHO country representative. Recently, vehicles and passengers traveling in the eastern part of Freetown have had to go through a checkpoint at Furniture Junction, Allen Town, as security officers search for the missing contacts.

In another development, police officers in Magburaka Town are investigating 8 suspects who were arrested over the weekend in Ronolla village, Gbonkolenken Chiefdom in the Tonkolili District for washing a corpse.]

[Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization: Opening remarks at the Review Committee on the role of the International Health Regulations in the Ebola outbreak and response (Geneva, Switzerland): The Review Committee has been tasked with providing a critical review of the International Health Regulations performed during the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa. Dr. Chan acknowledges the "...nearly universal agreement that the international response to the outbreak was inadequate." She also acknowledges some were late in recognizing the potential of the outbreak to grow so explosively, and that "some warning signals were missed." Dr. Chan further states: "When the number of cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone began to increase exponentially, all responders, including WHO, were overwhelmed, and asks the Review Committee to "...look for improvements that leave the world better prepared for the next inevitable outbreak."...more]

26 Aug 2015: United Kingdom: Now, an antiviral drug that could protect humans from Ebola virus
http://www.financialexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/now-an-antiviral-drug-that-could-protect-humans-from-ebola-virus/125834/
[Scientists have developed anti-viral-based therapies having the potential to protect humans from Ebola virus disease [EVD].

In the study, 8 British health-care workers were evacuated to the Royal Free Hospital in London, UK after possible accidental exposure to EVD in Sierra Leone between January and March 2015.

Four of the healthcare workers were considered to have been at significant risk of exposure to EVD from needle-stick injuries and were given post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with the antiviral drug favipiravir, with or without monoclonal antibodies. None of the health-care workers went on to develop EVD. All 8 health-care workers remained healthy throughout the 42-day follow-up, with no signs of disease or detectable levels of virus in their blood.

Lead author Michael Jacobs of the Royal Free NHS [National Health Service] Foundation Trust said that it was possible that none of these health-care workers were infected with EVD and added they cannot know for sure whether or not post-exposure prophylaxis prevented the onset of EVD. However, Jacobs mentioned that 2 of the workers had needle-stick injuries contaminated with fresh blood from patients with EVD, putting them at very high risk of transmission.

Jacobs concluded that a similar approach to treat household contacts of EVD cases might work to prevent a major route of spread during an epidemic. ...more]

26 Aug 2015: Researchers test Ebola vaccine for wild apes
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-08-ebola-vaccine-wild-apes.html
[Amid promising reports of effective Ebola vaccines for humans, a vaccine that could potentially protect endangered wild apes from deadly infectious diseases, including the Ebola virus, is being tested at the New Iberia Research Center.

Scientists are testing an oral vaccine that would be ingested by chimpanzees and gorillas. It is similar to a rabies vaccine that has been successful in virtually eradicating rabies in Western Europe and has been used to immunize animals, including foxes, coyotes, dogs, raccoons and skunks.

"The trial is relevant in addressing what has become an international health concern for both humans and animals," said Dr. Ramesh Kolluru, vice president for Research at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Vaccines haven't been used to combat outbreaks of diseases in chimpanzees and gorillas because of concerns about their safety. High mortality rates, however, have made many conservationists more receptive to the potential protection of vaccines for apes.

As part of the vaccine trial being conducted at NIRC, researchers are evaluating chimpanzee responses to a protein, called a glycoprotein. Because the glycoprotein is only a small fragment of the Ebola virus genome, it is incapable of replicating and causing disease. However, it should induce an immune response, which will protect against Ebola virus.

Of course, the vaccine will need to be able to survive the environmental conditions as it sits in the bait waiting to be ingested by the apes and induce an immune response following ingestion. But if successful, this would be an effective approach to protecting wildlife that has suffered from high mortality following Ebola virus infection. - Mod.LK]

Funding

24 Aug 2015: Medecins Sans Frontieres grows income by almost a quarter following Ebola crisis
http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/20256/mdecins_sans_frontires_grows_by_ almost_a_quarter_following_ebola_crisis
[Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF] increased its income by 23 per cent in the year to December 2014, to just over GBP 44 million [USD 69.5 million], mainly as a result of increased donations to tackle the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

Almost all income came from donations, grants and legacies, according to its annual accounts, filed recently. The charity did not receive any government funding. The charity's restricted donations rose from GBP 5.3 million [USD 8.36 million] to GBP 9.3 million [USD 14.6 million], the majority of which came on the back of the Ebola crisis. The charity also sharply increased its fundraising expenditure, from GBP 2.5 million [USD 3.9 million].

MSF said reasons for this included "implementing a program to increase supporter loyalty across all donor segments and preparing for major emergencies through integrated campaigns." MSF had 138 full-time equivalent staff, almost unchanged from the previous year, and the highest paid employee earned less than GBP 70 000 [USD 110 000], ...more]
