A stable in Halifax has placed its horses in quarantine after a veterinarian confirmed one of the animals had contracted a highly contagious respiratory infection.

The Halifax Junior Bengal Lancers made the announcement in a Facebook post on Sunday night [20 May 2018].

According to the organization, the infection is known as strangles. It is a bacterial infection of a horse's upper respiratory tract, causing lymph nodes in the throat to inflame and making it difficult to breathe.

Although the infection is highly contagious to horses, it poses no harm to the general public.

The Lancers says they have temporarily suspended operations as a result of the health issue.

"All staff are following strict disinfection protocols. Most of our horses remain healthy, and we are doing everything in our power to keep it that way," the Facebook post reads.

Horses may be observed outside the stable, but the organization says that is not part of their normal recreation program.

Cases of strangles have been confirmed in other regions, including throughout Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

The Lancers are recommending other horse owners take the following precautions as a result of the outbreak:

- Vaccinate any healthy horses if you have not already done so this year [2018].
- Vaccination may not prevent disease in all horses but could lessen its severity and duration. (Please still follow other precautions even if you have already vaccinated.)
- Monitor your horse's temperature daily. Immediately contact a veterinarian if your horse is unwell.
- Do not let your horse touch noses with other horses at competitions.
- Do not share water buckets or feed tubs with other horses.
- Disinfect stalls at shows before putting your horse in the stall.
- Isolate new horses coming onto your property for 3 weeks.

The organization says it will provide updates in the coming weeks.

[In a recent update, Halifax Regional Police's Mounted Unit has confirmed that one of their horses, Sarge, has been diagnosed with strangles.

It could be that these are early reports on the edge of an outbreak. There is an effective strangles vaccine, both intranasal and intramuscular.

Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae characterized by abscessation of the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive, capsulated B-hemolytic Lancefield group C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days, and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 F [39.4-41.1 C]). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscessation in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly the lymph nodes in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax. _S equi_ is the most common cause of brain abscess in horses, albeit rare.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed with dilute (3%-5%) povidone-iodine solution for several days until discharge ceases. NSAIDs can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and to improve appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease. Tracheotomy may be required in horses with retropharyngeal abscessation and pharyngeal compression.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but it ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia. Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (24 hours or less from onset of fever) will usually arrest abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, IM, bid) is the antibiotic of choice. Untreated guttural pouch infections can result in persistent guttural pouch empyema with or without chondroid formation.

Post-exposure immunity is prolonged after natural disease in most horses, and protection is associated with local (nasal mucosa) production of antibody against the antiphagocytic M protein. The clinical attack rate of strangles is reduced by 50% in horses vaccinated with IM products that do not induce mucosal immunity. Local (mucosal) production of antibody requires mucosal antigen stimulation. An intranasal vaccine containing a live attenuated strain of _S. equi equi_ was designed to elicit a mucosal immunologic response. This attenuated strain is not temperature sensitive (inactivated by core body temperature) like the intranasal influenza vaccine. Reported complications include _S. equi equi_ abscesses at subsequent IM injection sites (live bacteria on hands of administrator), submandibular lymphadenopathy, serous nasal discharge, and purpura hemorrhagica.

Most horses continue to shed _S equi_ for around one month after recovery. Three negative nasopharyngeal swabs at intervals of 4-7 days should be obtained before release from quarantine, and the minimal isolation period should be one month. Prolonged bacterial shedding (as long as 18 months) has been identified in a small number of horses. Guttural pouch empyema is the source of infection in most prolonged carrier states. Bacterial culture of nasopharyngeal swab and/or guttural pouch lavage is used to identify persistent carriers.

This disease can be wearing on the horse as well as the owner. Prevention is the best route to take, especially if your horse is showing, racing, rodeoing, or an athlete, or just a pretty pet at a petting fair.
