Growers in all of Tangail [district] are worried as vast tracts of their croplands have been attacked by blast disease and the insecticides or antidotes advised by the agriculture officials are not working. The sudden attack has damaged huge standing paddies only a couple of days before harvesting.

Local agriculture officials said abnormal weather condition, especially at night, and early planting are the main causes. Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) said at least 135 hectares were affected by blast. [Some] farmers said portions of the affected fields turned reddish and are drying up within a few days. [Another] farmer said he cultivated BRRI-28 variety and all the paddies are totally damaged due to the disease.

[Another farmer] said after training from the local agriculture office he cultivated BRRI-58 and BRRI-81 varieties. "I sprayed medicines, but no result." Officials visited the area during plantating, [but] are not seen after the disease attack.

DAE said they were providing necessary support and advice to the affected farmers. "It is tough to protect the crop once it is attacked by blast." [They] said the disease attacked only a portion of BRRI-28 variety.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (previously _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed; infection late in the growth cycle generally leads to less severe damage. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 and 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions, including high humidity. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers). The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence. Use of certified clean seed is essential, and farm saved seed poses a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops.

BRRI rice varieties have been developed by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). Of the 3 varieties mentioned above, only BRRI-28 was classed as 'moderately resistant to blast', the other two have no blast resistance (see links below). The disease impact on the varieties described above reflects this classification.
