Authorities in Saudi Arabia specified details today about this year's [2020] Hajj pilgrimage after announcing the major Islamic event would take place with a limited number of attendees.

Yesterday [22 Jun 2020], Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Hajj and Umrah announced the pilgrimage would occur with a "very limited number" of participants from various nationalities already present in Saudi Arabia due to the coronavirus [COVID-19] pandemic. A Saudi official told The Associated Press today the figure would be only a few thousand people. Hajj usually brings more than 2 million Muslims from all around the world to Islam's holiest city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia each year. In 2020, it will begin in late July [2020].

Today [23 Jun 2020], the ministry specified the restrictions under which this year's much smaller Hajj will take place. Pilgrims will be quarantined both before and after the Hajj, the ministry said in a tweet.

The state-run Saudi Press Agency further reported that pilgrims must be under 65 years of age and not have any chronic diseases. They will be tested for COVID-19 before they reach the holy sites, and medical teams will accompany them. The pilgrims' accommodations and visits to the sites will also be set up to allow for social distancing, according to the agency.

Saudi Arabia has been one of the hardest-hit countries in the region, with Mecca in particular having high numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases. The country has registered more than 3000 cases several days in a row. There have been 164 144 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia as of today [23 Jun 2020], according to Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health statistics.

Hajj pilgrim numbers could be limited to [more or less] 1000 to protect public health in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Saudi authorities. Health Minister Dr Tawfiq Al-Rabiah told a press conference on Tuesday [23 Jun 2020] that compulsory isolation before and after the pilgrimage will also be enforced.

He said Saudi Arabia is capable of ensuring pilgrims' safety this year [2020]. "The health ministry has accumulated experience in the service of pilgrims, and thus has enough human and technical capacities to serve pilgrims and preserve their health," he said. He added that an integrated hospital at holy sites will be provided, along with a health center in Arafat in case of emergencies during Hajj. Medical cadres will also accompany pilgrims throughout their journey.

Al-Rabiah said limiting the number of pilgrims this year [2020] is important. "Only people residing in the Kingdom, who are under 65 years of age and who do not have chronic diseases will be allowed to perform Hajj this year [2020]. They will get tested before arriving to the holy sites and will be subject to self-isolation after performing Hajj," he said. He added that those serving pilgrims during Hajj will also be tested.

Meanwhile, many East Asian countries decided to cancel their delegations to this year's [2020] Hajj before the Saudi decision to limit pilgrim numbers. Saudi Minister of Hajj and Umrah Mohammed Saleh Bentin said: "We appreciate this decision as it aims to protect people above everything else, which was also the priority of the Kingdom since the start of the pandemic, where it canceled Umrah and has now decided to limit the number of Hajj pilgrims to people already residing in Saudi Arabia."

He added that the decision to limit numbers "was taken based on the Kingdom's principles and past experience in managing Hajj. The main aim is preserving the health and safety of pilgrims in light of the coronavirus pandemic. "It is a delicate process and we are working with experts at the health ministry, the interior ministry, and other authorities to ensure a safe Hajj," Bentin said. He added that the Hajj ministry will cooperate with diplomatic missions in the Kingdom to determine the number of eligible non-Saudi residents.

Media coverage of this year's [2020] Hajj will be in line with adopted health measures, he said.

Bentin said the Kingdom's decision to limit Hajj pilgrims is based on the continuation of the coronavirus pandemic and the risks of it spreading in crowded spaces and large gatherings. It also comes amid a push to protect global health security. "We have been working alongside the health ministry to determine precautionary measures and protocols that need to be followed. Preserving human lives is our priority, therefore, special plans have been set in place for this year's Hajj, including the self-isolation of pilgrims both before and after performing Hajj," he said.

He added that there will be no exceptions made for pilgrims arriving from abroad. "We are aware of the dangers of this virus. Countries around the world have closed their borders. Therefore, no exceptions will be made," he said.

[A very wise decision on the part of the Saudi Ministries of the Hajj and Umrah and of Health. Remembering how Saudi Arabia weathered the Hajj during the early years of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2012-2016), the measures put in place and observed during the Hajj in those years were successful, as to date there have been no cases of MERS-CoV associated with Hajj attendance. This is a major decision on both a religious level as well as an economic level and is an acknowledgment of the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and very prudent public health measures.

[2] The hazards of hindsight conclusions
Date: Fri 19 Jun 2020 21:00 BST

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/19/our-knowledge-of-covid-19-changes-every-day-hindsight-is-misleading-when-it-comes-to-science


The results of a COVID-19 study have been announced. Unlike most of the previous results, this study seems immediately to be a game-changer -- rather than minor benefits from an expensive drug, or spurious nonsense from a dubious trial, these results show that a cheap and common medication, dexamethasone, could reduce the risk of death in people with severe disease by a substantial amount. The study was large enough to be meaningful and its finding likely to be true. This is, without qualification, fantastic news.

But immediately people started commenting. Had we known about this drug sooner, they said, 5000 lives could have been saved in the UK alone. The reasoning here appears to be that, because the drug prevents roughly 1 in 8 deaths from COVID-19, and because 40 000 people have died in the UK, you could have saved 12.5%, or 5000, of those people if you had treated them with this drug from the start.

Now that idea is fairly misleading -- it's a misapplication of the number needed to treat, and it ignores the reasonable likelihood that many patients were treated with dexamethasone or an equivalent drug anyway -- but it speaks to a larger point that we all need to be wary of: the issue of hindsight. It may be very tempting for us all to look back, in the months and years to come, and say "if only we had known this when ... " but the problem with these statements is that they ignore the realities of science.

Take the World Health Organization, for example. Many people have attacked it for saying in a tweet, on [14 Jan 2020], that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus. It's easy to look back now and say "well, that was obviously wrong", but if you actually look at the evidence that the WHO was working from at the time that statement was entirely correct. While we can argue about how forthcoming China was being in early January [2020], any scientist working from the information available would've been cautious, because there were simply too many unknowns to be sure of anything.

And broadly speaking, that's true of most things. We know now that hydroxychloroquine almost certainly doesn't work in treating COVID-19, with major clinical trials halted after finding no benefit, but that doesn't mean that we've wasted the last 3 months. It would have been enormously unscientific, not to mention unethical, to decide on the basis of incomplete information that one drug worked and simply start using it.

In fact, these hindsight comments ignore the truly breathtaking scientific effort that has taken place in 2020. If you had asked me only a year ago [2019] whether I thought that a 100-country trial involving patients in the tens of thousands could be set up and run within a month, I would've laughed -- the idea would've been preposterous. And yet that's almost exactly what the WHO has done in its Solidarity trial. The fact that we have seen results from thousands of patients carefully randomised into treatment arms within weeks of the study beginning is nothing short of miraculous and speaks to the truly astonishing effort that these researchers have put in to find out what does and doesn't work against COVID-19.

We can't look back and wonder what might have been, because the path that we've trodden was really the only one available. Perhaps in the next pandemic, we'll see science move even more quickly but, given the sheer number of papers published on the coronavirus since the year [2020] began, perhaps not.

The reality is that, while hindsight might be fun, it is misleading. Our knowledge of COVID-19 is changing every day, and it will continue to do so for years to come. You can't look back and wonder what if -- not just because it ignores the scientific process, but also because what we know now will probably be obsolete within weeks. In 2020 science has gone from a gradual accumulation of knowledge to a train at full steam. It's worth remembering that what is true today will almost certainly be proven false next week, and that when people appear to change their minds it is an inherently good thing -- adapting to new evidence is the cornerstone of science.

Ultimately, it is probably folly to think about the things we could've known. That's not to say that there weren't mistakes, things we could've done better -- obviously not everything went entirely to plan -- but that examining our failures with current knowledge simply doesn't make sense. We must always remember, when looking back, that there were so many things that we didn't -- and still don't -- know.

[These are words that needed to be said to remind all of us not to jump to severe criticism using 2020 hindsight. The reminder of the criticism of WHO's tweet, when the information available supported the tweet is something to keep in mind. And the warning that the plethora of scientific articles, many pre-peer reviewed that would not pass the peer review process leads folks down the garden path to draw conclusions only to be withdrawn as rigorous studies prove them wrong. The blame game grows tiresome to read. 20/20 hindsight is helpful to develop lessons learned moving forward, which should be the outcome of retrospective studies looking at what worked and what didn't work during the pandemic. One lesson learned late was the true stealth nature of this virus. Unlike its cousin's, the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, peak viral loads are pre-symptomatic, and that pre- and asymptomatic individuals have been implicated in transmission chains. The world learned the hard way, overlooking asymptomatic contacts for testing in the early days... but that's a takeaway lesson learned when dealing with new organisms... seek and ye shall find... - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 50.6% of the global newly reported cases and 63.3% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 40.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Brazil reported 25.9%, Mexico 7.9%, Chile 6.8%, and Peru 5.3%. The same 5 countries remained at the top, with changing orders... the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2 although they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold.

The European region reported 14.1% of the global newly reported cases and 11.1% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 39.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Sweden 15.3%, Turkey 6.4%, the UK 5.1%, Ukraine 4.4%, Belarus 2.7%, and Germany 2.7%. Again, the same countries with the addition of Sweden, minor juggling of orders and percentages day by day, although the proportion of cases represented by Russia has fallen.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 13.9% of the global newly reported cases and 12.1% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 21.3% of the regional newly reported cases followed by Saudi Arabia 18.3%, Iran 13.9%, Iraq 9.8%, Oman 8.7%, Egypt 8.5%, and Qatar 5.6%. Same countries, minor juggling of positions (Oman and Egypt switched positions).

The African region reported 5.7% of the global newly reported cases and 3.1% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 56.9% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 8.9%, Cameroon 8.1%, Gabon 4.1%, Cote d'Ivoire 2.5%, Mauritania 2.3%, and Central African Republic 2.1%. While South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2 in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day although Cameroon, Central African Republic, and Mauritania bear watching.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.78% of the global newly reported cases and 0.29% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 60.8% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 21.0%, Japan and China 5.0% each, and South Korea 4.4%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South East Asia region reported 14.9% of the global newly reported cases and 10.0% of global deaths. India reported 74.9% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 17.5%, Indonesia 4.8%, and Nepal 2.7%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 7000+ new cases a day (down from 8000+ per day). The Eastern Mediterranean had surpassed the European region in the past few days, but is slightly behind today (23 Jun 2020), with Pakistan reporting around 4000+ cases a day (over 3900 today 23 Jun 2020) and Saudi Arabia reporting around 4000+ cases a day (over 3300 today 23 Jun 2020). South East Asia has overtaken both the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions, with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day (over 14 000 cases today 23 Jun 2020). The Americas region is usually reporting around 70 000 cases a day (over 67 000 cases today 23 Jun 2020), with Brazil usually reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day (over 17 000 cases today 23 Jun 2020) and the USA at 20 000-25 000+ a day (over 27 000 today 23 Jun 2020). In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 3000-4000+ range daily, and the Western Pacific region is maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with the Philippines averaging 500+ cases per day (over 600 cases today 23 Jun 2020). (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 23 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

Countries with more than 5000 cases not on the list above (as the list has grown longer, we froze the list and maintain a list of countries passing the 5000-case mark):

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 9 353 735, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.42 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.9% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil, having crossed the 1 million mark (more than 1.15 million cases), represents 12.3% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. A global total of 479 805 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5545 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Chile, Italy, and Iran at number 10. China is number 21. In descending rank order, Brazil is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, India, Russia, Mexico, South Africa, Pakistan, Chile, Bangladesh, and Peru, all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, no change in the past 24 hours. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 8 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the European region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region. Again, there are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
