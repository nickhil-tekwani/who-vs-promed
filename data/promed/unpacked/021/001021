["AFB is the most serious bacterial disease of honey bee brood and is caused by the bacterium _Paenibacillus larvae_. The disease is transferred and initiated only by the spore stage of the bacterium. The reason this disease is so serious is that the spores can remain viable and last indefinitely on beekeeping equipment. It is extremely contagious and spreads easily on contaminated equipment, hive tools, and beekeeper's hands. A beekeeper's best way to manage AFB is to avoid it." http://caes2.caes.uga.edu/bees/disorders/bacterial.html#afb. - Mod.CRD
