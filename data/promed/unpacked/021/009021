Nine people were referred to doctors after possibly being exposed to rabies by a goat, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). Officials said the potential exposures happened when the victims were handling the goat on property in Anderson County. The goat was submitted to DHEC for lab testing on 8 Mar 2019. Results from the testing confirmed that the goat had rabies.

DHEC said the goat is the 3rd animal in Anderson County to test positive for rabies in 2019. So far, officials have confirmed 25 cases of animal rabies across the state this year [2019].

If you believe that you, your pets, or any family members have come into contact with an animal that possibly has rabies, you are urged to contact your local health care provider. The health care provider is required to report the incident to DHEC.

[Rabies cases in goats are rare, usually far less common than in other domestic mammals. There are few clinical reports on the furious form of rabies affecting goats, and the sporadic cases of rabid goats from surveillance programs worldwide lack clinical data. In Central and South America, the paralytic form of the disease that affects cattle, transmitted by vampire bats, has been reported sporadically.

Despite the rarity, a case of a rabid goat with human exposure was reported in the United States last year [2018], also in South Carolina (ProMED archive 20180502.5779549). - Mod.PMB
