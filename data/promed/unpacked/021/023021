Rare disease confirmed in Canada
-----------------------------------
A rare sexually transmitted disease has made its way to Canada. There have
been 22 cases of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) reported in Canada in
recent months, all in men who have sex with men with high-risk sexual
practices, according to a report published on Tue 31 May 2005 in the
on-line edition of the Canadian Medical Association Journal.
In fact, the way LGV is spreading -- among men who have anonymous sex in
bath houses (and the latest variation, encounters arranged via Internet
chat groups) -- is similar to the beginnings of the HIV-AIDS epidemic.
Unlike HIV-AIDS, however, LGV, a bacterial infection, is easily treatable
with antibiotics. But the symptoms -- small painless lesions on the
genitals and swollen glands -- are probably not familiar to most doctors.
What's more, an infection with LGV increases the risk of contracting and
spreading HIV-AIDS and hepatitis, partly because it creates sores, making
it easier for viruses to enter the bloodstream.
"This is an important public-health and clinical challenge," Dr. Thomas
Wong, director of the community-acquired-infections division of the Public
Health Agency of Canada said. He also said the arrival of a new sexually
transmitted disease reflects an upsurge in risky sexual behavior that stems
from "safer-sex fatigue," the popularity of party drugs that strip away
inhibitions (and often common sense), and the increasingly common practice
of anonymous sex.
"LGV isn't the only sexually transmitted disease we're seeing. The number
of cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia are all increasing," Dr. Wong said.
LGV is a form of chlamydia, a common sexually transmitted disease that can
cause infertility in women. But LGV is more invasive. Left untreated, it
can cause destructive swelling of the genitals and rectum and even lead to
meningitis (swelling of the lining of the brain), encephalitis (swelling of
the brain) and death. The infection is common in the tropics, including
Africa, Asia, South America and the Caribbean.
Until recently, it was virtually unknown in industrialized countries. That
changed, perhaps forever, in 2003, when a cluster of cases sprang up in the
Netherlands among sex tourists. The disease then spread to Belgium, France,
Germany, Sweden, Britain, and now the USA and Canada.
Dr. Wong said the rapid spread reflects the increasing globalization of
infectious diseases in an era of easy air travel and frequent trips for
work and pleasure.
According to the new study, none of the men infected with LGV in Canada had
traveled abroad recently, but all had the same strain of the disease that
is circulating in the Netherlands. What distinguishes those who have been
infected with LGV is that few of them could identify their recent sexual
partners, and their propensity for high-risk sexual activity.
Virtually all the men engaged in "Internet partnering," frequented bath
houses, or had sex at rave parties, according to the study. Half of the
infected practiced "barebacking," anal sex without a condom. They also
engaged in "booty bumping" -- ingesting the drug crystal meth anally -- and
in fisting.
Dr. Wong said the Public Health Agency of Canada is stepping up
surveillance for LGV and will try to educate physicians to spot symptoms
early. "This infection could spread to more people," he said. "We're
concerned that it could have an impact on the HIV and hepatitis epidemics
in the future."
The USA CDC has expressed similar concerns. In particular, the CDC has
warned men who have sex with men who practice unprotected sex to look out
for symptoms of LGV and cautioned that these symptoms, in particular
inflammation and bleeding of the rectum and colon, can be misdiagnosed as
colitis and Crohn's disease.

The posting does not report on locales of the infected individuals, and
none were epidemiologically-linked. Of the 22 cases noted, data was
available on 19, all male. 12 had had a sexual contact in the 60 days
before, 10 had from 1-16 male partners only, one had had 2 female partners
only and one did not disclose partner information.
Antimicrobial treatment of LGV is generally doxycycline 100 mg orally twice
daily for 21 days. - Mod.LL]
[This current increase in LGV is expanding its geographic reach with cases
reported now from the UK, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Sweden,
multiple cities within the United States and now Canada. The disturbing
side of this outbreak is that it is indicative of an overall increase in
sexually transmitted diseases, suggesting that high risk behavior is
increasing among sexually active groups. - Mod.MPP]
