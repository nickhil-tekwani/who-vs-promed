A Canadian citizen in Costa Rica is the 6th recorded case of malaria in Costa Rica this year [2013], but authorities believe the patient acquired the disease while on a trip to Peru.

An investigation into the case has determined that the patient contracted the disease in Peru, according to Director of Health Surveillance, Mary Ethel Trejos.

According to Trejos, the patient had spent 2 weeks in Peru, followed by 7 days in Panama, prior to arriving in Costa Rica. Trejos explained that health authorities were able to determine that the disease was contracted while the patient was in Peru because of the incubation period of the parasite that causes the disease.

Trejos said the man is in Monteverde and in good health, and has informed health authorities in Peru and Canada of his condition.

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease, which in severe cases can progress to coma or death.

This is the 6th case of malaria reported in Costa Rica this year [2013]. According to health authorities, most of the cases involved patients contracting the illness abroad.

[Costa Rica reported no autochthonous malaria cases in 2012 although 1 percent of the population (47 300) live in high risk areas defined as a population risk greater than 1 per 1000 population per year. This case was most probably infected outside Costa Rica (World Malaria Report 2012, Country profile Costa Rica http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/profile_cri_en.pdf). - Mod.EP
