Encephalitis is back again to haunt the children of eastern Uttar Pradesh as 21 deaths have been reported in the past 3 days itself from 4 district hospitals in and around Gorakhpur.

The maximum number of deaths is being reported from the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur. So far, 241 encephalitis deaths have been reported since the beginning of the year [2012].

Encephalitis is an air and water-borne viral that mostly affects children under the age of 6 [years]. Estimates suggest that the deadly virus has killed more than 50 000 children in the last 3 decades.

[The numbers of deaths from encephalitis in eastern Uttar Pradesh state in 2012 continue to climb from 129 on 12 Jul 2012, to 146 as of 30 Jul 2012, to 241 cited above on 3 Sep 2012. The reports concerning the etiology of these cases continue to be confusing, sometimes mentioning Japanese encephalitis virus infections for some or all of the cases and at other times associating the cases with contaminated water suggesting enteroviruses. Still another report proposes heat stroke as the cause of these cases. The report above makes mention of airborne factors for the 1st time, without suggesting the pathogen that might be involved. Until there is a definitive diagnosis of the cause of these illnesses and deaths, it will be difficult to implement effective preventive efforts.
