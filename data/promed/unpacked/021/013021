[Of the 16 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections 3 are in asymptomatic known contacts of previously confirmed cases. These newly confirmed cases (and deaths) are spread throughout the country [see source URL above]. It appears as though all of these newly confirmed cases were infected through person-to-person transmission. While location of contact with previously confirmed cases is not always specified, a number of the cases were known to have been admitted to hospitals for other health conditions prior to the onset of symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV infection.

This moderator erroneously stated that it appeared as though all newly confirmed infections reported above were person-to-person transmission. The actual thought process was that over the past several days, there has been no mention of history of travel or history of contact with animals (and especially camels or camel products) suggesting that perhaps most of the newly confirmed infections were felt to be due to either direct person-to-person transmission or indirect person-to-person transmission both in the healthcare environment and or community. More in-depth studies on the routes of transmission would be helpful. - Mod.MPP]

Council of Medical Advisors appointed to help address MERS-CoV -- 27 Apr 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
His Excellency Eng Adel M Fakeih, Minister of Health in charge, has appointed a Council of Medical Advisors with extensive experience in infectious diseases, to help combat the MERS coronavirus in the Kingdom.

The 10-member council will work under the direction of Dr Prof Tariq Ahmed Madani who was appointed last week as a special advisor to the Ministry. The role of the Council will be to advise the Ministry on the status and severity of the [MERS-CoV], as well as the management of existing cases, in the interest of containing the virus and minimizing the risk to public health.

The specialist council members will include Dr Prof Tariq Ahmed Madani -- Internal Medicine & Infectious Diseases from King Abdulaziz University; Professor Eltayeb Abuelzein -- Virology & Veterinary Medicine from King Abdulaziz University; Dr Esam Ibraheem Azhar -- Molecular Virology from King Abdulaziz University; Dr Anees Sendi -- Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine from King Abdulaziz University, Dr Abdulhakeem Althaqafi -- Internal Medicine & Infectious Diseases from King Faisal Specialist Hospital; Dr Basem Alraddadi -- Internal Medicine & Infectious Diseases from King Faisal Specialist Hospital; Dr Mohammad Qutb -- Laboratory Medicine from King Faisal Specialist Hospital; Dr Ali Alshareef -- Emergency Medicine & Intensive Care from National Guard Hospital; Dr Yaser Mandoora -- Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine from Ministry of Defense; Dr Samar Badruddin -- Internal Medicine & Infectious Diseases from Fageeh Hospital.

HE Eng Adel Fakeih said: "Council members have been chosen based on past relevant experience with similar public health challenges. Their advice and support will undeniably enhance the Ministry's ability to understand, analyze and report on the virus. As we continue to gather new information we look forward to the Council's ideas on how to prevent the spread of virus across the country and internationally."

"This is an important step towards ensuring public safety. I remain fully committed to addressing the public health challenge presented by the MERS coronavirus," he added.

In addition to the Council, the recently appointed Minister has opened 3 Specialist Health Centers in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam to ensure suitable treatment facilities are available for those affected by the MERS coronavirus.

[4] Saudi Arabia: MOH advises against direct contact with camels -- media report
Date: Wed 30 Apr 2014
Source: Saudi Gazette [summ., edited]
http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentid=20140430203585


Acting health minister Adel Fakeih said a group of Western experts and representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) have met for 2 days in Riyadh to discuss "a series of preventive measures... to contain the spread" of MERS.

"These measures will be announced in the coming days," Fakeih told reporters.

He announced that the ministry started implementing an urgent plan to understand and analyze the nature of coronavirus and exploring the best ways to contain it.

The minister warned people against direct contact with camels. There should be extra care while handling raw meat of camel, and its milk should be consumed only after boiling, the minister said while adding that cooked meat poses no danger.

Fakeih has appointed a council of medical advisors with extensive experience in infectious diseases to help combat the MERS in the Kingdom. The 10-member council will work under Dr Prof Tariq Ahmed Madani who was appointed last week [week of 21 Apr 2014] as a special adviser to the ministry.

Last week, the WHO announced its readiness to send international experts to Saudi Arabia to investigate "any evolving risk" associated with the transmission pattern of the virus. MERS is considered a deadlier but less-transmissible cousin of the SARS virus that erupted in Asia in 2003.

[According to the Saudi MOH website, there have now been 361 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 107 deaths confirmed in Saudi Arabia since the virus was 1st identified in a case that died in June 2012.

Each of the daily reports on new laboratory confirmed infections with MERS-CoV now contains a map showing the geographic distribution of cases and deaths reported in Saudi Arabia in the 24 hours covered by the report, as well as graphs by type of facility (public, private, or home isolation), by age and health status, and by gender. These can be seen at the source URLs provided for items [1] and [2] above.

The press releases and media report above suggest that there is a major effort ongoing to interrupt transmission of the MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, both in terms of the nosocomial transmission that is apparently occurring in Jeddah, Riyadh, and now Tabuk, and the possible interspecies transmission that may well be occurring between humans and camels. The MOH announcement to avoid direct contact with camels is a significant step as camels are a major part of everyday life in the region. - Mod.MPP
