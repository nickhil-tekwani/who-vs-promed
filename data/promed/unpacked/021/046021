Atlantic Brant Mortality in New Jersey
-------------------------------------
Atlantic brant are small, dark geese that breed in the arctic and winter
primarily along the New Jersey coast. Approximately 95 000 brant were
recently counted during the midwinter population surveys of coastal New
Jersey (NJ).
The first brant mortality event was noted in early November 2000 when sick
and dead birds were found on a shallow freshwater impoundment on US Fish &
Wildlife Service Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge near Atlantic
City, NJ. Sick birds were isolated from the flock, and sat hunched up with
their wings out and heads hanging down and to the side and had difficulty
flying or swimming. Sick birds tended to die shortly after capture with
both adults and juveniles affected. The mortality ended by early December
with approximately 700 carcasses collected. Sick and dead birds were
primarily found on the refuge although some carcasses were found up to 15
miles away.
A second brant mortality event began about 15 Jan 2001 when sick and dead
brant were observed in several bays in the tidal marsh area near Atlantic
City, NJ. The second mortality event lasted only a few days but over 700
carcasses were collected. A few additional carcasses have since been found.
During both episodes, carcasses were submitted to the USGS National
Wildlife Health Center and New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife Office
of Fish and Wildlife Health and Forensics.
In general, the birds were in good body condition. Clear viscous fluid ran
from the mouth and nostrils of some birds. Some had hemorrhages into the
dermis and breast muscles, and on serosal surfaces of the heart,
proventriculus, gizzard and colon. Small pale foci were found in the livers
and pancreases, and enlarged livers were noted in some of the birds.
Pulmonary edema and/or dark red wet lungs were consistent and intense. The
stomachs were usually empty except for sand. Some birds which retained
identifiable food substances had sea lettuce and in one instance seeds of
_Spartina alternaflora_. Some of the examined brant, especially those from
the second mortality event, did not have any gross lesions.
Principal histological findings were necrosis of lymphocytes in organs of
the immune system, epi-myocardial hemorrhages and acute hepatocellular
necrosis. A few granulomas and sectioned nematodes were occasionally
observed in liver and lung tissue from some specimens. Mild periportal
hepatitis with lymphocytes and eosinophils dominating the inflammatory
cellular response was observed in livers infected with nematodes.
Renal collecting tubular necrosis with lymphocyte and eosinophil
infiltration was associated with the presence of renal coccidians in some
birds. Blood vessels in the brain, liver, lung and kidney were often
congested with blood. Occasionally, mild focal hemorrhages occurred in
these organs. There has been no evidence histologically of avian vacuolar
myelinopathy in the brains.
Bacterial and viral isolation and detection attempts by a variety of
methods including electron microscopy have not revealed the etiologic
agent. Specifically, special cultures and tests for West Nile Virus, duck
plague, Newcastle disease, and avian influenza have been negative. Brain
acetylcholinesterase activity has been within normal limits and tests for
botulinum toxins and rodenticides were negative.
Multiple bird species are present in the tidal marshes. However Atlantic
brant appear to be the only species affected. There have been no observed
fish kills or unusual mammal morbidity or mortality noted in or around the
die-off area. Since the etiology of the brant mortality was undiagnosed
during hunting season, hunters were advised to avoid shooting or eating brant.
The cause of the mortality remains undetermined, however some tests are
still in progress. Investigations and diagnostic tests continue for a range
of etiologies including infectious diseases and toxins. Partners in this
endeavor include New Jersey Department of Agriculture, New Jersey
Department of Health and Human Services, US Department of Agriculture VSL
and NJVS, Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Biotoxin Laboratory.

[There have been reports of the birds dying from mercury and air pollution.
However, clinical signs of mercury poisoning are not consistent with the
deaths of these birds. Furthermore, in discussion with Dr. Miller, there
are no other animals or fish affected. If the culprit of the brant deaths
were mercury and/or air pollution, then other animals would have been
affected. - Mod.TG
