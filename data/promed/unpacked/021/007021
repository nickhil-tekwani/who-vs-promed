Botulism type E mortalities, wild birds, lower Great Lakes, Ontario, 2007
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Botulism type E is the presumed cause of death in fish-eating birds
recently reported from Michigan (ProMED-mail 20071103.3572;
20071111.3665). We report here outbreaks of confirmed and presumptive
botulism type E encountered on the Ontario side of the lower Great
Lakes in 2007. The specific outbreak data are summarized and a map is
available at <http://wildlife1.usask.ca/en/botulism_ontario_news.php>
[You are strongly recommended to read this. - Mod.MHJ]

Since mid-September 2007, 26 outbreaks of mortality suspected of
being due to botulism type E have been reported to the
Ontario/Nunavut Region of Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre
(CCWHC), one in September, 19 in October, and 6 in November. First
reports were mainly from Lake Huron, including Georgian Bay;
subsequently, incidents occurred on both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
Reports described scores to hundreds of birds involved, including
fish-eating species (common loons, red-necked grebes, horned grebes,
double-crested cormorants, red-breasted mergansers), mussel-feeding
diving ducks (white-winged scoters, long-tailed ducks),
invertebrate-feeders (mallard ducks, black ducks), or scavengers
(great black-backed gull, herring gull, ring-billed gulls, Bonaparte's gulls).

A total of 14 incidents generated submissions of carcasses for
diagnosis. Birds from 6 submissions are as of this date [6 Dec 2007]
confirmed botulism type E positive based on mouse protection test;
the birds from 2 submissions tested negative; results are pending on
5, and birds in one were too decomposed for diagnosis. Birds
submitted are necropsied and alternative diagnoses are sought. No
avian influenza viruses were detected, and no significant bacterial,
toxic, or parasitic diseases were detected using appropriate
diagnostic modalities, including histology. Botulism remains the
presumptive diagnosis in the outbreaks that tested negative. In some
instances the mouse protection test may not be sufficiently sensitive
to be diagnostic when the test substrate is an extract of tissue from
dead birds, as in our cases.

Since 1998 we have experienced outbreaks of botulism type E in
Ontario, on Lake Huron (since 1998), western Lake Erie (since 1999),
spreading east down Lake Erie 2000-2003, and into Lake Ontario in
2004. Reports this year [2007] encompassed the geographic span
previously experienced, but some from Lake Huron were further north,
and Georgian Bay was involved for the 1st time. Dissemination of
alien invaders -- zebra and quagga mussels and a mussel-feeding fish,
the round goby, 1st recognized in the Lake St. Clair/western Lake
Erie area about a decade earlier, may have created circumstances
favourable to the evolution of _Clostridium botulinum_ type E
neurotoxin in the benthic environment, and its translocation into
fish, fish-eating birds, and diving ducks. _C. botulinum_ is presumed
to be endemic, not introduced. The toxin may be available
more-or-less year round, affecting fish, resident cormorants,
scavengers, and shore-birds during the summer, while more obvious
outbreaks occur in the fall when waves of migrant fish-eating birds
and diving and dabbling ducks arrive.

[Our thanks to Ian and his expert colleagues for this valuable
report. Greatly appreciated.

Plagiarising from my good colleague Tam Garland: The sporulating
anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_ elaborates 7 types of
antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect humans: type A,
B, E, or rarely type F toxin. Types A and B toxins are highly
poisonous proteins resistant to digestion by GI (gastrointestinal)
enzymes. Approximately 50 percent of foodborne outbreaks in the USA
are caused by type A toxin, followed by types B and E.

Type C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds
living in an aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most
notably in waterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America,
it has been reported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and
Australia. In the Great Lakes region, it was first identified in 1936
in ducks on Green Bay of Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County
marshes along Lake Erie. Type C is most often associated with
limberneck paralysis in birds.

Type E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs
mainly in gulls and loons, and to a lesser extent in mergansers, mute
swans, grebes, and shorebirds. It now appears any birds or mammals
susceptible to botulinal toxin run a risk of becoming poisoned if
they scavenge dead fish. Evidence for this includes the
identification of type E toxin in a bald eagle, wood ducks, and
muskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.. - Mod.MHJ]
