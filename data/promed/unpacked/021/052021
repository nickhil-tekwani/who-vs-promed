Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
ovi / 4441 / 299 / 33 / 266 / 0
Diagnosis:
Clinical signs compatible with bluetongue were detected on 4 Sep 2001. A
total of 51 sheep showed clinical signs, 5 of which died the following day.
The affected sheep showed typical signs of bluetongue: a temperature of 39
degrees C, inflammation of the buccal and nasal mucosa and, in some cases,
lesions in the mouth and on the feet.
Blood samples were collected from susceptible animals in the affected
territory for serological examination.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made:
- On 5 Sep 2001, bluetongue was diagnosed by the Scientific Veterinary
Institute in Belgrade.
- On 4 Oct 2001, samples were sent for typing to the OIE Reference
Laboratory for bluetongue, Pirbright, United Kingdom. On 15 Oct, the
Reference Laboratory confirmed the presence of bluetongue virus in the samples.
B. Diagnostic tests used: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Epidemiology: the fact that the disease has occurred in a border region
means that the virus may have been spread by the wind from a neighboring
country.
Control measures: after the laboratory confirmation, the following measures
were implemented:
- killing and destruction of animals showing clinical signs;
- establishment of a 100-km monitoring zone;
- movement ban on susceptible animals within the protection zone;
- sampling and diagnostic examination of susceptible animals;
- disinsectisation and disinfection within the protection zone;
- serological surveillance for the disease.
