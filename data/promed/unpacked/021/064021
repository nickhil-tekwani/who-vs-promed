Most of the winter wheat crop is in fair condition and ahead of
normal crop development throughout the United States. Throughout
much of the northern spring grain area rain has delayed fieldwork.
Wheat stem rust. On 18 Apr 2006, wheat stem rust was at low levels
in plots at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. These plots of wheat were drying
down 14 days earlier than normal because of minimal rainfall. There
have been no other reports of wheat stem rust in the U.S.
Wheat leaf rust. In late April, plots of susceptible wheat cultivars
had leaf rust severities up to 80 percent, in the area from central
Texas, central Mississippi to central Georgia. Fields in the same
area had severities from 0 to 10 percent (Fig. 1). Drier than normal
conditions in March and April slowed rust development throughout much
of the southern U.S. On 1 May, traces of leaf rust were found in
plots at Stillwater in northeastern Oklahoma. The wheat is at the
milk stage of maturity and therefore it is too late for rust to cause
high yield losses this year. In late April, traces of leaf rust were
found in south central Kansas. In this area wheat was under extreme
drought stress and at heading to early flowering growth stage. In
late April, plots of susceptible wheat cultivars in northeastern
Louisiana had leaf rust severities up to 80 percent on flag leaves.
Leaf rust severity will increase significantly with the warmer
temperatures. In late April, plots in e!
ast central Arkansas had 0-50 percent leaf rust severities. In this
area rainfall has been at normal levels. Leaf rust should continue
to increase and provide inoculum for the northern wheat growing area.
Wheat stripe rust. In late April, hot and dry conditions slowed any
stripe rust development in plots and fields throughout the southern
U.S. (Fig. 2). For example, in central Texas and northeastern
Louisiana plots stripe rust infections were observed but there was
little sporulation occurring. During 2005 there was more stripe rust
because the cooler than normal temperatures in the last 2 weeks of
April were more conducive for stripe rust development in the southern
U.S. In late April, severe stripe rust was observed in late maturing
susceptible cultivars in the nursery at Plains in southwestern
Georgia. In the nursery most of the stripe rust infections had
occurred earlier in March and April when temperatures were
cooler. By late April leaf rust was the most prevalent rust on wheat
at Plains. On April 26, light amounts of stripe rust were reported
on winter wheat in plots at St. Paul, Minnesota. This was most
likely from an over wintering infection. By the 3rd week in April,
susceptible entries in winter wheat nurseries at Mount Vernon in
northwestern Washington had 60 percent levels of stripe rust
infection. In south central and southeastern Washington, early
planted winter wheat fields had 5 percent stripe rust severity. In
this area the initial stripe development was much later than in 2005,
but about normal for this area.

[There are 3 main rust diseases of the cereal crop plant wheat (bread
wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_), all
caused by species of the fungus Puccinia: wheat stem rust (_P.
graminis f.sp. tritici_), wheat leaf rust (_P. triticina_ aka _P.
recondita f. sp. tritici_) and wheat stripe rust (_P. striiformis f.
sp. tritici_).
Severe losses due to wheat stem rusts have abated in the USA since
the 1960s due to effective resistance breeding. Severe losses are
still a possibility with leaf rust. The USDA Cereal Disease
Laboratory in St. Paul, MN publishes regular reports on cereal rusts
in the USA during the crop season. Each report gives detailed
state-by-state information, including a summary map, all in pdf file
format (see link to main article).
In this the 4th bulletin for 2006 it is noted that wheat leaf rust is
widespread and increasing in severity throughout the southern U.S.
Leaf rust should continue to increase and provide inoculum for the
northern wheat growing area. Last year [2005] there was more stripe
rust in the southern U.S in April than in 2006 because the cooler
than normal temperatures in the last 2 weeks of that month were more
conducive for stripe rust development.
