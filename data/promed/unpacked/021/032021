Epidemic measles in the Campania region of Italy leads to 13 cases of
encephalitis and 3 deaths
------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------
Measles vaccine became commercially available in Italy in 1976 and the
administration of one dose at 15 months of age was recommended by the
ministry of health in 1979. In the 1980s measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
vaccine was introduced, and in 1999 the recommended age for the first dose
was lowered to 12 months. Regional health authorities are responsible for
decisions about the administration of MMR vaccine, and vaccination coverage
varies greatly by region. In 1999, taking into account the varying levels
of vaccine coverage in children up to the age of 24 months in different
regions, the ministry of health recommended strategies including a catch-up
campaign, and the offer of a second dose (1). A distinction was made
between areas where coverage with one dose of measles vaccine was less than
80 per cent and areas with higher coverage. Areas with lower coverage
emphasised the vaccination of older susceptible children; regions where
vaccine coverage within the first 2 years of life exceeded 80 per cent
recommended the administration of a second dose at 5 or 6 years or at 11 to
12 years of age.
Despite the increase in measles vaccination coverage observed in the 1990s,
the estimated national vaccination coverage up to 24 months of age in 2000
was still lower than 80 per cent, and lower than 60 per cent in many
southern regions. After 4 years of low incidence (the last measles epidemic
was in 1996 and 1997), in February 2002 the Sorveglianza Pediatri
Sentinella (Paediatric Sentinel Surveillance System, SPES) detected an
increase of measles incidence in Italy (2). The most affected area was
Campania, a region in southern Italy where measles vaccination coverage is
poor. The risk of an epidemic was considered high, and the regional health
authority was alerted, with a recommendation that it should strengthen
surveillance and improve uptake of vaccination. An investigation of the
epidemic was also begun; preliminary results for the period January-May
2002 are reported in this update.
Methods
-------
Information about cases was obtained by SPES. This sentinel system consists
of national health system primary care pediatricians: participation is
voluntary, the case definitions are clinical, and pediatricians report
cases monthly, giving for each patient the sex, date of birth, date of
onset of the illness, and vaccination status. Even if they do not see any
case of any of the reportable diseases during the month, pediatricians are
asked to send in the monthly form, so that the children in their practices
can be included in the denominator (zero reporting). Incidence rates are
estimated as the number of cases per 100 000 children (under 14 years); the
denominator includes children under the care of the participating
pediatricians. Feedback of results is provided monthly on a web page
<http://www.spes.iss.it/>.
Data on hospital admissions for measles were collected by reviewing
discharge records of the 5 main regional hospitals with infectious diseases
units (Cotugno Hospital in Naples and the regional hospitals of Caserta,
Benevento, Avellino, and Salerno). For each patient the sex, date of birth,
date of hospital admission and discharge, diagnosis, and outcome were
collected.
Data on regional vaccination coverage were derived from an ad hoc survey
conducted in 2000 and 2001 (3), on a sample of 12 647 children born in 1998
and aged 24 to 36 months.
Results
-------
From January to May 2002, an average of 50 pediatricians in Campania took
part in the SPES system. These pediatricians follow an estimated 41 000
children aged 0 to 14 years (4 per cent of the total pediatric population
of the region).
Between January and May, the number of measles cases notified by the SPES
pediatricians increased progressively; 981 cases were reported in 5 months
compared with a total of 18 during the previous 2 years. The estimated
measles incidence for the 5 months based on the SPES data was 2300 cases
per 100 000 children under 14 years; applying this rate to the overall
pediatric population of the region yields an estimated total of 24 000
measles cases. The highest incidence was observed in children aged 5 to 9
years, followed by those aged 10 to 14 years. Vaccinated cases accounted
for 6 per cent, and for 8 per cent in the 1 to 4 year age group (20/239).
The regional measles vaccination coverage for the 1998 birth cohort was 65
per cent. Assuming that this coverage applies to the 1 to 4 year age group,
the efficacy of measles vaccine, estimated with the screening method (4),
is 95 per cent.
The January to April 2002 incidence by region is shown in the table, as is
the region specific vaccine coverage for the 1998 birth cohort. The
incidence by region corresponds closely with the vaccine coverage; the
incidence is highest in the two regions with the lowest coverage (Caserta
and Naples), while the regions with the highest coverage (Benevento and
Avellino) have had fewer cases. It should be noted, however, than only two
pediatricians from Avellino contribute data to the SPES system, and the
results for this region should be interpreted with caution.

In the first 5 months of the year, 368 people were admitted to hospital
with measles (provisional data as of 5 June 2002). Of these, 63 had
pulmonary complications, 13 had encephalitis, and 3 died. The 3 deaths were
of children aged 6 months, 4 years, and 10 years. Most of the admissions
(258/368) were to Cotugno hospital in Naples; in this hospital the age of
patients with measles ranged from 15 days to 68 years, with 83 per cent of
the admissions of children under 15 years of age.
Conclusions
-----------
The epidemic in Campania has the characteristics of an epidemic in a
population with intermediate levels of vaccine coverage - levels are high
enough to increase the length of interepidemic period (In Campania, the
last epidemic occurred in 1996, and the interepidemic period was much
longer than that observed in the absence of vaccination: 6 years versus 3
years), but too low to interrupt transmission of the infection.
The key to preventing epidemics of this type is to address the accumulation
of susceptibles in all age groups as quickly as possible. The regional
health authorities have thus recommended: a) intensification of active
vaccination of those exposed in family and school settings; b) vaccination
starting at 6 months of age, with subsequent revaccination after 1 year of
those children vaccinated between 6 and 12 months. This measure was
introduced to protect infants under 12 months of age during the epidemic,
since cases were observed in this age group; c) offering vaccine to all
people who have not been vaccinated or who have no history of measles.
According to SPES results, incidence in the 20 other regions of Italy was
much lower than that observed in Campania; in fact, excluding this region,
the incidence of measles between January and May 2002 averaged 77 cases/100
000. Nevertheless, apart from Campania, there are other areas with low
measles vaccination coverage. To prevent new epidemics it is therefore
essential to have a strong political and technical commitment that
guarantees high levels of coverage in all the regions, both in children
aged 12 to 24 months and in older children. There is a need for national
and regional health authorities to agree a strategic plan for measles
elimination. In addition to measures aimed at strengthening the routine
vaccination program (for example, reducing missed opportunities and
inappropriate contraindications, and training health staff to improve the
management of immunization services), the implementation of a vaccination
campaign targeting all children between 5 and 13 years of age, regardless
of their previous vaccine and disease history, should be considered. By
vaccinating susceptible individuals in the age group with the highest risk,
and administering a second dose to those already vaccinated, this campaign
may interrupt measles transmission.
