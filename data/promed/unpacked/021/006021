Two new bluetongue outbreaks on highland farms
----------------------------------------------
Bluetongue outbreaks have been notified and published by the Ministry of
the Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs on 20 Oct 2008 in 2 highland
farms in the townships Aracena and Almonaster La Real, province of Huelva.

Yesterday [31 Oct 2008] the Junta de Andalucia (Andalusian parliament)
announced that 2.6 million animals (sheep and cattle) are to be vaccinated
with the BTV-8 vaccine within the campaign, which commenced on 10 Oct 2008,
following the detection in Andalusia of a focus of this serotype (in
Alhaurin el Grande, Malaga) and is to be concluded by 31 Mar 2009. 775 000
animals are to be vaccinated in Cordoba, 400 000 in Seville, and 22 000 in
Huelva.

The Minister for the Environment, Rural and Marine Affairs published
yesterday [31 Oct 2008] an ordinance establishing the guidelines for the
bluetongue vaccination. The ordinance states that "all the territory must
be vaccinated with BTV serotypes 1 and 8 by 31 Mar 2009.

The director of Agricultural Production and Livestock indicated that the
important decision was taken "with a vision to the future" to "simplify the
control of the disease," and that "all Spain will be in the same
conditions, thus enabling animal movements and trade by 31 Mar 2009, when
the restriction zones currently in place will be terminated. To this effect
the terms to be followed are: until 1 Dec 2008 "the current restricted
zones will remain in place with the same guidelines for movement. Between 1
Dec 2008 and 31 Mar 2009 it is expected that there is no risk of disease
because it is the "vector free" season. After 31 Mar 2009, all the animals
will have been primarily vaccinated with BTV-8 and re-vaccinated with the
previous serotypes."

The initial, early detection of BTV-8 in Malaga (Alhaurin el Grande) was
possible thanks to the Andalusian Plan of Epidemiological Vigilance (PAVE),
put in place by the Government of Andalusia.

Up to recently, only BTV-4 (2004) and BTV-1 (2007) had been recorded in
Andalusia.

[The report above does not clearly specify the serotype of the virus in
Huelva, but one can assume that it is the same virus reported from Malaga,
namely BTV-8.

Spain's strategy towards the control of bluetongue, based upon mass
vaccination against all BTV serotypes which have been circulating there in
recent years while accepting their possibly established endemicity,
reflects a realistic approach: "to live with bluetongue". Probably, such an
approach is the outcome of Spain's relatively long experience with this
orbivirus. In fact, the 1st major epizootic of bluetongue affected Spain as
far back as 1956-1960.

BTV-4 was initially recognised in Spain's mainland (Andalusia) in 2004. In
July 2007, BTV-1 was identified as well in Andalusia, following the major
BTV-1 epizootic in North Africa, namely Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia
during the summer and fall of 2006. In November 2007, BTV-1 was also
reported from a northern, distant, hitherto uninfected part of Spain,
namely the Basque Country, adjacent to the border between northern Spain
and south west France (see report and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6440>).
Subsequently, BTV-1 has been spreading further to the north and east in
France, recently leaping to Brittany in north west France.

In May 2008, the Spanish authorities declared that the BTV-1 event "is
unlikely to be contained and is now considered to be endemic", stating that
"no more follow-up reports will be made, but instead, information about
this disease will be included in the future 6-monthly reports." The
6-monthly report from Spain for the 1st semester of 2008 is not yet available.

BTV-8 was recorded for the 1st time in Spain in January 2008, namely in
Cantabria, in the north, into which it most likely spread from France. On
10 Oct 2008, Spain reported a long leap of BTV-8 to distant, southern
Malaga in Andalusia; for further details and a map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7414>.

An administrative map, showing, among others, the respective locations of
the 2 currently (BTV-8) affected Andalusian provinces -- Malaga and Huelva
-- is available at
<http://www.donquijote.org/destinations/images/Spain-map.jpg>.

Though the 2 new BTV foci currently reported by the Huelva source above are
probably caused by BTV-8, confirmation is pending. Malaga and Huelva are
included in the BTV restriction zone 'S' (colored brown), where the BTV
serotypes 1, 4, and 8 are considered to be circulating and/or included in
the vaccines applied. See in the EU map, updated 29 Oct 2008, available at
