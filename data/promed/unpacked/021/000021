The outbreak of hepatitis C in a remote village of Takiya-Magam, Kokernag has not only created panic among the residents of the area but has also left the health experts in a state of worry as they are yet to find out its exact cause.

After the reports that out of more than 1000 samples taken from the village during last 2 weeks 300 people have tested positive, a team of health and drug officials today [29 Jan 2013] visited the village and educated the people about the precautions to be taken to avoid catching the virus.

Chief Medical Officer [CMO], Anantnag Dr Gulzar, confirming the outbreak of the viral disease in the village, said they are trying to arrive at the exact source of the epidemic. "There could be many reasons for the spread of the disease, including the use of [contaminated] needles and sexual intercourse, but as far as the number of people having been infected so far is concerned, we cannot conclude that these could be the only reasons. We, too, are surprised over the spread of the virus at such an alarming pace," the CMO said. He further said 30 percent of the cases having acquired the virus have never been administered injection. "We talked to most of the people suffering from the disease, but most of them said that they have never been injected in their lives. So, we too are surprised as to what actually led to it," the CMO added.

He said that he along with a team of experts today [29 Jan 2013] rushed to the village to educate the people about the do's and don'ts. "Keeping the alarming situation in consideration, we have started a campaign in the whole area to make the people aware about the precautions to be taken," the CMO said.

Though the chemists operating in the area are being blamed for the spread of the epidemic by some locals, the officials say that they have not found any evidence against the chemists which could suggest their involvement.

"After the detection of several cases of hepatitis C in the village earlier this month [January 2013], a team of drug officials headed by assistant drug controller Anantnag rushed there and suspended the licenses of all the 3 medicates of the village for 10 days. However, during the investigations, none of them was found involved in [any] kind of mischief. Later, it was on the demand of the people of the village [that] all the 3 medical shops had to be unlocked by the district drug authorities," said a drug official wishing anonymity.

Meanwhile, the Pharmacists Association Anantnag said the pharmacists are being targeted under a well planned conspiracy. "Some cases had been detected in the area 3 years back, and the health authorities were in slumber during all these years. Now, when the epidemic has engulfed the whole village, the authorities, in order to save their necks, started putting blame on the pharmacists. If any of the pharmacists are found involved in some kind of mischief, the association will not leave it to the government but will itself burn down his shop. I can tell you with confidence that it is only an attempt to victimise the pharmacists of the village," said president of the Pharmacist Association, Majid Majeed.

Villagers have accused the authorities of leaving the entire populace of the village at the mercy of the chemists. "The village [comprises] at least a population of 7000, but so far, the authorities have not bothered to establish even a small dispensary in the area. Last time, when their shops were closed by the authorities, we had to approach the administration for unlocking their shops as there is no other option for the patients of the area. Now, if the authorities blame them for the spread of the epidemic, then why did they not bother to set up even a small health center in the village," said Sarpanch of the village.

[Jammu and Kashmir is the northernmost state of India. It is situated mostly in the Himalayan mountains. Jammu and Kashmir shares a border with the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south and internationally with the People's Republic of China to the north and east, and the Pakistan-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan to the west and northwest, respectively. Formerly a part of the erstwhile Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu, which governed the larger historic region of Kashmir, this territory is disputed among China, India and Pakistan. Pakistan, which claims the territory as disputed [1] refers to it alternatively as Indian-occupied Kashmir or Indian-held Kashmir, while some international agencies such as the United Nations [2] call it Indian-administered Kashmir. The regions under the control of Pakistan are referred to as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir or PoK within India and Pakistan-administered Kashmir generally.

Jammu and Kashmir consists of 3 regions: Jammu, the Kashmir valley, and Ladakh. Srinagar is the summer capital, and Jammu is the winter capital. A map of Jammu & Kashmir can be accessed at: http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/faultlines/volume16/Article1.htm.

Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver.

Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products and organ transplants, injections given with contaminated syringes and needle-stick injuries in health-care settings, injection drug use, and being born to a hepatitis C-infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.

The origin of the virus responsible for the outbreak affecting this village in Jammu and Kashmir has not yet been determined, and the outcome of further investigation is awaited. - Mod.CP
