After more than 22 months of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the Region of the Americas, and COVID-19 cases and deaths have been reported from all 56 countries and territories in the Region of the Americas, health systems are still being challenged and routine immunization activities are still behind in most of countries. The pandemic has affected compliance with the vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) surveillance indicators. Furthermore, imposed restrictions on movement as well as concerns due to the pandemic have limited primary healthcare activities, including preventive services such as vaccination, with a consequent decline in the vaccination coverage and an increase of the susceptible population. In addition, the migration phenomena in the Region, the relaxing of public health and social measures, and the impact of COVID-19 on the capacity of the healthcare systems, have led to challenges. Therefore, the occurrence of new outbreaks of VPDs of varying magnitude in the Americas Region cannot be ruled out, and the regional risk remains assessed as very high.

The British government has reported 88 376 new coronavirus cases, a 2nd consecutive record daily tally, as the omicron coronavirus variant fuels a worrying surge in infections across the country.

France said on Thursday [16 Dec 2021] it will tighten restrictions on travellers arriving from the United Kingdom. The move comes after South Korea announced it will reinstate stricter social distancing rules on 2 Jan 2022, 6 weeks after easing them, as the numbers of new infections and serious cases spiral.

Omicron has so far been found in at least 77 countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with many reimposing travel restrictions to stem the spread.

Here are other updates for 16 Dec 2021:

CDC panel considers recommending mRNA vaccines over J&J's
---------------------------------------------------------
A panel of outside advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been considering whether to recommend that Americans choose to receive one of the 2 authorized messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines over Johnson & Johnson's shot, due to rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood clotting.

J&J's vaccine uses a technology based on a modified version of an adenovirus to spur immunity in recipients, while the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines use mRNA technology. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization practices was expected to vote on the issue on Thursday [16 Dec 2021], after a subcommittee said it supported making the "preferential recommendation."

Novavax vaccine could gain European, WHO approval next week
-----------------------------------------------------------
The European Medicines Agency could approve the Novavax coronavirus vaccine as early as next week, which could also pave the way for emergency use listing from the World Health Organization, the Financial Times has reported, citing sources.

UK's Sunak: We already have support for COVID-hit hospitality firms
-------------------------------------------------------------------
British finance minister Rishi Sunak has said the government already has support schemes for hospitality firms hit by the latest surge in COVID cases, but that he understands the difficulties they currently face. "I appreciate that it is a difficult time for the hospitality industry," Sunak told reporters during a visit to the USA. "The good news, I would say, is that there [are] existing support measures in place to help the industry," he added citing tax reliefs among other examples

Daily infections rise in Italy
------------------------------
Italy has reported 123 coronavirus-related deaths compared to 129 the day before, the health ministry has said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 26 109 from 23 195. Patients in hospital with COVID-19 -- not including those in intensive care -- stood at 7338 on Thursday [16 Dec 2021], up from 7309 a day earlier. There were 101 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 84 on Wednesday [15 Dec 2021]. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 917 from a previous 870.

Denmark detects 3000 omicron cases
----------------------------------
Denmark has registered almost 10 000 new coronavirus cases, a new daily record since the beginning of the pandemic. The omicron variant was found in about 3000 of those cases, the director of the disease control and prevention body the State Serum Institute, Henrik Ullum, said at a press conference. In total, about 9000 omicron infections have been detected in Denmark since the end of November [2021]. Especially so-called super-spreader events in nightlife had led to the virus spreading rapidly, he said. "The infection will continue to rise if we do nothing," Ullum said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding the burden of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among children is essential for evidence-based decision-making regarding the vaccination of children and for assessing the importance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mitigation measures in specific settings, such as schools. Here, we report on the burden and severity of symptomatic notified COVID-19 cases among children in the European Union (EU).

We estimated risks of severe outcomes in 820 404 symptomatic paediatric COVID-19 cases reported by 10 European Union countries between August 2020 and October 2021. Case and hospitalisation rates rose as transmission increased but severe outcomes were rare: 9611 (1.2%) were hospitalised, 640 (0.08%) required intensive care and 84 (0.01%) died. Despite increased individual risk (adjusted odds ratio hospitalisation: 7.3; 95% confidence interval: 3.3-16.2; intensive care: 8.7; 6.2-12.3) in cases with comorbidities, most (83.7%) hospitalised children had no comorbidity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By 9 Dec 2021, 785 SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant cases have been identified in Denmark. Most cases were fully (76%) or booster-vaccinated (7.1%); 34 (4.3%) had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of cases with available information reported symptoms (509/666; 76%) and most were infected in Denmark (588/644; 91%). One in 5 cases cannot be linked to previous cases, indicating widespread community transmission. Nine cases have been hospitalised, one required intensive care and no deaths have been registered.

[4] Omicron impact
Date: Thu 16 Dec 2021
Source: DW [in English but original translated from German by Zulfikar Abbany; edited]
https://www.dw.com/en/covid-omicron-is-unstoppable-now/a-60148548


It's only a matter of time before we're hit by the full force of omicron infections -- a case of, "not if, but when." And that when won't take long. That's what 3 of Germany's top researchers said during a virtual nationwide press briefing Wednesday [15 Dec 2021].

Christoph Neumann-Haefelin, an immunologist at the University Medical Center Freiburg, said omicron will likely become the dominant variant of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, by mid-January [2022] -- superseding the delta variant, which until now has been one of the most infectious strains since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Neumann-Haefelin predicts that infection rates will shoot up dramatically -- possibly to hundreds of thousands per day.

That dark prognosis is based on international data that German researchers have been studying. Take for instance the United Kingdom, where omicron infection rates are doubling every 2-3 days. They think it's possible that 20-34 million people could become infected with omicron between now (December 2021) and April 2022 -- that's about half of the UK population -- despite reinforced rules on social distancing, medical masks, school closures and more. "I'd be surprised if we didn't see a similar situation here in Germany," said Brockmann.

Brockmann says politicians have to act immediately, setting up emergency plans for a range of scenarios and then putting them into action. "We have to slow the spread of the virus to limit the damage," according to Brockmann. But, he admits, it will be impossible to stop it outright.

Germany's experts say communities will have to reduce social contacts and people's movements drastically, similar to what they did in the very 1st lockdowns. "But we'll have to do a whole lot more given the speed with which this variant is spreading," Brockmann said.

Omicron is not only more infectious than other variants of the coronavirus, it can also evade our human immune responses -- what experts call "immune escape." That means people who are double-jabbed and even those who have had booster shots, can still get infected. A booster jab will pump up your protection to 70-75% and it will also reduce your risk of a severe infection but that could also lend you a false sense of security, said Sandra Ciesek, director of the Institute of Medical Virology at the University Hospital Frankfurt.

Ciesek said while it was important to get the unvaccinated vaccinated, 1st jabs would not be enough to fight off omicron. "It takes many weeks for the immune system to develop a defense," she said. "The virus moves faster than that."

Ciesek went on to say that omicron was likely to be just as dangerous as other variants of the virus -- despite some reports suggesting it may only cause mild infections. Initial data from the UK and Denmark show that hospitalization rates for people infected with omicron are not much different from those infected with the delta variant.

At the start of the omicron wave, reports from South Africa gave hope that the variant was less dangerous than delta, as many people there experienced only mild infections. But since then, an increasing number of people infected with omicron have had to be hospitalized. The UK was the 1st country to report a death with omicron. Ciesek said it was hard to compare the European situation with that in South Africa, where the population is on average younger, and where many people have had a previous coronavirus infection.

Experts also warn that if infection rates continue to rise dramatically, health systems may well collapse. Take, for example, the UK again: Estimated hospitalizations of between 3000-5000 people would put a strain on the "entire machinery," said Brockmann. Many hospitals are struggling as it is and they won't be able to accept many more patients, especially as more patients mean higher risk of medical personnel getting infected as well.

Brockmann said we could see a cascade of effects, not all of them predictable. So researchers are calling on politicians to act decisively -- "Time is running out," said Brockmann. Ciesek, too, said she felt that Germany was ill-prepared, adding that she was very concerned about the situation.

Granted, these are worst-case scenarios, but the 3 experts agreed it won't be enough to just hope omicron shows itself to be less dangerous than other variants. Neumann-Haefelin said such wishful thinking would be akin to "walking into a catastrophe with open eyes."

[The USA has ample warning to prepare for omicron. Vaccinations and boosters should be strongly encouraged, mask mandates should be put into place, and public service announcements should be made to attract people's attention. Contact tracing should be practiced, as well as quarantine of infected individuals. Large indoor social gatherings should be discouraged. Health clinics and hospitals should be prepared for a possible influx of patients.

The Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) confirmed on Monday [13 Dec 2021] that the new coronavirus variant omicron has been detected in a patient through gene-sequencing. In a statement, the hospital said the patient was at home and doing well. So far, no other patients at the hospital have been confirmed to have the omicron variant, it added.

The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) also confirmed that the omicron variant has been detected. "The National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad has been able to confirm that a recently suspected sample from Karachi is indeed the 'omicron variant' of SARS-CoV2," it said in a tweet. "This is the 1st confirmed case, but continued surveillance of identified samples is in place to identify trends," the NCOC added.

On 8 Dec 2021, the Sindh government had claimed that though genomic study had to be done for confirmation, the way the virus was behaving in a female patient in Karachi seemed it was the omicron. The matter was widely circulated in the media and reported as the 1st case of omicron. In a video message on the same day, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho had said the 57-year-old woman was unvaccinated.

However, on 9 Dec 2021, the NIH issued a clarification stating that the sample was yet to be confirmed as omicron through whole-genome sequencing, adding it would be obtained from the Sindh government. It later said that the results of samples of 3 suspected cases of omicron variant of COVID-19 would be received on Monday (today) [13 Dec 2021].

Dr Chandima Jeewandara, head of the Department of Immunology and Molecular Biology at the Sri Jayewardenepura University, said 3 new cases of omicron COVID variant have been reported in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the toll of omicron patients in Sri Lanka increased to 4 as of today [16 Dec 2021].

Dr Jeewandara said omicron cases could increase in the future and thus, he raised the importance of receiving the booster dose without further delay.

The 1st patient carrying the omicron variant of the COVID-19 was identified in Sri Lanka on 3 Dec 2021. The patient was a Sri Lankan citizen who had returned from South Africa on 24 Nov 2021.

These patients are identified as infected with omicron from samples only received to the Jayewardenepura University.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 17 Dec 2021 at 06:41 GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 34 726 049 / 476 869 / 341
Bangladesh: 1 580 559 / 28 041 / 168

Bhutan: 2652 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 51 305, 2009, 2125, 1622, and 7052 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 58 987, 1723, 2344, 1605, and 5201 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in India, an increasing trend in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, but a state of almost stability in Pakistan and Nepal. The daily case positivity remains below 1% in India, but it was below 1.5% in Bangladesh over the last 3 weeks or so except 12 and 13 Dec 2021, when the rate was between 1.5% and 2%. Only time will say whether this increasing trend is the signal of the beginning of a new wave soon in the country.

"Two players of the Bangladesh women's national cricket team, who returned from Zimbabwe and tested positive for COVID-19 were infected with the omicron variant (variant B.1.1.529) of the virus. According to the global genome sequence database GISAID, the Institute for Epidemiology and Disease Control (IEDCR), Bangladesh collected nasal swabs from both cricketers on 6 Dec 2021. The IEDCR-ideSHi Genomics Lab then completed the genomic sequencing of these samples and identified them as omicron variants" of SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/coronavirus/news/bangladesh-first-omicron-cases-detected-2915131).

The first 2 cases of the omicron variant (variant B.1.1.529) were detected on 2 Dec 2021 in India, and as of 17 Dec 2021 at 13:42 IST, the total number of cases attributed to the variant has increased to 97 in the country (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronavirus-omicron-live-updates-india-and-world-december-16/liveblog/88308411.cms). The suspected case of the omicron variant that was reported from Pakistan (see archive no. 20211210.8700174) has finally been confirmed by genome sequencing, as indicated in item [D] above. With this confirmation from Pakistan, 5 countries in South Asia -- India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan -- have confirmed the presence of the virus variant in their territories. Preparation in South Asian countries is required to gather and analyze real-time disease data to assess the transmissibility, severity, and probable ability of the variant to evade immunity already developed in the populations through massive vaccination initiatives and also by natural infections.

An update on the omicron variant can be seen at https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron.

Over the course of 24 hours since yesterday (16 Dec 2021), a total of 391 people died in India due to COVID-19. Of them 320 were from Kerala state, comprising 88.8% of the total deaths encountered across the country. As of 17 Dec 2021, at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 359 996 267 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above 18 years of age. As of 8 Dec 2021, 63.17% have received the 1st dose and 32.10% of the target population have received both doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 17 Dec 2021 at 10:49 AM, a total of 138 365 328 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

So far, Nepal has administered at least 19 157 444 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/nepal/), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 31 406 235. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 72% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).
