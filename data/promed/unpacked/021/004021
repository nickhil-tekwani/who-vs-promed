A new outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza was confirmed at a duck farm in the village of Zimnitsa, Straldzha municipality, Yambol district, Bulgaria's Food Safety Agency said.

There were 6000 ducks on the farm and it was expected that the process of destroying them would be completed on [Thu 5 Apr 2018], the agency said.

A 3-kilometre [1.86 mi approx.] protection zone and a 10-km [6.21 mi approx.] observation area around the holding were set up, with a ban on the trade and movement of domestic, wild and other birds and breeding eggs, organization of fairs, markets, exhibitions and other clusters of domestic or other birds.

The agency said that clinical examinations would be carried out at poultry establishment, along with a check on biosecurity measures at poultry establishments in the area.

The announcement came a month after Bulgaria reported a bird flu outbreak at a chicken farm in the village of General Toshevo in the Dobrich district.
