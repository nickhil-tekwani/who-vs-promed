*** IMPORTANT TIME SENSITIVE MESSAGE ***
FDA Notice of Investigation
Cyclospora in Florida
FDA, CDC, and Florida State are investigating a multiple site
outbreak of Cyclospora illness with a total of 27 confirmed cases
as of May 7, 1997. There are no known cases with onset times beyond
March 30, so the outbreak appears to be no longer active.
This investigation is ongoing. There are currently no confirmed
products or source of the infection. FDA will distribute summary
information and updates as additional details become known.
========================================================================
Date: April 18, 1997
To: State and Territorial Epidemiologists and
State Public Health Laboratory Directors
Through: Director, NCID
From: Division of Parasitic Diseases (DPD), NCID, CDC
Subject: Preparations for the possibility of outbreaks of Cyclospora
infection in 1997
This memo is being sent via E-mail (WONDER) and FAX to inform you about
preparations for the possibility of outbreaks of Cyclospora infection, as
well as epidemiologic resources and laboratory support available to you
through DPD.
Of note, two possible clusters of cases of Cyclospora infection are
currently being investigated in Florida. The vehicle and mode of
transmission are not yet known. Dr. Michael Beach, an EIS officer from
DPD, will be going to Florida to assist the Florida Department of Health in
the investigation.
Epidemiologic activities: Cyclospora infection is now reportable in CT,
FL, NYC, and SC. In March, three sites (CA, CT, MN) in CDC's Emerging
Infections Program (FoodNet) added Cyclospora surveillance to their
activities. In addition, a notification network of sentinel laboratories
has been established in eight states (CT, FL, MA, MD, NJ, NY/NYC, OH, SC),
and a Public Health Laboratory Information System (PHLIS) Cyclospora module
is being developed for incorporation into ongoing PHLIS systems. DPD, in
collaboration with the Cyclospora Working Group (state, local, and federal
officials involved in the 1996 outbreak), has developed questionnaires that
can be used for case and outbreak investigations. To obtain
questionnaires, see the list of epidemiology contacts below.

Laboratory activities: DPD will provide, upon request, confirmatory
evaluation of stool specimens for Cyclospora, if possible, send both
stained smears and wet sediment from formalin-ethyl acetate concentrates.
To document oocyst sporulation in specimens from persons who are shedding
oocysts, DPD would like to receive as large a volume as possible of either
unpreserved stool or potassium dichromate-preserved stool. DPD can provide
(to laboratories or individuals) stool collection kits that contain
potassium dichromate, instructions, and return-address labels;
alternatively stool specimens can be mixed with an equal volume of water or
saline (not formalin) and shipped directly to DPD.
Please provide the following information for each clinical specimen: date
specimen was collected; how it was stored in the interim (e.g.,
refrigerated); technique(s), if any, used to process and examine the
specimen (e.g., concentrate, wet mount, epifluorescence, type of staining);
and result, if any, obtained by submitting laboratory.
In addition, environmental samples (e.g., berries, other produce) can be
sent to DPD for examination. Please send environmental samples promptly to
avoid spoilage.
Shipping: Slides and concentrates of stool specimens can be stored and
shipped at room temperature. Stool specimens (both those preserved in
potassium dichromate and those in either water or saline) should be shipped
via overnight mail on wet ice (do NOT freeze) to avoid overheating during
transit. Produce samples should be kept refrigerated (i.e., shipped on wet
ice; do NOT freeze). Refrigerated specimens should be shipped by overnight
mail to arrive Tuesday-Friday. If possible, please notify DPD (see
laboratory contacts below) that you plan to ship specimens.
Please ship all clinical specimens and environmental samples to:
