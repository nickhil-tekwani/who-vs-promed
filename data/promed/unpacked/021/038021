The 1st Brazilian case of orange rust (_Puccinia kuehnii_) on sugar cane
has been detected, the Ministry of Agriculture says. Researchers alerted
the ministry to its emergence in the state of Sao Paulo in December [2009].

Plentiful rainfall, expected in the 1st quarter of 2010 over Brazil's
center-south region, should help the development of the 2010/11 cane crop,
Brazil's supply agency CONAB said. However, the wet weather could raise the
incidence of fungal diseases, such as the recently discovered cane orange
rust, which trims yields in susceptible cane varieties. Showers should be
between normal and above-average in most of Brazil's southeast, center-west
and south regions, which make up the main center-south cane region.

Producers should be on the alert for the sugarcane orange rust, a fungal
disease registered in Brazil for the 1st time in December [2009], whose
incidence increases with rainy weather, Conab said. Around 70 per cent of
the cane varieties currently used in Brazil are resistant to the disease,
but researchers say losses in yields could cost producers around 300
million reais annually [USD 169.7 million].

The agriculture ministry said it expects to approve the 1st fungicide to
combat the disease by the end of March [2010]. Until now, the only way to
fight the fungus is the replacement of susceptible varieties of cane by
resistant ones.

[Orange rust of sugarcane is caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_.
Symptoms include minute, elongated yellow lesions, which develop an orange
to orange-brown colour as they expand. Most rust pustules occur on the
lower leaf surface with more lesions toward the leaf base. Environmental
conditions conducive for the development of orange rust include warm, humid
summers and cool autumns, and the disease is favoured by rain. The disease
has the potential to cause significant economic losses to sugarcane crops.
A related species, _P. melanocephala_, causes brown or common rust. Colour
and distribution of leaf lesions vary from orange rust, and development of
this pathogen is inhibited by rain. Both rusts are rapidly spread by wind,
and disease management includes fungicides and development of resistant
cane varieties suitable to local requirements.

In Australia, _P. kuehnii_ had been present for 100 years, but in 2000 a
much more virulent strain emerged devastating the most widely grown
sugarcane cultivar. The disease was reported for the 1st time in the
western hemisphere in 2007 from Florida, USA (ProMED-mail post
20070731.2457), and it is not clear whether this was also due to the
emergence of a new strain or whether the pathogen was introduced. It has
been reported since then from additional countries in the Americas. Brazil
was put on alert in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20080903.2756), but
unfortunately, this does not seem to have been sufficient to protect the
national cane industry from the new disease.
