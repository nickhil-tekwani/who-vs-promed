MRSA bacteria have been detected in a fattening herd located in Haugalandet. Samples were taken from the farm as part of the Food Safety Authority's (FSA) monitoring and mapping programme. The National Veterinary Institute has now analysed the samples and confirmed that this is MRSA.

All MRSA variants can be transmitted between humans and animals. On farms where MRSA has been detected, animals are not allowed to be moved in or out of the farm without a special agreement from the FSA. The pigs will be farmed as normal. It is not dangerous to eat the meat.

"After the animals are sent to slaughter, the farmer must conduct thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises where the animals have stayed to ensure that we get rid of MRSA bacteria and thus ensure that the infection does not spread," said section chief Jarl Inge Alne, FSA.

[The information on MRSA detection in the above mentioned pig fattening farm in Haugalandet was initially published by Norway's Food Safety Agency (FSA, Mattilsynet) on its web-site on 28 Oct 2016 (see, in Norwegian, at
http://www.mattilsynet.no/dyr_og_dyrehold/dyrehelse/smitte_mellom_dyr_og_mennesker/MRSA/mrsa_paavist_i_slaktegrisbesetning_paa_haugalandet.24005.

FSA has developed a unique MRSA monitoring and mapping program addressing the Norwegian pig industry.

For a comprehensive description of the MRSA program (in Norwegian; machine translation is relatively satisfactory), please refer to http://www.mattilsynet.no/sok/?search=MRSA.

FSA conducted in 2014 a "Socio-economic analysis of appropriate measures to prevent the spread of MRSA in Norwegian farming;" the said analysis underwent an updating. The updated version, based upon experience gathered since 2014, was published on 30 Jun 2016. The update's summary (machine translated, edited) follows:

"Summary
MRSA is not an ordinary disease problem of swine. It is also not a significant food safety problem. The objective to keep pork continuously free of MRSA is to prevent the buildup of a new reservoir of infection for the population and to avoid increased costs in health care.

The purpose of the analysis was:
1. To shed light on socio-economic profitability by a management strategy which aims to keep the Norwegian swine population free of MRSA.

2. Given that such a strategy is profitable, to select the measures with best profitability and feasibility and providing the lowest risk.

Diffusion models prepared by the Veterinary Institute show that Norwegian swine production will not become totally free of MRSA over time but that it may be possible to keep the incidence of MRSA down to a very low level.

The main conclusion of this analysis is that it will be profitable to carry out comprehensive socio-economic measures to keep MRSA out of Norwegian swine herds.

This analysis considers 5 levels of measures, referred to as the action options 1-5, all of which are meant to keep the incidence of MRSA at a low level. Action options 1 and 2 show the greatest socio-economic profitability. Both of these action options require extensive testing for MRSA of people engaged in the swine industry, in addition to extensive surveillance programs in animals.

The analysis further addresses the costs involved, both for the swine industry as well as for the state's Agriculture Agency. A cost/benefit ratio is discussed in relation to the 5 action options." - Mod.AS
