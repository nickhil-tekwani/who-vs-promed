Zebra chip hits Northwest
-------------------------
Zebra chip, a disease that annually costs Southwest US potato growers
millions of dollars in crop loss, has been found in Washington and
Oregon. USDA and Oregon State University [OSU] confirmed zebra chip in
tuber samples submitted by growers. The disease was identified in 5
different fields in the southern Columbia Basin, and in 5 cultivars.

The disease has not been found in Idaho.

Researchers do not know if the disease develops or spreads in storage.
Growers who plan to store potatoes are advised to scout and treat for
the psyllid if they find symptoms and green tissue is present.

[2] New Zealand: losses and risk

Potato industry seeks help to survive crop disease
--------------------------------------------------
The potato industry says the fallout from a devastating crop disease
means it won't be long before some growers quit the industry. The
organisation Potatoes New Zealand [PNZ] is seeking more government
funding to tackle the tomato-potato psyllid that spreads a disease
which causes leaf yellowing, kills plants, and disfigures potato
tubers.

A report calculates the insect pest has cost the industry more than
NZD 120 million [about USD 98 million] in crop losses and control
measures since it was first found in New Zealand in 2006. The cost
last year [2010] alone was NZD 28 million [about USD 23 million], or
20 percent of the farm-gate value of New Zealand's potato crop.

PNZ says the report drives home the seriousness of the psyllid threat
and says it is beyond the means of his organisation to solve on its
own. They have already spent or committed more than NZD 1 million [USD
814 000] to fight the pest. But there's no more money and there will
be growers and processors who will go under unless PNZ can get more
research funding, and others will be discouraged from planting in the
1st place.

[Zebra chip (ZC) disease of potato was first reported in Mexico in
1994 and has caused yield losses of up to 60 percent in Guatemala,
Mexico, and the southwestern USA. Symptoms include leaf yellowing,
early senescence, and death of above ground plant parts, as well as
necrotic flecking of tubers where starch is converted to soluble
sugars. This results in zebra-like stripes and brittleness during
processing. ZC leaf symptoms also resemble a group of symptoms known
as psyllid yellows (PY), which was thought to be due to the injection
of toxic saliva by the feeding insects.

In 2008, a new liberibacter species transmitted by potato (or tomato)
psyllids (_Bactericera cockerelli_) was found to be associated with a
new yellowing disease of tomato and capsicum crops in New Zealand
(where the potato psyllid was first reported in 2006), as well as ZC
and PY. Both _Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum and _Ca._ L.
psyllaurous are currently used as preliminary names.

Only a few members of _Ca._ Liberibacter have been characterised so
far, including the pathogens causing citrus greening (huanglongbing,
HLB; more information via ProMED-mail post no. 20090415.1436). HLB,
one of the most damaging diseases of citrus, is limited to these crops
due to the host specificity of its vector, the citrus psyllid. In
contrast, the potato psyllid has a wider host range including species
in 20 plant families, and this impacts on the epidemiology and
importance of the diseases transmitted by them.

For both ZC and PY there remains a possibility that factors other than
the liberibacter may be involved as well, for example, a possible role
of phytoplasmas remains to be clarified.
