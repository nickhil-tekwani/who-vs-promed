Two minors die as viral fever rages in Nawalparasi
--------------------------------------------------
Viral fever has claimed 2 lives in Nawalparasi [Western region] on
Friday [3 Sep 2010]. Numerous schools have been shut down as the
parents did not send their children to the schools fearing the disease.

A Grade 2 student and a Grade 6 student from Janata Higher Secondary
School died due to the viral fever. The school has been closed for a
week, as more than 300 students started suffering from fever, school
authorities said. The 2 students died while being taken to Bharatpur Hospital.

The locals are living in fear as the neighbouring district Chitwan is
at high risk of dengue [fever] but health workers stated that though
the patients are suffering from fever, there is no symptom of dengue.

Mostly villagers and students are suffering from fever, a hospital source said.

[ProMED-mail thanks FluTrackers for drawing our attention to this
report. The exclusion of dengue fever and the prevalence of the fever
in a school setting suggest that an arboviral infection is unlikely.
Other than that there is no information that would allow a more
precise diagnosis. Further information from local sources would be welcomed.
