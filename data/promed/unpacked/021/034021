Tonsil/Appendix samples raise fears over higher incidence of vCJD infection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fears that more people than expected may have contracted the human form of
BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) have been raised by the discovery of
the infectious agent in a random screening programme. The British Medical
Journal reports today that the programme to screen appendixes and tonsils
for infection with the prion protein, the infectious agent responsible for
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in
ProMED-mail], found it in one of 8300 appendix and tonsil samples removed
during routine surgery between 1995 and 1999.
In response, the government said it would expand the research programme to
obtain more precise estimates of the numbers infected but who have not
developed the brain-destroying symptoms of vCJD. The Department of Health is
to set up a "tonsil archive" that will build up a collection of tens of
thousands of samples. Those of most interest to researchers are the ones
removed from older children and adults exposed to BSE prions in the 1980s,
before the government introduced measures to stop people eating infected
meat. Sir Liam Donaldson, chief medical officer, said the archive would be
anonymous, "which means individual patients will not be identified from
their tonsil samples. The archive will allow prospective studies to be done
on the largest possible number of tonsils, so we can get better estimates of
the size of the vCJD epidemic."
On the face of it, the discovery of prion protein in one of 8300 samples
equates to an infection rate of 120 per million or a total of about 6000
people in the British population. But there is too much uncertainty to draw
any reliable conclusion about the level of vCJD infection, said the study
leader, David Hilton of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. Firstly, the
statistical margin of error is great: the number of positive tests predicted
for the whole population ranges from as low as 25 up to 45 000. Secondly, he
said, "you cannot even make the assumption that someone with a positive test
will develop vCJD. People may carry prion protein for 40 years without
developing symptoms."
In the seven years since vCJD appeared, 115 people have died and 12 patients
have the disease. The number of deaths during the first eight months of this
year was 11, compared with 20 in 2001 and 28 in 2000 - some experts suggest
the epidemic may already have peaked.

UK 'mad cow' toll may be lower than feared
------------------------------------------
LONDON: New study findings suggest that only a few thousand people, rather
than the millions once feared, may be incubating the human form of "mad cow"
disease in Britain, scientists said on Fri 20 Sep 2002. They said tests on
8318 appendix and tonsil samples removed from patients aged 10 to 50 between
1995 and 1999 found that only one person's appendix showed signs of the
rogue prion protein that causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).
Writing in the British Medical Journal, researchers said finding a single
case could mean 120 people per million in the population in this age group
might be infected. However, they stressed much larger studies were essential
before they could be confident about the figures. At present they could only
be 95% confident that the actual figure was somewhere between 0.5 and 900
per million population. "It offers some limited reassurance, the findings
could have been a lot worse than this," said Professor Peter Smith, chairman
of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee which advises the
government on vCJD. "This is the first time that anybody has been able to
get any sort of handle on the level of exposure. But it is a small sample
and what is needed now is larger-scale studies," Smith added in an interview.
"I think we can say with some certainty that there are people out there
carrying the disease silently and we need to know how many," lead researcher
Dr. David A. Hilton, from Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, UK, told Reuters.
"We can't draw any precise figures from this finding so far. There is still
a huge margin for error," he added. Hilton, a neuropathologist, said the
study would continue until 15 000 tissue samples had been checked, but a
much larger study of 50 000 to 100 000 samples should really be done. "We
think a better test can be performed on fresh tissue. We were only using
tissue that has been stored in preservative and there is a limit as to what
test you can do on that tissue," he added.

[In the paper describing this research, which is published in the British
Medical Journal 2002;325:633-634, the authors (David A Hilton, Azra C Ghani,
Lisa Conyers, Philip Edwards, Linda McCardle, Mark Penney, Diane Ritchie,
and James W Ironside) make two comments not included in the above press
reports. Firstly, since half of all tonsillectomies are performed on
children under ten the window of opportunity for this type of study is
closing since such children will not have been exposed to the BSE agent.
Secondly the authors' data provide the first estimate of the current risk of
transmission of vCJD by iatrogenic procedures.
In their paper the authors provide the following comment on their study.
"One appendix showing the lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein out
of 8318 samples tested gives an estimated detectable prevalence of prion
protein accumulation of 120 per million (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to
900) among people aged 10-50 between 1995 and 1999. Our study design
precluded transmission studies, but the accumulation of prion protein in
lymphoreticular tissue detected by the immunohistochemical technique
correlates with the detection of abnormal prion protein by western blotting
and remains the only technique shown to reliably predict disease in animals.
The sensitivity and specificity of preclinical lymphoreticular accumulation
of prion protein in predicting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are
unknown, but in sheep exposed to scrapie are estimated to be 87% and 94%,
respectively. At autopsy, 95% of appendixes from patients with variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with adequate amounts of lymphoid tissue showed
accumulation of prion protein, as did both appendixes removed during the
1990s from patients who later developed the disease. We provide the first
estimate of the number of people who may be a potential source of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by iatrogenic spread. Large scale prospective
screening of tissue from tonsillectomies is needed to obtain precise data on
prevalence. The use of fresh tissue would allow for a semi-automated western
blot assay and verification of positive samples by transmission studies. As
half of tonsillectomies are in children under 10, who will have had little
or no exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the opportunity for such
a study will diminish over time." - Mod.CP]
