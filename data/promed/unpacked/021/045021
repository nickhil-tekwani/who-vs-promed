Launch of global early warning system for animal diseases
transmissible to humans
-----------------------------------------------
A global early warning system for animal diseases transmissible to
humans (zoonoses) was formally launched this week by the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal
Health (OIE) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Global
Early Warning and Response System (GLEWS) is the 1st joint early
warning and response system conceived with the aim of predicting and
responding to animal diseases, including zoonoses, worldwide. This
system builds on the added value of combining and coordinating the
tracking, verification and alert mechanisms of OIE, FAO and WHO.
"From an animal health point of view, controlling contagious animal
diseases in their early stages is easier and less expensive for the
international community. In cases of zoonoses, this system will
enable control measures that can also benefit public health,"
explained Dr. Bernard Vallat, Director General of the OIE.
As demonstrated throughout much of the globe, weaknesses of early
detection and rapid response for animal diseases and the inability to
control major diseases at their source have contributed to the spread
across borders of diseases of animal origin, such as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) and avian influenza.
"In such a context, the main expected outputs of GLEWS are better
prediction and prevention of animal disease threats through sharing
of information, epidemiological analysis and joint field missions to
assess and control outbreaks in animals and humans. That will lead to
the development of improved coordinated response to emergencies
worldwide," said Dr. Samuel Jutzi of FAO's Agriculture, Biosecurity,
Nutrition and Consumer Protection Department.
"History shows us that the earlier we can detect a zoonosis, the
earlier we can take action to reduce the threats to people. Today,
the spread of avian flu reinforces the fact that the animal and human
health sectors must work closely together and that early detection
and coordination is critical. This new network is an important step
forward," explained Mrs. Susanne Weber-Mosdorf, WHO Assistant
Director-General for Sustainable Development and Healthy Environments.
The information gathered through the tracking and verification
channels of each organization will be shared using the GLEWS
web-based electronic platform and jointly analyzed to decide whether
to issue common early warning messages.
These alert messages will describe the possible implications of
disease spread among animals at the national, regional and
international level and its potential public health impact. If there
is a clear indication that a joint on-site assessment or intervention
is required, the response mechanisms of the 3 organizations will be
activated together.

international organizations full success in their cooperative
endeavor. ProMED-mail's efforts are directed at rather similar goals. - Mod.AS]
