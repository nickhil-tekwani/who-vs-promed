Summary
------
Between March 2010 and November 2013, 8 laboratory-confirmed cases of serogroup B, invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) were identified in an extended Irish Traveller family across 3 Health Service Executive (HSE) areas of Ireland. Cases were aged between 5 and 46 months, and were either a cousin or sibling of another case. All 8 cases survived. Chemoprophylaxis was given to relevant nuclear family members and close contacts on each occasion, but failed to prevent further cases. _Neisseria meningitidis_ isolates from 6 cases were highly related, belonging to the ST-41/44 clonal complex, and shared the porA designation 7-2,4.

In November 2013, the outbreak control team recommended that directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis be administered simultaneously to the extended family, and that the 4 component meningococcal B (4CMenB) vaccine be administered to family members aged 2 months to 23 years inclusive and relevant close contacts of the 8th case. Subsequently these recommendations were implemented at 3 regional clinics. Additionally pharyngeal swabs (n=112) were collected to assess carriage rates of _N. meningitidis_ in this extended family. Pharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ was detected in 15 (13 percent) family members. From the epidemiological investigation and carriage study overcrowding was the most likely risk factor identified in this outbreak. To date, the combination of directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis and use of 4CMenB vaccine have controlled the outbreak with no further cases diagnosed.

Introduction
----
Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a life-threatening infection caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_. Risk factors for IMD include close contact with a known case, crowded environments, recent upper respiratory tract infection or influenza, cigarette smoking and immunological susceptibility [1].

Under Irish law, clinicians and clinical directors of laboratories must immediately notify suspected cases of IMD to the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) at the local Department of Public Health. Laboratories must also immediately notify IMD cases [that] meet the laboratory criteria for confirmed or probable disease in accordance with the case definition [2].

All notified cases of IMD are entered on to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) database, which is hosted by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), Ireland's specialist agency for the surveillance of communicable diseases. CIDR is a shared national information system, developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland [3].

In 2011, Ireland had the highest incidence of meningococcal disease in the European Union at 1.99 per 100 000 population [4]. However, this figure represents a decrease of 86 percent from 14.8 per 100 000 population reported in 1999. Irish Travellers are an indigenous minority in Ireland. Their lifestyle and culture, which may include a nomadic lifestyle, distinguishes them from the general population [5]. Irish Travellers experience social and cultural marginalisation in a similar manner to other indigenous minorities globally [6].

In Ireland, ethnic identification is not routinely collected on all individuals with notifiable infectious diseases. Consequently, assessing national rates of disease by ethnicity is not possible. However since 2004, when the CIDR system became operational, limited data on ethnicity is available. Based on such data, it is evident that while the incidence of IMD has decreased in the general population, a similar reduction has not been seen in the Irish Traveller population. In contrast, since 2004 there has been an increase in reported cases of IMD in this population group [7].

In 2013, 84 percent of meningococcal disease in Ireland was caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B [8]. While most cases of IMD occur sporadically, occasionally an unusual cluster or outbreak is reported. The National Guidelines on the Clinical and Public Health Management of Bacterial Meningitis defines an outbreak of meningococcal disease as 'a minimum of 4 cases of definite meningococcal disease within a 3-month interval, or 40 per 100 000 in any age group in a 3-month period, in a geographical area that makes epidemiological sense AND where available microbiological characterisation of the organism is the same' [9].

We describe the identification of 8 cases of IMD due to _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B in an extended Irish Traveller family over a 3.5-year period across 3 of 8 public health areas of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland. All 8 cases occurred in young children (≤46 months) who were siblings or first cousins of identified cases in the outbreak. The measures to prevent further cases are described. Although the cluster formed by the 8 cases does not fulfil the criteria for the above outbreak definition, the term 'outbreak' is used in this report to reflect the high endemicity within this extended family.

Discussion
-----
This report describes an outbreak of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B in an extended Irish Traveller family over 3.5-year period. While outbreaks of IMD are more commonly associated with serogroup C disease [5,21], prolonged community based and institutional outbreaks of serogroup B disease have been described [22,23]. Control measures in these outbreaks differed. In a prolonged serogroup B outbreak in northern France (2003-2005), an unlicensed monovalent outer membrane vesicle vaccine from Norway was thought to be [effective] and was administered initially to high-risk groups and subsequently to all the population [22]. In contrast, in a prolonged university outbreak in the United States (2008-2010), health promotion and ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis were the control measures used. Vaccination was not used as a control measure because a serogroup B vaccine was not licenced in the United States at that time [23]. Family clusters have also been described in the literature but their time duration is considerably shorter than our outbreak [24].

Transmission of _N. meningitidis_ occurs through droplet spread of respiratory secretions or saliva [25]. On average 10 to 15 percent of the population are colonised with _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the duration of carriage can vary from days to months [26,27]. When cases continue to occur, despite appropriate management of contacts, possible reasons for ongoing transmission of _N. meningitidis_ include; immunological susceptibility, poor compliance with chemoprophylaxis, resistance to chemoprophylaxis, unidentified close contacts and overcrowding. We considered each of these as a possible cause of this outbreak continuing.

The association between immunological factors, host genetics and IMD is well recognised [28,29]. However, in this outbreak the 4 cases who underwent comprehensive immunological tests had normal immunological results; therefore immunological susceptibility was not thought a likely cause of increased incidence or ongoing transmission.

Compliance of contacts with the recommended 4-dose schedule of rifampicin chemoprophylaxis could not be independently verified. Consequently, in order to ensure compliance, directly observed treatment with ciprofloxacin was provided at the clinics. Antimicrobial susceptibility results from the EMBU confirmed that the predominant outbreak strain was sensitive to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, rifampicin, and sulfadiazine. These results are in line with previous findings that IMD-associated strains of _N. meningitidis_ [that] exhibit decreased susceptibility to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, rifampicin and sulfadiazine are currently very rare in Ireland (data not shown).

There were on average 18 close contacts identified per case. This number is high when compared with an average of 7.6 contacts per case reported from a 2012 series of 38 IMD events in 4 regions in Ireland (data not shown). As this is a larger number of contacts than usually identified, it remains possible that not all close contacts were identified. Despite multiple interviews with the family to ensure identification of as many true close contacts as possible, it was recognised that recolonisation from a wider network remained a possibility.

A carriage rate of _N. meningitidis_ of 13 percent was identified. This rate may have been affected by the large number of family members who had received chemoprophylaxis previously (n = 68), especially those who received it in the preceding month, n = 18. In the general population highest carriage rates of _N. meningitidis_ are seen in the 15 to 24 years-old age group [27]. The 2011 Irish census identified 22.4 years as the average age of an Irish Traveller compared with 36.1 years for the general Irish population [30]. In this outbreak-associated cohort, 83 (74 percent) of the participants in the carriage study were less than 25 years of age and 22 (20 percent) were aged between 15 and 24. It is conceivable that cases in this outbreak had many opportunities to mix with young adult relatives. However, results from the carriage study reveal that only 3 (14 percent) of the 22 participants aged between 15 and 24 years demonstrated _N. meningitidis_ carriage, compared with 9 (45%) of the 20 participants aged between 25 and 40 years. The higher rate of carriage in the older age group is higher than expected when compared with previously undertaken carriage studies, which revealed carriage rates of 8.8 percent in individuals aged 25 and older (data not shown).

Traditionally Irish Traveller family size is larger than that of the general population of Ireland. In 2011, 26.9 percent of Traveller women reported to have 5 or more children compared with 2.6 percent of the general population [30]. Irish Travellers often live in houses or caravans in crowded conditions [30]. Household crowding and attendance at crowded venues such as clubs and parties are recognised as risk factors for carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and IMD [31,32]. Irish Travellers also frequently attend large family gatherings where there are large groups of people in close proximity for a prolonged period of time. This is supported by the large number of close contacts identified in the outbreak cases. From the carriage study 2/3 (n = 10, 67 percent) of the identified _N. meningitidis_ carriers lived in a trailer or caravan. Census information documents from 2011 identify that 12.3 percent of Irish Travellers live in trailers or caravans overall [30]. Therefore a larger proportion than expected of _N. meningitidis_ carriers lived in a trailer or caravan, which is likely to consist of 1 or 2 rooms in total. As the carriage study also identified that 2/3 (n = 10, 67 percent) of positive carriers live in households of 8 or more, in contrast to 8.32 percent of the total Irish Traveller population [30], an element of household crowding is likely to be present.

Additional previously reported factors associated with carriage of _N. meningitidis_ include personal and passive cigarette smoking and recent or concomitant respiratory tract infections or influenza [32-34]. Cigarette smoking rates are higher among Irish Travellers than in the general population (52.5 percent vs 29 percent) [6,35] and therefore it is possible that cigarette smoking could be associated with this outbreak. However, as information on cigarette smoking is not currently collected on enhanced surveillance for IMD, the rate of cigarette smoking for the outbreak family could not be confirmed. Neither information on cigarette smoking nor exposure to cigarette smoking was requested during the carriage study undertaken in December 2013.

Previously it has been difficult to control serogroup B IMD due to the absence of a vaccine. This has changed recently with the approval in 2014 by the Food and Drug Administration of a vaccine for the United States (Trumenba from Pfizer) [36]. Earlier, in January 2013, a 4-component Men B vaccine, referred to here as 4CMenB (Bexsero from Novartis), was licensed by the European Medicines Agency for use against serogroup B disease [37]. 4CMenB vaccine contains 3 antigens, factor H binding protein, neisserial adhesion A and _Neisseria_ heparin binding agent. In addition, the vaccine contains PorA (serosubtype P1.4) from the outer membrane vesicle of the New Zealand strain 98/254. These antigens affect meningococcal survival, function and virulence [38]. As the outbreak strain was identified as B:4:P1.7-2,4:ST-6697 (cc41/44), we were confident that the use of the vaccine would be beneficial to this outbreak.

The Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS) is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) designed to evaluate expression of 4CMenB target proteins and to evaluate their cross-reactive potential. Strains are predicted to be covered by 4CMenB if they carry the porA p1.4 epitope or meet a minimum threshold of reactivity to _Neisseria_ heparin-binding antigen (NHBA), factor H binding protein (fHbp) or _Neisseria_ adhesin A (nadA) in the MATS ELISA, known as the positive bactericidal threshold (PBT) [39]. The case B isolate (which was identified as the outbreak strain) has undergone MATS testing and results predict this strain is covered by any of porA (p1.4), NHBA or fHbp peptides it carries.

The decision by 2 of the affected HSE regions to delay administration of the vaccine until January 2014 was not thought to have impacted on control measures. The affected family members received ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis and therefore short-term eradication of _N. meningitidis_ was likely. The duration of eradication of _N. meningitidis_ after receipt of chemoprophylaxis can vary from weeks to months [40]. Subsequently, the administration of 4CMenB in January [2014] was thought likely to provide longer-term immunity.

To our knowledge, this outbreak was the 1st time 4CMenB vaccine was used in an outbreak situation in Europe. In December 2013, this vaccine was used in an outbreak of serogroup B disease at Princeton University in the United States, when in excess of 5000 students and staff received this vaccine [41]. More recently in March 2014, the University of California, Santa Barbara vaccinated ca 9000 students and staff in response to 4 confirmed cases of serogroup B disease in the university [41].

Conclusion
-----
This is a unique outbreak of IMD caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B in an extended Irish Traveller family across 3 regions of Ireland over a period of 3.5 years. This outbreak continued despite instigating all appropriate control measures on multiple occasions. From descriptive epidemiological data and the carriage study, the most likely risk factor identified for this ongoing outbreak was overcrowding. We hope that the combined use of directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis, in addition to vaccination with 4CMenB will be successful in halting this outbreak. We continue to monitor this family for new cases and strive to ensure that all relevant family members complete the recommended vaccine schedule. To date there have been no further cases of IMD in this family.

This outbreak highlights the importance of recording ethnicity as part of the enhanced surveillance information collected on all cases of meningococcal disease. We recommend the gathering of ethnicity data for key notifiable diseases including IMD. We also recommend that consideration be given to the use of 4CMenB vaccine for vulnerable groups living in similar crowded conditions.
