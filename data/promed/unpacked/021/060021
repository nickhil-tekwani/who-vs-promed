Cases of flesh-eating ulcers in Victorian coastal towns, which have seen some victims require limb amputations, have rapidly increased and spread further into inner Melbourne.

Buruli ulcer cases are forecast to increase 6-fold in 5 years, based on new statistics released this week [week of Mon 15 Oct 2018].

The gruesome open sores are caused by a bacterium called _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, which is thought to be spread by mosquitoes and possums and rots tissue.

If left untreated, the sores can cause extreme pain as the bacteria chews through skin and capillaries, all the while releasing a toxin that suppresses the immune system and leads to gangrene. Major surgery is often required to cut them out. There have been 2 known cases of limb amputation in Victoria in the last 5 years.

Data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows there were 277 cases in 2017, up from 65 in 2013. There have already been 276 infections this year [2018], including 49 new cases in the last 4 weeks. If the trend continues, the total number of cases for the year could reach 400 by the end of the year.

Daniel O'Brien from Geelong's Barwon Health, who is currently treating more than 100 patients, said new research into why the ulcer is spreading and how to stop it is due to begin next week [week of Mon 22 Oct 2018]. "The epidemic is getting bigger and bigger," he said. "It's looking like we'll see up to 400 cases this year [2018], and who knows how many we'll see next year [2019] and the year after [2020], so that's the concern. It's not turning around. And then it's moving; we don't know where it will appear. But we don't 100 percent know how to prevent it; we are not having much success."

The leading specialist on the outbreak accused the government of inaction in a paper in the Medical Journal of Australia earlier this year [2018]. It led to AUD 3 million [about USD 2.14 million] of state and federal funding for a research project that will examine risk factors for contracting the ulcer, including a questionnaire and house visits in hotspots.

Also known as the Bairnsdale ulcer, the disease was 1st recorded in the East Gippsland town in the 1930s but has more recently been seen on the Mornington and Bellarine peninsulas. By 2015, it had moved to Melbourne's southeast suburbs, including Bentleigh, Hampton, and Cheltenham. There have now been cases recorded in Melbourne's Bayside and Port Phillip council areas.

This map [available at the source URL. - Mod.ML] shows numbers of recent cases in Melbourne and its surrounding local government areas. The size of the circles is indicative of recent risk of infection in the locations shown.

What is most baffling to scientists is that Victoria is the only non-tropical part of the world where the ulcer is detected. Much smaller numbers of cases are recorded in Far North Queensland. The bacterium is otherwise largely confined to countries in west and central Africa, including Benin, Cameroon, and Ghana.

Professor O'Brien said awareness of the ulcer among doctors had improved since misdiagnoses that led victims to require surgery were common. However, he said more was needed to be done to warn the public, as early treatment was key to much less intrusive treatment. "The message is if you've got any sore on your body that's not going away, that you're not sure what it is, to present to your health practitioner as soon as possible and check it's not a Buruli ulcer."

Recorded cases of the Buruli ulcer in Victoria: 2018: 276 (year to date), 2017: 277, 2016: 182, 2015: 107, 2014: 89, 2013: 65, 2012: 75, 2011: 78, and 2010: 32.

How to avoid the Buruli ulcer:
- Wear covering clothing that reduces contact with biting insects
- Use insect repellent on exposed skin
- Clean and cover cuts and abrasions
- Remain aware if you live in or visit areas where the ulcer is more common, such as the Mornington and Bellarine peninsulas
- Ask your doctor about the ulcer if you think you have one. There is a fast and accurate diagnostic test available

[The Bellarine, on the west, and Mornington, on the east, are peninsulas that surround Port Phillip Bay, on which the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, is located. A narrow inlet, called the Rip, 3.5 km (2.1 mi) wide, separates the 2 peninsulas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rip). The Mornington Peninsula is primarily a local tourist region, with small towns on its western shorelines that are sometimes regarded as outlying suburbs of greater Melbourne (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula). Most of the Bellarine Peninsula is a part of the city of Greater Geelong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellarine_Peninsula). Melbourne, with a population of about 4.6 million residents, is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria and the 2nd-most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne). A map of local governmental areas in and around Melbourne can be found at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Australia_Victoria_Melbourne_Metro_Area_LGA_names.svg.

Buruli ulcer has been reported in over 30 countries, usually with tropical and subtropical climates (Bellarine and Mornington peninsulas have a temperate climate).
