Avian flu outbreak reported in Mekong Delta province
----------------------------------------------------
The [Viet Nam] Department of Preventive Medicine, a part of the Ministry of Health, yesterday [4 Mar 2015] announced an outbreak of A/H5N1 avian flu in a farm at Dai Hai commune, in Ke Sach District of the Mekong delta province of Soc Trang.

The provincial Department of Animal Health liaised with the local government to bury 1100, 2-month-old chickens infected with the dangerous avian flu virus in the farm and implement measures against the disease as per the regulation.

The Department of Preventive Medicine said that A/H5N1 avian flu is the virus causing avian flu amongst chickens in Asia since 2003 and is plaguing other nations. From 2003 to January 2015, around 777 cases of bird flu were reported in 16 nations and 428 people succumbed to the disease (or accounting for 55.1 per cent).

Accordingly, the Department of Preventive Medicine warned people not to eat diseased dead poultry; farms must be disinfected and people have to wear protective clothes when contacting with poultry to reduce the risk of transmission.

When a person experiences symptoms of chest pain and breathing problem, he/she has to go to a nearby medical clinic for examination and treatment.

[HPAI H5N1 started its circulation in Viet Nam in 2003. Its epidemiology there is characterised by a seasonal pattern, as reflected in the list of ProMED-mail postings on Viet Nam's HPAI H5N1 in humans and poultry, peaking each winter (see the list in "see also" below).

The current seasonal epizootic in Viet Nam reportedly started on 29 Nov 2014; so far, 6 reports have been submitted to the OIE, addressing 6 outbreaks; the most recent report was submitted on 25 Feb 2015. All the 6 reports and an interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16728.

During the previous season (October 2013-March 2014) the outbreaks were attributed to virus clade 2.3.2.1. Strain 2.3.2.1C is regarded as particularly pathogenic. This epizootic involved a total of 39 outbreaks and was declared resolved on 11 Apr 2014. Genotyping of the current virus strain will be of interest.

In April 2014, a "new strain", namely HPAI H5N6, was identified in Viet Nam for the 1st time. It caused 7 outbreaks and the event was declared resolved on 6 Oct 2014; all reports on this strain and a relevant interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15802.

Since 2003, 127 human cases of avian influenza have been reported from Viet Nam, including 64 deaths. The disease peaked in the 2 years 2004/2005 (90 cases, 39 deaths). Since then, control and prevention efforts by the animal health authorities were intensified, including vaccinations of poultry.

During (early) 2014, 2 human HPAI H5N1 cases were reported from Viet Nam; unfortunately, both fatal. - Mod.AS
