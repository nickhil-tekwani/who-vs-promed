A total of 45 dogs have died so far, since the end of June 2010, in
Arusha (Tanzania), due to aflatoxin contaminated maize or maize
flour, but there are no reports of any human beings affected.

The disease was suspected on clinical/laboratory basis. At
post-mortem the livers were yellow in colour with reddish dots. Some
of the suspected contaminated maize flour was sent to South Africa
for further confirmation, and resulted [in] positive [test results]
to aflatoxin.

It is not known from where the contaminated maize came from and why
no clinical cases were reported in humans as surveillance was not
established.

The situation looks like to have improved and no more cases are reported.

I have a question is it possible to destroy
1) the toxins by exposing the maize grains to the sun for some hours?
2) by roasting the grains or any other way?

[Dogs are susceptible to aflatoxin in the grain that is often used to
make pet food. Low levels of aflatoxin for a long period (120 or more
days) of time can cause liver failure, jaundice. It will cause
elevated liver enzymes. It can cause death. Dogs can and do recover
if removed from the contaminated grain.

High levels may produce acute clinical signs.

Aflatoxin in the grain is produced because the microclimate of the
grain is right for the production of the _Aspergillus flavus_ or
_Aspergillus parasiticus_ to grow. The presence of mold does not mean
the toxin is present as the mold may not be producing toxin. The lack
of mold does not mean the absence of toxin either, as the mold may
have died, leaving the toxin.

Leaving grains in the sun does not alter the aflatoxin content.
Roasting the grains does not alter the aflatoxin content either.

Ammoniation of the grain will destroy the aflatoxin, but the grain is
then only suitable for consumption by ruminant animals.

There is a clay product that is specifically used for binding
aflatoxin, but it does not destroy the aflatoxin. It may be something
to consider as this can be used for monogastric consumption. But the
product is very specific and not just any clay will work. - Mod.TG]
