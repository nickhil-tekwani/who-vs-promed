Bird flu has been registered in the Kochkovo district, the
Novosibirsk region, Siberia, the head of the Russian agriculture
watchdog [agency], Sergei Dankvert, told Itar-Tass on Wednesday.
"H5N1 virus has been found in non-vaccinated poultry in private
households of the Reshety village," he said. [Latitude 54.2142
Longitude 80.2142; map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/53/Reshety.html>].
So far the flu has killed 64 birds. The village has 35 000 poultry,
Dankvert said.
Bird flu has been [recently] registered in Russia's 6 villages, 4 of
them in Dagestan, one in the Krasnodar Territory and another one in
the Novosibirsk region.
As of 5 May 2006, 65.3 million doses of anti-bird flu vaccine was
delivered to Russia's regions. Almost 33 million birds were
vaccinated all over Russia.

[The first H5N1 outbreak in Siberia was reported in Novosibirsk
during the 3rd week of July 2005. The H5N1 virus, which affected
domestic poultry, was also isolated from wild birds (ducks, grebe).
The epizootic spread to 9 other regions (Altai, Astrakhan,
Chelyabinsk, Kalmykia, Kurgan, Omsk, Tambov, Tiumen and Tula),
causing 62 outbreaks (of which 15 -- the highest number -- in
Novosibirsk). The involvement of domestic poultry was terminated at
the end of October 2005. The annual data were summarised in Russia's
follow-up report No 5 of 27 Dec 2005. At that time, vaccination was
prohibited in Russia.
An "Immediate notification report", sent on 16 Feb 2006, notified the
renewal of AI outbreaks in commercial poultry, this time in Dagestan;
they were followed by outbreaks in other parts of southern Russia
(Stavropol, Volgograd, and Krasnodar). In March 2006, the Russians
decided to apply mass vaccination (see 20060311.0771).
A Russian epidemiologist, Gennady Onishchenko, was quoted on 25 Apr
2006 saying that the epicenter of the bird flu virus has shifted to
Russia, and that uninfected migrating birds would reach Siberia and
the Ural Mountains by the end of April and "probably become infected
by the summer" (see 20060426.1215). - Mod.AS]

The spread of deadly H5N1 bird flu in Nigeria is slowing 3 months
after the disease was first detected in Africa's most populous
country, officials said on Wednesday [10 May 2006].
The first African state to be hit by bird flu, Nigeria has not
reported any human cases of the disease, although experts warn
surveillance may not be completely effective and cases may have gone
undetected.
In the first few weeks, bird flu spread rapidly in poultry across the
country despite measures to contain it such as culling and
quarantine, and outbreaks were reported in 13 of Nigeria's 36 states
and in the Federal Capital Territory.
But there have been no outbreaks in new states since the disease
reached the largest city, Lagos, in late March 2006.
"No new states have been affected since Lagos, but that doesn't mean
the outbreaks have completely stopped," said Tony Joannis, head of
the viral research department at the National Veterinary Research
Institute which tests for bird flu. In the past 2 or 3 weeks we have
had 2 new outbreaks in states that were already affected, Bauchi and
Plateau," he told Reuters, adding the rate of new outbreaks had
slowed dramatically.
Joannis said it would not be safe to consider the disease contained,
but recent evidence suggested measures to prevent its spread were
working better than at the start.
Nigeria's public health system is almost non-existent and people are
often buried without any medical check to determine the cause of
death. This has raised fears human cases of bird flu may have gone
undetected.
Many Nigerians stopped eating chicken after bird flu was confirmed,
and a month later a poultry farmers' association reported sales had
dropped by 85 percent.
"Business was terrible in the first few weeks ... but sales have
started picking up now," said Joy Bankole, who sells frozen chicken
at a shop in Lagos.
However, sales were still slower than before bird flu hit. "I used to
sell one carton of frozen chicken in about 4 days, but it now takes
about 2 weeks to sell one carton," she said.
Many Nigerians are too poor to afford the luxury of rejecting chicken
if they are able to get hold of it.
"Bird flu or not, if I get chicken even now, I will gladly eat it,"
said Benjamin Ajayi, a street trader in Lagos.

China has stepped up monitoring for bird flu in the remote
northwestern province of Qinghai, state media said on Wednesday, as
the WHO said it remained concerned and that now was not the time to
be complacent.
Health authorities have tightened controls in Yushu county, about 800
km (500 miles) from the provincial capital Xining, where an outbreak
of the H5N1 strain among wild birds was reported last week, Xinhua
news agency said.
Qinghai has become a major focus for scientists studying mutations of
the H5N1 virus.
A year ago, scientists believe a mutated form of the virus killed
thousands of wild birds at Qinghai Lake, a major stop-off point for
migratory birds in the province's barren northeast.
Soon after the mass die-off of birds in late April and May 2005, the
virus rapidly spread West to Europe and then to the Middle East and
Africa, underscoring the importance of monitoring what's happening at
the lake, and elsewhere in China.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the Qinghai Lake form of the
H5N1 virus is almost identical to the strain found in recent
outbreaks in Nigeria, Iraq and Turkey.
Prior to the Qinghai Lake event, H5N1 was known to cause occasional
sporadic deaths in migratory waterfowl, but not to kill them in large
numbers or be carried by them over long distances, the WHO has said.
"The birds are on the move. This is the breeding and nesting time, so
we wouldn't be surprised to see more reports in wild birds and
possibly also reports in domestic poultry," said Julie Hall, the
WHO's China bird flu coordinator.
"This is a virus that is unstable and unpredictable," she said.
China has reported almost 40 outbreaks of bird flu in poultry across
a dozen provinces over the past year. Health experts see the country
as being particularly at risk because of its huge human population
and many poor, remote areas.
As in many other parts of Asia, domestic poultry often live cheek by
jowl with humans in China, increasing the risk of transmission to
people through contact with sick birds.
"Animal surveillance remains extremely important and there is
probably even greater need for enhanced surveillance now because
although reports of animal outbreaks are on the decrease, we are
still seeing human cases," Hall said.
China was being a lot more open with sharing information and samples,
she added, even if there remained areas of concern.
"Things are progressing. Relations with the Ministry of Health are
good and they're certainly sharing viruses," Hall said.
In March 2006, the WHO said that China had agreed to share virus
samples from outbreaks in poultry to meet a request the country go
beyond sending samples collected from people and help global efforts
to limit the spread of the disease.
"The Ministry of Agriculture is in the process of catching up in
terms of what has not been shared for a year to 18 months. We hope
that this is a sign that in the future there will be more timely and
easier sharing of information and viruses," Hall said

[4] Denmark, wild birds - correction
Date: Thu, 11 May 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

In yesterday's posting 20060510.1341, under "[2] Denmark, wild
birds, update 8 May 2006", we reported that a case of H5 HPAI was
confirmed on 2 May 2006 in a great crested grebe (_Podiceps
cristatus_), in the town of Grasten in South Jutland County.
Erroneously, the grebe was described in the commentary as a goose. We
thank Joe Dudley for drawing our attention to the error and for
attaching a picture of the grebe:
