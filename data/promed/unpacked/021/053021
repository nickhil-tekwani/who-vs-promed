Outbreaks of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in the Northern and Western Cape have been confirmed by the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD). Rabbit owners are advised to practise strict biosecurity measures.

The disease resulted in high mortalities in rabbits and hares, with animals dying suddenly due to bleeding in organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen, according to a statement by the agriculture department.

This was the 1st time that RHD had been detected in South Africa, and the department was investigating the source of the outbreaks, as the importing of hares and rabbits into the country was prohibited.

Local authorities began to suspect a problem after rabbits and wild hares began dying in unusually high numbers in parts of the Northern Cape towards the end of October, and in some areas of the Western Cape in the 1st week of November [2022].

Petro van Rhyn, general manager for advocacy at CapeNature, told Farmer's Weekly that 296 ill and/or dead hares had so far been recorded in 58 locations, mainly in the Karoo, the southern part of the Northern Cape, and the northwest quadrant of the Western Cape. Reports of the deaths of domestic rabbits had, however, come from as far west and south as Hermanus and Durbanville, she added.

Affected species included the domestic rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus_), the Cape hare (_Lepus capensis spp_), the scrub hare (_Lepus saxatilis_), and Smith's red rock hare (_Pronolagus rupestris_). Conservationists feared that RHD could also affect the endangered riverine rabbit (_Bunolagus monticularis_), which occurred only in the Nama-Karoo shrubland.

Van Rhyn added that the outbreaks of RHD were a devastating blow, as hares and rabbits were important seed dispersers and formed a crucial part of the diet of carnivores and raptors. Some species were also regarded as "ecosystem engineers", as they modified the environment by burrowing and digging.

In the absence of a vaccine [see comment] to control the disease, Daniel Johnson, spokesperson for the Western Cape Department of Agriculture, advised rabbit owners to practise strict biosecurity measures. "Don't introduce new rabbits, touch other rabbits, or allow visits from rabbit owners or their workers until more information is available on the disease.

"Avoid contact with wild rabbits and hares, and clean equipment with a bleach solution, then leave it to dry for at least 10 minutes before rinsing it off," he said. Johnson also advised owners to wear gloves soaked in bleach when handing carcasses, and to bury the carcasses at least 1.5 m deep and at least 100 m away from vleis, dams and waterways.

[On 18 Nov 2022, DALRRD informed the WOAH about the confirmation of the 1st outbreak of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in Karoo Hoogland, Namakwa, Northern Cape. Genotyping was "pending." A press release of the same day said the reports of die-offs of wild rabbits and hares from the Karoo areas in the Western and Northern Cape have been received (20221122.8706840).

According to the current report, the virus has, most likely, entered domestic rabbit farms as well.

According to WOAH's Terrestrial Manual (updated 2021), "indirect control of the disease is easily achieved by vaccination." Most vaccines used are prepared from the livers of infected rabbits, and are inactivated and adjuvanted. Vaccinated animals quickly produce solid protective immunity against RHDV infection (within 7-10 days) and experimental data indicate that protection lasts for a long period (over one year). As RHDV and RHDV2 have different antigenic profiles, combined vaccination with both serotypes, or the use of a vaccine homologous to the RHDV or RHDV2 strain identified during the epidemics or the outbreak, is highly advisable.

Genotyping of the pathogen currently circulating in South Africa, to identify the virus strain involved (RHDV or RHDV2), will allow vaccination to stop the further spread of this lethal virus.
