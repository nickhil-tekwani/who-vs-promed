Cambodia reported 33 770 malaria cases in the 1st 10 months of the year [2013], a drop of 43 per cent from 59 670 cases a year earlier [2012], Xinhua news agency reported a health official as saying on Sat 23 Nov 2013.

A total of 8 patients died during the 10 month period, down 78 per cent from 37 a year earlier [2012], said Char Meng Chuor, director of the National Centre for Malaria. "Based on the figures, we can say that the death toll from malaria is no longer a major threat for the Cambodian people," he said in a press release.

Malaria is a mosquitoborne infectious disease, which is often found in rainy seasons and mostly happens in forests and mountainous provinces.

Last year [2012], the country had distributed 2.2 million insecticide-treated mosquito nets to vulnerable groups of people. Char Meng Chuor said the government is committed to stopping deaths from malaria by 2015 and completely eliminating it by 2025. Last year [2012], malaria killed 45 people.

[Cambodia was one of the 1st countries to report decreased susceptibility to artemisinins, and it is, therefore, very good news that the impregnated bed net program has started to reduce malaria cases. The decrease in mortality from 45 last year to 8 so far this year [2013] also shows that the program is providing results. - Mod.EP
