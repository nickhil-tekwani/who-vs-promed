Rift Valley fever outbreak in Jizan
-----------------------------------
Rift Valley fever (RVF) has broken out again in the Jizan region, the
agriculture minister announced Monday [6 Sep 2004].
Fahd Bin Abdulrahman Balghunaim told the Saudi Press Agency that 5 cases
of viral disease were detected during periodic examinations in Jizan by the
agriculture ministry. 4 of the samples which tested positive are in Abu
Areish governorate and one in Al-A'rida governorate.
Ali Al-Qahtani, director of Health Affairs in Jizan Province told the Saudi
Gazette on Monday [6 Sep 2004] that every measure would be taken to
immediately control the spread of the disease. No human being was detected
to have RVF. There has not been a single case of RVF detected in humans,
Qahtani said.
Rift Valley fever -- which usually affects livestock -- can strike human
beings, leading to the victims suffering swollen brains and burst
arteries. [This terminology might be related to difficulties along the
Arabic-English translation routes; they probably refer to the typical
congested and edematous brains and to subcutaneous hemorrhages,
characteristic of RVF in humans. - Mod. AS].
The results of these tests indicate existence of limited virus activity,
said the minister. [It will be interesting to learn if this activity has
been detected by sero-conversion in sentinels, viral investigations in
trapped vectors, or otherwise. - Mod. AS].
Balghunaim said his ministry is moving to prevent an epidemic as in 2000,
when RVF appeared for the first time outside Africa with an outbreak in
Saudi Arabia and Yemen. A total of 124 people out of 884 infected died in
that epidemic in Jizan which took months to subdue. Additionally, tens of
thousands of livestock were slaughtered to prevent the disease from
spreading. The virus had reached the Kingdom from Africa through infected
sheep and was passed on by mosquitoes.
Most people get a flu-like illness when infected by the RVF virus. Some may
develop serious symptoms, including liver or kidney disease. At least 30
species of mosquitoes are capable of carrying it from cattle or sheep to
humans. People also can catch it by handling the blood or fluids of an
infected animal.
The ministry has already prepared a comprehensive plan for tackling such
cases, Balghunaim said. Preventive measures taken in 2000-2001 had included
sending teams to Jizan to spray insecticides. Qahtani said the Health
Ministry has already started a medical survey of the area to define the
magnitude of the problem. He described the medical survey as 'active phase
detection'. The surveillance will be conducted on all the hospitals in the
region. Besides, the Ministry will launch a campaign for the eradication of
mosquitoes, which are known for spreading the RVF virus, he said.
He said the Ministry of Agriculture will also engage in surveillance of
farmlands in Jizan to detect the disease if it exists in animals. Awareness
about RVF is already high among people in Jizan since they experienced the
outbreak in 2000.
Scientists say that usually only one percent of infected humans die of Rift
Valley fever. The mortality rate in animals less than a week old is 90
percent.
In late September 2000, before the preventive slaughter of animals had
begun, the Saudi Minister of Agriculture and Water said the virus had
killed almost 11 000 sheep, cows and camels in the Jizan port area alone.
At about the same time, Yemen reported 6000 dead animals. Total livestock
mortalities in that epidemic, including animals that were destroyed and
aborted fetuses, is estimated in the range of 40 000.
Noted as a disease in Kenya's Rift Valley as early as the turn of the 20th
century (the causative virus was isolated in 1930), RVF has been seen at
irregular intervals on the continent, particularly after heavy rains that
favor mosquito breeding. The 2000 outbreak in Saudi Arabia and Yemen came
after a prolonged drought both in the Horn [of Africa] and in East Africa.
Another outbreak -- in Libya in early 1999 -- was also not associated with
rains. [RVF has never been reported from Libya; might the Gazette be
referring to the human cases in the Delta area, Egypt, in 2003? see ProMED
post 20030827.2158. - Mod. AS].
Balghunaim said that there is no cause for panic at this stage and that the
positive results of the samples do not necessarily mean an epidemic has
broken out again in Jizan. He appealed to livestock breeders in Jizan to take
all the required precautionary measures and to cooperate with the authorities
concerned in this respect.

[The introduction of RVF into Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia (Jizan) in
September 2000 was the first occurrence of natural RVF infection outside
the African continent. The outbreak continued until the first quarter of
2001, affecting humans and animals (mainly small ruminants) -- see refs.
below.
Arboviral diseases seem to be seasonal in the Middle-East, probably related
to enhanced vector prevalence and activity during the months August --
December, c.f. bluetongue, Akabane disease, West Nile fever, ephemeral
fever, and -- in Egypt and the Arab peninsular -- RVF.
In April 2004, the Saudi authorities lifted a 3 year old ban on the
movement of livestock between regions hit by Rift Valley Fever (RVF). The
ban was imposed on animals in Jizan, the Tihama areas of Asir, Makkah [Mecca -
Mod.JW], as well as Baha regions Qunfudha, Najran, and Tihama Qahtan. The
Agriculture Ministry set up an early-warning unit "to monitor and contain
infectious diseases that affect agricultural and animal resources in certain
regions, before those diseases spread to other parts of the Kingdom" and
established a laboratory in Jizan to carry out medical tests and check the
effectiveness of insecticides (see ProMED post 20040426.1160). It might be
instrumental in investigating the possibility that RVF has become established
in the Arabian peninsular, or in other words -- endemic, with possible
periodic outbreaks.
The current news seems to reflect results obtained by the said surveillance
systems; details on the species/tissues sampled/tested, the lab techniques
applied and the results obtained will be helpful; in the meantime, the
disease remains "suspected".- Mod. AS].
