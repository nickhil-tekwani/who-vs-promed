In response to a 4th case of botulism being linked to Bolthouse
Farms, Bakersfield, California brand carrot juice, the FDA is warning
consumers not to drink Bolthouse Farms Carrot Juice, 450 ml and 1
liter plastic bottles, with "BEST IF USED BY" dates of 11 Nov 2006 or
earlier. Consumers should discard this product. FDA is also
reiterating its advice to consumers to keep carrot juice -- including
pasteurized carrot juice -- refrigerated. [Previous cases were in
Georgia residents; see ProMED-mail posting 20060916.2638 referenced below.]
The 4th case of botulism poisoning involves an adult female in
Florida who is currently suffering from paralysis. To date, one link
between the illness and the consumers appears to be that the juice
they drank was not properly refrigerated once it was in the home,
which allowed the _Clostridium botulinum_ spores to grow and produce
toxin. FDA is investigating other possible links.
_C. botulinum_ is a bacterium commonly found in soil. Under certain
conditions these bacteria can produce a toxin that if ingested can
result in botulism, a disease that may cause paralysis or
death. Cases of botulism from processed food are extremely rare in the USA.
Symptoms of botulism can include: double-vision, droopy eyelids,
altered voice, trouble with speaking or swallowing, and paralysis on
both sides of the body that progresses from the neck down, possibly
followed by difficulty in breathing. Anyone experiencing these
symptoms should seek immediate medical attention.
Adequate refrigeration is one of the keys to food safety and is
essential to preventing bacterial growth. Refrigerator temperatures
should be no higher than 40 degrees F and freezer temperatures no
higher then 0 degrees F. Consumers should check the temperatures
occasionally with an appliance thermometer.
Consumers should look for the words "Keep Refrigerated" on juice
labels so they know which products must be kept refrigerated. FDA is
looking into whether industry's current juice labels provide clear
refrigeration instructions.

[It is useful to reiterate, based on the ancient observation that
truth has a half-life of no more than 6 months, that foods whose
packaging says "keep refrigerated" should be.
ProMED thanks Brent Barrett for the submission. - Mod.LL]
[At present there have been cases in Georgia and now Florida from a
product that was produced in California. As we do not know the
actual distribution of this product, it is likely that it has been
distributed in other states as well, so the risk of cases of botulism
appearing in other states is ever present. Given this, we have
decided to rename this thread as USA (multistate) to allow for easier
reporting of other cases should they arise. There are still folks
out there who shy away from refrigerating products as an unnatural
way to store items, even though the products clearly state
"refrigerate after opening". - Mod.MPP]
