The Assam Medical College and Hospital (AMCH) has logged a total of 10 deaths due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) since January till now [30 Jul 2021].

Speaking to this correspondent, AMCH superintendent Prasanta Dihingia said: "Since January this year [2021], we had 108 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and 44 JE cases. In medicine department, 81 AES cases and 26 JE cases were admitted since January this year while 71 AES case and 18 JE cases were admitted at paediatric department of AMCH since April this year. There were 4 patients who died of JE at paediatric department while 6 succumbed to JE at medicine department of AMCH."

Dihingia added, "Most of the cases were from Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts. Many patients are still undergoing treatment at the AMCH and our team of doctors are giving them best treatment." Dihingia further said, "There has been a considerable decline in the number of AES and JE cases in the last 2 years."

Siddhartha Saikia, district consultant of the Directorate of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) said, "Due to the sincere efforts of health department, cases have decreased in Dibrugarh district. There has been a huge decline in the number of JE and AES cases in Dibrugarh district this year [2021]. The months of June, July and August are usually the peak period for the disease."

[Assam has been a state of very active JE virus transmission in recent years. The decline in JE and AES cases is remarkable. The previous report mentions immunizations, and one assumes that JE vaccine is included, which may be responsible for the decline in JE cases. The reason for the decline in AES cases is not as clear. As mentioned in many previous ProMED posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible JE, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and intoxication from lychee fruit consumption. Dr T Jacob John noted that hypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption. A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. The JE virus transmission season still has over 3 months to go, so more cases may occur. One hopes that vaccination and other efforts will continue to be successful in reducing the JE case numbers. - Mod.TY
