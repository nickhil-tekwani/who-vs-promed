Dengue fever has killed 321 people in Vietnam so far this year, nearly 50%
more than in all of 1997, a government official said Saturday. Tran Hung
of the Ministry of Health said 159,449 people had contracted the disease as
of Oct. 20. The 12 Mekong Delta provinces in the south were hit
particularly hard by dengue, he said, as swamps and water tanks prepared by
farmers for use during the five-month dry season starting in November
attracted mosquitoes that carry the disease. Last year, 226 of the 107,000
people who contracted the virus died.
