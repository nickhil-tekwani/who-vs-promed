[The neuraminidase for the current event and for the one reported on 8 Jan 2017 (see posting 20180108.5545413) have not yet been typed. However; given that the last outbreaks in Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia were associated with subtype H5N8; and the fact that the outbreaks are continuing in this area; it is likely that these recent reports in Afghanistan are also associated with the H5N8 subtype. - Mod.CRD
