African countries join forces to stop skin-eating bacteria, _Buruli
ulcerans_ [_Mycobacterium ulcerans_.
Three African leaders have pledged to work together to combat a gruesome
leprosy-related bacterium known as buruli, which eats away flesh and is
showing signs of spreading in the continent. Presidents Henri Konan Bedie
of Ivory Coast, Jerry Rawlings of Ghana and Mathieu Kerekou of Benin threw
their weight behind a World Health Organization (WHO) plan to coordinate
research and prevention at a conference which ends on Wednesday. "We are
deeply concerned that very little is known about this disease," the three
presidents said in a joint declaration at the first International
Conference on Buruli Ulcer Control and Research in Ivory Coast's capital.
The three, whose countries are among the worst hit by the disease, signed
the Yamoussoukro Declaration on Buruli Ulcer on Monday. There is no known
cure for the disease, Buruli ulcerans, a close cousin of tuberculosis and
named in 1960 by British scientists after an outbreak in Uganda's Buruli
district. The number of cases worldwide is not known. Ivory Coast saw its
cumulative total double to 10,000 between 1996 and 1997. The disease was
first detected here in 1978. Nations listing their first cases in 1998
alone included Kenya, Sierra Leone and Tanzania.
Researchers believe buruli's emergence in soils across Africa and to a
lesser degree in Asia, Australia and Latin America may be related to rain
forest destruction and to dams and irrigation. "Buruli is a threat to
development in African countries," host president Bedie told the conference
on Monday. Rawlings said sufferers were traveling to Ghana where treatment
was free and urged other African countries to follow its example to save it
from being swamped. "Some of our neighboring countries might have to take
such steps," he said. "We cannot close our borders. We must make the issue
a collective and joint effort."
Buruli is an African cousin of the flesh-eating bacteria which surfaced in
Western hospitals in the 1990s. It strips away skin and even eats into
bones by destroying blood vessels with toxins to expose large areas of
gangrenous flesh. Tell-tale skin nodules turn into ulcers, then gaping
yellow and black sores ringed with dead flesh. Victims often die from
multiple infections, exhaustion and septicaemia. Those who are saved are
often grotesquely deformed, unable to work.
WHO set up a Global Buruli Initiative in 1998 after classifying the disease
as an emerging threat to public health. The Yamoussoukro Declaration
targets treatment -- so far limited mainly to surgical excision of flesh
and grafting -- at the earliest nodular stage. Awareness campaigns in the
worst hit rural areas are also planned. Villagers, who sometimes blame the
ulcers on sorcery, have little access to basic health care and are often
found with late stages of the disease. WHO's representative in Ivory Coast,
Emmanuel Eben-Moussi, describes buruli as a "leprosy bug for the third
millennium." He said Africa should not make the same mistakes as with AIDS.
"When we first saw AIDS, people said it was brought in by the white man,"
he told Reuters. "Now we are seeing this disease and we must catch it early
to avoid the same mistakes."
Antwerp's Institute of Tropical Medicine has been designated by WHO to
cover buruli research and support for Africa and South America.

[_Mycobacterium ulcerans_ infections have been historically restricted to
geographic pockets in Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa and Mexico, often
swampy areas. The organism differs from many _Mycobacterium_ sp. insofar
as it seldom causes granulomatous lesions. Disease begins as a nodular
lesion that progresses to a chronic, necrotizing skin ulcer, generally more
superficial than is characteristic of leprosy. Therapy has been difficult.
It should be remembered that the emergence of this disease is superimposed
on an incidence of HIV infection that approximates 25% in adult populations
in some parts of Africa. Comments from those with direct microbiological
and clinical experience would be helpful. - Mod.ES
