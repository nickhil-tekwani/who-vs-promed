Bowing to international pressure, Indonesia has said that tforeign
scientists can have full access to the country's data on bird flu, the
infectious disease that has claimed 43 lives here.
The move is expected to help international scientists understand how the
H5N1 bird flu virus works. Researchers are especially interested in the
limited human-to-human transmission of the virus that happened in May 2006
in North Sumatra in the world's largest cluster of infections. Scientists
fear bird flu could become more easily transmissible among humans, sparking
a deadly global pandemic.
"I've learned that scientists across the world have complained that they
could not access the data and made statements as if we had hidden it,"
health minister Siti Fadilah Supari told a press conference here on
Thursday [3 Aug 2006].
"For the sake of basic human interests, the Indonesian government declares
that genomic data on bird flu viruses can be accessed by anyone."
In its 13 Jul 2006 edition, the respected journal Nature reported
scientists were complaining that they were hindered from studying the virus
because the Indonesian government had declined to release the data from
bird flu samples [see 20060729.2095].
In a recent interview with The Jakarta Post, the minister admitted the
government had kept the data to itself and its partners while conducting
its own research.
Siti said the decision to open up access to the information came after a
suggestion from the medical committee of the Indonesian Academy of
Sciences, a government-sanctioned forum of experts. Professor Sangkot
Marzuki of the academy said the committee made the suggestion because
emerging diseases like bird flu should be addressed promptly, involving as
many stakeholders as possible.
He said the academy had considered the potential benefits that the
government could reap by developing vaccines and drugs based on its data,
and from royalties from intellectual rights. Health experts have been
debating for decades whether genomic data from new viruses and other
microscopic materials should be owned by the organizations that sponsor the
research, or placed in the public domain so that the world can have access
to it.
Siti said opening up global access could be the key to unlocking such
important information as the origin of the virus, how it causes disease,
how it is mutating, the sources of infection, and how to prevent or cure
the virus.
"But in future cooperation on bird flu with other countries, the delivery
of specimens should be regulated under 'Material Transfer Agreement'
documents as is commonly practiced in scientific cooperation," she added.
