The Kedah Health Department has confirmed that on 11 Sep 2015 a 53-year-old woman residing in Kota Setar was bitten by her pet dog which tested positive for rabies. Director Datuk Dr Norhizan Ismail said the incident happened at 8.30pm after which the woman sought treatment at a private clinic before informing the Veterinary Services Department the next day.

"Kota Setar Health Department officers immediately swung into action and referred her to the Emergency Unit of the Sultanah Bahiyah Hospital for vaccination," Dr Norhizan said in a statement here on Sat [19 Sep 2015]. The woman was only treated as an outpatient and has to receive 4 more shots of the vaccine within a 2-week period, Dr Norhizan said, adding that she appeared healthy.

"However, she was asked to be extra alert about the symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if needed," Dr Norhizan added.

According to the department, of 9 reports of people being bitten by dogs, so far no human case of rabies has been reported.

[Kedah is the northeasternmost state of Malaysia and on the Thai border; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedah. Kota Setar is a district in Kedah, Malaysia where the state capital Alor Star is situated; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota_Setar.

This dog did not come down spontaneously with clinical rabies. It had to have been previously bitten by some infected animal. As the implications are that this is an urban area it was probably another dog, which in its rampage will have bitten a series of dogs. Hopefully this rabid pet was an unvaccinated exception. But if canine vaccination is slack in Kedah, there will be more incidents, some of which will involve human exposures. - Mod.MHJ
