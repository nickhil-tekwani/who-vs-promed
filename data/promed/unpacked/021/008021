Potato is the fourth most important food crop in the world after
wheat, rice, and maize. Potato production represents roughly
half of the world's annual output of all roots and tubers. Since
the early 1960's, the percentage increase in area planted in
developing countries has been higher than for any other major
food crop. Production increases have been second only to wheat.
Potato originated in the highlands of South America, most likely
in the area now bordering Lake Titicaca. The Spanish introduced
it in Europe in the 16th century as a botanical curiosity rather
than a source of food.
Annual world production currently totals 275 million tons and
covers 18 million hectares. The Russian Federation ranks as the
world's largest producer, followed closely by China. Together,
the Russian Federation and Poland account for 28 percent of the
world's total planted area; China and India account for a
additional 22 percent.
Currently, the potato sector worldwide is in transition. Europe
and the former Soviet Union account for the bulk of production,
but this situation is changing rapidly. In the early 1990's,
some 30 percent of the global potato output was produced in
developing countries, up from 11 percent in the early 1960s. If
this trend continues, most of the world's potatoes will be
harvested in Asia, Africa, or Latin America in less than a
generation. As a result, potato is becoming an increasingly
important source of food, rural employment and income for the
growing populations in these regions.

POTATO IN THE WORLD DIET
More than a billion people worldwide eat potato. The crop also
represents an important part of the diet of more than half a
billion consumers in developing countries. Although European per
capita consumption has declined over the past three decades,
Europe is still the largest per capita consumer, followed by
North America and Latin America. According to FAO, per capita
consumption during 1991-92 averaged as follows: Western Europe
(79.3 kg), Eastern Europe (80.3 kg), USA (58.4 kg). For the
developing world during this period, consumption averaged 11.7 kg
in Asia, 8.0 kg in Africa, and 20.6 kg in Latin America.

important potato-producing countries. It is available, free of
