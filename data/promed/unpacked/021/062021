Veterinarians will carry out an unplanned rabies vaccination program
in the private sector of Bogorodsky rayon of Nizhny Novgorod oblast,
starting 30 Mar 2010. This activity has been triggered by the rabies
outbreak in the territory, the regional government says.

The number of animal rabies cases during the 1st quarter of 2010 was
42, compared to 25 during the same period in 2009. Rabid animals had
contact with humans in 4 cases and with pets in 11 cases. The planned
vaccination activities during the January and February of 2010
included 1932 cattle, 8538 dogs and 5759 cats.

coverage (out of the susceptible pet population), could be given.
