Rabies cases in Weld and Larimer counties are on the rise this year [2018], with nearly 30 reported cases between the 2 counties so far in 2018.

There have been 17 rabid skunks reported in Larimer County this year [2018], which is 9 more reported cases than in all of 2017. Eight of those have been reported in Fort Collins, and the rest were found in Wellington, Timnath, Carr and unincorporated Larimer County.

Ten skunks and one bat have tested positive for rabies in Weld County, according to a Weld County news release. Rabid skunks have been found near Ault, Briggsdale, Gill, Greeley, Hudson and Windosr. A rabid bat was also found in Windsor.

"This looks like a year for high rabies exposure in wild animals," Weld County Health Department executive director Mark Wallace said in a news release. "The best protection against rabies is to avoid contact with wild animals and keep your pets vaccinated."

Before this year [2018], the last time a rabid skunk was reported in Fort Collins was 2013, when 6 were found in the city and 35 in the county.

County officials previously told the Coloradoan that this year's [2018] spike in rabid skunks has to do with the bounce-back in the county's skunk population.

Any mammal can contract rabies, and the risk for humans increases when pets aren't vaccinated, the release stated. To protect you and your animals, health officials recommend all domesticated animals, including livestock, stay up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations.

[Historically in North America, skunk rabies occurs mainly in 4 geographical regions: (1) southern Ontario and Quebec and upper New York State; (2) the north-central United States and the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta; (3) California; and (4) south-central United States (Texas and several adjacent states). Animal population densities are key drivers of the dynamics of diseases like rabies, which are transmitted by direct contact. If the skunk population increases, the prevalence of rabies in that population is expected to increase. - Mod.PMB
