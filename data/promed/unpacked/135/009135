Update: Cases of Acute Respiratory Infection with Myocarditis and
Pericarditis in Greece
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Background:
On 9 Apr 2002l, headline news in a local newspaper in Crete reported
the death of a previously healthy 45 year old woman in Heraklion. The
death, which occurred on 5 Apr 2002, was associated with myocarditis
after upper respiratory tract infection. A second death (13 Apr 2002)
of a 48-year old woman from eastern Crete with similar symptoms was
also headline news. This increased media attention and public
anxiety. On 15 Apr 2002, the death of a 32 year old woman from
myocarditis after respiratory tract infection was reported from
Ioannina (north-west Greece). Postmortem examination of these 3 women
showed myocarditis and pericarditis in 2 and myocarditis in one.
Several other reports of (non-fatal) cases of myocarditis or
pericarditis or both after upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)
were received by the Hellenic Centre for Infectious Disease Control
(HCIDC).
An investigation was begun on 15 Apr 2002 by colleagues at the
University of Crete, who were joined the following day by 2
epidemiologists from the HCIDC. The 2 deceased women had displayed
upper respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, malaise) with a
particularly prominent myalgia. Subsequently, they had chest pain,
dyspnoea and, later, cardiac failure, and cardiogenic shock. They
both deteriorated rapidly and died within 24 hours of admission to
hospital. Physicians reported that in recent weeks they had seen a
large number of patients with URTI. A subgroup of these patients had
characteristic (and often severe) myalgia or pleurodynia, which in
many cases developed after the fever subsided; some of them had
conjunctivitis. In several cases, URTI in child contacts preceding
the adult cases was reported.
Initial Interpretation:
A hypothesis was formed that there was an increase of URTI in Crete,
possibly from several viruses, one of which might be responsible for
the syndrome characterised by myalgia/pleurodynia and, rarely,
cardiac tropism.

Epidemiological sureveillance:
As of 1 May 2002, 53 cases of possible myocarditis/pericarditis
following suspected viral infection have been reported; some are
being evaluated and may eventually be excluded. The number admitted
to hospital peaked around 19-22 April, and declined afterwards Cases
have been reported from all parts of the country. No cases have been
reported among people visiting Greece for business or tourism. The
age distribution of cases is as follows: <10 years: 2 cases; 10-19
years: 3; 20-29 years: 9, 30-39 years: 8; 40-49 years: 10; 50-59
years: 6; 60-69 years: 5, 70-79 years: 8, 80+ years: 2. Thirty
patients are male (57%) and 23 female (43%). Seventeen (32%) cases
were reported to have myocarditis, 31 (58%) pericarditis, and 5 (9%)
both myocarditis and pericarditis. In general, the clinical course of
cases has been good.
There were 4613 visits to the sentinel general hospitals in Athens
recorded during the period 15 March to 28 April 2002, and 1005 visits
for URTI. No increase in visits for URTI was observed from mid-March
(figure 2). URTI visits to the paediatric hospital in Athens and to
the sentinel hospitals in Crete (not presented here) show similar
trends.
Visits for 1306 episodes of URTI were recorded by the health centres
of Crete in the period 1-20 April. Although a steady number of visits
for URTI is recorded, a small increase in the number of visits for
myalgia/pleurodynia was apparent during the second week of April,
which may be related to the circulation of a myotropic virus. On
average, 152 sentinel physicians reported per week in 2000, 121 in
2001, and 150 in the first 16 weeks of 2002. The number of URTI
visits per reporting physician in the sentinel system in Greece shows
that the seasonal increase of URTI was delayed this year, which is
possibly related to lower temperatures in spring, but there was no
increase since the 14th week of the year (4 weeks ago).
Forty-one sentinel physicians (24 general practitioners and 17
paediatricians) from Athens participated in the daily reporting
system; there was no increase in the number of visits for URTI in the
period studied (23-30 April 2002).
Microbiological studies:
To date, laboratory findings for 7 patients using PCR and reverse
transcriptase-PCR, reported from 2 of the laboratories involved
(University of Athens and University of Thessaloniki), are indicative
of the presence of an enterovirus. Two viral isolates were obtained
from stool specimens of 2 patients. Preliminary phylogenetic analyses
showed that both isolates were clustering with other enteroviruses
(University of Thessaloniki, Professor A Antoniadis). In addition,
immunohistology using mouse monoclonal antibodies against
enteroviruses and adenoviruses detected enterovirus antigen in the
cytoplasm of cardiac tissue cells from one of the deceased women
(University
of Athens, Professor N Legakis).
Public health measures:
On 17 Apr 2002 hospitals were alerted about the syndrome. On 23 Apr
2002 authorities issued advice that personal hygiene should be
intensified, and schools were closed 3 days early (on 24 Apr 2002)
for the 2 week Greek Orthodox Easter holiday. Following consultation
with national medical experts and public health officials, the
authorities stated that the situation did not justify any restriction
on travel, recreational activities, sports events or public meetings.
Discussion and conclusions:
A nationwide investigation was conducted in response to the report of
3 unexpected deaths in young and middle aged adults. The
investigation included enhanced surveillance of acute respiratory
infection, the creation of an ad hoc national surveillance system for
myocarditis/pericarditis, and focused laboratory studies.
Syndromic reporting of myocarditis/pericarditis following suspected
viral infection began on 18 Apr 2002, but cases treated in the past
one to two months were also reported. Less coverage and sensitivity
of reporting is expected for retrospectively reported cases, but it
is likely that reporting is comparable for cases with onset of
respiratory symptoms since 1 Apr 2002. Despite the lack of background
data, it seems that there was an increase in cases of
myocarditis/pericarditis preceded by URTI in Apr 2002, which is now
declining.
Existing evidence indicates that the incidence of upper respiratory
tract infection is not increasing in Greece. Data on hospital or
physician visits for URTI after 14-15 Apr 2002 should be interpreted
with caution, because of the large media attention given to the
incident.
The clinical presentation of the cases of myocarditis/pericarditis is
compatible with a myotropic viral infection (ref. 1), but
microbiological results are still preliminary. It is unclear whether
surveillance detected an outbreak or a seasonal increase (ref. 2).
Analysis of the additional epidemiological and laboratory data that
is expected should enable further conclusions to be drawn. According
to the available evidence, the situation is stable, but surveillance
will continue for some time.

[The EuroSurveillance report contains graphical presentation of the
available data in the form of 5 figures. The original article should
be consulted for further information, but in the Moderator's view the
data suggest that a small increase in URTI with associated
complications has been exaggerated by exceptional media attention. -
