Canadian Surveillance Data 2005 (as of Sat 3 Sep 2005, wk 35)
West Nile Virus National Surveillance Report
-------------------------------------------
28 Aug 2005 - 3 Sep 2005 (Week 35)
Human:
During week 35, 41 West Nile virus (WNV) cases were reported in
Canada [Quebec (3), Ontario (18), Manitoba (9), Saskatchewan (10) and
Alberta (1)].
As of 3 Sep 2005, a total of 127 human WNV cases have been reported
to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Of these cases, 119
were clinical cases and 8 were asymptomatic. Of the 119 clinical
cases, 27 (23 percent) were reported as West Nile Neurological
Syndrome, 66 (56 percent) were reported as West Nile Non-Neurological
Syndrome, and 26 (22 percent) were Unclassified/Unspecified. 13 cases
are travel-related. To date, there have been 3 deaths [Manitoba (1)
and Ontario (2)] related to WNV infection.
Bird:
During week 35, 147 dead birds were tested and 39 (27 percent) were
reported positive for WNV (see bird table). No new health units
reported dead birds positive for WNV within week 35. A total of 3554
dead birds have been tested since 2 May 2005, of which 365 (10
percent) were positive for WNV. Of the 365 positive birds, 276 (76
percent) were identified as American Crow and 88 (24 percent) of them
were identified as Blue Jay.
Domestic Animal:
As of week 35, 7 horses positive for WNV were reported in Manitoba
(3) and Saskatchewan (4).
Mosquito:
As of week 35 548 mosquito pools positive for WNV were reported in
Alberta (1), Saskatchewan (87), Manitoba (190), Ontario (224) and
Quebec (46). National West Nile virus surveillance data and maps can
be found on the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) web site at:

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional
whether or not state health departments report these cases to CDC
[further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and
West Nile fever are available at the URL above].
"Other Clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC -- These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan 2005 and 13
Sep 2005 that have been reported to ArboNet by state and local health
departments. ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system
established by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and
other mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2005
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 1299 cases, 497 (38 percent) were reported as West Nile
meningitis or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 724 (56 percent)
were reported as West Nile fever (milder disease), and 78 (6 percent)
were clinically unspecified at this time. Please refer to state
health department web sites for further details regarding state case
totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among
reported cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance
reporting bias. Serious cases are more likely to be reported than
mild cases. Also, the surveillance system is not designed to detect
asymptomatic infections. Data from population-based surveys indicate
that among all people who become infected with West Nile virus
(including people with asymptomatic infections) less than 1 percent
will develop severe neuroinvasive disease.

[3] USA, New York - case number update

3 New Yorkers have fallen ill to the West Nile virus -- the 1st human
cases in the city in 2005. All 3 people were hospitalized. Only one
of them, a 44-year-old Queens resident, remains in the hospital, city
Health Department officials said last night.
The other two, ages 61 and 68, are recovering at home. Their names
and gender were not revealed.
"We have seen increased mosquito activity in parts of the Bronx,
Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island," said Health Commissioner Thomas
Frieden. He urged all New Yorkers, especially people over 50, to use
mosquito repellent, wear long sleeves, and take other precautions to
avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes.
A man who was reported in July to be the 1st West Nile case of the
year turned out not to have the virus, officials said.

2 Douglas County residents were added as the 4th and 5th Kansas human
West Nile Virus cases in 2005, state health officials announced
Tuesday.
A 61-year-old and an 82-year-old, both from Douglas County,
experienced symptoms of the virus in late August. Test results
convinced officials the 61-year-old was a probable case. The
82-year-old was a confirmed case, according to the Kansas Department
of Health and Environment.
The KDHE did not further identify the patients because of
confidentiality rules, Sharon Watson, a KDHE spokeswoman, said.
A 51-year-old Douglas County man in June was declared the state's and
nation's 1st human case for 2005 by the KDHE and the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
Officials continue to warn about protection from mosquito bites, as
the virus has been found in Anderson, Barton, Crawford, Decatur,
Douglas, Ellis, Johnson, Mitchell, Reno, Rice, Stafford, Trego and
Wallace counties this year.
