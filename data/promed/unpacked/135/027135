Cholera outbreak in Kapilvastu, Nepal
----------------------------------------
The Nepal Ministry of Health and Population reported a cholera outbreak in Krishnanagar Municipality in Kapilvastu in the western terai [lowland region] part of Nepal. So far, 885 people have been infected with the diarrheal disease in Krishnanagar Municipality.

_Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa serotype was confirmed in stool samples of the patients. A total of 4 people [3 children and 1 adult male] have died during the 1st week of October 2021.

Nepal is also a cholera endemic country as cases of infection of the disease are detected every year. Cholera is a disease spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with cholera bacteria. Severe cholera is characterized by large amounts of watery diarrhea, often described as "rice-water stool" because it can have a pale, milky appearance. It can also be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. If untreated, the loss of fluid can be deadly. But simple treatment, including replacing lost body fluids, can lower the risk of death to less than 1%.

[As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and therefore are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, had been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes -- Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima -- each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba contains antigens A and C; and Hikojima contains antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

Kapilvastu is in Lumbini province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbini_Province) in the southcentral part of the country. - Mod.LL]
