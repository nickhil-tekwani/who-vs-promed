Grower may face huge fine
------------------------------
The company at the center of Queensland's citrus canker crisis could be
fined up to USD 1.1 million if found guilty of intentionally breaching
Australia's strict quarantine rules. The rules prohibit importing plant or
animal material into the country for commercial advantage. Government
inspectors will destroy thousands of orange trees that have been silently
spreading citrus canker on Evergreen Farms' Emerald property for months.
About 8000 trees were sprayed yesterday [Sun 11 Jul 2004] to enable them to
be bulldozed and burnt.
Primary Industries Minister Henry Palaszczuk said yesterday [Sun 11 Jul
2004] that inspectors were trying to trace the cause of the outbreak and
determine whether the disease had spread outside the property. While
companies can be fined up to USD 1.1 million for quarantine breaches,
individuals face a penalty of USD 220 000 or 10 years in jail.
Unintentional breaching of the rules can bring individuals fines of USD 66
000 and companies USD 330 000.
A spokesman for federal Agriculture Minister Warren Truss said samples had
been collected from the property by the Australian Quarantine and
Inspection Service, and, would probably be sent overseas for DNA testing.
The testing would attempt to determine the strain of the bacterium and the
place of origin of the disease.
The property was quarantined on 30 Jun 2004 - 5 days after a consultant
working for the property sent a suspect sample to the Department of Primary
Industries in Rockhampton for assessment. The sample was immediately
forwarded to the DPI laboratories in Brisbane's Yeerongpilly, which, by Tue
29 Jun 2004, had proven that it was a bacterial disease warranting further
tests by experts in NSW.
Suspicions of citrus canker prompted the quarantine order, a subsequent
pest quarantine order for the area, and, additional tests at the AQIS
laboratory at Eagle Farm in Brisbane, which confirmed the disease. A
records check by AQIS found that no import permits have been issued to the
owners of Evergreen Farms.
AQIS staff raided and investigated the property in 2001 following an
anonymous tip-off that the business had allegedly imported plant material,
but, not enough evidence was obtained to warrant prosecution. AQIS
monitored the property for 2 growing seasons after the raid, ending its
surveillance over 15 months ago without finding evidence of any exotic
citrus diseases.
Palaszczuk said 240 000 trees on the property would be inspected -- and up
to 1500 per hectare on surrounding properties -- to help reassure other
states that the outbreak was not widespread. To date, there is no evidence
of any fall in demand.

[Analysis of the genomic properties and genomic sequence of the strain of
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_ [Xac] at the Emerald property would be
invaluable in determining the strain of the bacterium, its origin, and its
relevance to its occurrence worldwide. Annual crop losses attributed to Xac
worldwide are in the millions of dollars. - Mod.DH]
