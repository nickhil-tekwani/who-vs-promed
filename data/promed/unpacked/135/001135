Severe outbreaks of Choanephora blight on green bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_
cvs. Bronco, Shade, & Gold Mine) and bell pepper (_Capsicum annuum_ cvs.
Aristotle, Crusader, & Sentry) were widespread in southwestern (Hendry
and Collier counties) & northern Florida (Alachua County) in October &
November 2002.
Disease incidence, estimated by inspecting 100 randomly selected bean
plants in each of 4 fields, was 40-100 percent and infected fruit ranged
from less than 10 to 100 percent. Incidence estimated similarly on pepper
plants in three fields was 35-40 percent with substantial fruit infection
observed predominantly around the calyx. Zucchini fruit and a pigweed plant
(_Amaranthus_ sp.) were observed with sporulating lesions of _Choanephora_,
indicating that other hosts were affected during the outbreak. Symptoms
were blighted leaves, dieback of shoot tips, blighted blossoms, and black,
soft-rot lesions on fruit. _Choanephora_ sp. was sporulating in abundance
on diseased tissue.
Isolates of _Choanephora_ sp. grew readily as pure cultures on acidified
potato dextrose agar and malt yeast extract (MYE) agar. _C. cucurbitarum_
(Berk. & Rav.) Thaxter was identified on the basis of shape and
ornamentation of the sporangiola (1). The sporangiola of _C. cucurbitarum_
are ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid, and the wall is usually longitudinally
striate.
Pathogenicity tests consisted of spray inoculation (5000 spores per ml) of
5 plants 6 weeks of age, each with and without wounding made by lightly
scratching the leaf surface with a needle. Plants were placed in the
greenhouse with temperatures ranging from 21 to 26 deg C, and symptom
development was observed as early as 3 days after inoculation.
The percentage of infected plants after wounding was 40 percent for bell
pepper ('Enterprise'), 100 percent for green bean ('Opus'), zero percent for
watermelon (_Citrus lanatus_ 'Star Gazer'), 60 percent for cantaloupe
(_Cucumis melo_ 'Vienna'), and 20 percent for cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_
'Thunder CY'). Lesions on inoculated leaves were similar to those seen in
the field on bean and pepper, and sporulation of _C. cucurbitarum_ was
present in the necrotic areas on all symptomatic plants.
Pure cultures of _C. cucurbitarum_ were reisolated. _C. cucurbitarum_ was
observed and isolated from a few uninoculated bean flowers and 2
uninoculated bean pods, indicating spread to uninoculated plants;
otherwise control plants were asymptomatic. Unwounded plants did not
develop lesions, indicating that wounding was necessary for infection by
this inoculation technique.
The mating type was determined by juxtaposing several isolates on MYE agar,
and zygospore formation was observed, indicating that both positive and
negative strains are present in Florida. These outbreaks show that under
the proper environmental conditions, such as long periods of high rainfall,
high humidity, and high temperatures, crops like bean and pepper that are
not usually affected by the disease may experience significant damage.

[_Choanephora cucurbitarum_ is primarily a pathogen of melons, squashes,
and pumpkins. Infection of blossoms and fruits can be high (30-40 percent).
Disease development is favored by warm temperatures (greater than 25C) and
wet weather. The fungus is considered a weak pathogen, and its occurrence on
bean and pepper was probably facilitated by the exceptionally moist
conditions in Florida. For disease management, provide for well-drained
soils, avoid overseeding, and apply fungicides thoroughly in the leaf
canopy. - Mod.DH]
