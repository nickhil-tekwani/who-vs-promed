Officials in Inner Mongolia deny outbreak despite local quarantine alert
-------------------------------------------------
Sheep farmers in the northern border regions of China's Inner Mongolia have
complained of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in their county,
despite insistence by local officials that the disease affecting the feet
of sheep is a form of flu, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reports.
In late 2003, sheep in the Taohai township region of Wuyuan County began to
fall sick with pain in their feet and difficulty walking and eating, and
some newborn sheep died, according to local officials and farmers. But from
that point their accounts diverge.
FMD affects all species of cloven-hoofed animals and can devastate
livestock. Financial losses from the disease can be heavy in terms of
direct losses from deaths in young animals, loss of milk, loss of meat, and
a decrease in productive performance.
"This seems to be a rather bad case of foot-and-mouth," sheep farmer Fanfei
told RFA's Mandarin service. "I don't know how many sheep have died, but
there are a few households in our district which have caught FMD. Some of
the families have worse cases, some are not so bad. Very few of the sheep
actually die, but they can't walk, don't eat, and often are in great pain
throughout their bodies. Sometimes they starve, or die in great pain," he said.
County government officials contacted by RFA confirmed there was an illness
affecting sheep in the area, but they denied it was foot-and-mouth, known
as "illness No.5" among local farmers. "It's not illness No.5. It's a sort
of cold, and inflammation," one official said in a telephone interview.
"Their legs are in slight pain. We've applied some anti-inflammatory
medicine to the area and it cleared up in a couple of days."
Other farmers described sheep with sore hooves and mouths, unable to eat,
and often wasting away as a result of the disease. "Their hooves are
infected," one farmer told RFA. "They're not eating. I have 7 or 8 sheep,
and 3 or 4 are sick."
Another said: "Their feet are painful and their mouths are sore. This is
getting worse and worse." China banned imports of cloven-hoofed animals on
13 Feb 2004, citing outbreaks of FMD in Vietnam and Mongolia. Under
emergency regulations issued by quarantine authorities, pigs, cattle, and
their products are to be sent back or destroyed if they arrive at a Chinese
border from those countries.
Authorities in the city of Erlian (Erenhot), on the Chinese border with
Mongolia, stepped up quarantine and monitoring of the disease to prevent it
from entering China, official media reported last week.
Officials feared the virus, which is harmless to humans but highly
contagious among animals, could be transmitted by wild Mongolian gazelles.
Mongolia reported a suspected outbreak of FMD in its Orgon County on 4 Feb
2004, with the disease spreading rapidly to neighboring counties around 100
kilometers (60 miles) from the Chinese border. Mongolian officials also
suspected antelopes as animal conveyors of the disease, which has killed at
least 100 cattle there.
Across the border, Inner Mongolian farmers said they had heard radio
broadcasts about preventative measures against FMD, but they told RFA that
Chinese officials had done nothing about it yet. "There was a radio
broadcast to Wuyuan county saying we should take preventative measures,"
one sheep farmer in the area said by telephone. "They were supposed to
inoculate them, but they didn't come to give the injections, so what sort
of immunization program is that?"
A Wuyuan County official contacted by telephone declined to comment on any
preventive measures the government might take, saying, "We are very busy
right now." Another official responded that "We are in the process of
administering medication."
Fanfei, the farmer, urged the government to take action before the disease
spreads further. "So far it hasn't spread very far. It has been confined to
a relatively small area. We hope the government can start a prevention
program as soon as possible. We farmers have to pay an inoculation fee of 5
yuan every year. They come once a year to spray disinfectant, which costs 1
yuan. So what are they doing with the rest of the money?"
