Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: On [7 Feb 2017], a batch of ducks (3787 heads) originating from 1 of the farms under intensified surveillance in Hualien County was intercepted in an abattoir located in Yilan County. The duck farm is under intensified surveillance because it is within the 3 km [approx 1.86 mi] radius of 1 dead young goose positive for H5N6 that was reported on [6 Feb 2016]. The ducks were transported to Yilan County on [6 Feb 2017], 1 day ahead of the entry into force of the ban on the dispatch of waterfowls of Hualien County to other regions of the country. The carcasses of the ducks intercepted in the abattoir were sampled and tested using RT-PCR and gene sequence analysis by the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI). H5N6 and H5N2 subtypes HPAI were detected and confirmed by the AHRI on [11 Feb 2017]. All of the 3787 carcasses were condemned and destroyed, and thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted in the abattoir. The farm of origin has been sampled for testing. The intensified surveillance zone has been enlarged to 5 km [approx 3.1 mi] radius surrounding the index farm. Sampling is underway and will be completed as soon as possible in order to detect any spreading of the viruses. These control measures will be imposed on the area for at least 3 months and will be lifted only after the confirmation of the elimination of the viruses.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection/disinfestation; quarantine; stamping out; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result:
Birds / gene sequencing / 11 Feb 2017 / Positive
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 10 Feb 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
