[The above notification may have been triggered by the recent submission by Dr Shamsudeen Fagbo, circulated in ProMED-mail's posting 20121002.1320026, which included concerning data on about 8 people who have died of suspected rabies in the past 4 months in Cross River. According to Dr Fagbo's information, the suspected dogs' heads have been forwarded to the NVRI [National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom, Nigeria] for confirmatory laboratory diagnosis. His alarming information was accompanied by Mod.CP's commentary, which concluded: "Information on the outcome of the confirmatory diagnostic tests is awaited." The current immediate notification does not include the results and details of laboratory investigations.

According to Nigeria's reports to the OIE, the annual number of reported rabies cases in dogs were the following: 2007 -- 2; 2008 -- 23; 2009 -- 24; 2010 -- 5; 2011 -- 11; during the 1st 6 months of 2012 -- 6 cases. Cases were reported from Cross River only during 2011; this may be indicative of underreporting.

Human rabies cases were reported to the OIE every year without quantitative data.

Subscribers are referred to Dr Fagbo's significant observations. - Mod.AS
