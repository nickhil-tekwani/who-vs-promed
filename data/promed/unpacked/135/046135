A Rockville (MD) company is recalling all packages of a food product because of potential salmonella contamination. Indonesianfoodmart.com announced the recall of Tempeh Starter Yeast and Super Starter Yeast on Tue 22 May 2012. The products were distributed nationwide and abroad.

The product was imported from Indonesia. It comes in sealed, clear, plastic packages marked with a small computer-printed label. The sizes sold are 30 gm, 50 gm, 250 gm, and 1000 gm.

The company said in an email that several illnesses have been reported in connection with the starter yeast. The potential for contamination was noted after testing by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services showed the presence of [the same] salmonella in some of the product.

Tests concluded last week that a food ingredient distributed by a Maryland company was the source of the outbreak that had sickened at least 62 Buncombe County residents. The total number of reported cases linked to the outbreak was 83 as of late last week [and now up to 87 in total - Mod.LL].

The Rockville, Maryland company, Tempeh Online, sold the starter culture to Smiling Hara Tempeh, which made the meat substitute in Candler.

[Although not all the reported cases in this outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B (probably the d-tartrate fermenting variant _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ serovar Paratyphi B dT+, sometimes referred to as _S._ Java) are Asheville area residents, as far as this moderator is aware, all the cases are linked to tempeh ingested in Buncombe County. It is important to note, however, that the product, imported from Indonesia, was much more widely distributed than just western North Carolina. - Mod.LL
