Campground closed after ground squirrel tests positive for plague
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Los Angeles County public health and US Forest Service officials have
closed the Los Alamos Campground in the Angeles National Forest after
a California ground squirrel captured 2 weeks ago tested positive for
plague.

The camp, between Gorman and Pyramid Lake, was closed Saturday
afternoon [3 Jul 2010] and will remain closed for at least 10 days,
said Jonathan Fielding, the county's public health director. Squirrel
burrows in the area will be dusted for fleas, and further testing
will be conducted before the campground is reopened.

[The causative bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ is transmitted to people
through fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when
infected, are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas.
They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially
cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea
treatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some
products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for
an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your
veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and
puppies, even resulting in fatalities.
