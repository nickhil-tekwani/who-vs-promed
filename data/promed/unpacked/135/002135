Suspected Case of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Near Cape Town
----------------------------------------------------------------
An employee at the Maitland abattoir near Cape Town is being treated at
Groote Schuur Hospital for suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF), and on Monday [12 Feb 2001 was reported to be in a stable
condition. The Hospital and the Western Cape Department of Health said in a
joint statement that the patient was admitted to the hospital last weekend.
[Tests on blood samples sent to the National Institute for Virology in
Johannesburg, to be tested for CCHF, had so far been inconclusive. The
final results should be known by Tuesday.
Groote Schuur Hospital is treating this as a case of CCHF and the patient
has been placed in isolation. About 90 people who came into contact with
the patient after he became ill on 2 Jan 2001, including 15 family members
and close friends, and hospital workers who treated him, are being
monitored for developments but so far, no one has displayed any symptoms of
the fever.

[The length of time between onset of illness and admission to hospital is
unusual. CCHF is normally considered to have an incubation period of
between 3 and 12 days after exposure to infected ticks. - Mod.CP
