Today [11 Mar 2022] in The Lancet, researchers say excess deaths data indicate that the global death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic may be more than 3 times higher than officially recorded (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02796-3). While official counts from countries vary, an estimated 5.9 million COVID-19 deaths were recorded globally in 2020 and 2021. The Lancet study compared that number to weekly or monthly data on deaths from all causes in those 2 years and up to 11 years prior from 74 countries and 266 states and provinces, using government websites, the World Mortality Database, Human Mortality Database, and European Statistical Office.

Excess mortality was calculated as observed mortality minus expected mortality. The authors also excluded weekly death tolls during times of anomalies, such as heat waves, from their calculations.

They estimate that the global COVID-19 death toll is closer to 18.2 million, and the excess death rate caused by the virus is 120 per 100 000 population globally. Some countries may have more than 300 excess deaths per 100 000 population.

The study showed stark regional differences in excess deaths, with the highest rates seen in Andean Latin America (512 deaths per 100 000 population), eastern Europe (345 deaths per 100 000), central Europe (316 deaths per 100 000), southern Africa (309 deaths per 100 000), and Central America (274 deaths per 100 000). But several territories outside these regions, including parts of Asia and several southern US states, also had high rates.

The authors said the highest estimated excess deaths at a country level occurred in India (4.1 million), the United States (1.1 million), Russia (1.1 million), Mexico (798 000), Brazil (792 000), Indonesia (736 000), and Pakistan (664 000). Together these countries accounted for almost half of the COVID-19 deaths seen in the past 2 years.

"Our findings indicate that the full impact of the pandemic has been much greater than what is suggested by official statistics," the authors said.

The countries with the fewest excess deaths were Iceland (48 fewer deaths per 100 000), Australia (38 fewer deaths per 100 000), and Singapore (16 fewer deaths per 100 000).

"Understanding the true death toll from the pandemic is vital for effective public health decision-making. Studies from several countries, including Sweden and the Netherlands, suggest COVID-19 was the direct cause of most excess deaths, but we currently don't have enough evidence for most locations," said lead study author Haidong Wang, PhD, of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, in a Lancet press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/945949).

"Further research will help to reveal how many deaths were caused directly by COVID-19, and how many occurred as an indirect result of the pandemic." The authors of the study also suggest that the huge gap between official death counts and the estimate provided from excess mortality counts points to a need to strengthen death registration systems around the world.

China's COVID-19 cases today [11 Mar 2022] continue to rise to their highest levels since February 2020, with the capital of Jilin province, Changchun, now on lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. China today [11 Mar 2022] reported 1100 new cases, 703 of them listed as asymptomatic, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). The country is among the few with a "zero COVID" policy but is struggling with the much more transmissible omicron variant.

The city of Changchun, with a population of 9 million, is under lockdown as mass testing of all citizens begins, according to Kyodo News, a news service based in Japan. About 70 cases in the city have been confirmed this month [March 2022] (https://bit.ly/3t7TlsA).

Of today's [11 Mar 2022] new cases, 246 were in Jilin province, including 23 in Changchun. All but 2 infections from the city today [11 Mar 2022] were asymptomatic, according to the NHC. Elsewhere in China, the Shandong province city of Yucheng, home to 500 000 people, is also on lockdown, according to NPR [National Public Radio] (https://n.pr/3Ja24jd).

Hong Kong's surge continues, with 31 402 new cases today [11 Mar 2022], according to the Centre for Health Protection. The area's outbreak has come with a spike in deaths, especially in older people, that is overwhelming local mortuary services (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202203/10/P2022031000650.htm).

Leaders today [11 Mar 2022] announced that vaccination efforts will focus on older people and children, according to Reuters. Seniors in Hong Kong have had low vaccination uptake. Officials have also said they will focus resources on older people (https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2L80DN).

In other global developments:
- The latest COVID infection survey from the UK Office for National Statistics said the number of people testing positive for the virus increased last week across all of UK nations. The rise reflects an increase in those ages 25 and older, with levels declining in children. The small overall rise in the countries also came with a rise in omicron BA.2 subvariant infections. Hospitalizations were up across all age-groups (https://bit.ly/3vZMH9k).
- The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has added a delta-omicron recombinant, which has a delta backbone and a mostly omicron BA.1 spike, to its variants under monitoring. It said a few cases have been detected in Denmark, France, and the Netherlands (https://bit.ly/3KEWiqa).
- Japan-based Fujifilm today [11 Mar 2022] announced that it has halted enrollment in the phase 3 trial of favipiravir as a treatment for COVID-19 because with milder illnesses from omicron, it would be difficult to assess the drug's impact on severe disease (https://www.fujifilm.com/jp/en/news/hq/7721).

[B] Pfizer vaccine

Receiving 2 doses of Pfizer vaccine showed moderate to good protection in 2 age-groups of children, researchers reported today [11 Mar 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). They based their findings on an ongoing cohort survey that tracks infections in children ages 6 months to 17 years in 4 states (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7111e1).

For children ages 5-11, vaccine effectiveness was moderate, at 31% for prevention of symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. For kids ages 12-15, the vaccine doses were 59% effective.

Researchers said wide and overlapping confidence intervals suggest the estimates might not be significantly different and are similar to a recent vaccine effectiveness report of 45%-51% against emergency department and urgent care visits for omicron infections across the 2 age-groups.

The authors said kids infected with omicron despite having received 2 vaccine doses spent an average of one-half day less in bed than unvaccinated study participants. "All eligible children and adolescents should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations," they wrote.

In other US developments:
- White House officials yesterday [10 Mar 2022] warned that key pandemic programs could run out of funds if Congress doesn't quickly authorize USD 15.6 billion in new funding for the efforts, according to Politico (https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/10/more-covid-aid-uncertain-00016212).
- The Transportation Security Agency yesterday [10 Mar 2022] announced that the mask requirement for planes and public transportation will be extended through 18 Apr 2022, according to the Associated Press. The rule was originally set to end next week, on 18 Mar 2022 (https://bit.ly/3pYW4CD).
- Nursing home resident COVID-19 booster rates in about one-third of US states lag the national average, with 3 states -- Florida, Arizona, and Nevada -- yet to reach an average of 60% boosted in each facility, according to ABC News (https://abcn.ws/3w1ActW).

A global total of 6451 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 9 Mar 2022 to late 10 Mar 2022).

A total of 58 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 34 of the 58 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region. There has been an overall increase in the global trends for cases, with a decreasing trend in deaths.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 8.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 10.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 28.6% decrease in daily reported cases and a 15.3% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report registered over 1.74 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 455.51 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.05 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA
