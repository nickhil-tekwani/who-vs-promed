A total of 7 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever have been
confirmed in Hardin County, but officials have yet to attribute the
death of a Southern Illinois resident to the tick-borne illness.

"There was a death and that person was diagnosed with Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, but we cannot say yet that the death was attributable
to the fever," Melaney Arnold, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department
of Public Health, said. The person was a resident in one of the
counties served by the Southern Seven Health Department, which serves
Hardin, Alexander, Johnson, Massac, Pope, Pulaski, and Union counties.

Arnold said the Hardin County diagnoses are among the 47 cases of the
fever confirmed statewide. She could not say whether any of the other
40 cases were diagnosed in Southern Illinois. Other cases are
suspected, she said, but are pending confirmation.

"We know it's been in Southern Illinois for a while, but the number
of cases in the counties vary from year to year" she said.

While Hardin County has reported only one case each of the past 2
years [2006, 2007], Williamson County reported 5 last year [2007],
she said. Early treatment is vital to overcoming the illness she
added.

"There is a 3 to 5 percent mortality rate overall, but it can range
from 13 to 25 percent in those who go untreated," Arnold said.

[It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to
minimize morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true in areas
such as the Midwestern USA where the disease is uncommon. The time
frame in this case is not clear.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing
human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from
grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After
crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site
(wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she
attaches and begins to feed.

After attaching, it generally takes as many as 24 hours to activate
and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or
twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease
transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or
beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick
exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is
generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the
headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in
day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles
before becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles
as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not
seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low
if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days
of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people
with compatible symptoms, inhabiting endemic areas, during the spring
and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick), a common
vector for this infection can be seen at
