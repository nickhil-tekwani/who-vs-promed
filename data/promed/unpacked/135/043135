Syphilis is on the rise in Pima County [AZ]. As of October 2021, 133 female cases have been reported; 25 of those involved pregnancy. Taking a look at 2020 for comparison, a total of 131 cases were reported among females; 27 of those patients reported being pregnant.

The factors that go into the high rates, according to the Pima County Health Department [see below], include incarceration, reinfection, drug use, and homelessness during pregnancy. Those are the primary reasons for infections among congenital syphilis mothers and heterosexual men.

According to the CDC, men account for the most cases of syphilis (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/figures/SYPH-2.htm).

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease that can be cured with the right treatment. Symptoms may include a painless sore that appears inside or near the mouth, genital or anus, or a rash that appears on the palms of hands, bottom of feet, or on the body between the armpits and upper thighs.

Information and confidential testing [are] available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at several local clinics, and walk-ins are welcome [Pima County Health Department].

As of October 2021, provisional number of cases in Pima County has reached 432 cases; these numbers include newly acquired infections [primary and secondary syphilis] and syphilis of unknown duration [latent syphilis and tertiary syphilis], in all genders.

Pima County is experiencing an increase in the number of syphilis cases among females. As of October 2021, 133 female cases have been reported, 25 of those involving pregnancy. In 2020, a total of 131 cases were reported in females; 27 reported pregnancies.

History of incarceration, reinfection, drug use, and homelessness during pregnancy are prominent themes among congenital syphilis mothers and heterosexual men.

From 2018-2019, cases of congenital syphilis in Arizona nearly doubled and are on track to increase again this year (2018, 63 [cases of congenital syphilis]; 2019, 109; 2020, 117; Jan-April 2021, 53). [Since 2015, the yearly average of syphilis cases in women in Arizona increased 449%; between 2016 and 2019, the number of babies born with syphilis doubled each year. In 2020, of 118 babies born with syphilis, 9 died. In 2021, so far, of 88 babies born with syphilis, 5 have died (https://webcms.pima.gov/cms/One.aspx?portalId=169&pageId=136859).]

A similar trend is occurring in Pima County; in 2019 there were 7 cases, in 2020 there were 11 cases, and thus far in 2021 there are 20 cases.

These local trends reflect a nationwide increase of cases among women and newborns. From 2018 to 2019 alone, the CDC reports that rates of syphilis increased by 30% among women and by 41.4% among newborns (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis).
