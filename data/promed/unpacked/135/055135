Eastern equine [encephalitis], Ecuador
--------------------------------------
An outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis has been reported in Ecuador. The situation affects the entire country and reportedly began on 25 Feb 2013.

In this "immediate notification" 2 new outbreaks are reported from Guayas province: the 1st, with a start date of 25 Feb 2013, involving a Peruvian Paso mare, for leisure purposes in a farm with 8 susceptible horses; and the 2nd, with a start date of 2 Mar 2013, affecting a Spanish foal for leisure purposes, in a farm with 18 susceptible animals.

While the source of the outbreaks is unknown or inconclusive, both "farms are near a dam for irrigation, where there is the presence of wild animals."

The apparent morbidity rate is 7.69 percent in this ongoing situation.

IgM-capture ELISA performed on 29 May 2013 by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL)-US Department of Agriculture (USDA) (OIE's reference laboratory) resulted positive.

Vaccination of horses is part of the response plan for this outbreak and measures applied include control of arthropods.
