Disease vectoring corn leafhopper again threatens corn crop
As the corn leafhopper continues to spread the corn stunt pathogen to
California's Central Valley, several evaluated insecticides have only a
short-term effect, suggesting that other measures, including a corn-free
period, have more potential for success.
Charles G. Summers, University of California entomologist at the Kearney
Research and Education Center, Parlier, says a corn-free period, from Oct.
31 to April 1, would help in management of the leafhopper.
The most important step for the time being is for growers to destroy
volunteer corn plants that provide the insect, capable of overwintering in
the valley, a bridge to infest the next crop.
Several commonly used insecticides provided control in his trials, but only
for relatively brief periods ranging from 10 - 30 days.
Developing plant resistance to the corn stunt pathogen is another potential
defense but will take time.
Taking yet another approach, Summers and others found in preliminary - but
as yet inconclusive - studies that corn plants grown over a mulch of wheat
straw for a month after planting had reduced populations of corn leafhoppers.
Mulch trials also showed one-third the incidence of corn stunt disease and
25 percent more yield compared to plants on bare soil. Summers suggests
that the mulch might be used to repel aphids and whiteflies, as well as
leafhoppers.
Summers and a team of several farm advisors and UC specialists surveyed
valley counties with sticky traps and D-vac sweeps in 2002 and confirmed
the leafhopper can successfully overwinter in these counties. Observations
are continuing this year.
According to Summers, while leafhopper damage can impair yield and quality,
the disease poses the greater threat.
Corn stunt is caused by a bacterial organism, _Spiroplasma kunkelii_ [Sk].
Beyond stunting of plants, it causes production of multiple ears that fail
to fill. In the fall, leaves in the upper portion of infected plants take
on a reddish color.
The corn leafhopper [_Dalbulus maidis_] is common throughout the
southeastern and southwestern U.S. Brownish or tan in color and less than
one-eighth of an inch long, it is the only vector of corn stunt disease in
California.
Summers said the leafhopper, or something very like it, was first reported
in Fresno and Tulare counties in 1942 and a disease fitting the description
of S. kunkelii was recorded a few years later.
Corn stunt is now found from Los Angeles County to Yolo County. Outbreaks
once lasted only 1 or 2 years and were blamed on leafhoppers migrating from
Mexico, but since 1996 they have been annual events with increasing
severity in the southern San Joaquin Valley.
The disease formerly was seen mostly in corn planted after July but later
showed up in fields planted in April or May. "This suggests to me that both
the insect and the disease were overwintering in the San Joaquin Valley,"
Summers said.
The leafhopper has no diapause period and during winter cold it is
inactive, only to resume flight when temperatures reach about 55 F.
Leafhoppers are present from October Into March on riparian areas, alfalfa,
weeds and triticale.
Summers said a "real key" to managing the leafhopper is destroying
volunteer corn that provides the bridge between seasons. After corn has
been cut, thousands of volunteer seedlings emerge, serving as hosts for the
insect vector over the winter. In August and September, as chopping
intensifies, younger fields catch the full impact of the leafhopper movement.
Even though some corn was frozen back, significant numbers found shelter
enough in remaining intact whorls. They were discovered in Kings County in
February on residue ears that had started to sprout.
Global imaging system surveys analyzed by University of California
scientists in 2001-2002 showed heaviest and earliest infestations around
the Lemoore area of Kings County, confirming earlier observations on the
ground.
However, the same surveys from 2002 through July of 2003 identified a shift
of hot spots of leafhopper populations to Tulare County as pressure
continued in Kings County.
Tulare County farm advisor Carol Frate said corn stunt appears to be
scattered throughout the county and she expects that since much of the
acreage is late corn, the problem will worsen by the end of the season.
"It's been increasing since 1996-97 and some fields had a 50 percent
reduction in yield. We can see the insect in corn but we don't know what
the loss will be. Unfortunately, we have a lot of late corn this year, and
those fields are most at risk," she said.

[Corn stunt disease [CSD] is of significant economic importance in a number
of Latin American countries. It occurs from the southern U.S. states to
Brazil and Peru. Sk and the maize bushy stunt phytoplasma [MBSP]together
with Maize rayado fino virus constitute the CSD complex. Using a PCR assay
for Sk, the pathogen was found in El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama.
Significant yield reductions can follow from dual infections of Sk and
MBSP. Disease management depends heavily on cultural practices (disking
fields containing volunteer corn, herbicide applications to eradicate
alfalfa). In California, all current commercial cultivars of field and
sweet corn are susceptible. Generally, insecticides are ineffective in
controlling CSD.
