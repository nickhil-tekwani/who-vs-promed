During the current epidemiological week, 1282 dengue fever cases were
diagnosed, and 72 of them were dengue hemorrhagic fever (5.6 percent), and
the dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever ratio is 17/1.
Cumulated case toll for 2005 is 27 820 cases, 6.1 percent of them are
hemorrhagic dengue fever (1694 cases), and the dengue fever/dengue
hemorrhagic fever ratio is 15/1.
Cumulated morbidity rate is 104.7 per 100 000 inhabitants. Circulating
serotypes are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Cumulated case toll for the period had a 23.3
percent increase compared to the cumulated case number for the same date in
2004.
In this week there have been no deaths caused by dengue.
There was a 4.8 percent descent in the number of cases compared to the
figures for last week, but the case toll corresponds to an epidemic (see
the endemic channel).
Persons less than 15 years old constitute 51.8 percent of all reported
cases, and persons from 15 to 24 years old are the 2nd most affected group,
with 20.9 percent of all cases.
Federal Entities reporting the highest numbers of cases are as follows:
Carabobo (185), M ida (165), Miranda (129), Capital District (87), and
Trujillo (82).

The death toll from Singapore's worst dengue fever outbreak on record has
risen to 11 with total cases in 2005 now approaching 11 000, the health
ministry said.
A 39-year-old mother of 3 suffering from diabetes became the 11th fatality
from the mosquito-borne tropical disease this year in Singapore, local
media reported Monday.
The Straits Times newspaper said she died Friday at the National University
Hospital, and was a permanent resident originally from Malaysia.
Singapore, better known overseas for its emphasis on cleanliness, has
launched an all-out campaign to eradicate mosquito breeding grounds, but
press reports Monday said new cases had reached a record high for a single
week.
A total of 714 new cases were reported in the week ending 24 Sep 2005, on
top of 10 200 cumulative cases previously reported, local media said. The
health ministry said official statistics were scheduled for release later
Monday.
Puzzled by their inability to stem the outbreak, Singapore authorities have
engaged foreign and local experts to study the dengue crisis and advise the
government on the best strategy to deal with the problem.
Singapore has 4.2 million people packed densely into an island that imposes
penalties for littering and failing to remove stagnant water in private
homes, and once penalized people for failing to flush toilets.
The government is spending 30 million Singapore dollars (18 million US) to
fight dengue and has been waging a "search and destroy" campaign against
potential mosquito breeding areas for the past two weeks.
Construction sites used to be the main source of dengue-carrying Aedes
mosquitoes, but private homes are now the main culprit, officials say.

An epidemic of dengue [hemorrhagic] fever [DHF] has killed 2 people in the
French Caribbean island of Martinique this month, and more than 6000 have
been infected, medical authorities said Monday.
Since mid-September 2005, the rate of new cases has increased to almost
1000 a week, said Jacques Rosine, a doctor at the Antilles-Guyane
Inter-Regional Epidemiology Center in Martinique. "The epidemic is not
calming down. It is gaining ground," he said.
More than 60 people have been hospitalized, 3 of them with a severe form of
the disease [DHF], which often causes internal bleeding.
The disease -- characterized by high fever, chills, headaches, aching
joints, bright red rashes and prostration -- is common in tropical areas
and endemic to parts of Asia and the Caribbean. There is no vaccine and the
only treatment is bed rest, fluids and fever-reducing medication.
A 60-year-old woman died 10 Sep 2005 of cerebral hemorrhage. A 30-year-old
woman died 22 Sep, of complications of an earlier illness brought on by the
fever, the Martinique Health and Social Development Bureau reported.
In Guadeloupe, a French Caribbean island north of Martinique, more than 700
cases have been reported since the beginning of August 2005. There are
about 100 new cases every week now, said the Health Surveillance Institute,
a government epidemiology center.
To prevent the disease from spreading, authorities have intensified their
campaign to eradicate stagnant water, Rosine said.
Dengue fever comes from a virus carried by the striped _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito, which breeds in puddles and such water-filled containers as
flowerpots and old automobile tires. The incubation period is usually 5-8 days.
The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 100 million people
worldwide are infected with dengue each year, with a death rate of about 5
percent.

[Martinique is a small island in the Caribbean about 1100 square km, a
population of 390 000, and is part of the French West Indies (FWI) with
Saint Martin and La Guadeloupe. There are 32 towns, but the main city is
Fort de France, on the east side of the island. There are 2 main seasons:
the dry season (from February to August) and the rainy season (from
September to January). The hurricane season goes from July to September and
usually ends in the middle of August, though hurricanes are still possible
in September (even October 2004 with Joseph). The rainy season has just
begun and with it the island's dengue season. - Mod.RY]

A Malaysian housewife pregnant [for the 1st time] with twins has died after
contracting dengue fever, pushing the nationwide death toll from the
mosquito-borne disease this year to 70, news reports said Monday.
The 26-year-old woman died at a government hospital in the northern Penang
state on Saturday after experiencing a high fever for 3 days, the New
Straits Times reported. Her 7-month [twin] fetuses also did not survive.
She was the 3rd person to die from the virus in 2005 in Penang state and
the 70th [death] nationwide.
Penang state health officials were not immediately available for comment.
In southern Negeri Sembilan state, authorities reported that 5 people have
so far died due to a dengue fever outbreak and more than 42 cases were
detected last week, a 2-fold increase compared to the preceding week, the
national news agency Bernama reported.
Health officials have earlier said that they were battling to control an
outbreak of dengue, which has infected more than 7000 people across the
country so far this year.
Negeri Sembilan's chief minister Mohamad Hassan blamed villagers and
farmers for the problem, saying they failed to keep abandoned buildings and
mosques clean and that the structures later became breeding grounds for
mosquitos, Bernama reported.
The illness causes severe fever and can lead to vomiting, nausea and a body
rash. Dengue fever can also cause severe pain in the joints, and some
strains of the virus cause internal bleeding.
The U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention has called dengue this
year's "most important mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans" --
ahead of malaria and encephalitis -- with an estimated 2.5 billion people
at risk worldwide.
World Health Organization officials have said Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand,
the Philippines, and Singapore all had a large number of dengue cases this
year and have scrambled to curtail the spread of the disease.

[The death of the pregnant Malaysian woman -- likely a case of DHF, though
not specified in the news -- and her unborn twins is indeed tragic. The
news has aroused a public awareness to the point that the health
authorities and the residents of the affected area may be more willing to
gear up on eradicating the mosquito breeding grounds. Usually use of
fogging machines alone is not as effective at getting rid of mosquitoes as
a public campaign and good political leadership. - Mod.RY]
