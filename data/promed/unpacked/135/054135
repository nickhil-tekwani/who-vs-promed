One more child in Hong Kong has contracted [enterovirus 71 = EV-71, which
has killed more than 50 children in Taiwan, bringing the number of
confirmed cases to 11, health department spokesman said Saturday. The
spokesman said 11 cases of EV-71 had been confirmed and 16 cases were
listed as suspected ones pending laboratory test confirmation. All the
patients in Hong Kong had recovered.
Following the appearance of the virus, the government set up a task force
toward the end of June to monitor hand-foot-mouth disease, one of the
manifestations of EV-71. In Taiwan, health authorities announced at the
start of the month that the death toll from [EV-71 since May had reached
55 with the death of a 2-year-old girl. The virus usually strikes children
under 5, and the Hong Kong interdepartmental working group has decided to
step up publicity and education about the disease in nurseries and
kindergartens over the summer.

The enterovirus 71 [EV-71 discovered in Hong Kong shows no evidence of
mutation and is not deadly, says the Department of Health. Two more cases
were confirmed, bringing to 10 the number of confirmed cases, while
suspected cases rose to 16.
Acting Director of Health Dr. Paul Saw Thian-aun yesterday told members of
the health services panel the administration would be buying
gene-sequencing equipment to check against any mutation. But panel
vice-chairman Dr. Leong Che-hung criticised the administration for being
slow to react, saying it had failed to learn from previous incidents, like
bird flu.
"Cases were detected in Taiwan in May, but Hong Kong began to have tests
only in June. Why have you waited so long? You know these viruses could
come very fast," Dr. Leong said.
But Dr. Saw denied the administration had delayed and that it had already
stepped up inspections and surveillance to monitor the hand, foot and mouth
disease related to the virus.
Dr. Saw said that from Wednesday, 93 per cent of all child care centres and
30 per cent of kindergartens had been inspected and that there was little
justification for any closures.
Dr. Ko Wing-man, deputy director of operations at the Hospital Authority,
said it was more concerned about mutations of bird flu since it was a new
virus.
The causes of enterovirus could be studied through previous case analyses,
Dr. Ko said.

[I take responsibility for posting these messages. The latter sounds as
much political as medical. My reason for posting this is to point out how
sensitized politicians are, and how easily people blame governments for
occurrences no one could reasonably avoid. On the other hand, this message
also is instructive in that the Hong Kong authorities are saying the strain
of EV-71 currently circulating there is "not deadly" and there is "no
evidence of mutation". I take this to indicate the Hong Kong strain is
different from the Malaysian and Taiwanese strains. Of course, other
answers could be that insufficient strain characterization has been done in
Hong Kong or that the epidemiologic situation in Hong Kong is different
from those in Malaysia and Taiwan, i.e., the still-undefined second agent
has not been found in Hong Kong. As Yogi Berra said, "It ain't over until
it's over." (For those of you unfamiliar with U.S. philosophers, Yogi Berra
is not one of them.) - Mod.CHC ................................chc/es
