Food safety chiefs in Ireland and the UK have launched an
investigation into a salmonellosis outbreak after 68 cases of the
illness were reported since February 2008.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said 60 people across England,
Wales, and Northern Ireland had fallen victim to a strain of
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agona. Men were the most commonly
affected accounting for 58 percent of the cases, while ages ranged
from one to 79 years.

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) confirmed 8 people
contracted the infection, which causes diarrhea and vomiting, between
the end of June and early July [2008].

Both agencies are working to try and find the source of the outbreak.

The Food Standards Agency in the UK said it would provide information
to the public as soon as it becomes available. "We are aware of an
outbreak of _Salmonella_ Agona in the UK and Ireland and are working
with the relevant agencies to investigate the source," a spokesman said.

The FSAI warned shops and cafes providing ready-to-eat sandwiches to
keep strict hygiene standards. It is understood its investigation is
focusing on meat and poultry products and one company supplying
catering ingredients has withdrawn its produce from the market as a
precautionary measure.
