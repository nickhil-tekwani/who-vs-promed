[It is now 10 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report, there are 3 new reports of locally transmitted infection -- all 3 in Guangdong. It has now been 20 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 10 days or so... I repeat my questions of 7 Apr 2020: is this increase related to the lifting of restrictions? Are there chains of transmission that can easily be followed? Are these cases related to importations? There were a total of 89 newly confirmed cases of which 86 were imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 82 249 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3341 deaths, representing an increase of 89 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (12 Apr 2020) report, and no newly reported deaths. An additional 3 suspected cases were newly reported, all in imported cases, 2 Shanghai, 1 in Inner Mongolia. 5 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to increase daily. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

A total of 86 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 1464. There are an additional 72 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 54 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 5 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1005. 237 of these are importations from abroad. There is no mention of originally asymptomatic cases that have developed symptoms in the past 24 hours.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020 China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concern is the imported cases returning to China.

The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 586 941, including 23 640 deaths, an increase from 560 433 cases, and 22 115 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 195 655 (33.3%) cumulative case reports and 6240 (23.5%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City, according to the New York City Department of Health (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) website reported 106 813 cases and 6182 deaths (unchanged from yesterday, hence not updated today as yet) as of 1 pm on 13 Apr 2020 (note: previous updates were at 5 pm on the day of the update). Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (2734 newly confirmed cases 10.3%), Massachusetts (1392 newly confirmed cases 5.3%), Pennsylvania (1372 newly confirmed cases 5.2%), and Connecticut (1346 newly confirmed cases 5.1%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number 1, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Florida, and Louisiana.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is starting to decrease. That being said, Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. From a high of 9222 cases reported in 24 hours on 31 Mar 2020, there has been a gradual decline in daily cases reported so that recent days have shown a lowering to levels of 4000s and 5000s and today [13 Apr 2020] it is 3477.

As of today [13 Apr 2020], totals of 169 496 cases and 17 489 deaths have been reported, up from 166 019 cases and 16 972 deaths in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 179.3, slowly decreasing over the past 6 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 179.3 today [13 Apr 2020]. Spain has the highest case count in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 169 496 cases, approximately 75 229 (44.4%) have been hospitalized and 7777 (4.6%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data -- in fact today's hospitalization figures are lower than yesterday's...

[7] Iran transportation
Date: Mon 13 Apr 2020
Source: Radio Farda [abridged edited]
https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-taxi-drivers-die-of-coronavirus-in-danger-of-losing-more-income/30550763.html


Nearly 2 dozen Iranian taxi drivers have died of COVID-2 and hundreds have been infected across the country, the Managing Director of Tehran Municipality's Taxi Company, Morteza Zameni, said on Monday [13 Apr 2020].

Besides being in danger of contracting the virus and losing their lives, taxi drivers have taken a hit from the social distancing measures that have considerably reduced their income. Zameni said that drivers of shared taxis will have to seek compensation from the government for lost fares due to newly introduced regulations to enforce the government's "intelligent social distancing" plan.

Shared fares or fixed-route car services in Tehran -- a city of 8.7 million -- and in other large cities have a considerable role in urban transportation. Fares for fixed routes are set by municipal authorities. Taxi drivers say the government is implementing its new social distancing measures at their expense because fares have not gone up to cover for the fewer number of passengers they will be serving.

Normally as many as 4 people share one taxi but a new Health Ministry regulation has limited the number of passengers to limit the spread of coronavirus on taxis. Drivers are now allowed to take a maximum of 3 passengers at a time. The details of the "Intelligent social distancing" plan which will allow economic activities to resume from next week have not been announced yet.

The Taxi company official also pointed out that drivers and passengers must consistently be screened, measures must be taken to enforce electronic payment instead of cash by all taxis, and drivers infected with the virus should not be allowed to work to prevent the spread of the virus in taxis.

Speaking at a meeting of the National Coronavirus Combat and Management Taskforce on Sunday [12 Apr 2020], President Hassan Rouhani said people should use their own cars and cabs to get to work instead of taking buses or the underground when businesses open again. Public transportation has been blamed for a quarter of coronavirus infections in Iran. Rouhani said more buses including some of the buses in use for transportation between cities will be added to the urban public transport fleet in larger cities to allow people to sit at safer distances to each other.

[I'm sure this scenario is playing out in many cities around the world. Remembering early on in this pandemic when public transport and taxi and rideshare drivers were singled out as at high risk -- taxi drivers in Japan and elsewhere. More recently, anecdotal reports of bus drivers being at high risk and affected in Detroit Michigan, USA. This is an example of high risk essential workers often forgotten about. - Mod.MPP]
