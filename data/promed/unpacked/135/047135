The dreaded Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is suspected to have claimed lives of 3 men in Barvalataluka in Ahmedabad district [Gujarat state]. Following this, the health department has asked medical and veterinary teams to undertake fogging [fogging would be more appropriate for flying vectors rather than ticks - Mod.CP] operations to contain the virus, which spreads through ticks found on the cattle.

Regional deputy director of health at Civil Hospital Dr Neelam Patel said that 3 men were reported dead in Kundal village in Barwala due to haemorrhagic fever suspected to be caused by Crimean-Congo haemorrhhagic fever virus. Moreover, 2 relatives of the victims, including a woman, have also been admitted to the Bhavnagar Government Hospital. The victims belong to Bharwad families staying in the same locality.

District health officer Dr Shilpa Jadhav said that the teams of health department and animal husbandry department have been sent to the village to carry out extensive antiviral operations and undertake cleanliness drives. The ticks, which are known to carry Crimean-Congo virus, are being plucked from the cattle. The officials said that the cleanliness drive has been undertaken in a 5 km [about 3 mile] radius of the village.

Earlier, 4 people of Kariyana village in Babra taluka of Amreli district [Gujarat state] had died of confirmed Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever as their clinical samples had tested positive for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.

In India, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus 1st surfaced in Gujarat in January 2011 when a woman from Kolat village in Sanand died of the virus infection.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40 per cent. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks harboured by livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of those infected. Infected domestic animals do not usually show signs of infection, which may contribute to the general lack of awareness of the disease even in endemic areas and a toleration of tick bites.

CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals.
