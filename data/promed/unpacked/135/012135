Chinese health authorities say they have detected the new [avian influenza] H7N9 virus in quails, at a live poultry market in eastern city of Hangzhou. One of the people infected with the new bird flu strain is thought to have eaten quails brought from the same market. Health officials have now sent the virus sample to China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, for further analysis. The local government carried out a cull of all live birds at the market early on Saturday [6 Apr 2013], and the market has now been banned from trading in live birds.

Misinformation about H7N9 detection in quail
--------------------------------------------
The staff from Hangzhou City Health Bureau involved in culling activities mentioned that a total of 12 specimens were taken and 5 tested positive. The specimens included feather and foot swabs from pigeon, poultry feces, swabs of cage and console table, and sewage from leg feathers. According to the results, nucleic acid of H7N9 avian influenza virus has not yet been detected in [or on?] the body of the quail. Thus, this can only be assumed as a high risk factor.

During these days, human infection of H7N9 avian influenza infection has touched the heart of everyone. Yesterday [6 Apr 2013], the reporter learned from the authority in Hangzhou city that Zhejiang province has identified that the 2nd case of H7N9 avian influenza infection bought and consumed quail in a live poultry market before the onset of illness and thus, it was the risk factor for the infection.

Subsequently, relevant departments in Hangzhou city culled all the live poultry in the firm and suspended the live poultry trade in the firm. Then, the officers collected 12 types of specimens such as bird feces for laboratory testing. Later, 5 types of specimens, including feather and foot swabs from pigeon, poultry feces, swabs from cage and console table, and sewage [feces] from leg feathers, included H7N9 avian influenza virus [sic].

(Latest news)
One case from Hangzhou bought and ate quail
-------------------------------------------
During these days, human infection of H7N9 avian influenza infection is the main focus of every sector in society of the province, especially the disease control department and testing department which need to pay special attention by working overtime.

At 3 am yesterday [7 Apr 2013], the department from Hangzhou city issued information that an epidemiology survey was conducted for the 2nd confirmed patient of H7N9 avian influenza infection (also the 2nd confirmed patient of Zhejiang province). It revealed that the patient had been to Binsheng agricultural firm before the onset of illness where he bought and ate quail. Thus, it is the high risk factor for the infection.

The reporter learned that this patient is a 67-year-old retired worker in Hangzhou. On 25 Mar 2013, he was hospitalized in a hospital of Hangzhou city with symptoms such as cough and fever. On 2 Apr 2013, as the symptoms got worse, he was transferred to a hospital under Zhejiang medical university where emergency treatments were provided to save his life. On 3 Apr 2013, a specimen of this patient was tested to be H7N9 avian influenza virus positive by the influenza laboratory in China CDC. The patient is still under treatment.

Although there is insufficient evidence to conclude that quail can transmit the H7N9 avian influenza virus infection to humans, authorities in Hangzhou city have culled live poultry in the Binsheng agricultural firm and suspended the live poultry trade within the firm.

(Clarification of rumor)
Detection of H7N9 avian influenza infection in quail is misinformation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The information that came out at dawn became a hot topic among people in the city until yesterday afternoon [6 Apr 2013]. When it was passed from one to 10 and 10 to 100, many reports showed up on the websites. Some said that quail from the live poultry market has tested positive of H7N9 virus. Some said that feces from pigeon and quail have H7N9 virus. Some even said that H7N9 infection is most likely to be transmitted by pigeons.

What is the real situation? Yesterday afternoon [6 Apr 2013], the reporter learned from the staff involved in culling that after the poultry were culled at that time, a total of 12 types of specimens were collected, including

- pharynx and external swabs of quail,
- rectal contents of chicken and duck,
- feather and foot swabs of pigeon, etc.

After testing, 5 types of specimens showed H7N9 avian influenza virus positive, including

- feather and foot swabs of pigeon,
- feces of poultry [presumably chicken &/or duck],
- swabs from cage and console table [of which species?], and
- sewage [feces] from leg feathers [of chickens?].

[No mention of quail. - Mod.JW]

Later, the reporter has confirmed with the related department in Hangzhou city that according to the current situation and results, nucleic acid of H7N9 avian influenza virus has not been detected in the body of quail yet. Thus, it can only be assumed as a high risk factor and the information that H7N9 virus was found in quail is wrong information.

No "quarantine order" in Hangzhou Zoo yet
-----------------------------------------
In the past, according to the Xinhua News Agency's report, Associate Professor Yuan Wenke from Beijing Agriculture College who has been engaged in science and studies of poultry diseases said that avian influenza is one of the most serious viral infections in poultry around the world. It has been widely spread among poultry and causes great harm to the poultry industry.

Then, what is the recent condition of the zoo with all these poultry? Yesterday afternoon [6 Apr 2013], the reporter contacted the Hangzhou Zoo and the zoo staff said birds in the zoo had been vaccinated [with which vaccine?] before they were sent to the zoo. The staff said, "Breeding management is very systematic and everything is normal until now."

The staff said that as now is the time for the Qingming holiday, "We have less visitors and the situation is quite normal." He also said that the zoo has not announced a "quarantine order" until now, but the breeders are monitoring the poultry 24 hours every day such as to their appearance and appetite.

[The balance of these reports is some uncertainty about the veracity of the earlier reported laboratory recovery of H7N9 from a singular quail carcass. This latter result was not the quail the 67-year-old sick person ate or was possibly exposed to when purchasing the bird. Nor possibly the bird which provided the virus sent to China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The thoroughness of the multiple (negative) sampling is not clear. And as any experienced investigator knows not only must the correct samples be taken in adequate numbers, but their handling during transit must not negatively affect the viability of any suspect pathogens. - Mod.MHJ]

[About the zoo, presumably it would rather quarantine the poultry section than cull all their poultry.
