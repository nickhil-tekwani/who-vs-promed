Tourism industry players have called on the government to be more
transparent in informing the public about the bird flu outbreak to avoid
confusion that could be harmful to the industry.
Although the country's tourism sector is yet to experience a significant
impact from the outbreak, Indonesian Hotel and Restaurants Association
(PHRI) chairwoman Yanti Sukamdani Hardjoparkoso said the industry could
face another downturn as it did in 2003 -- when Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) swept across Asia, including Indonesia -- if the government
failed to seriously handle the situation. "Look at what happened to Ragunan
Zoo," Yanti told The Jakarta Post on Friday. "People may never want to
visit the zoo again after the government was so wishy-washy about whether
the place was safe from bird flu or not." The government closed down the
zoo in South Jakarta for 21 days starting 19 Sep 2005 after they found 19
birds in the 140 hectare zoo had been infected with bird flu.
4 people with bird flu have died since July and 2 children died this week
after showing symptoms of the virus. Yanti said the government needed to
assess the situation and take preventive measures -- including specifying
tourist destinations that should be avoided for the meantime -- rather than
waiting for a tourist to fall ill, which would only do the tourism industry
more harm. "Tourists are actually more afraid of -- and more likely to be
traumatized -- by the outbreak of a disease than a terror attack; it is
always more difficult and costly to restore the good image of a tourist
destination afterward, than (to take measures) before it is tarnished," she
said.
Similarly, the Association of Indonesian Tour and Travel Agencies (ASITA)
chairwoman Meity Robot said the government needed to step up its efforts in
preventing and tackling the bird flu outbreak, before it worsened and
really turned into another nightmare for the tourism sector. "The
government must, most importantly, provide clearer and more complete
information on the situation to the public and be resolute in taking
preventive measures against the outbreak," she said.
The government has been hoping to attract 6 million foreign tourists this
year, which would generate USD 5.8 billion in foreign exchange from the
industry -- higher than last year's 5.3 million tourists and USD 5 billion
in revenues. The number of foreign arrivals during the year's 1st 7 months
was 2.45 million, according to the Central Statistics Agency, down 4.08 per
cent from the same period in 2004.
Minister of Culture and Tourism Jero Wacik told Dow Jones Newswire that the
bird flu outbreak would bring little effect to the tourism sector. He was
still upbeat that the country's tourism sector would meet its target.
Indonesia's tourism sector has been in the doldrums since the Bali bombings
in 2002, and terror attacks on the JW Marriott Hotel and the Australian
Embassy, both in South Jakarta, the following years, scared off potential
tourists. At the same time, a series of SARS and influenza epidemics in the
region, as well as the 26 Dec 2005 tsunami, made things worse for the
sector. The occupancy rates of hotels in the country dropped from an
average of 55 percent to 30 percent during the SARS outbreak, PHRI said.
Despite the government's earlier warning that the outbreak could turn into
an epidemic, several foreign embassies are yet to issue travel advisories
to their citizens concerning the bird flu. The Japanese Embassy has
notified Japanese citizens of the bird flu outbreak, but it has not issued
an advisory suggesting they defer travel to the country. "There are no
plans to issue a travel warning yet," an embassy official said. Elizabeth
O'Neill of the Australian Embassy said her government had asked --- in its
latest travel bulletin -- Australians residing in avian-influenza-affected
areas not to panic and to take precautionary measures. "We will continue to
keep close contact with the Indonesian government and the World Health
Organization, and update Australian citizens about the situation," she
said. There are more Japanese and Australian tourists here than visitors of
any other nationality.

The lure of free entertainment on a sunny Sunday afternoon drew hundreds to
a field near the Javanese village of Babat to witness the 1st mass cull of
pigs infected with the deadly bird flu virus.
Adults and children milled around, watching animals being slaughtered,
thrown into a pit and burnt with no sign of public safety precautions. The
Indonesian Agriculture Minister, Anton Apriantono, shouted frantically to
department staff to find if it was safe to remove his white mask to answer
questions. "Don't blame me if you get bird flu because you don't wear a
mask. This is very dangerous, you know, as the virus can be transmitted
through the air," he warned reporters that July afternoon.
Mr Apriantono was soon struggling to explain why only 31 pigs and 40 ducks
from Tangerang region, bordering Jakarta, were being culled, instead of the
promised hundreds of infected pigs and thousands of chickens. "We only
culled the infected animals as we do not have the money to carry out a mass
culling," he said.
Days earlier, an auditor who lived nearby, Iwan Rapei, and his 2 daughters
died with symptoms of heavy pneumonia. Tests confirmed Mr Rapei carried the
bird flu virus.
Yesterday the United Nations Food and Agriculture Agency demanded Indonesia
improve its virus control and immediately start culling in infected areas.
In April tests at pig farms uncovered bird flu infections, but no cull was
ordered. This week it emerged several of the 17 Indonesians in hospital
with bird flu in the latest outbreak came from Tangerang or areas close to
Jakarta.
The botched cull raises concerns about Indonesia's ability to prevent a
pandemic that could kill millions across the region.
The World Health Organisation's regional spokesman, Peter Cordingley,
believes Indonesia is now the "hot spot" for bird flu, and the WHO's
country representative, Georg Peterson, describes it as the "weak link" in
global efforts to avert a pandemic.
Mr Cordingley said the WHO has known "for some time the H5N1 virus is
entrenched in Indonesian poultry populations". "Each time a human being
becomes infected, we worry because one of the scenarios for this pandemic
to start is if one person has the avian influenza virus in his body at the
same time as the normal flu virus, [then] there is the possibility of
genetic exchange between the 2 viruses."
Although tests had shown more than half its exotic birds carried the bird
flu virus, Jakarta's Ragunan Zoo was kept open on Sunday for thousands of
visitors, including hundreds of expatriates on a charity fun run. Several
of those since taken to hospital were zoo visitors.
The health minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, at first denied the possibility
of human transmission, then stated it was inevitable and Indonesia was in
the grip of an epidemic. She later reversed her position, saying the
outbreak could possibly become an epidemic and called on the nation to
increase "alertness" .
But Mrs Supari's extraordinary flu alert was attacked by other cabinet
ministers on the grounds it could harm tourism and investment.
This week Mr Apriantono finally announced culls in "highly infected" areas.
But he later said more than 20 per cent of stock had to be infected for a
cull order to be issued - and that no such areas existed.
Mr Cordingley said the problem was a familiar one in Asia. "There is no
incentive for somebody who raises chickens to report infected chickens if
he is not going to be compensated for the day government authorities come
in and kill all his chickens," he said.
