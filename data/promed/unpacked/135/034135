The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) has been notified of a confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province today (29 Dec 2015) affecting a 26-year-old woman in Shenzhen. The patient lives in Bao'an, Shenzhen. She is currently hospitalised for treatment and in a critical condition.

A spokesman for the DH said, "All novel influenza A infections (including H5N6) are notifiable diseases in Hong Kong. Locally, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments. In view of cases confirmed on the Mainland, members of the public should maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times during travel," the spokesman urged.

"All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added.

Regarding health education for travellers, the display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are proceeding.

Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.

The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:
- Do not visit live poultry markets and farms.
- Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
- If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- Avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
- Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

[Avian influenza H5N6 has caused few human cases, but is highly virulent in poultry. The virus is a recombinant with the backbone of H5N1 that acquired the NA gene from H6N6. It was 1st detected in China in April 2014, and has spread to Laos and Viet Nam. The low number of human cases suggests the virus does not jump species easily -- nevertheless, vigilance must be maintained.

See FAO-Empres Watch: "Avian influenza A(H5N6): the latest addition to emerging zoonotic avian influenza threats in East and Southeast Asia" (http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4199e.pdf) for more information.
