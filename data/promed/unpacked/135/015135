Nepal: Birgunj Doctors Warn of Jaundice Outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Doctors have warned people here to follow preventive measures, as
jaundice has been spreading for the past few weeks. Medical experts
have urged people to be conscious of the fact that jaundice can be
transmitted through contaminated drinking water and can result from
bad sanitation.
Asking people to follow preventive measures, the Consumer Forum of
Parsa today [3 May 2006] organized a program here. More than 3000
people have fallen ill with jaundice in Birgunj and surrounding areas
over the past 3 months, said Dr. Shyam Sundar Das of the Narayani
Sub-regional Hospital.
Doctors have urged people to drink boiled water in order to be safe
from jaundice. Dr. Ram Avatar Prasad Khetan said: "This disease might
become an epidemic if precautions are not taken." More than 60
percent of jaundice patients are from urban areas. Most of them are
consumers of the Nepal Drinking Water Corporation (NDWC).
Chief of Birgunj NDWC Satish Datta Karna, a participant in the
program, said: "Water supplied by the corporation is suitable for
drinking. NDWC uses chlorine to ensure that the water is germ-free."
The doctors, however, pointed out that the germs of jaundice can't be
controlled by using chlorine.

[Birgunj is a population center in the Administrative Division of
Parsa, which lies in the Central Region of Nepal to the south of
Kathmandu close to the border with India; (see map at
<http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map04.htm>).
Water-borne infectious jaundice could be a consequence of infection
with a variety of enteric viruses (especially hepatitis A virus and
hepatitis E virus), or bacterial infection (e.g. leptospirosis).
However, all these agents would be rendered harmless by routine
chlorination of water supplies. It may be that there has been
disruption of water treatment as a consequence of the current
political upheaval in Nepal. Further information is awaited.
However, Nepal has long had a reputation for jaundice due to the
endemicity of acute liver disease in the Kathmandu Valley. Hepatitis
E virus is considered to be the predominant cause of jaundice in
Kathmandu. An increase in the number of jaundice cases admitted to
Nepalese hospitals often occurs during the rainy season from mid-May
through mid-October; (see the ProMED-mail reference below for
documentation). - Mod.CP].
