[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), is an acute contagious disease caused by a _Morbillivirus_ in the family _Paramyxoviridae_. It affects mainly sheep and goats and occasionally wild small ruminants.

Based on the fact that PPR has been reported on a few occasions in camels, cattle, and buffaloes, those animal species are considered to be susceptible although their potential role in the circulation of PPR virus (PPRV) has not been formally established. PPR occurs in Africa except Southern Africa, in the Arabian Peninsula, throughout most of the Near East and Middle East, and in Central and South-East Asia.

The clinical disease resembles rinderpest in cattle. It is usually acute and characterised by pyrexia, serous ocular and nasal discharges, diarrhoea, and pneumonia, and erosive lesions on different mucous membranes particularly in the mouth. At necropsy, erosions may be noted in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The lungs may show interstitial bronchopneumonia and often secondary bacterial pneumonia. PPR can also occur in subclinical form.

PPR must be confirmed by laboratory methods, as rinderpest, bluetongue, foot-and-mouth disease, and other erosive or vesicular conditions as well as contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, can cause clinically similar disease.

There are no known health risks to humans working with PPRV as no report of human infection with the virus exists. Laboratory manipulations should be carried out at an appropriate containment level determined by biorisk analysis

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.7.11 "Peste des petits ruminants" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.11_PPR.pdf (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2013).

In May 2013 PPR was added to the list of diseases for which the OIE has put in place a specific procedure for official recognition of disease status. No country or zone has yet officially been recognized by the OIE as being free from the disease (http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/peste-des-petits-ruminants/).

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to "Infection with Peste des petit ruminants virus" are described in chapter 14.8 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.14.8.htm.

According to the most recent 6-monthly OIE reports (July-December 2012 or January-June 2013), PPR was present in 37 countries, limited to certain zones in 5 countries, as suspect in 4 countries, never reported in 117 countries, and absent during this period in 13 countries. Countries in the area reporting the disease as absent are China (People's Rep of), Israel, Jordan, Korea (Dem People's Rep.), Lebanon, Qatar, Syria, and United Arab Emirates.
Details are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.

Quantitative information provided by OIE's WAHID database shows that from January 2012 to date (14 Oct 2013), the following countries in the Asian region reported outbreaks of PPR:
Country / June-December 2012 / January-October 2013
Afghanistan / 25 / /
Bahrain / 150 / /
Bhutan / /1 /
India / 128 / /
Iran / 2056 / 1119 /
Iraq / 31 / /
Israel /1 / /
Kuwait / 75 /162 /
Nepal / 98 / /
Oman / 582 / /
Palestinian Auton Territories / 71 / /
Yemen / 18 / /

Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia reported the disease present, but no quantitative information is available.
