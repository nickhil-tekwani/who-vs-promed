The monsoon nightmare is back to haunt Jamshedpur [Jharkhand state] and its neighbours.

The East Singhbhum civil surgeon's office on Tuesday [19 Jul 2016] issued a double alert for dengue and Japanese encephalitis in the steel city after 18 suspected cases of the vector-borne diseases were reported from Tata Main Hospital (TMH) on Monday [18 Jul 2016].

"A general alert has been sounded to all hospitals, nursing homes and health centres in and around Jamshedpur. We have to maintain strict vigil," said civil surgeon Dr S.K. Jha.

Sahir Pall, district officer for the Centre's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), said the private hospital had reported 4 Japanese encephalitis [JE] suspects. "Blood serum samples have been sent to the microbiology department of MGM Medical College in Dimna for confirmation. Reports are expected in another 48 hours," Pall added.

Sources at TMH said all the 4 encephalitis suspects were children -- 3 boys and a girl aged between 4-12 years.

"The patients have come from various parts of Jamshedpur like Birsanagar, Sakchi, Sonari, Kadma, Mango and Bagbera as well as Adityapur in adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district.

Japanese encephalitis [virus] is transmitted to humans through infected _Culex_ mosquitoes, particularly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_.

Of the 200-plus samples tested for Japanese encephalitis in 2015, 40 had confirmed presence of the virus. No cases were reported in 2014.

The civil surgeon's office, once again on Tuesday [19 Jul 2016], prodded Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee, Mango Notified Area Committee, Jugsalai Municipality and Jusco to increase frequency of fogging, sprinkling of bleaching powder, spraying of larvicides and other disinfectants in areas under their command. It also issued a notice to all government and private hospitals/nursing homes, asking them to report suspected cases within 24 hours.

[JE virus is endemic in northeastern India, where the JE virus transmission season is beginning. Fogging is not an effective long-term approach to JE prevention -- vaccination is. This report does not indicate if there is widespread vaccination against JE in the affected area, which is the most effective preventive measure. Vector control may provide short-term mosquito population reduction, but is not a long-term preventive measure. Extensive rice fields offer ample breeding sites.
