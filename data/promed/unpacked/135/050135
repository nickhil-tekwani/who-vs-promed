Meningitis in Congo kills 24
-------------------
The authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo say at least 24 people
have died in an outbreak of meningitis in the northeast of the country.
The Health Minister, Mashako Mamba, said the illness had struck people
living around Mai-Ndombe lake, about 450 kilometers from the capital,
Kinshasa. He said the illness was spreading quickly as people were wasting
time visiting sorcerers rather than doctors. The Congolese minister also
said extra medical teams had already been sent to the worst affected areas.
[The number of cases of infection in this outbreak is not reported nor is
the serotype of _N. meningitidis_ stated. If case fatality rates are
similar to the Burkina Faso outbreak below, about 250 cases may have
occurred. In an epidemic setting, large-scale immunization is often used
with antimicrobial prophylaxis in closed settings and/or household
contacts. It is not clear if the "sorcerers" were being used to attempt to
treat already-ill individuals or to prevent disease in individuals not yet
sick. - Mod.LL]

W135 meningococcal disease in Burkina Faso - Update 6
---------------------------------
As of 15 May 2002, 12 587 cases, including 1447 deaths, have been reported
to WHO. The downward trend in the epidemic noted in the report of 6 May
2002 is continuing, with 1 district, Paul VI, remaining above the epidemic
threshold.
The following measures continue to be taken by Le Comite National de
Pilotage pour la Meningite (Crisis Committee): epidemiological
surveillance, laboratory confirmation of suspected cases and case management.
Since the emergence of meningococcal serogroup W135 in Burkina Faso has
major implications for public health in the African continent, a research
agenda has been agreed upon by the Crisis Committee. The research is being
implemented by a team consisting of WHO, Epicentre, WHO Collaborating
Centre for Reference and Research on Meningococci, Oslo, Norway, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (USA) and l'Association pour la Medecine
pr√©ventive (AMP). The topics include: a detailed description and evaluation
of the risk factors of the current epidemic; an ecological analysis of
association between vaccine coverage and epidemics; _N. meningitidis_
seroprevalence and carriage; and the socioeconomic impact of the epidemic.
The team is also assessing the feasibility of estimating immunogenicity and
efficacy of tetravalent vaccine (A, C, Y and W135).
[It is likely that ultimate control of meningococcal infection will depend
on the development and wide-scale utilization of conjugated polyvalent
meningococcal vaccine to include not only those in the current
nonconjugated, quadrivalent product but also type B. The type B
meningococcal capsule, a poorly immunogenic polymer of N-acetylneuraminic
acid, is not currently represented in any commercially available
vaccine. Conjugation of the immunogens assists in facilitating
immunological memory and allows use of the vaccine in younger children. -

Second meningitis case confirmed at playgroup - England
--------------------------------------------------
A playgroup in Devon has been hit by its second meningitis case in a
month. A 3-year-old boy who attends Ellacombe Church Playgroup in Torquay
contracted the meningococcal type of the disease at the end of last week.
Another case involving a different boy was confirmed there in April 2002.
Public health doctors from the South West Peninsula Health Authority have
offered antimicrobial preventive therapy to all children and staff at the
playgroup as a precaution. The 3-year-old, who also attends St Mary Church
Primary School's nursery, is said to be making "good progress" at Torbay
Hospital. The other boy who contracted the disease has since made a
satisfactory recovery.
Dr Geoffrey Thould, a consultant in communicable disease control with the
health authority, said: "Because we had 2 cases within the same playgroup,
we offered antibiotics to everyone because of the possibility that other
children might be carrying the same strain of the meningitis germ. Parents
should remember that the risk of contracting meningitis remains low." The
playgroup is attended by around 35 children, aged 3 to 5.
Paul Woodhouse, headteacher of St Marychurch Primary, has written to
parents of all 344 pupils at the school and nursery to inform them of the
situation. Although the risk of the disease spreading is low, he is urging
them to be aware of the symptoms of the disease including vomiting, high
temperature and fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and drowsiness,
joint pains, and a rash of red-purple spots or bruises.
[Although chemoprophylaxis to prevent secondary cases of meningococcal
infection is not generally indicated in school or work settings, day-care
contacts are usually treated because of the greater ease of transmission in
younger children. Most secondary cases occur within 10 days of the primary
case onset. It should be noted that, although secondary household cases
occur with a rate 500-800 times the background rate, it is only 1-3 percent
overall. - Mod.LL]
