WHEAT STREAK MOSAIC VIRUS - AUSTRALIA (WESTERN AUSTRALIA): 1ST REPORT

Western Australia's Department of Agriculture has confirmed several
cases of wheat streak mosaic virus in the southern wheatbelt: 2 cases
have been confirmed in the Esperance area and one in Kondinin.
The seed-borne disease can cause extensive damage to crop yields,
although it is too early to know what damage may result. Minister for
Agriculture Kim Chance says while the discovery is regrettable, it is
now a case of dealing with it. "There is absolutely nothing we can do
about it," he said. "That is a great concern, we now have it and
we'll move to deal with it. I can remember going through this same
process with stripe rust, we hoped we were never going to get it but
eventually it did turn up."
Mr. Chance says it is inevitable the disease will spread.
"It's one of those things that you know is inevitable, you know that
some time it's going to get here through one means or another,
there's very little you can do to keep them out,"
Mr. Chance said.

[The cereal crop plant wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ L. subsp.
_aestivum_, develops symptoms of the disease wheat streak mosaic when
infected by wheat streak mosaic virus (genus: Tritimovirus, family:
Potyviridae, WSMV). It can also infect barley, maize, oats and rye
and some pasture and weed grasses. The virus is transmitted by the
eriophyid wheat curl mite (_Aceria tosichella_). WSMV causes severe
disease in some winter wheat crops in the Great Plains of North
America, with average losses of 3 percent. There is one report
(Argentina, 20040922.2614) from South America. It occurs throughout
the Mediterranean Basin at low incidence and is reported from Eastern
Europe.
The first detection of WSMV in Australia was in southern Queensland
and South Australia in 2003 (20030417.0941 and 11 other postings that
year, all of which are included in the final posting, 20030603.1354).
The high level of concern at that time is clear in these postings and
in the first 4 links, all to Australian reports, listed below. It was
subsequently reported in 2005 in New South Wales (20051029.3159), and
that outbreak was quite severe in individual fields (paddocks) of
wheat. While the stunted, yellowed plants flowered and set seed, they
produced only very small and shriveled grain. Badly affected paddocks
were not harvested. An estimated 7000 hectares were affected there
in 2005, 1000 severely. Monetary losses in 2005 were estimated at
approximately Aus $2 million (USD 1.5 million). Work in Australia
has demonstrated that WSMV is seed-transmitted in wheat, but it is
not clear what part this plays in the overall epidemiology of the
disease, which also includes wind-driven mite transmission. Movement
of virus from infected volunteer plants to new wheat by mites is
considered a significant part of the overall disease cycle. Avoidance
and removal of volunteer plants is an important part of disease
management. Insecticides and miticides have not been effective in US
studies.
This report documents the further expansion of the range of this
virus to Western Australia. This is not an especially surprising
announcement as the Minister for Agriculture Kim Chance notes in the
comments above. It is quite likely that the virus has been there for
some time in crop or other wild grass hosts.
