USA - Mumps Activity Update; 1 Jan to 7 Oct 2006
------------------------------------------------
During the period 1 Jan to 7 Oct 2006, a total of 45 states
(Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Montana, and Vermont did not report
cases) and the District of Columbia reported 5783 confirmed or
probable mumps cases to CDC (data presented as a histogram in the
original article). This includes 2597 cases previously reported by 11
states during the period 1 Jan to 29 Apr 2006 (1). This report
summarizes the epidemiology of mumps cases in the United States
during 2006. With low levels of reported mumps continuing,
health-care workers should remain alert to suspected mumps, conduct
appropriate laboratory testing, and use every opportunity to ensure
adequate immunity, particularly among populations at high risk for mumps.
Cases of mumps are reportable through the National Notifiable
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Reports are transmitted
electronically via NNDSS to CDC each week and include individual case
information such as age, sex, date of symptom onset, vaccination
status, and complications of illness. Mumps cases included in this
report are those with onset from 1 Jan to 7 Oct 2006 (week 40).
The clinical case definition of mumps is an illness with acute onset
of unilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited, swelling of the
parotid or other salivary gland, lasting 2 or more days, and without
other apparent cause. A confirmed case of mumps is one that is
laboratory confirmed or meets the clinical case definition and is
linked epidemiologically to a confirmed or probable case. A probable
case meets the clinical case definition but is neither laboratory
confirmed nor linked to another confirmed or probable mumps case (2).
Of the 5783 cases, 3113 (54 percent) were confirmed, and 2612 (45
percent) were probable; for 58 cases (1 percent), classification was
unknown. Six states reported 84 percent of the cases: Iowa (1968),
Kansas (904), Wisconsin (750), Illinois (591), Nebraska (357), and
South Dakota (288).
For 5747 (99 percent) of the 5783 mumps cases with patient age
available, the median age was 22 years (range: 1 month to 96 years).
Among the 5739 (99 percent) patients for whom sex was known, 3644 (63
percent) were female. As reported previously (1), the highest
age-specific rate continues to be among persons aged 18 to 24 years,
many of whom were college students.
Data regarding vaccination status are incomplete. In Iowa, one of the
states with the most complete data, preliminary vaccination data have
been reported through 20 Sep 2006. Among 1798 patients with completed
follow-up reports, 123 (7 percent) were unvaccinated; 245 (14
percent) had received one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
vaccine, and 884 (49 percent) had received >2 doses of MMR vaccine.
The vaccination status of 546 (30 percent) patients, the majority of
whom were adults, was unknown (3).
Among the 5783 cases for which weeks of onset are known, cases peaked
during the period 16 to 29 Apr 2006, the onset period for 1498 (26
percent) cases. The number of reported cases decreased during the
period May to September, when most students were not attending
college. However, since students began returning to school in August,
mumps clusters have been reported from three college or university
campuses in Illinois (84 cases), Kansas (22 cases), and Virginia (12
cases). Most of these cases (96 percent) were reported in persons who
had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Because 2 doses of
mumps-containing vaccine are not 100 percent effective, in a setting
with high vaccination coverage such as the United States, most mumps
cases likely will occur in persons who have received the 2 doses.
Multiple other factors might have contributed to the spread of the
mumps outbreak (e.g., the close-contact environment of college
dormitories or varying college admission requirements for MMR vaccination) (1).
Health-care providers should continue to remain alert for suspected
mumps cases, conduct appropriate diagnostic testing, and report these
cases to local or state health departments. At the initial visit,
recommended specimens for laboratory testing include serum to test
for mumps immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and a swab from the
parotid duct or other affected salivary gland ducts for viral
isolation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing,
or both. Parotid duct swab is the preferred viral sample for mumps;
urine samples are no longer recommended. The first (acute) serum
specimen should be collected within 5 days of illness onset. If the
IgM antibody titer is negative, a 2nd (convalescent) serum specimen
for IgM antibodies is recommended 2 to 3 weeks after onset of signs
(e.g., parotitis) or symptoms; a delayed IgM response has been
observed in patients with confirmed cases of mumps, especially in
vaccinated persons. The paired serum specimens also can be used to
detect a significant rise (as defined by the testing kit
instructions) in immunoglobulin G (IgG seroconversion) if measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or a fourfold rise in titer if
measured using plaque-reduction neutralization assays or similar
quantitative assay.
Negative laboratory tests, especially in vaccinated persons, should
not be used to rule out a mumps diagnosis, because these tests are
not sensitive enough to detect infection in all persons with clinical
illness. In the absence of another diagnosis, cases meeting the
clinical case definition should be reported as mumps cases.
In response to this nationwide mumps outbreak, ACIP recommendations
for prevention and control of mumps were updated (4). Evidence of
immunity through documentation of vaccination is now defined as one
dose of live mumps vaccine for preschool-aged children and adults not
at high risk for exposure and infection and 2 doses of live mumps
vaccine for school-aged children (i.e., grades kindergarten-12) and
adults at high risk for exposure and infection (i.e., health-care
workers, international travelers, and students at post-high-school
education institutions). Additional recommendations for outbreak
control include administering a second dose of MMR for preschool
children and adults not at high risk for exposure and infection if
these persons are part of a group that is experiencing an outbreak
(4). To ensure high levels of immunity, especially among groups at
high risk for exposure and infection, every opportunity should be
used to provide the 1st or 2nd dose of MMR vaccine to those without
adequate evidence of immunity (e.g., documentation of vaccination).
Private health-care providers, clinics, health departments,
health-care institutions, schools, universities, and colleges should
consider offering MMR vaccine through such settings as routine
preventive health services and special immunization clinics,
including providing MMR in conjunction with influenza vaccine.

[This outbreak, which peaked in April/May 2006, has declined to
pre-2006 levels. It has resulted in revision of the US ACIP
recommendations for control and elimination of mumps virus infection
in the USA. These recommendations are relevant to control and
elimination of mumps elsewhere. This thread is now closed. - Mod.CP]
