Cases of hepatitis A continue to rise: VIHA
-------------------------------------------
This week health officials confirmed 91 cases of hepatitis A have been
reported to the Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA) in a
continuing outbreak. Last month [November 2011], VIHA officials
confirmed the outbreak, which at that point totaled 80 cases. Since
then, one to 3 new cases per week have been identified, the majority
of whom are centered in the Port Alberni/West Coast region, with some
cases in other parts of Vancouver Island, according to VIHA medical
health officer Dr. Paul Hasselback.

About 15 percent of those infected will have prolonged symptoms during
a 6-to-9-month period.

[Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person
ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's faeces. The
disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of
personal hygiene habits. Improved sanitation and hepatitis A vaccine
are the most effective ways to combat the disease. The symptoms of
hepatitis A range from mild to severe, and can include fever, malaise,
loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort,
dark-colored urine and jaundice. As indicated above there is no
specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following
infection may be slow and take several weeks or months.

Reports of hepatitis A virus infection from Canada have been rare. The
persistence of the outbreak in the VIHA area suggests a water-borne or
contaminated sea-food source. Further information in this respect
would be welcomed.
