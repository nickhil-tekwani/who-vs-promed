Subject: Emergency Management Warning 3: Newcastle Disease in California in
Backyard Poultry

Newcastle disease (ND) has been confirmed in backyard poultry in Riverside
and Los Angeles Counties, CA.
-------------------
Officials with the California Department of Agriculture (CDFA) and the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are conducting an
eradication campaign for Newcastle disease. The disease was confirmed on
October 1, 2002, and is restricted to backyard poultry. Clinical signs in
infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal
signs. Mortality is up to 90% of exposed birds. Commercial poultry, at
this time are not involved in the disease occurrence.
State and federal animal health officials are conducting door-to-door
surveys to identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are
following up on all epidemiologic associations. To date, depopulation,
cleaning and disinfecting, and carcass disposal are being conducted by CDFA
and APHIS. CDFA has closed all poultry exhibits at fairs and expositions
within the State of California.
The Newcastle disease situation is contained and is still considered a
single outbreak cluster within a 30-mile radius in Los Angeles County and
along the Los Angeles/Riverside County border.
Affected and exposed backyard poultry are being euthanized, double-bagged,
disinfecting the bags, and transporting the carcasses to restricted
landfills for burial.
All door-to-door surveillance, along with interviews, has established that
there have been no links to eastern States within the United States and no
exposure to other backyard poultry in other States.
Local commercial table egg layer birds are being closely monitored and will
only be allowed to move intrastate under CDFA monitoring and spent-hen
movements restricted to the day they are scheduled for processing.
The following are the numbers associated with the Newcastle disease
situation in California:
Number of premises positive: 12
Number of contacts: 9
Number of premises quarantined: 50
Number of premises depopulated: 20
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 1
Birds depopulated to date: 5,711
If you have any additional questions, please contact the USDA, APHIS,
Veterinary Services, Emergency Programs staff at
301-734-8073, 800-940-6524, or EMOC@APHIS.USDA.GOV.

NEWCASTLE DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
------------------------
Follow-up report No. 1
See also: 4 October 2002
Information received on 11 October 2002 from Dr Peter Fernandez, Associate
Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), Washington, DC:
End of previous report period: 3 October 2002 (see Disease Information, 15
[40], 194, dated 4 October 2002).
End of this report period: 11 October 2002.
Outbreaks:
Location No. of outbreaks
Los Angeles and Riverside Counties, State of California 1*
* 13 known positive premises.
Description of affected population in the outbreak: detections continue to
be made only in game fowl located in backyard premises. No commercial
poultry are affected.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species: avi
susceptible cases **
deaths: approximately 400
destroyed: approximately 5,500
slaughtered
** Game fowl on backyard premises. Due to the nature of this type of
activity involving this type of bird, an exact census is not available. The
number of birds in these flocks ranges from one bird to several hundred birds.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Veterinary Services
Laboratories, Ames, Iowa.
B. Diagnostic tests used: virus isolation.
C. Causal agent: paramyxovirus-1.
- The virus was found to have multiple basic amino acids at the fusion (F)
protein cleavage activation site: arg. arg. glu. lys. arg* phe, a sequence
compatible with that of mesogenic/velogenic pathotypes.
- The intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of the virus isolated from
tissues of these backyard game fowl is 1.75.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: Unknown. An evaluation of bird,
people and fomite movement is ongoing.
B. Mode of spread: direct contact, fomites.
Control measures during reporting period:
- Depopulation of affected/exposed game fowl. To date, 11 of 13 backyard
positive premises have been depopulated. The cleaning and disinfection of
depopulated backyard premises is being conducted by State and Federal
authorities.
- As a result of exposure or through possible epidemiological linkage with
affected birds, additional backyard flocks are under quarantine.
- To prevent movement and assembly of this type of bird, the State of
California has cancelled the following activities: swap meets (locations
where game fowl are sold and exchanged), and exhibits at fairs and other shows.
- The commercial poultry industry has fortified its biosecurity measures.
- Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. Surveillance activities
continue to be conducted door-to-door in the affected areas. Over 100
backyard premises are being monitored.
