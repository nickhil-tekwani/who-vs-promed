Japan faces a "high risk" that an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
[FMD] may spread from southwestern Miyazaki prefecture to other
livestock regions, new Agriculture Minister Masahiko Yamada said today
[9 Jun 2010].

"Japan is in a critical situation where the disease may break out
anywhere, anytime," as infected animals are still alive, Yamada told
reporters in Tokyo today [9 Jun 2010]. "We must speed up culling and
burying them."

FMD is one of the most contagious livestock diseases and can have high
mortality rates in young animals, according to the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health, or OIE. Miyazaki is Japan's
2nd-largest pig-farming region and 3rd-largest producer of beef cattle.

The country has so far discovered 185 999 cases of the disease, of
which 152 871 were in pigs and 33 111 were in cows and cattle,
according to the agriculture ministry. They represent 1.5 percent of
Japan's total swine herd and 0.7 percent of total cows and cattle.

The government has buried about 154 000 culled animals, Tomohiro
Nishio at the ministry's animal health division said today [9 Jun
2010] by phone. Japan plans to slaughter an additional 122 000
animals, including uninfected ones, to prevent the disease from
spreading further, Nishio said.

Yamada, 68, took office yesterday [8 Jun 2010] as Naoto Kan replaced
Yukio Hatoyama as Japan's prime minister and established a new
cabinet. Yamada was a deputy to former Agriculture Minister Hirotaka
Akamatsu, who stepped down amid criticism from opposition lawmakers
that he was slow in arranging measures to contain the disease.
