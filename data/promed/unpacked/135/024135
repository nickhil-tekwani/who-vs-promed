South Korea tests new suspected cases of foot-and-mouth
-------------------------------------------------------
SEOUL: South Korea, fighting to contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease, said on Sun 19 May [2002] it was testing more suspected cases at 2
farms near an outbreak confirmed earlier.
Korea confirmed early on Sunday a case of the animal epidemic disease south
of Seoul and had destroyed 900 more pigs to try to contain an outbreak just
days before the soccer World Cup finals. An Agriculture Ministry official
said by telephone the affected farm was at Ansong in the province that
adjoins the capital. He said more than 92 000 head of livestock had now
been culled since the first case was reported on 04 May 2002. "One sow and
4 piglets showed symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease. They tested positive
in initial tests, so 900 pigs at that farm, which is near the original
site, were destroyed," the official said.
A second test will be carried out to confirm the initial tests but is
expected to be positive, the official said. It was the first new case since
8 pigs tested positive early last week.
"Separately, we are investigating two additional reports on suspected
foot-and-mouth in 16 pigs and one sow at two farms respectively in Yong-in
and Ansong," the agriculture ministry said in a statement. Officials had
already said they would step up disinfection near affected areas because
Sunday is Buddha's birthday and many gatherings are expected at temples
across the country.
The official said the farm, about 30 km (20 miles) south of Seoul, had
fallen just outside earlier preventive cull zones. The slaughter around the
latest farm was limited because neighbouring farms do not keep livestock.
European governments have warned soccer fans travelling to South Korea for
the 31 May -- 30 June [2002] World Cup to be careful to leave all food
behind when they return home and not to bring the disease back with them.
South Korea is co-hosting the finals with Japan and thousands of soccer
fans are expected to criss-cross the country to watch matches at the 10
venues. There are 10 stadiums in Japan, too.
Veterinary experts said this year's outbreak was less likely to have been
carried by wind because it had occurred only in pigs and had not hit
cattle, which would be more vulnerable to a wind-borne virus since they are
usually kept outdoors. The country breathed a collective sigh of relief on
Fri 17 May 2002 after a cow tested negative for the disease on a farm close
to a World Cup venue, Suwon -- a city south of Seoul. In an outbreak 2
years ago, the disease hit cattle in an area north of Seoul around Paju.
South Korea is Asia's third-largest economy and is seeking to use the World
Cup finals to underscore its location between China and Japan as a
potential business hub in northeast Asia. The latest outbreak has derailed
plans to resume 400 million dollars a year pork exports to Japan .
