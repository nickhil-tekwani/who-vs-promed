Ukraine
-------
A woman suspected of clinical anthrax has been hospitalized in the village
of Marshyntsi, in Ukraine's Chernivtsi region. She is the 3rd case since
Sun 18 Jul 2004. 2 other residents of the same village were also
hospitalized with anthrax diagnoses on Sun 18 Jul 2004. They had developed
symptoms of the disease, after livestock, infected with the virus
[bacterium not virus - Mod.DK], was slaughtered. The woman worked at a firm
which handled the slaughtered animals, and, was hospitalized on Tue 20 Jul
2004, the Ukrainian Emergency Situations Ministry reported.
Moldova
-------
2 cases of anthrax have also been registered in the village of Chenak, 100
km south of Chisinau in Moldova, where a married couple presumably caught
the disease from [butchering a sick] sheep. The head of Moldova's national
preventative medicine center, Arkady Gucu, told Interfax that the infected
and non-vaccinated animals were slaughtered without consultation with a
veterinarian. Anthrax was last reported in Moldova in 2002, when 3 people
contracted the disease.

[The Ukraine sees this disease at a low frequency, but in all species,
including horses and in wildlife, and thus, also in humans. Some 37 human
cases were reported in 1997, for example, but this was in ProMED not via
Geneva.
Unfortunately, it seems we have no previous anthrax reports from Moldova
within the ProMED archives. In the OIE annual reports, they usually have
2-5 bovine outbreaks per year. Like everyone else, it would appear that
they under-observe cases in sheep. I do, however, suspect that the
condition is truly sporadic in Moldova. The original report does not state
what form of anthrax the couple had, but, from a warning statement on
sores, it is presumably the cutaneous form, which is usual in these
circumstances. With antibiotic treatment, recovery from the cutaneous form
is usually good, although the lesion does take time to heal. This latter
delay sometimes encourages physicians to surgically excise the wound, which
is totally unnecessary. - Mod.MHJ]
