Nine districts in the centre of Portugal, including Lisbon and the Alentejo, have reported sheep affected by the bluetongue virus, a noncontagious insect-borne disease that can kill its victims within a week. Farmers in the areas affected are legally obliged to have their stock vaccinated, thus this outbreak should be contained fairly quickly. So far it is prevalent in Castelo Branco (all boroughs), Coimbra (Arganil, Oliveira do Hospital, and Tábua), Guarda (Gouveia, Fornos de Algodres, Seia), Viseu (Carregal do Sal, Castro Daire, Seia, Nelas, Tondela, and Viseu), and Santarém (all boroughs). Lisbon/Vale do Tejo and Santarém district have also registered cases, as have all districts and boroughs of the Alentejo.

[According to other local media sources, the bluetongue virus [BTV] serotypes involved in the described event are BTV4 and BTV1. This is yet to be confirmed.

The European Commission's (EC) bluetongue map (last updated 28 Jul 2022; https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-07/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map_0.pdf) presents Portugal as infected by both BTV1 and BTV4 in its very southern region (dark blue area); large parts of the remaining territories are regarded infected by BTV4 exclusively. The current event may present extension into free (white) areas.

Bluetongue (BT) is a WOAH-listed, infectious, vector-borne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants. The BT orbivirus, of which at least 27 serotypes are known, is primarily transmitted by certain species of _Culicoides_ midges. The global distribution of the disease is largely determined by the distribution of competent vectors. Infection with BTV is inapparent in the vast majority of animals but can cause fatal disease in susceptible breeds of sheep. Infection of cattle is usually subclinical, with the exception of BTV-8 infection. When apparent, clinical signs of BT are mainly attributable to an increase in vascular permeability and include fever, hyperaemia and congestion, facial oedema and haemorrhages, erosion of the mucous membranes, coronitis and laminitis, and pleural and pericardial haemorrhages. Cattle are particularly significant in the epidemiology of the disease due to the prolonged viraemia that occurs following infection. - Mod.AS
