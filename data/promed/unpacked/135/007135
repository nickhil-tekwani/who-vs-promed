A total of 9 people are in hospital including 4 children after an outbreak of anthrax in northern Russia, the first in 75 years. Of these, 2 are currently suspected of having contracted the deadly infection after a helicopter evacuation from the stricken district.

The alert came after a herd of reindeer were struck with anthrax in the Yamalsky district in Yamalo-Nenets autonomous region. The region is famed for its venison exports, including to Britain. Some 1200 reindeer died suddenly in the areas around Tarko-Sale but the authorities are unclear so far how many perished from anthrax. Others may have expired in a 30 deg C [approx. 86 deg F] heatwave which hit the region, straddling the Arctic Circle. Potentially infected animals are being culled, as are the young of mothers that succumbed to the infection.

A mass evacuation of 63 nomadic herders and their families is now underway from the stricken district, some 350 mi [approx. 563 km] south east of regional capital Salekhard. "As a preventive measure all the nomads from the area will be flown to another part of the tundra for preventive inoculation," said a spokesman for the local governor, Dmitry Kobylkin. "A helicopter has already been sent to their camp."

Mass vaccination of 'all nomads of Yamalsky district' has not been ruled out. "The contamination of a disease that can remain infectious for more than a century could have been from a herd uncovering the burial place of an infected reindeer from the past," reported The Siberian Times. The governor's spokesman admitted: "There are no cattle mortuaries in the area but considering the viability of the infectious agent of anthrax - 100 years and more - and its resistance to the change of temperatures, professionals assume that animals looking for food came across the site of an animal that died of anthrax and then infected each other." Officials say enormous precautions are being taken to burn and dispose of the remains of the infected animals, and to prevent any spread.

Fearful that venison exports can be hit - a key regional earner - they stressed that the infection is restricted to a single district of a sprawling region almost the size of Turkey. Senior veterinary official Vyacheslav Khritin said: "We will have to dispose the calves born this year that are left without mothers..... All the corpses that died over some 4 or 5 km [approx 2-3 mi] - we will gather them and build a large cattle cemetery."

The governor's spokesman insisted there was no threat to export of meat from the anthrax outbreak, the 1st in the region since 1941. Exports go to Germany, Sweden, Finland, and the UK. In recent years Lidl supermarket has obtained venison from an internationally recognised meat processing plant in Yar-Sale, around 95 miles from the outbreak. "There is no single chance that infected venison will make it to slaughter complex: all of them, each and every patch is thoroughly checked in line with the highest standards," he said. "We're interested in exporting high-quality venison just like it has always been. Our long-term history with foreign partners says that we are trusted and our reputation is precious. We're hoping that this situation will not impact on attitudes towards Yamal products."

[This report has an excellent map showing the location of this outbreak. As the Australians would say, it is beyond the black stump in the middle of nowhere but even so they clearly have had a respectable export program of reindeer meat. The only report of reindeer anthrax in Russia that I have is for 1999 when 300 cases were reported among reindeer on the Gynym River, Yakutia, NE Siberia. My memory tells me that there was a persistent problem at one time in reindeer/caribou in the Taymyr Peninsula.

How one acquires 1200 "anthrax" deaths is puzzling as around 100 deaths should have triggered a major response. As the writer hints there may have been a coincident health problem from the 30 deg C heatwave, which would anyway have significantly reduced the reindeer's innate resistance to any infection. Disposing efficiently of the carcasses presents problems. Just stacking them up in one place will provide future problems. What they need to do is to repeat the UK 2001 FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] livestock bonfires with the carcasses stacked in rows, say 3 m high, aligned a few degrees off the wind direction and use napalm; they don't have coal or wood in this part of the world.

When further inquiries are made I would not be surprised if they find that they had been sporadic reindeer deaths over the years in the summer and which were ignored, and of which some were anthrax. This would have allowed the pathogen to persist in the area in a semi-active mode. So far we just have an assertion that it is anthrax. No laboratory confirmation has been quoted. - Mod.MHJ
