Avian flu suspected at Missouri facility
----------------------------------------
A poultry facility in southwest Missouri was quarantined after the
discovery of a suspected case of bird flu, officials said. "As a
precaution, the poultry facility has been quarantined following
preliminary results obtained during routine testing," the Missouri
Department of Agriculture said in a news release.

Additional tests will authenticate the viral disease at the Polk
County facility, the state said Wednesday [30 Mar 2011], adding that
it is extremely rare for humans to be affected by this type of bird
flu.

Cargill Corp. will euthanize up to 15 000 younger birds exposed to
older turkeys that tested positive for bird flu antibodies, said Mike
Martin, director of communications for the company. Martin said
Thursday the older birds are being harvested at another Missouri
location. Their meat poses no health risk, he said.

Flocks within 6 miles of the facility are being tested. Test results
may be back as early as Friday [1 Apr 2011], Cargill said.

"At the time the tests were conducted, the birds had no symptoms of
the avian influenza. However, the antibodies mean at some time, the
animal immune systems responded to the avian influenza," Martin said.
"The flu could have been present in the water, ground, air or
transmitted by other migrating birds."

Cargill owns the birds but uses the farm under a contract, he said.

"This flu is not transferable to humans," Martin said. "The real
concern is for animals and the flu not being spread to other animal
herds."

The U.S Agriculture Department is monitoring the situation.

[While this virus is designated as low pathogenic avian influenza,
[see ProMED-mail post 20110402.1019] it remains a reportable disease.
It has already been reported to OIE. Even avian influenzas of low
pathogenic variety are of a concern and our trading partners watch
this closely as well. Cargill was very prudent in their decision to
act early and eliminate the treat, essentially prior to the
confirmation of the disease. - Mod.TG]
