GLANDERS, EQUINE - INDIA (03): (HARYANA) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Further information on the report of glanders in Haryana in India is desperately needed.

The press report and the ProMED-mail posting both imply that the affected animals are still alive, or at least there is no report of them having been slaughtered in line with current OIE recommendations.

The affected state is Haryana, whereas typically, Uttar Pradesh is the state in India associated with most outbreaks of glanders.

- Is there any history of movement from, or contact with horses from, Uttar Pradesh?
- How were the horses diagnosed?
- Was it through clinical signs, or was a serological test carried out, and if so why?
- What about in-contact horses?
- Have they been screened?
- Have any movement restrictions been put on these horses and the at-risk area?

Any further information that can be obtained and reported would be very much appreciated.

Abstract:
"Glanders is the contagious zoonotic disease caused by infection with _Burkholderia mallei_. It affects primarily horses, donkeys and mules. The disease was eradicated from large areas of the Western world in the early 20th century, but, over the last 10-20 years, has emerged and re-emerged in areas in which it was previously unknown or had been eradicated. Although glanders was previously thought to manifest in only acute or chronic presentations, it now appears that _B. mallei_ can produce latent infections similar to those caused by _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. These latent infections may or may not be detectable by current diagnostic tests. The diagnostic test currently recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties [OIE]) for international trade in equids is the complement fixation test (CFT). This test has been shown to have varying sensitivities and specificities depending on the antigen and methodology used. False positives are problematic for the horse-owner and veterinary authority, whereas false negatives may allow the reintroduction of _B. mallei_ into _B. mallei_-free areas. These gaps in knowledge of the epidemiology of glanders, and weaknesses in its diagnosis, coupled with the increased movement of equids, indicate that infection with _B. mallei_ remains a major risk in the context of international movement of equids". - Mod.AS
