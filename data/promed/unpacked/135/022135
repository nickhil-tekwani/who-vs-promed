The Barry-Eaton District Health Department was told Thursday [3 Sep 2020] a horse in Barry County died from eastern equine encephalitis.

The health department said there have been 13 confirmed cases of EEE in horses in Michigan. The deceased animal became ill on 26 Aug 2020.

Eaton County and Barry County have not reported any other cases of EEE in either humans or animals.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has reported 4 cases in Clare County, one case in Kent County, 4 cases in Montcalm County, 2 in Newaygo County, and one in Oakland County. All the cases in the state have been tested in horses, and there have been no cases reported in humans in Michigan.

Humans can get EEE through infected mosquitoes, and [the disease] has the potential to be serious, though most cases do not cause symptoms. People over 60 and under 15 are at the greatest risk for developing severe symptoms.

There is a vaccine for horses, but not for humans.

The Barry-Eaton health department recommends using insect repellents with DEET or other products approved by the EPA, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants outside, maintaining window screens, and keeping stagnate water from forming around a home.

The health department also advises anyone who sees an animal behaving strangely or looks sick to contact the Michigan Department of Natural Resources at 800-292-7800 or fill out an observation form at the DNR website (https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ORS/Home).

The Jackson County Health Department (JCHD) has announce it received information a horse has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). It is the 19th case diagnosed in a horse to date, and so far there are no human cases in either Jackson County or the state.

The information came from the State departments of MDHHS and MDARD, and JCHD is taking this single confirmed positive EEE horse case very seriously by providing the public and local officials with additional information as it becomes available.

EEE is a rare, deadly virus that is transmitted to horses, deer, and humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. [It may be rare in humans, but sadly it is not rare in unvaccinated horses. - Mod.TG] It is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the United States, with a 33% fatality rate in people who become ill and a 90% fatality rate in horses becoming ill. Signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, and body and joint aches. EEE can develop into severe encephalitis, resulting in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures, and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, coma, and death may also occur in some cases. The JCHD recommends that anyone who develops any of these signs seek medical attention immediately.

Michigan is beginning to experience widespread animal activity of EEE. The activity is occurring mostly in the mid-Michigan area between Grand Rapids and Clare. Now, with Jackson County's case, Michigan has had 19 confirmed horse cases to date.

Rashmi Travis, Jackson County Health Department Health Officer, said, "At this time and with an abundance of caution, JCHD recommends everyone limit their outdoor events and activities occurring during dusk to dawn and take other precautions, such as the use of repellent sprays and long-sleeved shirts and pants. The dusk-to-dawn hours are the prime hours when the mosquitoes, responsible for the transmission of EEE, generally come out."

Travis added, "These precautionary measures should continue until the 1st hard frost decreases the mosquito population."

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases in Michigan are on track to exceed those documented in 2019, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

To date, 18 equine EEE cases have been confirmed. Of the cases, 3 reside in District Health Department No. 10's jurisdiction: one in Mecosta County, and 2 in Newaygo County.

In 2019, 10 human cases of EEE were documented, including 6 deaths, and 50 cases were found in animals.

EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases that can be transmitted to both animals and people. In Michigan, the virus is typically seen in late summer to early fall and poses a risk to both animals and humans until mid-October.

With the rise in EEE cases, DHD#10 is strongly encouraging horse owners to vaccinate their animals and for Michiganders to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves against mosquito bites through the 2nd hard frost by following the below precautions:

To protect your horses and other domestic animals (such as dogs, sheep, and goats), measures could include the following:
- Talking to a veterinarian about vaccinating horses against EEE.
- Placing livestock in a barn under fans (as mosquitos are not strong flyers) during peak mosquito activity from dusk to dawn.
- Using an insect repellant on an animal that is approved for the species.
- Eliminating standing water on the property (i.e., fill in puddles, repair eaves, and change the water in buckets and bowls at least once a day).
- Contacting a veterinarian if an animal shows signs of the illness: fever and stumbling, which can progress to being down and struggling to stand.

To protect yourself and your family, here's what you should do now:
- Apply insect repellents that contain the active ingredient DEET, or other U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved products, to exposed skin or clothing, and always follow the manufacturer's directions for use.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to clothing to help prevent bites.
- Maintain window and door screening to help keep mosquitoes outside.
- Empty water from mosquito breeding sites around the home, such as buckets, unused children's pools, old tires, or similar sites where mosquitoes may lay eggs.
- Use nets and/or fans over outdoor eating areas.

A horse in the Red Hill area near Maxton has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis, the 1st case in the county since 2012, according to the Robeson County Health Department director, Bill Smith. "This 5-year-old mare was unvaccinated," he said.

The horse was tested 10 Aug [2020] after experiencing difficulty breathing, and the results were confirmed this week. Smith said typical signs include fever, drooping lips/eyelids, and a rapid heartbeat.

Southeastern Veterinary Hospital treated the horse, and the horse is said to be at home and stable.

"This particular horse was recovering at last report," Smith said.

Robeson joins Brunswick, Carteret, Camden, Columbus, Bladen, and Durham counties in confirmed EEE cases this year [2020] in North Carolina.

Horses have become sentinel animals for EEE and West Nile virus because they are easy prey for mosquitoes, Smith said. There are vaccinations for both of these viruses for horses, but not for humans.

"This virus kills 30% of the humans contracting it and is even more fatal to horses," Smith said.

Eastern equine encephalitis is spread by mosquitoes. It is a rare virus causing a brain infection. Only a few cases are reported each year in the United States, with the majority of them occurring in the Gulf states and the eastern part of the country. Transmission is from one type mosquito to a bird, which then has another type mosquito bites the bird and subsequently a human or another mammal. The mosquito types locally are capable of this transmission. Once the human or other mammal acquires the virus, it cannot be further transmitted from them.

"Residents should use mosquito precautions including repellents, wearing long sleeves, avoiding outdoor activities at dusk/dawn, wearing light-colored clothing, and emptying water basins/pots/bowls weekly," Smith said. "Robeson County does not have a county-wide mosquito abatement program, so individuals must protect themselves."

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health said on Thursday [10 Sep 2020] that a 7-year-old crossbred gelding horse in Aitkin County died and was confirmed to have eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) last week.

The Minnesota Department of Health reported the positive results to the board. They also reported the animal was negative for other diseases of concern including rabies, western equine encephalitis (WEE), and West Nile virus encephalitis (WNV).

Before its death, the horse was reportedly showing clinical signs of neurologic disease including staggering, impaired vision, and excessive drooling. Samples were initially submitted to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for rabies testing. The rabies samples tested negative, and additional tests were ordered for the other diseases.

"The diseases EEE, WEE, and WNV in horses can be limited through vaccination protocols and decreased exposure to mosquitoes," said Board Senior Veterinarian Dr. Brian Hoefs. "While COVID-19 has restricted many equine-related activities, it is imperative to be vigilant about annual preventative care, including core vaccinations. We encourage all horse owners to work with their veterinarians to develop strategies for preventing EEE/WEE/WNV exposure and illness in their horses."

The horse had no history of travel over the past 3 months and a reported last vaccination for EEE 18 months ago. At least 11 other horses remaining on the premises appear healthy at this time and have subsequently received vaccinations for all viruses and conditions mentioned with boosters pending, according to the board.

EEE can cause fatal infections in horses and people. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes. Horses and people are considered "dead-end hosts," meaning they are unable to transmit the disease to other horses or people. In horses, EEE is fatal in more than 90% of cases. Clinical signs include fever, lethargy, not eating, and walking aimlessly.

Even though people cannot contract the disease from horses, cases in horses are a clear indication that infected mosquitoes are in the area and can infect humans.

Clinical signs of EEE in people can include high fever, muscle pain, altered mental status, headache, photophobia, and seizures. These symptoms typically occur between 3 and 10 days after the [bite] of an infected mosquito.

[The take-home message, which every horse owner needs to pay close attention to, is make sure your animal's vaccination is current. Recall that protection against EEE wanes rather quickly, about 3 months, and in long seasons it is advisable to revaccinate.

Vaccinations are generally in combination (EEE, WEE, and WNV). Rabies is a separate injection, and it is highly advisable to also vaccinate for rabies.

Use horse-approved mosquito/fly sprays and eliminate standing water where mosquitoes breed. - Mod.TG
