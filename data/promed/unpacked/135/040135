A total of 6 people have been hospitalized with anthrax in southern
Kyrgyzstan after eating contaminated beef, the country's emergencies
ministry said on Tuesday [15 Jul 2008].

A total of 167 people are known to have eaten the infected beef, and 6
cases of infection with the lethal disease have been confirmed in the
Central Asian country's Osh Region. The condition of the other 161 is being
monitored.

Vets have decontaminated the site where an infected cow was put down and
incinerated.

The outbreak is the 2nd in about a month in southern Kyrgyzstan. In early
June [2008], 7 people were hospitalized with anthrax in the neighboring
Jalalabad region, of whom one died.

A total of 475 people who have come into contact with infected cattle are
undergoing preventive treatment.

[This report -- delayed just in case there were any further updates from
Bishkek -- gives us an attack rate for eating contaminated beef in Osh of
6/167 or 3.6 per cent, which may explain why people put themselves at such
risk. Of course if there is a communal habit of eating such meat we can
expect that the community immunity has been increased by repeated past
exposures, which will feed this habit. - Mod.MHJ]
