Hemorrhagic syndrome of Japanese macaques
-----------------------------------------
Overview:
We have 790 Japanese monkeys among 1216 monkeys of 13 species, as of
11 Jun 2010. During the phase, 2001-02, we had 6 deaths out of 7 sick
animals. During the 2nd phase, we had 38 deaths out of 39 sick animals.

Two points should be underlined:
1. Humans don't have this disease.
2. We assume this is a disease not yet known. [A new disease entity? - Mod. AS]

We did thorough sanitation using Vilcon hypochlorous acid/Bayer) and
controlled infected animals individually.

Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------
Q1: Are humans infected?
A1: No similar case has been seen in humans during the last 10 years;
therefore, human infection probably not to be expected.
Q2: What other disease demonstrates similar symptoms in monkeys?
A2: None.
Q3: Any sex or age-related susceptibility recorded?
A3: No significant differences in any such analyses.
Q4: What is the cause?
A4: Not known yet, though an infective agent is highly suspected,
specific to macaques. We believe there is a very high chance of infection.
Q5: Has the disease been seen in wild monkeys?
A5: No reported cases. However, the current publication of the cases
may help in obtaining more information.
Q6: Is there another example in Japan and overseas?
A6: As far as investigated, other cases have not been similar.
Following the current publication, we are awaiting a response from
the scientific community.
Q7: Are there comparable diseases in humans?
A7: The symptom "aplastic anemia" in humans is comparable.
Q8: What happens when the monkeys develop the symptoms?
A8: Decreased appetite, recumbency, pale faces. Bleeding from the
nasal mucosa, blood is attached to the lip, subcutaneous bleeding.
The main symptom is dark brown and mushy stool. High mortality. In
blood counts, low counts of platelets, erythrocytes, and leucocytes.
At the end platelet count reaches zero, and this is the most
pronounced finding.
Q9: What is the duration from onset to death?
A9: Rapid; Ichigaini says -- 1 to 2 weeks.
Q10: Which disease agents have been screened for?
A10: 6 bacterial agents and 16 viruses which may cause bone marrow
suppression, all found negative. Investigations are still in progress.
Q11: What measures to control the cases have been applied?
A11: Disinfectants such as hypochlorous acid disinfectant solution
and other applicable biosecurity and biosafety measures.
Q12: What other measures are considered for future application?
A12: This depends on further findings, and on consultations with
other institutes addressing hemorrhagic diseases. This will include
the establishment of screening tests.
Q13: Why has the announcement on the syndrome been made at this time?
A13: The intention was to make the issue known without causing
unnecessary public anxiety while still not recognising the cause of
the syndrome. The article reviewed the past 10 years, we will work
tirelessly to discover a cause, and publish accurate and factual data
as they become available.
Q14: Are the Monkey Centre and Primate Research Institute the same
organization?
A14: The Japan Monkey Centre is an independent private property and
the Primate Research Institute is part of Kyoto University. They are
different institutions.
Q15: : Are the monkeys in the "Japan Monkey Centre" dangerous or not?
A15: There have not been cases in the "Japan Monkey Centre" and there
is no exchange of animals between the 2 establishments.
Q16: Who should be contacted if a similar syndrome is discovered or
suspected elsewhere?
A16: The "Primate Research Institute for Disease Control Committee"
should be contacted at <cdc@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
In reference to the story above.

We may be able to help and would like to get in touch with the institute.

My name is Reed Johnson I work for the [US] National Institutes of
Health, NIAID. We are currently studying simian hemorrhagic fever
virus and other hemorrhagic fever viruses. We may be able to provide
diagnostic and other support.
