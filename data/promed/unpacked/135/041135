[1] Cholera - South Sudan (Unity State)

A young boy has died and 16 people admitted into hospital in Bentiu hospital, after a suspected cholera outbreak in Hayingas and Tiedbar villages within Bentiu town and Rubkotna County [Unity State].

Payuan Puok, a medical doctor at Bentiu Hospital, told Sudan Tribune on Monday [11 Jun 2012], that 3 days of heavy rainfall had caused the outbreak of the waterborne decease. Puok added that about 8 people came to hospital on Sunday, 10 Jun 2012, with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea. He urged on the community to be careful as the onset of the rainy season begins. "The condition of the 8 people who arrived was better than those who had waited and extra day to go to hospital," he said. This delay had led to the death of a boy and the critical condition of another. He also warns the community to take care of their families by promoting proper hygiene as the rains continue. Many people in South Sudan drink untreated river water, which is also used for washing and other things.

Puok called on the government and all citizens of Unity State to create awareness and to promote good hygiene in the home to prevent flies spreading germs on food. Despite South Sudan becoming an independent state last year [2011], the nation faces many challenges in terms of health facilities and awareness across its 10 states.

The secretary of state for public health was in Bamenda on 7 Jun 2012 to sensitize the public. While presenting the situation of cholera outbreak since 2010, the North West regional delegate for public health, Dr Victor Ndiforchu, said enough sensitization has been carried out in the region on the dangers of the disease. He disclosed that from December 2010 to July 2011, the region recorded 143 cases with 9 deaths. "Since August 2011, no case has been recorded," he said.

Bafut Subdivision was the hardest hit with 25 cases and 7 deaths. Some health personnel have been trained to manage any emergency while some drugs were equally distributed. Furthermore, an ambulance to rush suspected cases to the hospital was also made available.

On his part, the governor of the North West Region, Adolphe Lele L'Afrique said the fight against cholera concerns everyone and appreciated the contributions of some civil society organisations.

[3] Cholera - Ghana (Upper East Region)

http://allafrica.com/stories/201206120397.html


Between 27 May 2012 and 6 Jun 2012, Navrongo has recorded 43 cases of cholera, with 2 deaths. Last month [May 2012], Navrongo, capital of the Kassena-Nankana East District, and Paga, capital of the Kassena-Nankana West District [Upper East Region], recorded 14 cases and 1 death each.

The Medical Superintendent at the War Memorial Hospital, Navrongo, Dr Abdulai Forgor, told this reporter in a telephone interview that since the outbreak of cholera in the town, the hospital records cases of the disease on a daily basis. He said almost all the cases reported at the hospital had symptoms of diarrhea, and are often sent to the laboratory, where they are tested and confirmed as cholera cases.

Dr Forgor said the Ghana Health Service had started doing public education on the emergence of cholera in the district, and has intensified public education on the need for people to keep the environment clean and maintain personal hygiene at all times. He attributed the outbreak of the disease to the filth engulfing the town. A walk through Navrongo town revealed that residents were indiscriminately dumping refuse, and the assembly was also not doing enough to clear the filth.

Following the outbreak, district directors of the Ghana Health Service in the 2 districts have directed their health educators and other volunteers to intensify their education on clean environments and personal hygiene in their homes, market places, and communities.

To date, 5 persons are reported dead in Atebubu in the Brong Ahafo region following the fresh outbreak of cholera in the area. So far, 97 cases have been reported in the epidemic, leaving 5 dead within 9 days, deputy Brong Ahafo regional public health director of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Dr Emmanuel Tinkorang, has told Daily Guide.

The latest figures will likely cause the national figures, which stood at 64 deaths and over 4000 cases as of May 2012, to shoot up. The Accra metropolis is said to be leading with 2756 cases and 31 deaths. According to Dr Tinkorang, Atebubu recorded 14 cases in the 1st week of the outbreak with one death.

The deputy director disclosed that most of the early reported cases came from the Zongo community.
