Infected mosquitoes are known to be buzzing in 16 states so far, and 5
people [in the United States] are already battling [West nile virus
infection] in its most severe form. Scientists fear the rubble-strewn Gulf
Coast in particular is ripe for a bad outbreak. How bad this year will be
depends on the weather. Anywhere that's especially hot and dry should watch
out.
It also depends on birds -- robins and house sparrows, to be exact. Forget
the dying crows that became notorious in West Nile's early days. How
mosquitoes feed on these smaller backyard birds seems more important in
determining how much virus circulates in communities -- especially in July
and August, the disease's worst months.
West Nile virus has infected a surprising 1.2 million to 1.3 million people
in the United States in just the 7 years since it first struck the nation,
estimates Dr Lyle Petersen of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). Most people didn't know it: About one in 5 people develop symptoms,
and fewer get the life-threatening disease. Still, West Nile has killed
almost 800 people in the US in that brief period, and caused severe
neurologic illness, meningitis or encephalitis, in more than 8300. Others
are left with polio-like paralysis.
Even the less severe West Nile fever is "really quite a horrible kind of
illness," says Petersen. He caught the disease himself in 2003 -- spending a
week in bed and a month afterward battling bone-deep fatigue -- and he
worries that people don't take the threat seriously enough.
Scientists can't predict where the virus will strike each year, but recent
research shows: (1) West Nile virus grows faster and more plentifully inside
a mosquito's body when it's really hot. (2) Just about any mosquito can
carry West Nile virus, but the biggest carrier, the _Culex_ breed, thrives
in small amounts of nutrient-rich water, such as the muddy puddles left when
ponds dry out in a hot, dry summer. Even drops left under dense leaves in
irrigated fields or in the bottoms of flower pots can be enough. (3)
Hurricanes don't spur West Nile. Instead, heavy rains temporarily flush out
the tiny pools where mosquitoes have laid eggs. Yet CDC fears that New
Orleans and the Gulf Coast are ripe for a surge in West Nile this summer
because of the rubble left by Hurricane Katrina last year, full of
water-collecting crevices that make perfect mosquito breeding grounds. (4)
Birds are the incubators key to West Nile virus's spread. Some, like crows,
die quickly when bitten by an infected mosquito. Others, particularly robins
and house sparrows, build up high levels of the virus without dying off,
able to then infect more mosquitoes. When it's hot and dry, those birds
compete with mosquitoes for the same scarce water supplies -- close contact
that spurs more bug bites. (5) And scientists who checked the stomach
contents of live mosquitoes found that one big West Nile carrier tends to
mostly bite robins until June, when those birds finish nesting and start
migrating. Then, rather than filling the gap with just other birds, the bugs
bite more people in late summer.
Since it emerged in New York City in 1999, West Nile virus has spread from
coast to coast. Only Maine and Washington have no diagnosed cases yet,
despite finding the virus in mosquitoes and other animals in summers past.
Already this year, doctors are reporting the neurologic form of West Nile in
5 people in California, Colorado, Mississippi, and Texas. All donated blood
is tested for West Nile, to prevent transfusions from symptom-free but
infected people, and CDC hopes those tests will also act as an early warning
signal of impending outbreaks -- in addition to mosquito testing that has
uncovered infection in 16 states and counting.
Older people and organ transplant recipients are most at risk of
life-threatening disease, while, mysteriously, the polio-like muscle
weakness tends to strike people in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. But the sad
truth is that West Nile can strike anyone, and there's no vaccine yet. Hence
CDC wants people to use mosquito repellents as routinely as they do seat
belts, so they'll be covered wherever and whenever the virus pops up.

US CDC/ArboNET report (2006): 2006 West Nile virus activity in the US
(as reported to CDC by Tue 27 Jun 2006)*
----------------------------------------
*[Currently, West Nile virus (WNV) maps are updated weekly to reflect
surveillance reports released by state and local health departments to CDC's
ArboNET system for public distribution.]
As of Tue 27 June 2006 avian, animal, or mosquito WNV infections have been
reported to CDC ArboNET from the following states: Arkansas, California,
Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee,
Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
Human cases have been reported in Colorado, Mississippi, and Texas.
Maps detailing county-level human, mosquito, veterinary, avian and sentinel
data are published each week on the collaborative USGS/CDC West Nile virus
web site: <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov/>
As of 27 Jun 2006 the number of human cases and disease manifestations
remain unchanged from those recorded in the previous week (13 Jun 2006):
State / Neuroinvasion* / West Nile fever** / Other*** / Total**** / Deaths
Colorado / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0
Mississippi / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0
Texas / 2 / 0 / 0 / 2 / 0
Totals: 4 / 0 / 0 / 4 / 0
* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by state
and local health departments.
[See previous update for case definitions].
Total human cases reported to CDC: these numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases that occurred and have been reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments since 1 Jan 2006. ArboNET is the
national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist states
in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses. Information
regarding 2006 virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported
to CDC.
All of the 4 cases were reported as West Nile meningitis or encephalitis
(neuroinvasive disease), none was reported as West Nile fever (milder
disease), and none was clinically unspecified at this time. Please refer to
state health department web sites for further details regarding state case
totals.

[The reporting of WNV in the western hemisphere in the US CDC/ArboNET Report
(2006) has begun slightly later than in previous years. The number of US
states reporting West Nile virus activity has increased from 14 to 22 since
that reported on 13 Jun 2006. The 2006 surveillance program of Public Health
Agency of Canada has not yet begun. - Mod.CP]
