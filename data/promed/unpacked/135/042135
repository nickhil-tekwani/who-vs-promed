A case of trypanosomiasis infected in Serengeti diagnosed in Sydney
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In January 1998 a 30 year old Australian woman visited the Serengeti park
for several days before returning to Sydney. She became ill 24 hours after
her return, with fever, rigors and headache. Initial examination of blood
films for malaria revealed nothing but, when the illness persisted for 3
days she was referred to this hospital where numerous trypanosomes were
found. She was initially treated with pentamidine and, when it became
available, suramin. She made a full recovery.
This was the first case of African trypanosomiasis seen in Australia for 50
years, the only other known infection having been acquired in West Africa
during WWII.

Extract of GIDEON background data on trypanosomiasis in Tanzania:
1922 - 29: 855 per year
1930 - 39: 1281
1940 - 49: 735
1950 - 59: 711
1960 - 69: 583
1970 - 79: 501
1980 - 89: 351
1990 - 98: 367

[The third case just emphasizes the need for data on tsetse flies in
Serengeti National park. The background data show the notified number of
cases which probably is quite incomplete. The declining number of cases
could just reflect poor surveillance and reporting systems. The WHO report
from 1986 "Epidemiology and control of African trypanosomiasis" (WHO
Technical Report series no. 739) found that surveillance was reduced in
known foci and reporting inadequate and predicted a resurgence of
trypanosomiasis due to depleted health services in African countries. We
would be interested to receive a comment from the Tanzanian Ministry of
Health. - Mod.EP
