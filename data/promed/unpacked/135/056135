Meningitis B cases among students in England are rising sharply and are exceeding pre-pandemic levels according to the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The NHS [National Health Service] states meningitis as being an inflammation of the lining around your brain and spinal cord. It is potentially fatal if not treated quickly. Meningococcal group B bacteria are cause of life-threatening infections including meningitis and sepsis that can cause brain damage, epilepsy, hearing loss, the loss of limbs, and death. This is despite most of the population being vaccinated against it as children.

Linda Glennie from the Meningitis Research Foundation said: "The data published by UKHSA have highlighted that students, particularly those living on campuses, have a higher risk of meningococcal disease than their peers. Meningitis progresses rapidly, so it's critical to alert someone if ill, and to seek urgent medical advice." [See item 2 below.]

The data also highlight teenagers and young adults as at particular risk. From September to November 2021, 41.5% of meningitis cases occurred in those aged 15-19 years, compared with 11.8% and 14.3% during the same period in 2018 and 2019. [See citation and abstract below.]

Why are meningitis cases rising? Successive COVID-19 lockdowns saw levels of viruses drop to a historic low, with the public taking increased measures to stay safe by improving personal hygiene, wearing masks and socially distancing. Since measures have been relaxed, however, cases of cold, flu and indeed meningitis have skyrocketed. A "rebound" effect was expected when restrictions eased, but meningitis cases now exceed pre-pandemic levels.

The UKHSA suggests that the rise in cases could be down to a combination of factors. This includes high levels of transmission in young people as they return to school and universities in person for the first time in months. The other factor researchers suggest is an "immunity debt". This means individuals have lower immunity to infectious diseases due to not being exposed to them in day-to-day life during lockdown.

Throughout 2020 and 2021, restrictions to reduce transmission of COVID-19 also led to rapid reductions in transmission of some types of meningitis-causing bacteria, with rates of meningococcal disease at a historic low until September 2021.

That low is now showing early evidence of reversing, with cases of meningococcal disease in teenagers and young adults rising sharply through autumn 2021. Based on UKHSA data, cases in 15-19 year olds are now exceeding pre-pandemic levels, with nearly all cases caused by meningococcal group B (MenB).

In contrast, meningococcal group W (MenW) accounted for just 6% of cases, and no cases of MenY or MenC were observed from September to November 2021. This suggests that the MenACWY vaccination programme, targeted at teenagers since 2015, is maintaining low rates of the disease.

The UKHSA data begin to confirm the dangers of a post-lockdown infectious disease rebound, something leading charities, led by the Meningitis Research Foundation, warned of in December 2021, following reports of cases in universities, including the University of Exeter. Of all the confirmed cases among the 15-19 and 20-24 age groups from September to November 2021, 85% (22 of the 26 confirmed cases) were college and university students.

Linda Glennie, director of research, evidence and policy at the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: "It's encouraging to see that the MenACWY vaccine is working, and important for everyone eligible to get the vaccine. However, teenagers and young adults remain susceptible to MenB disease and are not eligible for routine MenB vaccine, due to low case numbers in this age-group since the vaccine was introduced for babies.

[Five main meningococcal serogroups (serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y) cause disease. Meningococcal disease is a life-threatening infection that can progress rapidly to a fatal outcome. Many of those who survive have a permanent disability, such as brain damage, epilepsy, hearing loss, or amputation.

Before 1999, when meningococcal serogroup C vaccination (MenC) program was introduced in the UK, most cases of meningococcal disease in the UK were caused by serogroup C. Since then, cases of serogroup C have fallen dramatically in the UK. In the past 10 years, about 90% of cases of meningococcal disease in the UK have been caused by serogroup B (MenB), most commonly in babies and young children (https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/menb-vaccine).

The meningococcal vaccination schedule in the UK now consists of MenB vaccine at 8 and 16 weeks of age, with a MenB vaccine booster and MenC vaccine at 12 months of age. In addition, a meningococcal vaccine that targets serogroups A, C, W and Y (MenACWY) is given at 14 years of age (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/nhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/).

Meningococcal B vaccine was introduced into the UK vaccination schedule in September 2015. Subsequently, there was an estimated 72% reduction in the number of cases of invasive MenB disease in infants in the 2nd year of the program, with a further estimated 60% reduction in cases in the 3rd year of the program (https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/menb-vaccine). However, in autumn 2021 there was an increase in the number of cases of meningococcal disease in teenagers and young adults in the UK, mainly caused by group B meningococcal disease -- with the majority occurring among university students (see items 1 and 2 above).

The UK National Health Service recommends that students entering university or college for the first time, who have not yet had the MenACWY vaccine, should be vaccinated with that vaccine, "because many of them mix closely with lots of new people, some of whom may unknowingly carry the meningococcal bacteria at the back of their nose and throat" (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/men-acwy-vaccine/). Because of the rapid progression of meningococcal disease in an infected individual, it would seem the most reasonable option is disease prevention by including MenB vaccine in their vaccination recommendations to entering university students.

Abstract
--------
"In July 2021, COVID-19 containment measures were withdrawn in England. Between September and November 2021, IMD cases increased with group B disease in adolescents/young adults rising sharply and exceeding pre-pandemic levels. The serogroup and age distribution of these cases suggests that meningococcal vaccination programmes are maintaining low rates of group C/W/Y disease; however low immunity against group B strains and high transmission of meningococci among adolescents/young adults resulted in the return of group B disease, particularly in university students." - Mod.ML
