Sara Lee Corp. is, according to this story, recalling hot dogs and other
packaged meats, some sold under well-known brands like Ball Park and
Hygrade, because they could contain _Listeria_.
Sara Lee officials were cited as saying today that the affected brands were
produced by the company's Bil Mar Foods unit in Zeeland, Mich. The products
include some brands distributed throughout the United States, as well as
some regional brands.
George A. Chivari, president and chief executive officer of Bil Mar Foods,
was quoted as saying in a news release that, "The safety of everyone who
eats our products is our No. 1 priority, and therefore we are voluntarily
taking this precautionary measure."
Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen was cited as saying that Sara Lee is
cooperating with an investigation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention into reports of food poisoning that might have been caused
by the _Listeria_ bacteria in certain meat products although she could give
no details of the reported cases. The story notes that a CDC spokeswoman
did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. The affected
products are coded EST P261 or EST 6911 and include the Ball Park, Bil Mar,
Bryan Bunsize and Bryan 3-pound Club Pack hot dogs, Grillmaster, Hygrade,
Mr. Turkey, Sara Lee Deli Meat and Sara Lee Home Roast brands. The Sara Lee
spokeswoman did not know how many packages were involved in the recall.
Consumers can return any affected packages to the place of purchase for a
full refund.
An official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was cited
in the Dow Jones story as confirming that the CDC has made a "provisional"
determination that an outbreak of listeriosis which has killed at least
four people can be traced to hot dogs made at a Michigan plant owned by
Sara Lee Corp. (SLE).
Dr. Stephen Ostroff, associate director at the CDC's National Center for
Infectious Diseases was quoted as saying, "We're not at the end of the
investigation," but he said that Sara Lee is the only company included in
the CDC's investigation of the recent outbreak involving the _Listeria_
bacteria. He praised the company, saying Sara Lee has "proactively taken a
stance to protect the public's health."
In some cases, some of the patients still had open containers of the
suspect hot dogs in their refrigerators, and the specific strain of
_Listeria_ turned up in one package of Sara Lee-manufactured franks.
Ostroff was quoted as saying, "That's another very strong piece of
information," because "the strain that is actually causing this outbreak is
not very commonly seen."
Those various pieces of information, Ostroff said, "seemed to lead back ...
to this specific facility."
It is "problematic," Ostroff said, to determine how far back the
contamination at the plant occurred. It is possible that, if some of the
early cases of the outbreak occurred in early August, that the
contamination could have occurred in the plant's July production.
Ostroff reiterated that "a lot of lab work remains to be done" before the
CDC will be in a position to make a definitive determination as to the
source of the outbreak.
