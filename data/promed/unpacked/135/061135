According to ITAR-TASS, 51 animals died as a result of classical
swine fever (CSF). The chief of the ministry of emergency situations,
Eduard Trunin, said that 31 pigs were left in their household, all
vaccinated. "However," he added, "there is no guarantee that they
will survive."
The spread of CSF has been controlled due to the timely application
of quarantine measures. However, there was a problem with the burial
of animal carcasses in Volgograd. According to chief veterinarian
Kremnev, in the absence of appropriate land-fills for the disposal of
the cadavers, animal cadavers had to be burned, using old car tires as fuel.

[From the above newswire, it is not clear whether the outbreak has
resolved; continued disposal of carcasses might be indicative of the
presence of infected or suspected animals, leading to their culling or burning.
Russia's last report on CSF dates back to 21 Feb 2007; according to
OIE's requirements, this should have been followed by weekly
follow-up reports until the disease is declared endemic or has
resolved. - Mod.AS]
