On 5 Mar 2012, the California Department of Public Health was notified of 9 cases of clinically diagnosed fungal endophthalmitis at a single California ambulatory surgical center. The initial investigation, led by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, determined that in all cases, patients had undergone vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peeling using a dye called Brilliant Blue-G (BBG) from Franck's Compounding Lab, Ocala, Florida. This investigation has since expanded to involve intravitreal injection of triamcinolone-containing products from Franck's, an overall total of 33 cases in 7 states, and collaboration between state and local health departments, CDC, and the FDA. This report describes the current investigative findings. Clinicians should be aware of the ongoing investigation and should avoid use of compounded products labeled as sterile from Franck's during this ongoing investigation.

A probable case is defined as ophthalmologist-diagnosed fungal endophthalmitis occurring in a patient who underwent an invasive ophthalmic procedure, including but not limited to vitrectomy, corneal surgery, or intravitreal injections on or after 23 Aug 2011, the production date of the contaminated BBG lot. Confirmed cases meet criteria for probable infection and also have fungi identified from the affected eye by culture, genetic sequencing, or histopathology. Active case-finding in this investigation has included calls for cases through Epi-X postings, FDA MedWatch alerts, ClinMicroNet microbiology laboratories, e-mails sent to all members of 2 professional ophthalmology societies, and state and local health alerts.

As of 30 Apr 2012, a total of 33 confirmed and probable cases have been identified, with earliest onset of symptoms in November 2011. Of these, 20 cases (13 probable and 7 confirmed) are associated with BBG dye use, and 13 (2 probable and 11 confirmed) are associated with triamcinolone use. All BBG or triamcinolone products administered to patients reportedly were purchased from Franck's. All available isolates from the 7 confirmed cases associated with BBG dye use were identified by culture or genetic sequencing as the mold _Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti_ species complex. All available isolates from the 11 confirmed cases that occurred following intravitreal injection of triamcinolone-containing products have been identified as the mold _Bipolaris hawaiiensis_. Both fungal genuses are ubiquitous molds present in air, soil, and water. Among the 30 patients for whom data are available, 23 (77 percent) have suffered some degree of vision loss, ranging from partial to severe, or worsened vision because of infection; 24 (80 percent) have required repeat ophthalmic surgery.

Culture of unopened bottles and intact (unused, pharmacy-prepared) syringes of BBG dye collected by FDA yielded multiple bacterial and fungal species, including _F. incarnatum-equiseti_ species complex, _Rhodotorula_, _Bullera_ [also a mold - Mod.LL], _Pseudomonas_, and _Enterobacter_ species. Microbiologic testing of triamcinolone-containing products from Franck's is ongoing. On 9 Mar 2012, Franck's recalled all BBG dye lots; on 31 Mar 2012, a single lot of triamcinolone was recalled. The investigation to identify the root cause of product contamination is ongoing. The pharmacy has not recalled or halted production of other sterile compounded products, which, in addition to ophthalmic preparations, include chemotherapy and numerous other medications administered by injection (including intrathecal and epidural), inhalation, and intranasal routes.

Postprocedural endophthalmitis is uncommon, complicating 0.04 percent of either intravitreal injections or pars plana vitrectomies (1,2). The majority of these infections are bacterial; fungal infection is rare and often is diagnosed only after a patient has failed empiric antibacterial therapy. Clinicians are encouraged to be vigilant for post-procedure adverse events, particularly among patients who have received a product labeled as sterile from Franck's, and should consider methods to confirm and treat possible fungal infection.

Compounding pharmacies, which combine or alter medications from standard preparations, provide needed formulations that often are not available from pharmaceutical companies. Compounded sterile preparations must be prepared according to aseptic practices recommended by organizations such as the United States Pharmacopeia, as stated in the United States Pharmacopeia-National Formulary (3). However, contamination of compounded sterile preparations has caused outbreaks. Since 1990, FDA has learned of approximately 200 adverse events associated with 71 compounded products (4). A recent outbreak of bacterial endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection of contaminated bevacizumab occurred after breaches in aseptic technique at a different compounding pharmacy (5).

Because of the seriousness of endophthalmitis and because the full extent of the outbreak and root cause of contamination remain unknown, CDC recommends that, at this time, clinicians avoid use of compounded products labeled as sterile from Franck's. Health-care providers should maintain a heightened suspicion for infections among patients who received compounded products labeled as sterile from Franck's and should report suspected infections to their local and state health departments for further investigation. Patients also should avoid use of compounded products labeled as sterile from Franck's and report adverse events or suspected infections promptly to their physician.

[Fungal endophthalmitis is infrequent but usually causes poor visual outcomes. It can be exogenous or endogenous, depending upon the mode of infection. The common causes for endogenous, post-traumatic, post-surgical, and those secondary to keratitis are _Candida albicans_, _Aspergillus niger_, and _Fusarium solani_, respectively. Clinical features depend on the virulence of the organism and the mode of infection. Broad-spectrum systemic antifungal therapy with or without intravitreal antifungal drugs is recommended. The prognosis depends upon the virulence of the organism, extent of intraocular involvement and the timing of interventions. Prompt therapy following early diagnosis helps to reduce significant visual loss. - Mod.LL
