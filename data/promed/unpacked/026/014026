[In response to our inquiry as to signs of illnesses, if any, in pigs. We
had had no previous reports of illnesses in pigs, only illnesses in humans.
These are anecdotes only and should not be considered definitive clinical
observation. - Mod.CHC

From: Chan Yow Cheong <chanyowcheong@pacific.net.sg>

I have the following anecdotal info on the disease in pigs in the Perak
(Ipoh) outbreak from 2 sources:
1. This one is from Singapore vets. The information was given to them in
Ipoh by Malaysian pig farmers regarding on-farm pigs. Pigs of all ages were
observed to have marked dyspnea with open mouth breathing, epistaxis,
marked coughing, "bluishness and malodour" to the carcass at death.
2. This description was given by a Malaysian physician in Ipoh whose
parents died of the disease. The pigs first became irritable and started to
bite other pigs. They then coughed severely until haemoptysis occurred.
They then started fitting and died.
