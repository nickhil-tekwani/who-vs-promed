Angkor Bakery outlets at Burton, Blakeview and Salisbury Downs -- all in Adelaide's northern suburbs -- closed last week after salmonellosis cases were linked to Vietnamese rolls, also known as banh mi. SA [South Australia] Health said a total of 51 people had fallen ill since the outbreak started.

SA Health acting director of public health services Dr. Fay Jenkins said all 3 bakeries were expected to reopen tomorrow [22 Feb 2019]. They have been advised to stop using raw egg butter, which is similar to mayonnaise. "The owners of the Angkor Bakery stores continue to work closely with the local councils and SA Health to improve their practices, and all 3 bakeries closed voluntarily during the investigation," Dr. Jenkins said.

Last week, SA Health said raw egg butter, pate or barbecue pork ingredients could be linked to the outbreak. Of those, the only product that contained raw egg was the butter. Dr. Jenkins said raw egg products could be risky if not appropriately handled. "Many food poisoning outbreaks have been associated with foods containing raw or partially-cooked eggs, such as aioli, mayonnaise, hollandaise or tartare sauce and mousse," Dr. Jenkins said.

"The external shell of eggs may contain harmful bacteria such as salmonella, and while eggs may not necessarily look or smell 'off', they may be contaminated. It's important to check that eggs are clean and not cracked or dirty -- and those that are should be thrown out. Preparation surfaces and utensils should be thoroughly washed, sanitized and dried after handling eggs, and remember to think of raw eggs like raw meat, and wash your hands thoroughly after handling them."

Last week [11-17 Feb 2019], SA Health said a similar issue was reported at the same bakery in 2015. "A number of years ago we had a similar problem from this particular bakery and that was investigated and the business was supported in terms of looking at their food hygiene practices," SA Health deputy chief medical officer Dr. Nicola Spurrier said.

[Butter consists of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and often added salt so that the raw egg butter must have raw egg added to it or it is another way of calling mayonnaise, a stable emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and acid, either vinegar or lemon juice.

Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
