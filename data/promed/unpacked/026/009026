Current statistical data on the cholera outbreak in the Greater Accra
Region indicates that 4190 cases had been recorded, with 36 deaths.
The breakdown shows the Accra Metropolis is leading with 3207 cholera
cases and 33 deaths, while the Ga East district comes 2nd with 473
reported cases and 1 death. Others include Ga South, with 119 cases
and a death; Ga West, 253 cases and a death.

Adentan, Ledzorkuku Krowor and Tema, recorded 38, 62 and 28 cases
respectively, with no deaths. Furthermore, the Dangbe West district
had 6 cases, followed by Ashaiman with 3 cases, while the Dangbe East
district, recorded only 1 case.

This became known when The [Ghanaian] Chronicle visited some selected
hospitals in Accra to find out the state of the epidemic. According to
Dr. Irene Agyepong Amarteyfio of the Greater Accra Regional Health
Directorate, her outfit had requested the various facilities in the
districts to check their summaries, in order to produce the final
report.

The Acting Metro Director of Health Services, Dr. George Mensah,
disclosed to The Chronicle that just 2 days ago, the Adabraka
Polyclinic's infirmary cholera record was approaching about 3008
cases, a number which spans January [2011] to date.

He explained further that the outbreak had become severe, because of
the way and manner people disposed off faeces in the environment. Also
at the La General Hospital on Monday [28 Mar 2011], cholera figures
were up to 357 in the 1st quarter of 2011. Out of the 357 cases,
January documented 49, with February recording 147, and in this month
of March alone, the number has increased to 161 cases.

[3] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Manicaland)

One person has died while 70 others have been affected by cholera in
Chisumbanje after a sugarcane estate in the district reportedly failed
to provide adequate water and sanitary facilities.

This comes amid unconfirmed reports that at least 8 people could have
died of the disease in Chimanimani, where 11 cases have been reported.
The estate in Chisumbanje, formerly run by ARDA, employs nearly 5000
people from 5 districts of Manicaland province but has inadequate
sanitary facilities to cater for the huge numbers of people staying
there. Officials from the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare have
since intervened and are currently working with the estate management
to arrest the outbreak.

A cholera epidemic claimed 36 lives, out of the 645 affected, between
27 Feb and 26 Mar 2011 in Kisangani, eastern Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), the UN Office for humanitarian affairs (OCHA) said. It
said new cases were being recorded, as preventive vaccines were not
available and drugs to treat those affected were scarce.

Because of the prevailing situation, the country's Public Health
minister, Victor Makweng Kaput, has since Wednesday [30 Mar 2011] been
visiting Kisangani, at the head of a high-powered delegation of
hospital and humanitarian staff, including representatives of the
World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF in DRC.

At least 13 persons suffering from cholera have been admitted to the
hospital of Rumonge in the province of Bururi, 75 km south of the
Burundian capital Bujumbura, a health official in the town told local
media on Mon 21 Mar 2011.

Charles Bikorimana, head of the Hygiene and Sanitation Service in
Rumonge, said the cholera epidemic broke out on 11 Mar 2011 during a
shortage of clean water in that town. "3 more persons were admitted
yesterday (20 Mar 2011) at Rumonge Hospital and they had cholera
symptoms. They are in addition to other 10 persons who were admitted
to Rumonge Hospital on 11 Mar 2011 and who had cholera-like symptoms,"
Bikorimana said.

Rumonge is a tourist town and is located on the shores of Lake
Tanganyika. It is Burundi's 4th town after Bujumbura, the central town
of Gitega and the northern town of Ngozi.

A growing cholera outbreak in Somalia's war-ravaged capital has
killed more than 20 people and infected more than 2000, a doctor said
Sat 11 Mar 2011.

Dr. Lul Mohamed said that Banadir Maternity Hospital has seen more
than 2000 cholera patients since the beginning of February [2011] and
the disease is rapidly spreading. In the past 48 hours, she said, the
hospital has received 180 people affected by the highly contagious
disease whose symptoms include dehydration, nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea.

She said that the hospital is running low on supplies and cash to pay
health workers but volunteers are helping care for the sick. Mohamed
said many of patients are children from camps for displaced families,
some of whom fled after weeks of a government-led offensive against
insurgents.
