The presence of dioxin was not detected in a district in central Viet Nam where the military toxin had been suspected of causing an unknown skin disease that has killed 23 people since last April [2011]. Colonel Dinh Ngoc Tan, chief of the Military Institute of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences, announced the results after his agency finished tests on soil and water samples taken from Ba To District, Quang Ngai Province, where 239 people have come down with the disease. Tan said his agency did not find residues of pesticides or heavy metals.

Of the water samples taken, only the rate of microorganisms was found to exceed regulations, which means that the local water source had been contaminated, he said. According to Tan, his agency conducted the tests in the hopes of helping the provincial health department identify the source of the mysterious ailment. Earlier, scientists concluded that the condition was caused by chronic poisoning, but it remains unclear as to the precise toxin responsible.

Officially known as "hoi chung viem da day sung ban tay ban chan" (the syndrome of dermatitis and horny layer thickening in feet and hands), the disease begins with blisters on the hands and feet and decreased appetite, and can turn fatal due to organ failures, starting with the liver.

Health officials in central Viet Nam have confiscated a large amount of herbs of unclear origins being used by people who live in an area that has been plagued by a mysterious skin condition that killed 23 people so far. Officials from Quang Ngai Province's Health Department have sent samples of the medicine found in Ba Dien Commune of Ba To District to the Health Ministry for testing.

Locals have been asked to stop using the medicine, which is in the form of a powder, ostensibly of roots, branches, and dry leaves. Chinese labels found on the package say the medicine is for treating liver cancer. The medicine is not in the list of products allowed by Viet Nam's Health Ministry.

It's not clear how long the medicine has been used in the commune. Le Huy, chief of staff of Quang Ngai Health Department, on Saturday [23 Jun 2012] said many people have visited the district with medicines after news about the disease broke out.

The disease, which causes thickened skin and blisters on hands and feet, and leads to multiple organ failure, has killed 23 people since April last year [2011]. Huy said the gesture to give free medicines was "meaningful" but it could be "dangerous" as most do not have clear origins or a permit from the Ministry of Health, according to a Nhan Dan [newspaper] report.

Military chemicals, a prime suspect in the beginning, are yet to be found in the district. But elevated amounts of arsenic were found in a hair sample of a 9-year-old boy who died in May [2012].

[The news articles above concern an outbreak in several villages in the Bo To district of Quang Ngai province, Viet Nam, on which ProMED-mail has previously reported. Those affected are reported to have developed an acute febrile illness with loss of appetite and respiratory symptoms followed by a rash on the hands and feet described as "palmoplantar keratoderma" (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1108406-overview#aw2aab6b), accompanied by liver dysfunction and, in some patients, by multi-organ failure and death. Ulcers on the hands, feet, mouth, back, and abdomen, eye disease, stiffness of the limbs, and miscarriage are also described. Mainly children and young adults have been affected.

The disease is said to have started in April 2011, subsided somewhat between November 2011 and February 2012, and picked up pace again in March and April 2012. The numbers of patients affected and the death toll has varied in the news reports, but the 1st news report above says that the number affected is 239 and both new reports above say the death toll is 23.

Pictures of the rash on the hands and feet of the affected Vietnamese villagers are available at http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Health/2012/4/100698 and http://www.eyedrd.org/2012/04/breakout-of-unknown-skin-disease-has-claimed-27-lives-in-central-vietnam.html.

Chronic arsenic toxicity (http://icmr.nic.in/ijmr/2008/october/1007.pdf) and dioxin toxicity (Patel S, Zirwas M, English JC: Acquired palmoplantar keratoderma. Am J Clin Dermatol. 2007; 8(1): 1-11; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17298101) can produce skin lesions similar to those seen in the Vietnamese villagers. In fact, hair samples taken from a 9-year-old boy who died contained arsenic at a level 100 times higher than the country's acceptable limit (ProMED-mail post Undiagnosed illness - Viet Nam (06): (QG) toxin susp. RFI 20120601.1153587). However, the news reports above say that authorities did not find residues of dioxin or heavy metals, presumably including arsenic, in the affected villages. The 2nd news report says that an herbal medicine was being investigated, but it may have been distributed to the villagers after the onset of this outbreak.

Quang Ngai is a Vietnamese province located in the South Central Coastal region along the South China Sea, 883 km (549 miles) south of Hanoi and 838 km (521 miles) north of Ho Chi Minh City (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quang_Ngai_province). The province has a large plain along the coast and in the center of the province and has mountains and hills in the west. Ba To is a rural district of Quang Ngai province with a population of 47 268 in 2003 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_To_District).
