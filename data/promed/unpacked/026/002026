Libya has destroyed all its chemical arsenal, the country's foreign minister has announced. Mohamed Abdelaziz said that this included bombs and artillery shells filled with mustard gas.

In 2004, Libya said it had 25 tonnes of sulphur mustard and several thousand unfilled aerial bombs for use with chemical warfare facilities.

Tripoli has committed itself to getting rid of all its chemical arms by signing the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).

"Libya has become totally free of usable chemical weapons that might present a potential threat to the security of local communities, the environment and neighbouring areas," Mr Abdelaziz said on Tuesday [4 Feb 2013] in the capital Tripoli.

He added that this "would not have been possible in such a short time" without international support, including technical assistance from Canada, Germany, and the US.

Libya's foreign minister said the process was completed on 26 Jan 2014.

Mr Abdelaziz was speaking at a joint news conference with Ahmet Uzumcu, the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

The process of destroying Libya's chemical arsenal began in 2004. Mr Uzumcu -- who had visited the site in Ruwagha where the chemical weapons were destroyed last week -- described the move as a "significant milestone" for Libya.

He added that it was a "good example of international co-operation now emulated in Syria on a larger scale".

The process began 10 years ago under the then Libyan leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, when Tripoli joined the CWC.

Gaddafi's government had succeeded in getting rid of 54 percent of its declared sulphur mustard and about 40 percent of the precursor chemicals before operations had to be suspended in February 2011 when the destruction facility stopped working. Gaddafi was ousted from power later that year, and the country's new rulers then told OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) inspectors about the previously undeclared chemical stocks.

The arsenal destroyed by Libya falls under "Category 1 chemical weapons", the OPCW said.

The organisation says such materials "have been used as chemical weapons in the past and/or have very few or no peaceful uses, and thus pose the most direct threat" to the CWC.

It added that the destruction of chemical precursors -- Category 2 chemicals -- was to be completed by Libya by December 2016.

Precursors are defined as "chemicals involved in production stages for toxic chemicals." Most of these chemicals "have some industrial uses."

The OPCW is an independent international organisation which works with the UN to monitor the 1997 convention banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.

[ProMED-mail was founded in 1994 by FAS (Federation of American Scientists) and Satellife (now SatelLife) to provide early warning over the internet of outbreaks of infectious disease or toxins that might have been started deliberately. Therefore news of the destruction of toxic bioweapons in a country is of equal importance to the eradication of polio or street rabies in a country.
" The last artillery shell was destroyed on 26 Jan. 2014", officials said (New York Times, 2 Feb 2014 http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/world/africa/libyas-cache-of-toxic-arms-all-destroyed.html?_r=0)

Ruwagha is a very remote desert location, in the southeast of Libya. The destruction of these chemicals occurred with assistance from Germany, Canada, and United States.

Libya has a long history of having had chemical weapons. The road to the destruction of this arsenal of chemicals has not been easy, as a civil war erupted in Libya, thus delaying the destruction and opening up the possibility that some of those weapons may have been misappropriated.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) supervised the destruction of Libya's chemical weapons caches through February 2011, when it was forced to suspend its operations due to the uprising against Gaddafi and the resulting deterioration of the country's stability. At this point the Libyan government had destroyed 40 percent of its precursor materials and 55 percent of its mustard gas, as well as 3500 chemical weapon munitions. In early September 2011, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said reports he had received indicated that the remaining weapons were secure and had not fallen into the hands of militant groups. A stockpile of mustard gas, which the OPCW reported the regime may have attempted to hide from inspectors overseeing the chemical weapons program's dismantlement, was reportedly found in the Jufra District by anti-Gaddafi fighters less than 2 weeks later. In late September 2011 the Wall Street Journal reported that a major ammunition complex, including chemical-weapons-capable artillery shells, was unguarded and open to looting. In December 2012 a senior Spanish intelligence official said that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb "probably also has non-conventional arms, basically chemical, as a result of the loss of control of arsenals", with Libya being the most likely source.

Libya's National Transitional Council is cooperating with the OCPW regarding the destruction of all legacy chemical weapons in the country. After assessing the chemical stockpiles, the Libyan government will receive a deadline from the OPCW to destroy the weapons. As of September 2013, 1.6 metric tons of mustard blistering agent loaded in artillery rounds, 2.5 metric tons of congealed mustard agent, and 846 metric tons of chemical weapons ingredients remained to be destroyed.

According to the New York Times in February 2014, the United States and Libya have discreetly destroyed what both sides say were the last remnants of Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi's lethal arsenal of chemical arms [see quote & URL in comment below]. They used a transportable oven technology to destroy hundreds of bombs and artillery rounds filled with deadly mustard agent.
