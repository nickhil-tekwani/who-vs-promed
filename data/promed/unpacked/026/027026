Al-Ahram's Arabic website reported 2 more cases of malaria have been reported in Edfu's fever hospital in Aswan governorate.

Another 15 cases have been reported in the area since May [2014], although 2 of the patients have been cured and left hospital, according to the deputy health minister responsible for Aswan, Mohamed Azmy. Egypt suffered from a malaria epidemic from 1942-1944, when around one million people were infected and 200 000 died.

[This report strongly indicates that a new focus of malaria has been established in Southern Egypt. We assume that none of the patients have been travelling and that they are not immigrants from malaria endemic areas, for instance from the Sudan.

The dry climate of Egypt usually results in a short life span of anopheles mosquitoes and thus limited transmission. The mosquito _Anopheles sergentii_ is the commonest _Anopheles_ species in the oasis and the commonest malaria vector here, and was described from Aswan nearly 20 years ago in a single study (Cope SE, et al. New record of the malaria vector _Anopheles sergentii_ in the southern Nile Valley of Egypt. J Am Mosq Control Assoc. 1995; 11(1): 145-6).

In 1942, however, _A. gambiae_ was found in Egypt from the Sudan border all the way up to 200 miles (300 km) south of Cairo in the Nile valley, but was pushed back by a larvicidal campaign which eradicated _A. gambiae_ in Egypt and Sudan north of Khartoum. The presence of _A. gambiae_ in Egypt in 1942 explains the outbreak of 1942-44 described in the post.

Studies are needed to determine the _Anopheles_ species responsible for the present transmission in Aswan as well as active case detection to identify clinical cases and gametocyte carriers for treatment. - Mod.EP
