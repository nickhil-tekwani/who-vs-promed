The Nature Conservancy Today [2 Apr 2013] announced that white nose syndrome (WNS), which has decimated bat populations in eastern North America, has been confirmed in a bat found last month [March 2013] at the Conservancy's Bat Cave Preserve in Rutherford County.

White nose syndrome was 1st identified in the winter of 2006-2007 in upstate New York. It has spread to 19 US states and 4 Canadian provinces. It is estimated that bat populations have declined by 80 percent in the affected areas. Infected bats have also been identified in Avery, McDowell, Haywood, Yancey, and Transylvania counties. Investigators from the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and The Nature Conservancy found the infected bat. The US Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed the disease.

The disease gets its name from a white fungus, which is found around muzzles, ears, and wing membranes of infected bats. The fungus, _Geomyces destructans_, grows at low temperatures and high humidity -- making hibernating bats the perfect victims. Infected bats behave oddly -- moving toward the mouth of caves and flying when they should be hibernating. It is believed that activity uses up fat that sustains bats during their winter hibernation. Many infected bats are found to be emaciated as a result.

Bats are an underappreciated, yet very important, mammal. Worldwide there are nearly 1000 species of bats, accounting for close to a quarter of all mammals. They are vital to insect control and pollination. It is likely that the affected species in North Carolina -- Indiana bat, little brown bat, eastern pipistrelle, Townsend's big-eared bat, eastern small-footed bat, and Rafinesque's big-eared bat -- will be dramatically affected by the disease because they are long-lived and give birth to a single pup each year. The Conservancy closed the caves at its Bat Cave Preserve in 2010 in an effort to protect bats. The caves will remain closed until further notice.

The Nature Conservancy is a leading conservation organization working around the world to protect ecologically important lands and waters for nature and people. To date, the Conservancy and its more than 1 million members have been responsible for the protection of more than 18 million acres [7.28 million ha] in the United States and have helped preserve more than 117 million acres [47.35 million ha] in Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, and the Pacific.

About 4 weeks ago [early March 2013], Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWD) researchers' fears were realized -- a fungal infection that kills hibernating bats has moved into Georgia from the Northeast.

"Once it was coming further south, we were hoping that because of the warm weather that we experience and the shorter hibernation periods, the bats would be able to make it better, and we had not been seeing the widespread mortality like they had in the Northeast," said Lisa Last, a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Wildlife Disease Study. "Unfortunately, this year [2013], our fears have been confirmed; we have seen a lot of widespread mortality, as well."

Last works as SCWD's white nose syndrome surveillance coordinator at the University of Georgia [UGA], a program run through the College of Veterinary Medicine.

WNS is a disease caused by a fungus, _Geomyces destructans_, which lives in caves where bats hibernate. It can then grow on the hairless skin parts of bats, such as the ears and feet, but mostly the wings and muzzle. The fungal infection wakes bats up while they are hibernating, Last said.

Steven Castleberry, professor of wildlife ecology and management at UGA, said that waking a bat up in this manner can kill it. "The fungus apparently irritates them and causes them to wake up multiple times during the winter and they use all of their fat reserves, so it seems like they just starve to death," Castleberry said. "What you'll find are dead bats that are just completely emaciated and have no body fat."

Last said that the rate that bats are dying from WNS is significant. "In general, bats have been dying off at rates over 70 percent in affected caves, in a lot of places it is over 95 percent in an affected hibernaculum," Last said. A hibernaculum is the shelter for a hibernating animal -- in this case, the cave where bats hibernate.

Since early March [2013], Last and her colleagues received 4 bats to be tested for the disease from Dade and Walker counties, Last said.

Until that time, WNS was found in states surrounding Georgia, including just across the border in Tennessee's Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park [CCNMP], Last said. According to a press release from The Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the US Fish & Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, infected bats were found in late February [2013] in Lookout Mountain Cave on the Georgia side of CCNMP. On 5 Mar 2013, the infection was also found in Sittons Cave in Cloudland Canyon State Park, a park located in Dade County.

WNS affects cave dwelling species of bats, including little brown bats and northern long-eared bats along the eastern seaboard, Castleberry said. Last said that all of the bats from Georgia which she received to diagnose were tri-colored bats, a small cave-dwelling species found throughout the Eastern United States.

Castleberry and Last both said that little brown bats used to be common, but their population could be in trouble. "In the Northeast, because they have been hit so hard, there are some reports out that they may go locally extinct in 15 to 20 years if the death rate continues," Last said.

The bats that are being affected seem to be from the same genus -- _Myotis_ -- except for the tri-colored bats, Last said.

"It was first found in 2006 in New York City, and the most common perception now is that it was brought in by cavers from Europe. It has spread down the Appalachian Chain pretty fast," said Jesse Thomas, a 2nd-year MS graduate student from McRae who wrote his senior thesis on WNS.

The fungus causes no known harm to humans, but they may be helping in its spreading. "With humans that's the big deal, trying to keep people from moving it cave to cave," Castleberry said.

I thank ProMED-mail and its moderators for keeping us apprised of the devastation of WNS on North American insectivorous bats.

However, it is important to bear in mind that 6 years is a very short time in which to expect to see a resistant population, especially when WNS is caused by a cold-adapted, cave-adapted fungus, _Geomyces destructans_, which affects hibernating bats in caves. Hibernating, or torpid, bats are apparently in an immunosuppressed state in order to maintain prolonged torpor.

The rapid rise and spread of WNS and the low reproductive rate of the species affected do not suggest these species could develop any sort of resistant population in such a short timespan.

Thanks to Leslie Sturges for sending her comment. I will have to disagree with her opinion, though. On one hand, the development of genetic resistance might not be necessarily slow. An increasing number of studies indicate that parasites represent powerful selective agents in natural populations. From Alitzer et al. 2003 (Trends Ecol Evol), "The observation that infectious diseases might be both mitigated by and rapidly change the genetic composition of host populations gives new significance to the role of host genetic diversity in species conservation." It should be taken into account that the survivors of an outbreak are very likely more resistant than those that died, so the population that would be exposed again to the pathogen has a different genetic composition in terms of _G. destructans_ resistance. On the other hand, even if 6 years is a very short time period to expect any development of intrinsic resistance, vertebrates have a wonderful defense system to provide them with protection in the short term: the adaptive (acquired) arm of the immune system. It is true that we still need to know more about how it works for this particular host-parasite system, but based on our current knowledge of epidemiology and immunology, we have sound reasons to keep on being hopeful! - Mod.PMB]
