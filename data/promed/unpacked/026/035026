Hundreds of students from the Wabag Secondary School have fallen ill
with typhoid, Wabag Hospital yesterday [3 Sep 2007] confirmed. Senior
students from the school who went to a public phone called the
Post-Courier advising about 400 students from the school have been
confirmed typhoid positive.
A senior student, who did not want to be named for fear of being
penalized by school authorities, said that the situation was
worsening and that the management of the school were turning a "blind
eye and deaf ear on the matter."
Wabag Hospital yesterday confirmed several hundreds of students from
the school were diagnosed with the disease but could not elaborate on
the issue. A hospital executive yesterday [3 Sep 2007], said that
hundreds of students visiting the hospital had been diagnosed with
typhoid. Poor kitchen facilities, badly managed amenities especially
toilets and the bad state of dormitories were cited as possible
sources of the infections.
"Yes, I can confirm that the school students that have been visiting
us have been tested positive with typhoid but I do not want to go
further on it because it is a school matter that has to be addressed
by the principal and the 2 deputy principals," the hospital executive said.
The Post-Courier contacted the school principal and the deputies but
after several attempts was told they were very busy and that the
issue was not important enough to be commented on.

The school at the centre of an alleged typhoid outbreak in Enga
province in Papua New Guinea says it believes the numbers involved
have been misreported by disgruntled students.
An official at Wabag Secondary school says a number of students have
sought treatment at the hospital for a range of illnesses that might
include typhoid as well as flu or malaria. But he says this is normal
for the size of the school.
A group of senior students from the school called the the
Post-Courier newspaper to report that about 400 students from the
school have been confirmed typhoid positive. Wabag Hospital has
confirmed that several hundred students from the school have been diagnosed.

[There seems to be some disagreement regarding the number of cases.
The hospital in Wabag (the capital of the province) seems to support
the student numbers.

The UK's Health Protection Agency is hoping the Valuing Vaccines
campaign will help make people aware of the importance of immunizing
against a myriad of diseases, including typhoid, to prevent them from
coming back in large numbers.
Typhoid cases surged 69 percent to 248 in 2006 from 147 in 2002 in
England and Wales, with the number of infections acquired while
traveling totaling 122 last year and 101 in 2002. During the same
time span, cases of paratyphoid climbed 78 percent to 270 from 152,
with 152 cases acquired abroad in 2006 and 96 in 2002.
As part of the vaccination campaign, the UK Vaccines Industry Group
is covering the costs of free pamphlets that can be obtained online
or from doctors and schools.

immigrants who may already have been infected or if the cases of this
usually waterborne disease were acquired in the UK. - Mod.LL]
