Uptake of prions into plants
----------------------------
Session title: Current science of chronic wasting disease: what have we learned in the last 5 years?
Author: Christopher Johnson, US Geological Survey, Madison, WI

Abstract
--------
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) and scrapie-infected animals shed infectious prions during both the preclinical and clinical phases of disease. Contamination of environments with prions released from animals or from infected carcasses appears to contribute to the transmission of these diseases.

Previous work has suggested that soil may serve as an environmental disease reservoir. Vegetation is ubiquitous in CWD-contaminated environments and plants are known to absorb a variety of substances from soil, ranging from nutrients to contaminants.

The uptake of proteins from soil into plants has been documented for many years and we have been investigating the uptake of prions into plants in vitro. Using laser scanning confocal microscopy, we observed root uptake of fluorescently-tagged, abnormal prion protein in the model plant thale cress or mouse-eared cress (_Arabidopsis thaliana_), as well as the crop plants alfalfa (_Medicago sativa_), barley (_Hordeum vulgare_), and tomato _(Solanum lycopersicum_). Using serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification, a sensitive biochemical prion detection method, we have found evidence of prions in aerial tissues from these species, as well as maize (_Zea mays_). Both stems and leaves of _A. thaliana_ grown in culture media containing prions are infectious when injected into mice and oral bioassays are underway for _A. thaliana_ and other plants. Our results suggest that prions are taken up by plants and that contaminated plants may represent a previously unrecognized risk of human, domestic species, and wildlife exposure to CWD and scrapie agents.

[This research is interesting but in this moderator's mind it stimulates more questions than provides answers. This article seems to be trying to say this is a potential health risk for humans. However, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids has been around since the 1960's. Yet humans have not yet come down with the disease.

Scientists continue to use a modified mouse model to study cervids. However, no matter what the genetic make up of the mouse, it is still a monogastric [having a simple single-chambered stomach] animal . Cervids are ruminants [having a 4-chambered complex stomach]. The physiology is quite different. Until the scientist can reproduce all results in cervids, I have a very hard time putting much stock in mouse research designed to represent ruminant physiology. It just doesn't work. A monogastric mouse is physiologically still a monogastric.

Further, the scientist injected plant extract into the mouse. Cervids do not acquire the disease through injection. While scientific argument is that injection and mice are cheaper and faster, which is true, there is no evidence that it is accurate.

In the 2nd article, published by the Wisconsin Watch, there is a significant point made by the state public health veterinarian; James Kazmierczak said that a molecular species barrier, though little understood, appears to have so far prevented the CWD prions from making people and cattle sick.

Also, Kazmierczak said, data reported to the Wisconsin Division of Public Health show little deviation from the national rate -- a little above one case per million people -- in annual cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Nor, he added, does data on more than 800 Wisconsin hunters who have consumed CWD-tainted venison show any human cases of prion brain disease.

Every researcher considers their work significant and ground breaking. The research at the very least begs further research, correct research using cervids and oral dosing of actual plants, not plant extract or injections. It should also prompt a review of the attempted control of CWD in Wisconsin.

Most researchers are not prepared to research prions in gut piles and establish trail cameras to watch other cervids being cannibalistic. This research has been done and conclusively showed that deer do eat gut piles. This work was detailed at one of the United States Animal Health Association meetings in the cervid committee. Why are researchers not looking at this? Why are researchers not looking at urine as a mechanism of spread? We know the prion has been shown in urine and urine is used as scent bait by hunters.

So while learning that plants may have prions I think we are a long way from the jump that plants are responsible for the spread of the disease or even a potential risk to humans.

Of minor interest is that the plant used is not a native plant to the US but a naturalized plant that is now widespread in the US.

CWD is one of the prion diseases collectively known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Among those diseases is scrapie in sheep. If one traces [the onset of] that disease [in sheep] and the onset of Alzheimer's disease [in humans], there is a startling parallel. Yet this does not seem to be primary research and [Alzheimer's] is a human disease. Interesting!

So the fact that plants can pick up prions is in itself interesting, but we don't know what the plant does with prions, or if there is any action on the plant. It seems there are many more questions and avenues to explore before jumping to conclusions regarding this research. - Mod.TG]
