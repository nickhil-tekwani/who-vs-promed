From your comments:
[If it is anthrax, the reported symptoms would be characteristic of enteric
anthrax ("bloody diarrhoea") and oral anthrax ("swollen cheeks & neck");
when the lesion is in the mouth or the throat there is the added serious
risk of being unable to breathe. With malnutrition their immune systems are
already seriously compromised permitting a lower infective (& lethal) dose.
The source would be dead animals and under the circumstances might even be
animals dead for some time and sundried. While not minimizing the
seriousness of the situation the numbers affected will be less than
"hundreds" (whatever large number that is) and a range of different
diseases will be involved, not just anthrax even if it is one of the
diseases involved. - Mod.MHJ
Report on a Deadly Disease in Afar Region
Shortly after returning to Afar region following an absence for vacation at
end of March 2000, I was alerted by people from the Afar Pastoralists
Development Association (APDA) about a rapidly deadly disease for which
they had been receiving reports from Zone 5 in Afar Region.
In the first week of April, an exploratory mission with people from APDA
was therefore organized and which over the period of 5 days, managed to
visit Telalak, Dawe and Artuma Woredas of Zone 5. Meetings were held with
woreda and zonal officials as well as the health staff of Telalak and Dawe
clinics and a number of affected villages were visited.
From these discussions and visits it was apparent that at least three
different outbreaks were prevalent in the area. An epidemic of an
occasionally severe and prolonged bloody diarrhea sometimes manifested as
frank hemorrhage and another outbreak of a syndrome including lymphadenitis
of the head and neck area associated with various other respiratory tract
symptoms were considered by many pastoralists to be manifestations of a
much more severe form of the same disease.
This severe form of brutal onset is associated with swelling of the neck
and sore throat followed very quickly by rapid breathing, delirium and
asphyxiation within 24 to 48 hours.
In Dawe woreda we were told that this syndrome, also present the previous
year, restarted during the Ramadan and had continued since. The Afar are
convinced that the disease has its origin from their livestock where it has
the same presentation. They use an occasionally effective medicine (a dust
or paste prepared from a tree) which they apply to the nose of the affected
animal. This same medicine was applied to the human cases.
No rigourous epidemiological survey was performed in the limited time
available. Several weeks would be necessary to visit all the camps in the
area. However in the village of Horungu in Dawe woreda, 17 deaths had been
counted since 5 days before the end of the Ramadan (Jan 05, 2000) most if
not all with the above presentation. The last death had occurred the week
previous to our visit (March 30, 2000). Most of the deaths occurred in
January.
Reports of a similar illness were obtained from many other Afar along the
road and from the woreda authorities. According to these reports, the
deaths were "too numerous to count". It seems the outbreak spread from Dawe
into Telalak and was now crossing the Mile-Kombolcha road into Chifra
woreda of Zone 1.
All the information gathered was transmitted directly to the acting
director of the Regional Health Bureau (RHB) in Asaita and the WHO
consultant present there on Friday, April 14th. Immediately following this
meeting I returned to Telalak woreda and crossed from there into Chifra
woreda where similar reports were gathered from the local population. It
seems that the nurse at the clinic at Oua'ama had seen two cases whom he
had referred to Chifra but who died in private homes before being able to
move on to Chifra.
Contact was made with Dr Berhanu in Kombolcha, an animal health specialist
very familiar with Afar region who suspected an outbreak of anthrax in
animals and asked me if it was possible to bring blood samples to his
laboratory in Kombolcha from affected animals. This information was
therefore transmitted to the director and to technical advisors of the
Regional Agricultural Bureau in Asaita.
Following this I unfortunately was obliged to leave Afar region for Gode
zone of Somali region where MSF/F opened an emergency feeding program in
Imi district. I returned to Afar region on June 12th following a month in
Ogaden.
At mid-day on Friday June 16th while eating in a restaurant in Mile with my
Afar team, we were approached concerning a seriously ill person in a
residence near-by. We found a 25 year old Afar gasping and in severe
respiratory distress, lying on a mat in the residence compound. This young
man was from Mile woreda and had been in town for some time. Being poor
with no mother or father this man had gone to sleep at night in the local
mosque apparently well. In the morning he had presented to the residence
with a sore throat and inability to talk or swallow.
On examination the man was obviously close to asphyxiation with periods of
agitation from severe hypoxia. He was not febrile and his lungs were not
affected. He had a discrete but visible diffuse swelling of the neck and
tenderness along the larynx. His tongue was swollen to three times normal
size and the back of his pharynx was bulging outwards into his oral cavity.
I performed an emergency tracheotomy, which temporarily gave the man some
relief. However there were copious secretions continuously emerging from
the improvised tracheotomy tube, the respiratory distress and agitation
quickly returned and the man died in my arms at around 2 in the afternoon.
This man's presentation corresponds exactly to the description of this
rapidly deadly illness which we had gathered from numerous Afar in Zones 1
and 5. So far we have no reports of the same illness from other zones of
the region. It would appear that most of the cases are currently coming
from Oua'ama (Chifra woreda).
In summary I am now convinced that several hundred Afar at the very least
have died from this disease since the beginning of the year. I am concerned
that this disease is an oro-pharyngeal or inhalational form of human anthrax.
I will continue my investigations on this further unfortunate event
affecting a poorly serviced and marginalized population. Clearly I am also
appealing for help from competent authorities. A systematic epidemiological
investigation is indicated to fully document the extent of the outbreak.
The team may actually encounter another active case if they remain
sufficiently long enough in the affected areas and if they go out to reach
the Afar rather than remain in the few health institutions present.

[Dr Tectonidis message was forwarded to WHO Geneva and I received an
immediate telephone reply that a meeting was in fact being convened Tuesday
morning to decide on the appropriate response. They had been informed by
the WHO ResRep in Addis. We have since had the following communication from
Dr. Tectonidis:

We finally are receiving statements from regional authorities that anthrax
in animals is out of control in Afar region.
The government is starting to vaccinate in a badly affected area of zone 1
(Geiga). They have also given 20,000 vaccines to Action Contre La Faim who
are vaccinating in Zone 4 where pastoralists are reporting sudden deaths
from LADORE (Anthrax) amongst their cattle. Anecdotal reports suggest that
Zone 3 is also very severely affected with animal anthrax at least.
I think that the disease is in fact all over Afar Region. There are
certainly reasons why the outbreak and spread to humans may however be more
severe in parts of Zones 5 and 1.
This week Epicentre, MSF and ACF will start a in depth survey along with
people from the concerned ministries of Afar region. We will be taking
samples from animals and humans and documenting as much as possible the
deaths which have occurred in a number of Afar communities.

[Technically we still await laboratory confirmation that it is anthrax, but
tragically it gives all the appropriate signs and symptoms of being so from
the start. It seems that there had been some initial government reluctance
in Addis to admit to the situation. MHJ
[We'd like to thank MSF France in Ethiopia for sending us this report from
the field. Dr. Tectonidis has been doing a valiant job of trying to
clarify an outbreak in a remote area so that appropriate control measures
can be implemented. It is reports like this that justify ProMED-mail's
objective to serve as an early warning system as well as to provide
assistance through information exchange at all levels. For those of us who
have worked in the field, we very much appreciate the value of information
exchange. We wish Dr. Tectonidis and his colleagues good luck with their
investigation and look forward to hearing follow-up on this outbreak. -
