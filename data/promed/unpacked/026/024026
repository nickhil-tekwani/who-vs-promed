Chemical source found in foodborne illness outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
An April 2010 investigation by Dallas County (Texas) health officials into acute-onset illnesses in restaurant customers suggested chemical poisoning, which eventually turned out to be sodium azide, according to a report today [28 Jun 2012] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). In the initial incident, 4 customers were taken from the restaurant to an emergency department after experiencing rapid-onset foodborne illness symptoms, including nausea, lightheadedness, and sweating. The patients had drunk iced tea from paper cups filled from a self-serve urn.

Authorities collected iced tea samples from the restaurant and from 2 patients who had brought their paper cups of ice to the (Emergency Department) ED. Surveillance of similar cases in local EDs yielded one more patient. Healthcare teams suspected a chemical source, but tests in the ED and in area labs didn't identify the cause.

Tea samples were sent to the FBI, which 5 months later detected hydrazoic acid, formed when sodium azide contacts water.

The patients recovered, but the source of the contamination was never found. The toxic chemical, widely used in industry, has been involved in food-poisoning incidents before, but the MMWR account is the 1st detailed report of an event at a public venue and the resulting investigation.

The authors suggest that chemical poisoning be considered as a potential cause of any rapid-onset foodborne illness and that an interdisciplinary approach is the key to pinpointing the cause.

[Sodium azide is a rapidly acting, potentially deadly chemical that exists as an odorless white solid. When it is mixed with water or an acid, sodium azide changes rapidly to a toxic gas with a pungent (sharp) odor. It also changes into a toxic gas when it comes in contact with solid metals (for example, when it is poured into a drain pipe containing lead or copper). The odor of the gas may not be sharp enough, however, to give people sufficient warning of the danger.

Sodium azide is best known as the chemical found in automobile airbags. An electrical charge triggered by automobile impact causes sodium azide to explode and release nitrogen gas inside the airbag. Other uses of the chemical include being used as a preservative in hospitals and laboratories. Accidents have occurred in these settings. In one case, sodium azide was poured into a drain, where it exploded and the toxic gas was inhaled (breathed in).

The chemical may also be used in agriculture (farming) for pest control. Sodium azide is also used in detonators and other explosives.

Exposure may occur when sodium azide is mixed into water and can be consumed in this fashion. It may also be consumed when it has contaminated food. Breathing the chemical dust or the gas from an air release is another form of exposure.

Sodium azide can also enter the body and cause symptoms through skin contact. An explosion involving sodium azide may cause burn injury as well as expose people to the toxic gas, hydrozoic acid.

The seriousness of poisoning caused by sodium azide depends on the amount, route, and length of time of exposure, as well as the age and preexisting medical condition of the person exposed.

Breathing the gas that is formed from sodium azide causes the most harm, but ingesting (swallowing) sodium azide can be toxic as well. The gas formed from sodium azide is most dangerous in enclosed places where the gas will be trapped. The toxic gas quickly disperses in open spaces, making it less harmful outdoors. The gas formed from sodium azide is less dense (lighter) than air, so it will rise. Sodium azide prevents the cells of the body from using oxygen. When this happens, the cells die.

Sodium azide is more harmful to the heart and the brain than to other organs, because the heart and the brain use much more oxygen.

People exposed to a small amount of sodium azide by breathing it, absorbing it through their skin, or eating foods that contain it may have some or all of the following symptoms within minutes: rapid breathing, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, headache, nausea and vomiting, rapid heart rate, red eyes (gas or dust exposure), clear drainage from the nose (gas or dust exposure), cough (gas or dust exposure), skin burns and blisters (explosion or direct skin contact).

Exposure to a large amount of sodium azide by any route may have additional health effects, including convulsions, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, loss of consciousness, lung injury, respiratory failure leading to death. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to sodium azide.

Survivors of serious sodium azide poisoning may have heart and brain damage.

After exposure to sodium azide, first, get fresh air by leaving the area where it was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from exposure to the chemical. Seek appropriate medical care regardless of the type of exposure.
