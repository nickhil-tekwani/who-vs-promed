Niger's Ministry of Health has declared an epidemic of hepatitis E in the Diffa region, where 25 people have died among the 86 cases recorded since the beginning of April 2017.

Public Health Minister Idi Illassou Mainassara said on Thu 20 Apr 2017 that authorities have blocked roads leading into the infected area and are assisting the sick. He says the situation is now under control but advised the population to be vigilant and to report to the health center for free treatment if they have symptoms.

Hepatitis E is most commonly transmitted through water contaminated with human excrement. Mainassara says the main symptoms are fever, headache, vomiting, ulcers, abdominal pain and loss of appetite.

The Diffa region in Niger has for years hosted thousands of people displaced by the Nigeria-based Boko Haram Islamic extremists.

[A mortality rate of almost 30 percent is quite high for any form of viral hepatitis. Contributing factors here may be infection in already debilitated individuals who may be chronically infected with hepatitis B or C or infection occurring in women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy.

This article provides some important potential insight into why there is a substantially increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:

Kmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al: The association of cytokines and micronutrients with hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period in rural Bangladesh. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2016; 94(1): 203-11 http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.15-0238.

Abstract
--------
"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is severe during pregnancy, with a pregnant case fatality rate around 30 percent. In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study."

Of the 4 genotypes of HEV, it seems that GT 1 and 2 are the ones that are associated with this increased mortality during gestation.

Diffa is an administrative region in the southeast of Niger. The capital of the region is the city of Diffa. It can be found on a map at:
