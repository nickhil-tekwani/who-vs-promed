Assistant Minister Abdi Affey appealed to the government to urgently send
medical experts to deal with an outbreak of kalazar disease in Wajir
District.
Mr. Affey said more than 50 patients were admitted to Wajir District
Hospital suffering from the disease. He appealed for urgent medical
personnel to check the disease. Mr. Affey, the MP for Wajir South, also
appealed to the government to give financial assistance in the area to help
residents deal with the outbreak.
Contributing to debate on the Budget speech, the Assistant Minister for
Foreign Affairs said it costs Sh20,000 to treat each case which the poor
people cannot afford. He said the Budget did not allocate funds for
development in North Eastern Kenya. He called for establishment of research
centres in the province, saying the area has resources and the potential
but lacks funding.
