Toronto -- An advisory on a province-wide outbreak of _Salmonella
enteritidis_ was issued today by Dr. David Mowat, Ontario s Chief Medical
Officer of Health.
According to Dr. Mowat, results of an investigation by public health
officials from the Ontario Ministry of Health suggest that shredded cheese
contained in Lunchmates products produced by J.M. Schneider Inc. may be the
source of the infection.
J.M. Schneider has issued a voluntary recall of four products containing
shredded cheese, all in the Lunchmates series. They are:
Lunchmate Chicken Soft Taco UPC Code 062000192758
Lunchmate Beef Taco UPC Code 062000192710
Lunchmate Two Cheese Pizza UPC Code 062000192833
Lunchmate Big Combo Beef Taco UPC Code 062000192598
There have been 177 confirmed cases of _Salmonella enteritidis_ [infection],
predominantly among school age children aged 5 to 14 years. This age group
normally accounts for a very small proportion of the yearly average of 600
cases of _Salmonella enteritidis_ in Ontario.
Symptoms include fever, diarrhea and vomiting. The incubation period is
usually 6 to 72 hours and duration of the illness is several days to
several weeks.
Investigation by Ontario public health officials and Health Canada is
continuing.
