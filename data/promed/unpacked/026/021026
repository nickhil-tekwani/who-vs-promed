Varroa mite infection of bee colonies has strongly reduced honey production
in Kashmir valley. The department has recorded 45 metric tons of honey
production this year [2007] compared to last year's 30 metric tons. "This
production is negligible when we compare it with 400 metric tons of honey
some 8 years before," said apiculture development officer Mehraj-u Din.

"Due to the mite disease, there has been a 72 per cent decrease in honey
production in the valley, while almost 90 per cent of the bee colonies have
perished," said an apiculture development officer. Out of 40 000 bee
colonies registered with the department of agriculture Kashmir, more than
half of the colonies have perished because of the mite disease. The
officials in the apiculture wing of the agriculture department said that
varroa mite attack has dealt the biggest blow ever to the apiculture
industry in the state.

The field officials of the apiculture department said that the disease in
the valley might have been brought by the bee hive keepers from outside the
state, as most of the beekeepers migrate with their hives to Punjab and
other adjoining states during winter. "Some bee hive keepers from Kashmir
go with their bee hives to Punjab and other states during winter to
increase honey production. We suspect the disease might have come from
there," said a field officer, Ghulam Mohammad, from Kulgam. [map at

At present, there are only 10 064 bee colonies in the private sector
registered with Kashmir's agriculture department; there were 11 375
colonies registered last year [2006]. In addition, the agriculture
department has 164 bee colonies of its own.

According to farmers, the disease was reported 1st in valley in 2003, but
until now, the concerned department has not come up with any specific cure
against the disease. As the disease shows no sign of cessation, the
agriculture department has began to prescribe formic acid fumes and sulfur
powder for this disease, but the farmers don't seem to be convinced of
these as a remedial measure.

Seriously concerned about the loss caused by the mite to honey production,
the scientists at the Sheri Kashmir University of Agriculture Sciences
(SKUAST), Shalimar Srinagar said that the university is keenly studying the
disease and hope to find the cure soon. "The loss due to the disease is not
the same as it was in the beginning. We have taken up certain projects
including "fall the strip" and "sulfur fumigation" to work out the measures
to check this disease," said A.R. Wani, a scientist in the agriculture
university who is working on these projects.

[Varroosis is a worldwide distributed bee disease, caused by the mite
_Varroa destructor_ (formerly _Varroa jacobsoni_), a parasite of adult bees
and their brood. It penetrates the intersegmental skin between the
abdominal sclera of adult bees to ingest haemolymph. It can sometimes be
found between the head and thorax. The number of parasites steadily
increases with increasing brood activity and the growth of the bee
population, especially late in the season when clinical signs of
infestation can 1st be recognized. The life span of the mite depends on
temperature and humidity, but, in practice, it can be said to last from
some days to a few months.

Varroosis is reportable to the OIE; for its global distribution (2004), see
