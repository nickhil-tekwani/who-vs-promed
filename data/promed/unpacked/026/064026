The Government of Navarra has registered a case of tularemia in a forestry worker in the Leitza area, who had to be admitted to hospital, where he tested positive for the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_ with the agglutination antibody test. The autonomous community had not reported new cases of this disease for years. In fact, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the only autonomous community that was seriously affected in recent years of the last decade was Castile-Leon, which in 2014 suffered a score of cases during an outbreak of this infection.

Tularemia is a zoonotic disease, that is, it is an animal infection transmissible to humans. Fundamentally, it affects lagomorphs and rodents, although other mammals, birds, fish and amphibians can also be infected. In general, it occurs frequently in people related to hunting, meat handling and jobs associated with agriculture and livestock. Therefore, the risk groups for this disease are those formed by people who have close contact with the natural environment or its products, such as farmers, ranchers, veterinarians, hunters, fishermen, forestry employees, gardeners, cooks, and butchers.

Clinical symptoms in humans vary depending on the route of entry or the method of infection. There are 7 clinical presentations: ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, typhoid, and intestinal. Among them, the most common is ulceroglandular, which originates when contagion occurs through the bite of an arthropod or when contaminated animals or their remains are handled. An ulcer appears at the site of contact and inflammation of the regional lymph nodes occurs, along with high fever. With proper treatment (antimicrobial therapy), most patients make a full recovery.

In Spain, the autonomous community most traditionally affected since 1997 has been Castile-Leon, with special epidemiological relevance of the peasant vole in its outbreaks. In Europe, tularemia affected 16 countries in 2015 and, according to the Spanish government, the trend in the number of cases has been increasing since 2008. In the case of animals, especially lagomorphs (hares and rabbits), hesitant gaits, loss of the flight reflex, not lifting of the head, recurrent tonic spasms and, finally, death from septicemia (generalized infection caused by the presence in the blood of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins) occur.

Transmission methods are varied, as contagion can occur through direct contact with urine, feces and secretions, or through arthropod vectors, mainly fleas and ticks. However, it can also be caused by consuming contaminated water or poorly cooked infected meat, and even by the respiratory route, when inhaling dust in suspension with the presence of the bacteria.

In infections such as tularemia, prevention and vigilance are essential for its control. For this reason, it is very important to raise awareness about hygiene and biosecurity measures among the main agents susceptible to becoming infected with this disease, such as hunters.

These measures include the following: avoid contact with dead, sick animals or with unnatural behaviors (the competent authorities should be notified when something like this is observed); use gloves and masks when capturing, handling or slaughtering animals; use protective clothing and repellent products to avoid insect bites; do not consume water that is not sanitary controlled; protect yourself from dust clouds in places where animals that can transmit the disease proliferate; properly cook the meat of wild animals (with high time and temperature); see a doctor in the event of suspicious symptoms (fever, swollen glands, skin ulcers, etc.); and ensure coordination between the competent agencies and the agents involved for adequate epizootiological surveillance.

The manifestations of tularemia in this case and possible method of exposure are not stated. A single positive antibody test does not necessarily diagnose acute infection. Ideally, a positive culture and/or a rising antibody titer confirm the diagnosis.

Navarra, officially the Chartered Community of Navarra (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarre), is an autonomous community and province in northern Spain, bordering the Basque Autonomous Community, La Rioja, and Aragon in Spain and Nouvelle-Aquitaine in France. The capital city is Pamplona. It can be found on a map at the above URL. - Mod.LL
