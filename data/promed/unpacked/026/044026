Pesticides are the suspected cause of a devastating decline in the lobster
population off the coast of New York. Preliminary tests on lobsters from
Long Island Sound have found traces of pyrethroid, and researchers believe
this may be linked to [the management of] an outbreak of West Nile virus
[infection] in New York last year.
In an attempt to prevent another outbreak of the virus, which is spread by
mosquitoes, several eastern coastal states sprayed large quantities of
insecticide. Although the US Environmental Protection Agency restricts
spraying to land, scientists have surmised that heavy storms caused by
Hurricane Floyd at the time of spraying may have washed large amounts of
the pyrethroid chemicals into the sewers that flow into the Sound.
Although the pesticides may have been sufficient to cause the fatalities, a
_Paramoeba_ parasite has also been found in the nervous system of lobsters
studied, which may indicate that the insecticide affected the lobsters'
immune system, allowing the parasite to overwhelm the population.

[Although the lobsters may be more sensitive to pesticides, and
subsequently to the parasite, the dilution factors would make the amount
reaching the lobsters minuscule. There have been other lobster die-offs
prior to the discovery of West Nile virus in the US. The link between
pesticides in the lobsters and the parasites is extremely weak at this
point. - Mod.TG]
