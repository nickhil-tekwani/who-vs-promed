In its 7 May 2020 situation report, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed 2 newly infected counties in Arizona with equine cases of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Cochise County had one newly confirmed positive equine premises. Gila and Pima counties, which are both newly infected, each had one confirmed equine premises.

Arizona was the 2nd state with confirmed VSV cases in 2020, with one premises identified in Cochise County on 22 Apr 2020 and another on 27 Apr 2020. By 29 Apr 2020, a Pinal County premises was confirmed.

Premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases are quarantined for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected on the premises. [According to the USDA update on 14 May 2020: Arizona (no new positive premises) -- Since the last situation report, 2 premises have been released from quarantine -- one in Cochise County and one in Pinal County. - Mod.TG]

VSV can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these signs to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western USA have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks, (and) the most recent and largest VS outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways."

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

[According to the USDA update (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/downloads/animal_diseases/vsv/sitrep-05-14-20.pdf):

New Mexico (2 new confirmed positive, 1 new suspect premises)
- De Baca County: 1 new confirmed positive equine premises
- Dona Ana County: 1 new confirmed positive equine premises
- Sierra County: 1 new suspect equine premises
- Since the last situation report, 7 premises have been released from quarantine -- 3 in Dona Ana County, 1 in Eddy County, and 3 in Sierra County

Texas (1 new confirmed positive premises)
- Zapata County: 1 new confirmed positive equine premise

Please note, this update does NOT specify which premises are Indiana strain or New Jersey strain.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses, cattle, and swine. The agent causing VSV has a wide host range and can occasionally infect sheep and goats. In affected livestock, VSV causes blister-like lesions to form in the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves, and teats. These blisters swell and break, leaving raw tissue that is so painful that infected animals generally refuse to eat and drink and show signs of lameness. Severe weight loss usually follows, and in dairy cows a severe drop in milk production commonly occurs. Affected dairy cattle can appear to be normal and will continue to eat about half of their feed intake.

Known competent vectors for transmission of VSV include black flies, sand flies, and biting midges (_Culicoides_ spp.). The use of equine fly/mosquito approved spray is helpful in controlling the insect vectors transmitting this virus. - Mod.TG
