[Following is a press release from PACNEWS. We would greatly appreciate
further information, in particular regarding ascertained diagnosis. Thanks.
- YS
A medical team was rushed into Jimi district in Papua New Guinea's Western
Highlands Province Thursday following reports that an outbreak of influenza
has claimed 114 lives. Official reports put the death toll at 84 in the
Lower Jimi area while the rest of the casualties were from the Upper and
Middle Jimi areas, The National reports.
These reports have prompted the Division of Health to send in a team which
will be in the area for three weeks to assess the situation and distribute
medicines to the affected people. According to the Department of Western
Highlands and the Malaria Surveillance and Control Unit in Goroka, Eastern
Highlands, the epidemic could be higher because all health facilities in
the district have been shut down and not all deaths may be reported as most
parts of the district are not accessible by road or air.
Western Highlands health chief Kelly Kewa said most of the deaths were due
to complications like pneumonia, especially in children and the elderly but
generally the epidemic is affecting all age groups.
