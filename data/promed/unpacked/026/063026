The Belize Agricultural Health Authority (BAHA) has detected suspected cases of the virulent Newcastle disease in poultry in southern Belize. According to BAHA, the "disease is endemic in Belize and historically the country has experienced sporadic outbreaks in backyard poultry."

BAHA reported earlier this month [September 2021] their laboratory in Central Farm conducted PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests on poultry samples received from Silver Creek village in Toledo and the results were positive for Newcastle disease. However, international protocols are being followed and in line with the policy of World Organization for International Health (OIE) for listing a disease of trade importance, "a positive result from BAHA is considered a suspect case and samples need to be sent to an OIE reference laboratory for confirmation."

In a press release issued late on Friday evening [3 Sep 2021], the Government of Belize informed "BAHA, in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Enterprise, the Belize Poultry Association, the Regional International Organization for Agricultural Health (OIRSA) and the Interamerican Institute for Collaboration on Agriculture (IICA), is now instituting the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan which BAHA has for OIE listed poultry diseases of trade importance."

The emergency plan includes movement control to prevent further spread from the infected region, vaccination of backyard poultry to curb the epidemic and maintaining a high level of biosecurity of the commercial operations. This will be accompanied by a public awareness programme and continuous monitoring of affected areas.

The release advises the public as well as backyard and commercial poultry producers to be vigilant for sick and dying birds and report cases to BAHA and the Ministry of Agriculture.

["Virulent Newcastle disease, formerly known as exotic Newcastle disease, is a contagious and fatal viral disease affecting the respiratory, nervous and digestive systems of birds and poultry. The disease is so virulent that many birds and poultry die without showing any clinical signs.

"Virulent Newcastle disease is not a food safety concern. No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected with mild signs, such as conjunctivitis. These are easily prevented with personal protective equipment" (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/virulent-newcastle/vnd).

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a paramyxovirus infecting poultry populations. The disease is usually controlled by mass vaccination using a modified live vaccine.

"Newcastle disease virus can produce a transitory conjunctivitis in humans. The condition has primarily been reported in laboratory workers and in members of vaccination teams exposed to large quantities of virus. Before vaccination was widely practiced, infections were also reported in workers eviscerating poultry infected with Newcastle disease virus. In developed countries, birds infected with Newcastle disease virus are not processed, but in village poultry and live markets of developing countries, Newcastle disease is common and may not preclude slaughter of infected birds. The disease has not been reported in individuals who raise poultry or consume poultry products" (Fenner's Veterinary Virology, 5th ed, 2017). - Mod.TG
