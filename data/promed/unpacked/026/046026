PRION TRANSFER, STOMACH TO BRAIN
********************************
A ProMED-mail posting

Adriano Aguzzi and other members of the Institute of Neuropathology at the
University of Zurich [Switzerland] report in Nature that prions involved in
CJD can travel from the stomach to the spleen and lymphatic system where they
accumulate, and that normal prion protein is needed for the abnormal form
to replicate and invade the central nervous system and the brain.
Aguzzi was quoted as saying, "The whole thing is about how the abnormal
prion (protein) spreads from one place to another in the body."
The story says the Swiss team used mice infected with scrapie to follow the
route of prion invasion.
