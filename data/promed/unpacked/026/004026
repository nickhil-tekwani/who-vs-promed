It might be of relevance to determine the following with regard to the cattle reported to have been exported from China to Jordan in 2004:
1. Was the consignment or any part of it transported by air?
2. Were any animals in the consignment vaccinated before export?
3. Were animals in the consignment treated with contact-knock-down external parasiticides immediately before export?

As I understand it, BEF [bovine ephemeral fever] prepatent period is usually short as also is viraemia in cattle under natural circumstances, hence the absence of evidence of long-range international transmission via sea transportation of cattle. Air transportation could be a completely different story (for incubating or viraemic cattle and, theoretically, also for infected vectors).

I don't know how cattle were transported from China to Jordan or Egypt - air, sea?
How long does the journey take?
BEF has a very brief viraemia, I forget the length of incubation period.

Given lack of contact transmission (vector-mediated infection only) it seems unlikely that infection would be maintained throughout transport, unless vector was transported along with infected animals or transport was extremely speedy.

[Drs Thomson and Friedgut's questions/doubts are correct and worth being addressed by those who may have the answers, particularly regarding the mode/duration of transport and the (Jordanian) veterinary import requirements. Responses will be appreciated.

According to available information (2008 review at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/bovine_ephemeral_fever.pdf), incubation period -- in experimental BEFV infections -- is 1 to 10 days, with most cases developing between 3 and 5 days after exposure. The natural incubation period is probably similar; carriers are not known to occur.

In case transport was by sea, exceeding 10 days, the possibility of virus circulation during travel, within the transported consignment, either by accompanying/incidental vectors or by other means, including mechanical (such as, iatrogenic), should be ruled out.

BEF is not included in OIE's diseases list. This means that there are no internationally-binding technical data to back official animal-health/veterinary certification requirements; those are liable to bilateral agreements between exporting and importing countries. Though the OIE has included scientifically based chapters on several non-listed diseases of bovidae in the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, BEF is not included. The 2011 edition of the Manual (section 2.4) includes 6 non-listed "other diseases of importance to international trade" in bovidae -- namely bovine cysticercosis, bovine genital campylobacteriosis, bovine viral diarrhoea, dermatophilosis, malignant catarrhal fever, and trypanosomiasis (tsetse-transmitted). Section 2.9 includes 7 disease entities common to bovidae and other species: _Campylobacter jejuni_ and _C. coli_, cryptosporidiosis, _Listeria monocytogenes_, mange, salmonellosis, toxoplasmosis, and verocytotoxigenic _E. coli_ (VTEC). The 2 Manual sections can be found at http://www.oie.int/international-standard-setting/terrestrial-manual/access-online/.

Vaccines against BEF can be live attenuated or killed; for a list of manufacturers, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Vaccines/disease_list.php?disease=bovine-ephemeral-fever&lang=en.

Some data on economic losses due to BEF, as recorded in Israel, have been presented in ProMED-mail posting 20090713.2502. - Mod.AS]
