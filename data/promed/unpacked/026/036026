Russian authorities have warned people near the country's border with Mongolia not to hunt or eat marmots after an outbreak of bubonic plague.

Two cases of the plague were recorded in the Khovd province in western Mongolia, reported Russian state media agency TASS on [Tue 7 Jul 2020].

Officials from the Republican Ministry of Agriculture and Food told citizens in the border area not to hunt marmots or eat marmot meat, and take preventive measures against insect bites.

Marmots are large ground squirrels, a type of rodent, that have historically been linked to plague outbreaks in the region. Rodents are the main [reservoir] of plague transmission from animals to humans, and the disease can also be passed on through flea bites. Bubonic plague, which is one of plague's 3 forms, causes painful, swollen lymph nodes, as well as fever, chills, and coughing.

Plague killed an estimated 50 million people in Europe during the Black Death pandemic in the Middle Ages, but modern antibiotics can prevent complications and death if administered quickly enough.

Mongolia quarantined its region near the Russian border last week [1 Jul 2020] after lab tests showed 2 cases of bubonic plague linked to the consumption of marmot meat, the country's health officials said.

Mongolia's National Center for Zoonotic Diseases said last week it had identified and tested 146 people who had come into contact with the 2 infected people. The center also identified 504 people of secondary contact in the Khovd province.

The Russian Embassy in Mongolia said "there are no grounds for serious concern" as the Mongolian authorities have imposed travel restrictions and isolated infected individuals, according to Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti.

The embassy also cited Sergei Diorditsu, a World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Mongolia, who reportedly said the province sees seasonal outbreaks of the plague, according to RIA Novosti. "There are natural foci of plague in Mongolia and the disease is spread by tarbagans [Mongolian marmots]," said the embassy. "The problem is that local residents who, despite all prohibitions and recommendations of local authorities, continue to hunt them and eat them, as this is a local delicacy."

Authorities in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia have also confirmed a case of the plague. The case in the city of Bayannur, northwest of Beijing, was confirmed [Tue 7 Jul 2020], according to state-run Xinhua news agency.

In 2019 a couple in Mongolia died after eating a raw marmot kidney, triggering a quarantine that left several tourists stranded in the region.

Anywhere from 1000 to 2000 people get the plague every year, according to the WHO, but that estimate does not account for unreported cases.

[The Siberian marmot (_Marmota sibirica_) is a commonly hunted wildlife species in Mongolia, for their meat and skin.

Plague, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic in wild rodent populations (mainly marmots) over large rural areas of Mongolia. Natural plague foci have occurred over 28.3% of Mongolia, and 47.1% of these foci are highly active. Highly active plague foci exist mainly in the western part of Mongolia. A total of 27% of all plague cultures were isolated from ectoparasites of 12 species of endemic mammals and 1 species of bird.

Most plague cultures isolated from ectoparasites of mammals were from fleas (91.5%). The majority of cultures isolated from fleas were from marmot fleas (64.5% of all fleas). The marmot flea (_Oropsylla silantiewi_) is considered the primary vector of plague. [Portions of this comment were extracted from https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2009.0047]. - Mod.PMB
