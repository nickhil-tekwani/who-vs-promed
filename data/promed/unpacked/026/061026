Farmers in Cuttack district are in despair as their crops are affected by an unknown disease, posing a threat to a good yield of paddy this [2017] season. They have been spraying available medicines on their paddy fields but it has failed to yield results. Hundreds of hectares of paddy are affected due to an unknown pest which is ruining the roots of the plants.

The district agriculture officer said that the department does not have any medicine for this disease. "Our village level workers are presently conducting surveillance. We will take necessary measures to save the paddy after going through the report," he said.

[A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes, have been reported to affect rice crops in the region. The symptoms of root rot described above could be caused by a number of fungi, as well as some bacterial or nematode pathogens and are not sufficient for diagnosis. Although a 'pest' is also mentioned and the original source carries a photo of a caterpillar, such insects live above ground and would not affect roots. An infectious pathogen appears a more likely cause, with insects as possible secondary invaders of affected plants. A soil borne root rot pathogen would not respond to agrochemical sprays, which presumably are the 'medicines' found ineffective by the farmers above.

Reliable diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
