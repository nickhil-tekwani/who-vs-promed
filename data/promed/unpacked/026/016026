BioCryst Pharmaceuticals (BCRX.O) said a late-stage study testing the
intravenous form of its experimental influenza drug peramivir showed
the drug was not inferior to another flu drug, Tamiflu [oseltamivir],
sending its shares up 50 percent in premarket trade. The study,
sponsored by BioCryst's partner Shionogi & Co Ltd (4507.T) of Japan,
compared the efficacy and safety of a single dose of peramivir --
either 300 mg or 600 mg -- with oral 75 mg of Tamiflu. Both the 300
mg and 600 mg single dose peramivir groups demonstrated
non-inferiority to Tamiflu. A total of 1099 patients were enrolled at
146 centers, the company said.

BioCryst said it is currently finalizing its plans for late-stage
studies of peramivir intended to support U.S. regulatory approval and
also continuing to support the pre-emergency use authorization review
of peramivir by the regulators.

In May 2009, BioCryst said government agencies were considering the
future option of providing intravenous peramivir through an emergency
use authorization in the event of a severe influenza outbreak with
significant hospitalizations.

[Dr Suzuki adds that peramivir is an intravenous form of
neuraminidase inhibitor. The report from the pharmaceutical company
lacks important information on the study design, particularly a
definition of "non-inferiority." I am also curious about the
proportion of people infected with oseltamivir-resistant strain among
the study population.

ProMED-mail does not normally report the outcome of clinical trails,
but the appearance of oseltamivir-resistant isolates of influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (see below) may, in the long term,
diminish the utility of Tamiflu, leaving Relenza as the only proven
alternate neuraminidase inhibitor. The effectiveness of peramivir
against oseltamivir-resistant virus is not disclosed in this report
but is highly relevant to its potential usefulness as an antiviral. -

[2] Oseltamivir resistance

Canada has recorded a case of Tamiflu-resistant swine flu virus in a
Quebec man who had been given the drug to prevent infection.
Meanwhile, Japan revealed Tuesday [21 Jul 2009] it had found a 2nd
such case of Tamiflu resistance, in a person who has no ties to the
country's earlier reported case. The cases are the 4th and 5th
globally since the new H1N1 virus was discovered in April [2009].

The Quebec man, 60, was given the flu antiviral after his son fell
ill with the pandemic virus. It's believed the resistance arose in
the man, and there is no evidence he transmitted resistant virus to
anyone else. "It appears to be an isolated case," said Jirina Vlk,
spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Canada. "Although the
strain does not appear to have spread beyond the reported individual
case, we continue to be vigilant on this front."

Use of Tamiflu to prevent infection -- a procedure called prophylaxis
-- has been seen on occasion to give rise to resistant viruses. "We
know that it was going to happen, and it's not good news that it's
happening," said Dr. Allison McGeer, an influenza expert at Toronto's
Mount Sinai Hospital. But she said given the amount of Tamiflu being
used in the world right now, such cases are bound to arise. "It's the
problem with influenza, right? Either we're going to see small
numbers of these, and they're just going to kind of appear
periodically, and we're all going to worry, or it's going to go big,"
McGeer said. "There's probably not going to be much in between."

Another such case cropped up in Japan in the city of Yamaguchi.
Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases logged genetic
sequence data for the virus on Tuesday [21 Jul 2009] in GenBank, a
repository for genetic sequences used by flu researchers. The lab's
director, Dr. Masato Tashiro, confirmed the case in an email
containing details provided to the World Health Organization. The new
case was a person who had been given the antiviral drug as
post-exposure prophylaxis, an attempt to prevent illness in a person
exposed to the pandemic virus. The person has since recovered, and it
appears that there has been no spread, the email stated. The virus
was sensitive to Relenza, a 2nd drug in the same class [i.e. a
neuraminidase inhibitor] as Tamiflu. The earlier Japanese case had
occurred in a person in the city of Osaka.

Other cases have been reported by Denmark and Hong Kong. Four of the
5 cases arose in people who had been taking the drug. One, however,
was recorded in a girl from San Francisco who travelled while sick to
Hong Kong. Health inspectors at the airport there pulled her aside
and tested her for swine flu. She was positive but told doctors there
she hadn't taken Tamiflu. That suggests the virus that caused her
infection was already resistant. U.S. officials have intensified
surveillance for resistant viruses in the San Francisco area but say
they have not found other cases.

The Public Health Agency says the Quebec man recovered from his bout
of swine flu without complications and never needed hospitalization.
Vlk [the agency's spokesperson] said the agency recommends using
Tamiflu for treatment only, adding prudent use of the drug could
stave off the development of resistance.

[Fortunately so far, there is no evidence that the
oseltamivir-resistant virus has exhibited increased virulence or
fitness, but continued vigilance and avoidance of indiscriminate use
of the drug are essential. - Mod.CP]
