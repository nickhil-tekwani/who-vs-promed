Iowa state health officials are reporting an increase in congenital syphilis cases in 2021, the Carroll Broadcasting Company reports. To date, 9 cases have been identified in Iowa that meet the definition for congenital syphilis. That matches the number of cases seen in the previous 12 years combined. And health officials say the upward trend shows no sign of slowing and may in fact be accelerating.

Congenital syphilis is an infectious disease transmitted by an infected mother to her baby in the womb. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact but mothers can transmit the infection to their baby in the womb or through the birthing process. The disease can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, death shortly after birth, prematurity and birth defects. A woman can be treated and cured for syphilis during pregnancy, but it is important for women to be tested in time for treatment to be effective. Babies who test positive for syphilis at birth must be treated immediately to prevent serious health issues.

[Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 29 Jul 2021, show nearly 2100 cases of congenital syphilis in 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/Congenital-Syphilis-preliminaryData.htm).

The latest comprehensive data for syphilis in the USA can be found at: National overview - sexually transmitted disease surveillance, 2019 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis). The following is extracted from that report:

"Since reaching a historic low in 2000 and 2001, the rate of P&S (primary and secondary) syphilis has increased almost every year, increasing 11.2% during 2018-2019. Rates increased among both males and females, in all regions of the United States, and among all racial/Hispanic ethnicity groups.

"Since 2000, rates of P&S syphilis have increased among men, likely attributable to increases in cases among MSM; however, increases among MSM may be slowing. In jurisdictions with consistent collection of sex of sex partners, case counts among MSM were stable during 2018-2019. Still, MSM are disproportionately impacted, accounting for a majority (56.7%) of all male P&S syphilis cases in 2019. Although rates of P&S syphilis are lower among women, rates have increased substantially in recent years, increasing 30% during 2018-2019 and 178.6% during 2015-2019, suggesting the heterosexual syphilis epidemic continues to rapidly increase.

"The 2013 rate of congenital syphilis (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births) marked the first increase in congenital syphilis since 2008. Since 2013, the rate of congenital syphilis has increased each year. In 2019, 1870 cases of congenital syphilis were reported. Although the majority of cases were reported from a few states, 44 jurisdictions (43 states and the District of Columbia) reported at least one case of congenital syphilis in 2019. The national rate of 48.5 cases per 100,000 live births in 2019 represents a 41.4% increase relative to 2018 and 291.1% increase relative to 2015.

"During 2018-2019 the number of syphilitic stillbirths increased (from 79 to 94 stillbirths), as did the number of congenital syphilis related infant deaths (from 15 to 34 deaths). In 2019, the most common missed congenital syphilis prevention opportunity was a lack of adequate maternal syphilis treatment despite receipt of a timely syphilis diagnosis (40.2%). The 2nd most common missed congenital syphilis prevention opportunity in 2019 was a lack of timely prenatal care and subsequent lack of timely syphilis testing (36.3%)." - Mod.ML
