Bovine TB Case Traced to Indiana Farm
-------------------------------

Staff of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) is investigating a case of bovine tuberculosis (commonly called "TB," or more formally known as _Mycobacterium bovis_) in a beef cattle herd in Southeastern Indiana. The TB-positive cattle were identified through routine inspection at a meat processing facility in Pennsylvania.

BOAH veterinarians are in the process of conducting a thorough investigation of the Indiana herd from which the animals were shipped. In follow up to the initial positive report, the infected herd will be depopulated. A total of 6 beef steers were condemned at slaughter last week [25 Apr - 1 May 2016] after exhibiting signs of TB. _M. bovis_ was confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture laboratory in Ames, IA over the weekend.

BOAH staff is working closely with the herd owner to trace any movements of animals into and out of the herd. As information develops, BOAH will notify herd owners and others who may be impacted by the investigation.

Indiana has officially held a bovine tuberculosis-free status since 1984 with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Under federal guidelines, that status remains. BOAH has found individual cases of TB in a cattle herd and a cervid farm in this region of the state between 2008 and 2011.

BOAH is also coordinating efforts with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to determine if the disease is present in the wildlife population. BOAH and DNR have worked together on surveillance of hunter-harvested white-tailed deer in Franklin and surrounding counties since 2009. Of 430 wild white-tailed deer examined, none were found infected.

About Bovine TB
---------------

Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease that affects primarily cattle, but can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal. TB is difficult to diagnose through clinical signs alone. In the early stages of the disease, clinical signs are not visible. Later, signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present. Cattle owners who notice these signs in their livestock should contact their private veterinarian.

More information about the disease and the investigation, as it develops, will be available on the BOAH website at: <www.boah.in.gov>.

[Bovine TB is a disease that generally develops slowly and the animal may not show any clinical signs for a long period of time. Tracing animals having been in contact with an infected animal is extremely important and can be a time consuming process.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------
Q. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?
A. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.

Q. What animals can it affect?
A. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.

Q. What are the signs of bovine TB?
A. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.

Q. What should I do if my animals show these symptoms?
A. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.

How Bovine TB Can Spread
------------------------
Q. How does TB get into cattle herds?
A. TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the United States, the 2 most common methods of introduction are:
1) Purchase of or exposure to infected cattle, or
2) Exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife. The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spread through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.

Q. How can I reduce the risk of my cattle herd being infected with TB?
A. Following these best practices will help keep TB out of your herd:
- Have your livestock tested for TB and, if possible, keep a closed herd and raise your own replacement stock.
- Buy your animals from an accredited TB-free herd, test the new animals prior to purchase, and finally, isolate them for 60 days and retest before commingling them with your herd.
- Restrict or eliminate all contact between your herd and other herds.
- Clean with a disinfectant any trailers or facilities that have housed newly purchased animals or animals that did not originate from your herd.
- Keep on-farm visitors away from your herd whenever possible. This includes milk haulers, feed delivery personnel, and anyone who may have contact with other herds.
- Make sure your fences are in good condition to separate your herd from wildlife. If the wildlife in your area is affected by TB, contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services office in your State for advice on reducing wildlife contact with your herd. You can reach Wildlife Services staff by calling 1-866-4USDA-WS (1-866-487-3297).

Q. Are dairies more susceptible to bovine TB?
A. The layout and activities of a dairy operation offer a greater chance for exposure to bovine TB than those of a beef operation. Dairy cows spend more time in enclosed areas or in crowded conditions, where there is a higher risk of exposure. Unpasteurized milk and unpasteurized colostrum, which are 2 main sources of nourishment for calves, can also spread the disease.

Bovine TB Testing
-----------------
Q. How does USDA test for bovine TB?
A. USDA uses 2 methods to test for bovine TB. The main method of testing is a tuberculin skin test, where the animal receives an injection of tuberculin in the skin and is checked for a reaction 72 hours later. There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with bovine TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories for confirmation.

Q. How many animals in the United States are tested for bovine TB each year?
A. Each year, more than 1 million animals receive a skin test, and approximately 11 000 cattle are sampled during slaughter surveillance.

Q. Typically, when are animals tested for bovine TB?
A. Animals are tested if they are:
- Suspected of having bovine TB;
- Part of an epidemiological investigation, such as a TB trace from an affected herd;
- Required to for participation in a show or exhibition;
- Required to for a change of ownership;
- Preparing for interstate movement; or
- Part of surveillance activities at slaughter.

Wildlife and TB
-------------
Q. Does wildlife spread TB to commercial cattle?
A. Wildlife and cattle with TB can pass the infection to each other.

Q. What is the risk of TB transmission from local wildlife?
A. In areas where free-ranging deer are known to be infected with TB, deer that have direct contact with cattle could pose a risk of transmitting the disease. While the risk of transmitting TB is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns, livestock can become infected if they share common watering or feeding places contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges from infected wildlife.

Q. How can I find out if the wildlife in my area has TB?
A. Contact your State's game and fish commission or department of natural resources. You can find specific contact information for State and local government agencies on the U.S. Government's official Web portal at <www.usa.gov>.

Q. What steps can I take to keep my cattle safe from TB in wildlife?
A. Always practice good biosecurity and avoid keeping livestock in the same enclosure as wildlife. Try to keep wildlife away from outdoor feeding and watering containers, such as troughs and pools. Additionally, store your animal feed in areas that wildlife cannot access. Should wildlife get into stored feed, discard that feed immediately, and do not give it to your cattle.
