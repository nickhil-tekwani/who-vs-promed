Turkey: 2 More Children Released from Hospital
-----------------------------------------------
2 more children have been discharged from hospital after recovering from
avian influenza in eastern Turkey doctors said, as they stressed that early
treatment after infection was proving crucial for survival. A 9-year-old
girl and her 3-year-old brother, 2 of 21 people who have been infected with
avian influenza in Turkey, were discharged late Monday [22 Jan 2006] from
the University Hospital in Van, their doctor, Ahmet Faik Oner, told AFP by
telephone. These siblings were cousins of a 16-year-old girl, one of 4
victims who have died of the disease in the country since 1 Jan 2006, the
1st human fatalities from avian influenza outside Southeast Asia and China.
7 other carriers of the potentially deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus
remain under treatment in different Turkish hospitals. Turkish officials
say the outbreak in their country appears to be fading, with no new cases
reported in nearly a week and infected people staging recoveries.
In the Van hospital, where all 4 deaths occurred, physicians said they were
hopeful of saving the remaining 2 patients there, including the 5-year-old
brother of the deceased 16-year-old, who is described as one of the gravest
cases.
Turkish doctors say the mortality rate they are observing -- 19 percent --
is encouraging when compared with the 58 percent in eastern Asia, where the
disease has claimed some 80 lives since 2003. "We see that the sooner the
patients are brought to hospital after infection, the more successful the
treatment is," Oner told AFP. "If we compare the 4 dead children to those
who survived, we see that they came to the hospital 10 days on average
after they began showing symptoms, while the others were hospitalized after
5 days on average," he said.
While optimism in Turkey is growing, there were fears that avian influenza
may have spread to the Turkish-occupied northern 3rd of Cyprus. Authorities
there have begun culling poultry, after 2 sick birds showed signs of what
could be avian flu, officials said on Tue 24 Jan 2006. Ferdi Sabit Soyer,
the prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) -- a
breakaway state recognized only by Turkey -- said on Monday [23 Jan 2006]
that a routine veterinary inspection had revealed 2 suspected cases in a
village near Famagusta, on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean island.
"Our labs are unable to determine whether or not this is bird flu," a
senior official told AFP in Nicosia. Samples have been sent to Turkey and
Britain for analysis, and results are expected Thursday [26 Jan 2006]. If
the disease is confirmed, they would be the 1st bird flu cases in Cyprus,
which lies just 40 nautical miles off Turkey's southern coast. The
internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot government in the south of the
island said in early January 2006 that it was looking for cooperation from
Turkey and the TRNC to prevent the spread of bird flu.

[As of 25 Jan 2006, there is a continuing discrepancy between the number of
confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection in Turkey
cited by WHO
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2
006_01_25/en/index.html>
and those reported by the Turkish authorities. According to WHO, the
cumulative number of human cases of H5N1 virus infection in Turkey remains
at 4 with 2 deaths, figures very different from the 21 cases with 4 deaths
reported by the Turkish Ministry of Health. If the WHO figures are used,
the mortality rate becomes 50 percent, which is similar to that observed in
East Asia, rather than the 19 percent estimate given by the Turkish
authorities. The discrepancy needs to be resolved: either the Turkish
authorities are over-estimating the number of human avian influenza cases,
or the number of cases of infection in East Asia is being under-estimated.

[2] China - 7th death (WHO Update 2)

China: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 2
-----------------------------------------------
As of 25 Jan 2006, the Ministry of Health in China has confirmed the
country's 10th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case occurred in a 29-year-old woman from Chengdu City in the
south-central province of Sichuan. She developed fever on 12 Jan 2006 and
was hospitalized with symptoms of pneumonia. Authorities say her condition
deteriorated rapidly, and she died on 23 Jan 2006. Information provided to
WHO indicates that she was self-employed in a shop selling dry goods. No
information on possible exposure to diseased birds as the source of her
infection is presently available, but an investigation is underway. Close
contacts have been placed under medical observation.
This is the 2nd human case reported this year [2006] in China, both from
Sichuan Province. The 2 Sichuan cases occurred in different prefectures
located around 150 km apart. A confirmed outbreak of H5N1 in poultry began
in late December 2005 in another part of the province. No outbreaks have
been confirmed in the areas where the 2 human cases resided.
During 2005, Chinese agricultural authorities reported 32 outbreaks in
poultry in 12 provinces, resulting in the culling of more than 24 million
birds. The appearance of human cases in areas without reported poultry
outbreaks is a cause for concern. WHO recommends that, in China, testing
for possible H5N1 infection should be undertaken in all cases of severe
respiratory disease having no alternative diagnosis, even when no poultry
outbreak has been reported in the patient's area of residence.
Of the 10 cases confirmed in China, 7 have been fatal. The cases have
occurred in 7 provinces and regions: Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi,
Fujian, Hunan, and Sichuan. No poultry outbreaks have been officially
reported in 2 of these provinces.

[3] North Korea - Suspected case

Japanese Group Says North Korean Infected With Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
A Japanese group helping defectors from North Korea said on Wed [25 Jan
2006] that a woman in Pyongyang was infected with bird flu last month,
after chickens carrying the disease were found in the capital. Lee
Young-wha, head of Rescue the North Korean People's Urgent Action Network,
did not elaborate on how members of his group had found the woman to be
affected but said she was reported to have been admitted to a Red Cross
hospital in December [2005]. He had the group, strongly critical of North
Korean leader Kim Jong-il, make checks, after scientists from a group
representing pro-Pyongyang Koreans living in Japan went to North Korea
carrying 10 packs of the anti-flu drug Tamiflu. Lee, however, said members
of the group could not verify whether the woman had been infected with the
virulent H5N1 strain of avian influenza or a less virulent strain.
North Korea's state media said in November 2005 that it was stepping up its
efforts to counter an outbreak of bird flu, but no cases of human infection
had been reported.

[A ProMED-mail correspondent in Japan has provided the following additional
information from Sankei Shimbun, Japan's 5th largest daily newspaper. A
government source has stated that there have been outbreaks of bird flu in
rural areas of North Korea since September 2005 and outbreaks in 3 areas of
Pyongyang in December 2005. At least one woman was infected and admitted to
the Red Cross Hospital in Pyongyang. A Japanese public security service
source confirmed that the Association of Chosun People in Japan delivered a
quantity of Tamiflu to Pyongyang last September [2005].
Further information about the current disease situation in North Korea and
confirmation or not of the suspected human case would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]

Indonesia: Chicken Vendor Hospitalized with Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
An Indonesian chicken seller in Jakarta is in hospital after being infected
with H5N1 avian influenza virus, according to local test results, a senior
Health Ministry official said on Wed 25 Jan 2006. Hariadi Wibisono,
director of control of animal-borne diseases at the ministry, said the
22-year-old man was being treated in a Jakarta hospital designated for bird
flu patients.
"Local tests show he was positive for avian influenza virus. He is a
chicken vendor in a traditional market," Wibisono said, adding blood
samples had been sent to a Hong Kong laboratory recognized by the World
Health Organization for confirmation.
Indonesia has had 14 confirmed deaths from bird flu and 5 cases in which
patients have survived.
