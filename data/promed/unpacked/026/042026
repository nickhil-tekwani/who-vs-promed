A total of 40 Cambodian children died of dengue fever in the 1st 7
months of this year [2011], an increase from 37 such deaths in all of
last year [2010], minister of health Mam Bunheng said on Monday [22
Aug 2011].

>From January to July this year [2011], some 7867 cases of dengue fever
had been reported, exceeding the 2010 total of 5497 cases, the
minister told reporters during a visit to dengue fever patients at the
National Pediatric Hospital in Phnom Penh.

"The disease has claimed more Cambodian children's lives this year
[2011] than last year [2010], so I'd like to appeal to parents to let
their children sleep under mosquito nets and if their kids have
symptoms that are suspicious of the disease, they should urgently send
them for medical attention," he said.

Dengue is an infectious tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.
Symptoms include headache, fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and joint
pain, swollen glands, and rash.

In Cambodia, outbreaks of dengue fever usually take place in the rainy
season from May to October.

with the storm [hurricane Irene] could add to the dengue fever problem
