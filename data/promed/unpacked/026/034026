The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) is seeing an uptick in bats testing positive for rabies. As of [Thu 28 Jun 2018], the MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories has identified rabies in 22 bats and 2 skunks. Last year [2017] at this time, MDHHS had identified 9 bats with rabies. Michiganders are reminded to adopt practices that protect their families and animals from rabies.

Rabies is a viral disease of mammals that is transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal. Bats and skunks are the most common carriers of rabies in Michigan. In 2017, there were 38 cases of rabies in animals in Michigan, including 35 bats, 2 skunks, and one cat.

Michigan local health departments experience an increase in calls from citizens about bat encounters during the warm weather months between May and September. During this time, bats are more active, searching for food and rearing their young. While bats are beneficial to our ecosystem, they are also one of the species of animal that is a natural host for the rabies virus.

People or pets usually get exposed to rabies when they are bitten by an infected animal. Other situations that may present a risk are when a bat is found in a room with people who have been asleep, or a bat is found with an unattended child or impaired adult who cannot be sure they didn't have contact with the bat. In these cases, it is important to collect the bat for rabies testing.

Rabies is [almost always] fatal to humans. Post exposure treatment [prophylaxis] is given to people who are exposed to a potentially rabid animal. Treatment is not necessary if the animal tests negative for rabies.

Despite its ability to infect all mammals, rabies virus persists in numerous species-specific cycles that rarely sustain transmission in alternative species. Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus.

Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts.

Bat rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, with the infections almost always fatal, unless treated. Also, a dog or a cat infected with a bat rabies virus can infect a human. - Mod.PMB
