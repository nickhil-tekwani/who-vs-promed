The latest outbreak of Ebola [virus disease] in the Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] has ended after claiming 34 lives, Health Minister Felix Kabange Numbi said on Monday [26 Nov 2012]. According to revised figures, 62 people are believed to have been infected during the latest epidemic, which was declared in mid-August 2012 in the northeastern Orientale Province and which officially ended on Friday [23 Nov 2012, he said.

The Health Ministry, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control based in Atlanta, Georgia (CDC), Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), [and the USAID PREDICT project] have been working in close cooperation to combat the outbreak.

To date, no treatment or vaccine is available for Ebola virus disease, which kills between 25 and 90 percent of those who fall sick, depending on the strain of the virus, according to the WHO. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with blood, faeces, or sweat, or by sexual contact or unprotected handling of contaminated corpses.

The DRC has now recorded 8 outbreaks of Ebola virus disease, one of the world's most virulent diseases, since the virus was first reported near a river that gave the disease its name in 1976.

[The WHO's most recent report on this outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the DRC reported that 52 cases and 25 deaths had occurred during the course of this outbreak, which is attributed to infection by the Bundibugyo strain of Ebola virus. The report above gives the final tally as 62 cases and 34 deaths.

Currently 2 other regions in Central Africa are afflicted by outbreaks of filovirus infection. An outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Sudan strain) is affecting the Luwero and Kampala districts of Uganda. 6 confirmed cases and 4 probable cases have been reported, and there have been 5 deaths.

An outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in western Uganda as a result of Marburg disease virus infection has been responsible for at least nine fatalities. The outbreak has affected in 4 districts in southwestern Uganda (Kampala (the capital city), Ibanda, Mbarara, and Kabale). It appears that the outbreak is being successfully contained by the prompt response of the Ugandan Ministry of Health and its partners.

It would seem that currently in Central Africa conditions are right for the transmission of filovirus infections. Concurrently the ability of the local medical authorities and their international partners to respond to these events has improved significantly.
