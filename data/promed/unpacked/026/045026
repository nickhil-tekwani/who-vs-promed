Pakistan's polio count for the year [2022] has risen to 13 with one case reported on Friday [22 Jul 2022] as the South Asian nation looks to contain a disease mostly eradicated elsewhere, officials said.

The latest case was found in the north west province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and involved an 18 month old boy reported to be undernourished, the health ministry said in a statement. The previous 12 were reported from North Waziristan district, which in the past was a lawless area mainly under the control of Pakistani Taliban before military operations were launched against the group in 2014.

"This is the first polio case reported from outside of North Waziristan district where vaccinators were still facing serious challenges in reaching out to children due to resistance from local religious leaders and unwilling parents," provincial health department officials told Reuters.

Last month [June 2022], a vaccination official along with 2 policemen on security duty were shot dead during a polio inoculation drive in KP province.

"This case puts the wild polio case count for endemic countries at 14, with 13 cases from Pakistan between April and June 2022 and one case from Afghanistan in January [2022]," the ministry said.

[From the media reports, this case occurred outside North Waziristan (southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). According to Dawn (Pakistan media), the case is from Lakki Marwat (https://www.dawn.com/news/1701072/13th-polio-case-from-kp-puts-question-mark-on-vaccination). Lakki Marwat is to the east of North Waziristan, still in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but spread outside of the previously identified transmission zone -- not surprising, but disconcerting nevertheless.

This case now makes a total of 16 cases of WPV1 associated AFP confirmed in 2022 -- 13 in Pakistan, 1 in Afghanistan, 1 in Malawi and 1 in Mozambique.

[At the global level looking at confirmed cases to date comparing 2022 to 2021, there is a significant increase in both WPV1 associated AFP cases (14 vs 2) and cVDPV associated AFP cases (181 vs 153).

In the past week, the 13th WPV1 associated AFP case in Pakistan was confirmed (see Poliomyelitis update (28): WPV1 AFP (Pakistan), IHR meeting 20220625.8704083 for media report of this case). In addition, there were 2 countries reporting cVDPV2 activity -- both with AFP cases (Nigeria, Yemen).

[3] USA (New York): VDPV2 - PAHO alert

Epidemiological alert: detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) in the United States: implications for the Region of the Americas - 21 Jul 2022
-----------------------------------------------------------
Given the identification of a case of acute flaccid paralysis related to type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus in an unvaccinated individual from Rockland County, New York, USA, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) reiterates to member states to join efforts in order to maintain and strengthen surveillance for the detection of cases and achieve adequate vaccination coverage against poliomyelitis.

Situation summary
No cases of wild poliovirus have been detected in the countries and territories of the Region of the Americas in over 30 years. In 1994, the Americas became the first region in the world to be certified polio-free by the World Health Organization (WHO). The early detection of cases through the implementation of surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age and maintaining adequate polio vaccination coverage have been key to this achievement.

On 21 Jul 2022, as a result of surveillance conducted in the USA, the New York State Department of Health reported the identification of a case of paralytic poliomyelitis in an unvaccinated individual in Rockland County. Initial sequencing confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that this is a case of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2). The investigation is ongoing; further information will be shared as it becomes available.

On 10 Jun 2022, the PAHO/WHO published the Epidemiological Alert on the risk of poliovirus outbreak in the Region of the Americas (available at https://bit.ly/3cypDaf), warning of the risk of the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus and urging Member States to implement effective measures to reduce the risk of outbreaks by maintaining high and homogeneous vaccination coverage, as well as having sensitive epidemiological surveillance systems allowing for timely detection and investigation of acute flaccid paralysis cases.

In recent years, polio vaccination rates have dropped considerably, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; polio vaccination had fallen below the recommended 95% or greater coverage goal to prevent the reintroduction of the virus in this Region. During the pandemic -- which has affected health services throughout the region, including routine vaccination -- polio vaccination rates have continued to decline. In 2020, only 80% of children had received the 3rd dose of polio vaccine necessary for full immunization, a decrease of 87% compared to 2019. If this trend in vaccination coverage continues, there is a high risk of outbreaks occurring after the importation of a virus (wild or vaccine-derived) or the emergence of poliovirus derived from the vaccine, and that these are not detected in time.

Surveillance
It is important that all countries/territories in the region strengthen surveillance of AFP cases to facilitate a timely response to the detection of an import or emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus.

- Detection and reporting of cases of AFP in children under 15 years of age: Train health personnel at all levels in the detection and notification of AFP. The number of AFP cases reported each year is used as an indicator of a country's ability to detect polio, even in countries where the disease no longer occurs. A country's surveillance system must be sensitive enough to detect at least one case of AFP for every 100 000 children under the age of 15, even in the absence of polio.

- Collection and transport of stool samples for analysis: At the onset of paralysis, polio can be difficult to differentiate from other forms of AFP such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis or traumatic neuritis. All children with AFP should be screened for wild poliovirus within 14 days of the onset of paralysis. For polio testing, fecal samples are tested for the presence of poliovirus. Samples must arrive at the laboratory within 72 hours of collection. Otherwise, they must be frozen (at -20 deg C) and then sent frozen.

[There are significant concerns globally about the drops in routine vaccinations in response to the COVID pandemic as well as increased vaccine hesitancy. Media reports have identified the case in Rockland County, New York as a member of a religious group with lower vaccination coverages -- a group identified as involved in a measles outbreak in 2018-2019 (http://rocklandgov.com/departments/county-executive/press-releases/2019-press-releases/measles-outbreak-declared-over-in-rockland/).

It's hoped the PAHO alert will increase a wakeup call to countries to increase surveillance and vaccination activities. - Mod.MPP]
