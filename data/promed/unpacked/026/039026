IRRADIATION OF FOODSTUFFS: A SUGGESTION

[see
AHEAD assists in oyster outbreak tracking 970826232710]
The recent problems with contaminated meat and oysters might never had
happened, not because of increased regulations or inspections but because of
the [availability] of a modern technology, irradiation.
1. Irradiation kills all parasites, bacteria, viruses, prions, etc..
i.e., yields a sterile food supply.
2. Irradiation does not cook or alter the texture or appearance of
meats or vegetables.
3. Radiation levels fall below detectible levels shortly after
cessation of irradiation.
4. Daily exposure to household and work place radiation sources is many
times greater than [that of irradiated] foodstuffs.
5. Safety and shelf life of foodstuffs are increased.
The only [impediment] to starting full scale irradiation of foodstuffs is
public opinion. We as public health officials need to seize these
opportunities to educate the public when the public awareness and fear is the
highest. With a lot of work we can overcome the ignorance that is keeping
full scale irradiation from being used. This is [a similar problem faced by
those who wanted to introduce] pasteurization.
