Norovirus outbreaks linked to oyster consumption
in the United Kingdom, Norway, France, Sweden and Denmark, 2010
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper describes several simultaneous
outbreaks of norovirus infection linked to the
consumption of raw oysters. Since January 2010,
334 cases in 65 clusters were reported from 5
European countries: the United Kingdom, Norway, France, Sweden and Denmark.

Background
----------
Oysters are grown in coastal waters of several
countries and are considered a delicacy in most
parts of the world. Like all bivalve molluscs,
they feed by filtering large amounts of water
through their gills. In situ studies with
bioaccumulation of a virus indicator in oysters
have shown that oysters can concentrate viruses
up to 99 times compared to the surrounding water
[1]. In water contaminated with norovirus, this
leads to the accumulation of the virus within the
flesh and gut of the oyster. Norovirus has been
detected in 5 to 55 percent of oysters from
Europe and the United States (US) by random
sampling at market places and oyster farms [2-4].

The detection of norovirus in oysters follows the
same seasonal trend as the norovirus epidemiology
in the general population; i.e., norovirus in
oysters is generally detected between October and
February [1, 12]. A total of 78 percent of
shellfish-related illness from noroviruses in the
US between 1991 and 1998 were associated with the
consumption of oysters harvested between the
months of November and January [1]. Contamination
of oyster beds with noroviruses can occur after
heavy rains cause flooding, which results in
combined sewer overflow or hydraulic overload in
sewage treatment plants [5, 13].

There are also examples of oyster harvesters
disposing sewage into oyster-bed waters causing
multi-state outbreaks of norovirus in the US [6].
Noroviruses are difficult to remove from oysters
through cleansing and also stay infectious [7].
Oysters are often eaten raw, creating the
potential for foodborne enteric virus infections.

Several norovirus outbreaks linked to the
consumption of oysters have been reported in
Europe in recent years [5, 8-10]. In a review by
Baert et al. (2009), bivalve shellfish accounted
for 17.5% (7/40) of internationally reported
foodborne norovirus outbreaks in 2000-2007 [11].
A search of the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) database
(<https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/>)
revealed 19 alert notifications on norovirus
findings in oysters and/or norovirus food
poisoning associated with the consumption of
oysters between March 2006 and March 2010. All of
these alerts concerned oysters grown and sold
within the European Union (EU) and 17 were
reported between the months of January and April,
reflecting the season when oysters are considered to be of the best quality.

From January to March 2010, the European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) was
informed through its Food- and Waterborne
Diseases and Zoonoses (FWD) surveillance network
about norovirus outbreaks linked to consumption
of oysters in 5 EU/EEA countries: the United
Kingdom (UK), Norway, France, Sweden and Denmark.
In total 65 small clusters involving 334 cases
were reported. Most cases had eaten oysters in restaurants.

For the purpose of this article we defined a
verified cluster as one where (i) evidence was
available that cases had consumed oysters within
the incubation period (descriptive epidemiology)
and (ii) norovirus was identified with reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in oysters from the
same batch or from the same harvesting area as
the oysters which were consumed by the cases
(microbiological evidence). Following these
criteria, 27 of the clusters were verified. [This
information is tabulated in the original text. - Mod.CP]

Outbreak descriptions
---------------------
United Kingdom: In January 2010, local
authorities in the UK notified 22 possible
foodborne clusters of gastroenteritis associated
with consumption of oysters in restaurants,
affecting over 120 people to the Health
Protection Agency (HPA). Investigations
identified norovirus genogroup I (GGI) and
genogroup II (GGII) in stool samples taken from
cases in 9 of the 22 clusters and in oysters in 3
of these clusters. Oysters produced in England,
Scotland and Ireland were implicated in the
clusters. However, most were sourced from one
producer in Ireland. Ireland issued a RASFF alert
on 17 Feb 2010 after having detected norovirus in
Irish oysters. Control measures taken in Ireland
included closure of identified fishing areas and
withdrawal of shellfish coming from these areas.

Norway: 8 clusters of gastroenteritis involving
39 cases were notified between 22 Jan 2010 and 6
Feb 2010. Cases became ill after having eaten
oysters from one importer distributed to 6
different restaurants in Oslo. No stool samples
were collected. The local food authorities traced
back the oysters to one producer from Brittany in
France. 2 of 3 incriminated batches were analysed
at the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science,
and both tested positive for norovirus genogroup
I (GGI) and genogroup II (GGII) by RT-PCR. A
RASFF alert was issued on 11 Feb 2010.

France: 6 foodborne clusters of gastroenteritis
were notified linking the consumption of oysters
originating from the same area in Brittany (1) as
the area incriminated in the Norwegian clusters.
The French clusters occurred in weeks 2 to 9 of
2010, and involved 22 cases. The cases had
consumed oysters mainly in restaurants but also
in their homes. No stool specimen was available
for analysis. Oysters coming from this area were
sampled and norovirus was detected. 4 additional
clusters of gastroenteritis linked to consumption
of oysters from a different area of Brittany (2)
occurred in weeks 4 to 7, involving 45 cases.
Cases and oysters from the area were tested and
norovirus was confirmed. Norovirus GGI and GGII
were detected in the stool samples of cases
whereas the results confirming the genogroup of
the norovirus positive oysters are still pending.
The identified harvesting areas were closed and
shellfish from these areas was recalled from the market. The measures were imp!
lemented from week 7 to 9.

Sweden: 48 persons in 15 clusters developed acute
gastroenteritis after having eaten oysters at a
restaurant in Stockholm. 2 additional persons ate
oysters at another restaurant in Stockholm and
also developed acute gastroenteritis. Oysters
were consumed between December 2009 and early
March 2010. The 1st restaurant served both Dutch
and French oysters. No stool samples were taken from the 50 cases.

Denmark: 27 norovirus cases in 6 clusters who had
consumed oysters at 3 different restaurants were
reported from January to March 2010. Norovirus GG
I and II were detected in stool samples from 2 of
the cases. Norovirus GG II was detected in the
stool sample of a 3rd case. Oysters served at the
restaurants originated from 4 coastal locations
in France. Oysters from all 4 batches tested
positive for norovirus GG I and II and were
recalled from the Danish market. 3 RASFF alerts
were issued on 12 Mar 2010 and a 4th alert was
recently submitted. 3 additional clusters,
bringing the number to 9, are currently being
investigated. [The original text includes a
figure illustrating the epidemic curve by week of
onset of reported cases from Norway, France, Sweden and Denmark. - Mod.CP]

Discussion
----------
Outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus
occur simultaneously in several European
countries. Norovirus of both GG I and II were
detected in oysters and in stool samples
collected from cases in the outbreaks. This is a
common finding in oyster-related outbreaks and
reflects an environmental source of contamination
[5, 14-16]. Bon et al. (2005) found up to 7
different strains of norovirus in some outbreaks.
This contrasts with person-to-person transmission
occurring in settings such as hospitals or
nursing homes, which most often involve a single genotype.

It is likely that current reports underestimate
the true burden of norovirus infection in the
community following consumption of oysters as
restaurant-associated outbreaks are more commonly
reported to public health authorities than
outbreaks occurring in a household setting. Even
though norovirus contamination in oysters is a
known source of gastrointestinal outbreaks, the
number of such events in the 1st 3 months of 2010
is considered unusual in several of the involved
countries and is above what is normally observed at the EU level.

This increase may be due to several factors.
Firstly, it could partly be a surveillance
artifact as the sharing of information regarding
norovirus outbreaks through the FWD network is
relatively recent and may have contributed to the
reporting of these events. There is currently no
evidence to suggest that the increase in reported
outbreaks is due to increased transmission in the
EU population. Secondly, as the contamination of
the oyster harvesting areas is not restricted to
a single location, it would indicate a broader
environmental issue and not a localised
contamination problem. It is possible that the
unusually cold winter experienced in northern
Europe during the 1st 3 months of 2010 favoured
the contamination of the oysters as virus
survival increases in cold water temperatures and
reduced exposure to ultraviolet light [17].

Conclusion
----------
An increased number of norovirus outbreaks
related to the consumption of oysters have been
observed at EU level in the last 3 months
[Jan-Mar 2010]. The reason for this needs to be
further investigated. With the expected decline
both in the seasonal activity of norovirus and
the seasonal consumption of oysters in Europe
over the next coming month(s) it is likely that
reports about outbreaks such as the ones
described here will also decrease. However,
consuming raw oysters involves potential exposure
to norovirus and is particularly hazardous for
immunocompromised or chronically ill persons.
Therefore, countries might consider informing the
public about the risks linked with consuming raw
oysters. Furthermore, it is important that
countries continue to notify these events through
the RASFF [Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed]
in order for producers to be informed in a timely
manner about contamination, enabling them to implement control measures.

[Noroviruses (genus _Norovirus_, family
_Caliciviridae_) are a group of related,
single-stranded RNA, non-enveloped viruses that
cause acute gastroenteritis in humans. The most
common symptoms of acute gastroenteritis are
diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Currently,
there are 5 recognized norovirus genogroups, of
which 3 (GI, GII, and GIV) are known to affect
humans. More than 25 different genotypes have
been identified within these genogroups.

Noroviruses are highly contagious and as few as
10 viral particles may be sufficient to infect an
individual. During outbreaks of norovirus
gastroenteritis, several modes of transmission
have been documented. Although pre-symptomatic
viral shedding may occur, shedding usually begins
with onset of symptoms and may continue for 2
weeks or more after recovery. Immunity may be
strain-specific and lasts only a few months;
therefore, given the genetic variability of
noroviruses, individuals are likely to be
repeatedly infected throughout their lifetimes.
This may explain the high attack rates in all ages reported in outbreaks.

The detection of viruses of 2 different
genogroups in the oyster-related outbreaks
described above contrasts with the more commonly
observed person-to-person transmission occurring
in settings such as hospitals or nursing homes,
which most often involve a single genotype.

Norovirus activity in the current season appears
to be higher than in recent years in Norway and
the UK whereas France and Sweden did not observe
a similar pattern. The contamination of the
oyster harvesting areas has not been restricted
to a single location. Rather surprisingly the
norovirus-contaminated oyster beds have been
located on the Atlantic coasts of France and
Ireland rather in the more confined waters of the Baltic.
