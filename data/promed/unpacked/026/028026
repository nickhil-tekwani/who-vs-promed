The Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) is an independent group of experts that periodically monitors and evaluates the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and assesses if specific mutations and combinations of mutations alter the behaviour of the virus. The TAG-VE was convened on 26 Nov 2021 to assess the SARS-CoV-2 variant: B.1.1.529.

The B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on 24 Nov 2021. The epidemiological situation in South Africa has been characterized by 3 distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly the delta variant. In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 Nov 2021.

This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the 3 target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation. Using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.

A number of studies are under way and the TAG-VE will continue to evaluate this variant. WHO will communicate new findings with member states and to the public as needed.

Based on the evidence presented indicative of a detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, the TAG-VE has advised WHO that this variant should be designated as a VOC, and WHO has designated B.1.1.529 as a VOC, named omicron.

As such, countries are asked to do the following:
- Enhance surveillance and sequencing efforts to better understand circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.
- Submit complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, such as GISAID.
- Report initial cases/clusters associated with VOC infection to WHO through the IHR mechanism.
- Where capacity exists and in coordination with the international community, perform field investigations and laboratory assessments to improve understanding of the potential impacts of the VOC on COVID-19 epidemiology, severity, effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostic methods, immune responses, antibody neutralization, or other relevant characteristics.

Individuals are reminded to take measures to reduce their risk of COVID-19, including proven public health and social measures such as wearing well-fitting masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, and getting vaccinated.

For reference, WHO has working definitions for SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest (VOI) and variant of concern (VOC).

A SARS-CoV-2 VOI is a SARS-CoV-2 variant:
- with genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape; AND
- that has been identified as causing significant community transmission or multiple COVID-19 clusters, in multiple countries with increasing relative prevalence alongside increasing number of cases over time, or other apparent epidemiological impacts to suggest an emerging risk to global public health.

A SARS-CoV-2 VOC is a SARS-CoV-2 variant that meets the definition of a VOI (see above) and, through a comparative assessment, has been demonstrated to be associated with one or more of the following changes at a degree of global public health significance:
- increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; OR
- increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation; OR
- decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics.

[B] Israel ex Malawi
Date: Fri 26 Nov 2021 09:51 IST

https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-detects-first-case-of-new-highly-mutated-covid-19-strain/


The fst case of a new, highly mutated coronavirus variant that first emerged in South Africa was detected in Israel on Friday [26 Nov 2021], the Health Ministry announced, a development that experts have been fearing. The person was identified as an Israeli who had returned from Malawi. The ministry said 2 others were suspected of also being infected with the new strain, currently known by its scientific name B.1.1.529, and were awaiting final test results. All 3 were vaccinated, the ministry said, adding that their inoculation details were still being verified.

Following the announcement, prime minister Naftali Bennett's office said he would hold a discussion Friday [26 Nov 2021] afternoon with health minister Nitzan Horowitz and experts. The statement said Bennett had been updated during the night about the new strain being detected in Israel, and has ordered the government to purchase PCR test kits designed to better detect the variant.

The developments came despite efforts to prevent the strain from reaching Israel. On Thursday evening [25 Nov 2021], Bennett ordered that several countries in southern Africa be labeled "red," heavily restricting entry from them. South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, and Eswatini were added to the list of countries from which foreigners are barred entry to Israel. The list had been empty for some 6 weeks, as no country had fallen into the Health Ministry's "red" criteria.

Returning Israelis, including those fully vaccinated, from any of the countries now considered "red" will be required to isolate at a state-run hotel for a week and will be released after receiving 2 negative PCR virus tests, Bennett said in a statement. Returnees who refuse to be tested will be required to isolate for 2 weeks at a state-run quarantine hotel, the statement added.

Bennett "also instructed that an immediate evaluation be held on stopping flights from these countries to Israel and vice versa, or the implementation of a different plan to prevent the variant from spreading to Israel."

Scientists in South Africa revealed Thursday [25 Nov 2021] that they had detected a new COVID-19 variant with "a very high number of mutations," blamed for an "exponential" surge in infections there. The number of daily infections in Africa's hardest-hit country has increased 10-fold since the start of the month.

In Israel, Health Ministry data on Thursday [25 Nov 2021] showed that 543 people had been diagnosed the previous day, with the number representing 0.70% of the nearly 84 000 tests conducted. There were 163 hospitalized individuals, of whom 120 were in serious condition. Data showed nearly 85% of serious cases are unvaccinated individuals.

Officials from the Health Ministry warned lawmakers on Wednesday [24 Nov 2021] that there may be a need for new virus restrictions if cases cross the threshold of over 1000 new infections diagnosed per day or infection rates are seen rising. "If we pass the transmission rate of 1.2, we will have to use restrictions to reduce crowd sizes as a 1st stage, including in venues operating under the Green Pass, as these are events where more infections are seen," Ilana Gans, chief of the public health services department at the Health Ministry, told the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee.

Health Ministry figures Thursday [25 Nov 2021] showed that Israel's transmission rate stood at 1.08, based on data from 10 days earlier. Also known as the "R-number," the figure represents the number of people each confirmed patient infects, on average. Any number over one signifies that case numbers are rising. The infection rate had been below one for 2 months before hitting that threshold several days ago.

First case of B.1.1.529 in Belgium: two possible cases (based on presence of SGTF at a federal testing platform) have been sequenced on 26 Nov 2021. Among these, one was identified as a delta variant presenting the Del69/70, and the 2nd was confirmed to be B.1.1.529. The patient infected with B.1.1.529 is a young adult woman who developed symptoms 11 days after travelling to Egypt via Turkey. The patient had a high viral load at the time of diagnosis (Cq of 14.2). The patient did not report any link with South Africa or other Southern African countries. This patient had not previously been vaccinated and had not yet been infected. She developed flulike symptoms but does not present at this stage signs of severe disease. The patient did not report high-risk contacts outside her household. None of her household members have developed symptoms but have nevertheless been referred for testing. An extended investigation will be launched.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-uk-cases-of-omicron-variant-identified


After overnight genome sequencing, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed that two cases of COVID-19 with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 have been identified in the UK.

The individuals that have tested positive, and all members of their households, are being re-tested and told to self-isolate while further testing and contact tracing is under way. One case has been located in the Chelmsford area and the other in Nottingham. The two cases are linked and there is a link to travel to Southern Africa. UKHSA is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive cases were likely to have been infectious.

In response to the developing situation, the UK is taking decisive action to protect public health. Confirmed cases and contacts are being followed up and requested to isolate and get tested as necessary.

In addition, in line with updated advice from the UKHSA, from 4am Sunday Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will be added to the travel red list. Travellers who have returned from these four countries in last 10 days must isolate and get a PCR test. UKHSA are following up recent arrivals from these countries.

Britain, Germany and Italy detected cases of the new omicron coronavirus variant on Saturday and British prime minister Boris Johnson announced new steps to contain the virus (https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-opening-statement-at-covid-19-press-conference-27-november-2021), while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern Africa.

The health ministry in the German state of Bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant. The two people entered Germany at Munich airport on 24 Nov [2021], before Germany designated South Africa as a virus-variant area, and were now isolating, said the ministry, indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from South Africa.

In Italy, the National Health Institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in Milan in a person coming from Mozambique.

Czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in Namibia.

Dutch authorities said that 61 out of around 600 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday [26 Nov 2021] had tested positive for the coronavirus. Health authorities were carrying out further tests to see if those cases involved the new variant.

India added 9119 new coronavirus infections taking the country's total tally of COVID-19 cases to 34 544 882 while the active cases declined to 109 940, the lowest in 539 days, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Thursday [25 Nov 2021]. The death toll climbed to 466 980 with 396 fresh fatalities, according to the data updated at 8:00 am.

The daily rise in new coronavirus infections has been below 20 000 for 48 straight days and fewer than 50 000 daily new cases have been reported for 151 consecutive days now.

The active cases comprise 0.32% of the total infections, the lowest since March 2020, while the national COVID-19 recovery rate was recorded at 98.33%, the highest since March 2020, the ministry said.

A decrease of 1541 cases has been recorded in the active COVID-19 caseload in a span of 24 hours.

More than 132 crore [1.32 billion] (1 323 315 050) vaccine doses have been provided to states/UTs [union territories] so far through Govt of India (free of cost channel) and through direct state procurement category, whereas more than 22.72 crore (227 219 901) balance and unused COVID vaccine doses are still available with the states/UTs to be administered.

Moreover, with the administration of 9 027 638 vaccine doses in the last 24 hours, India's COVID-19 vaccination coverage has exceeded 119.38 crore (1 193 844 741) as per provisional reports till 7:00 am today [25 Nov 2021]. This has been achieved through 12 373 056 sessions.

Meanwhile, a study conducted by AIIMS [All India Institute of Medical Sciences] has shown that 2 doses of Covaxin, the indigenous vaccine developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research in collaboration with Bharat Biotech, is 50% effective in preventing symptomatic infection due to COVID-19. This is lower than the 77.8% efficacy claimed by Bharat Biotech after phase 3 trials of the vaccine.

The spread of coronavirus which was widely seen in urban areas is now considerably visible in rural areas as well, the Health Ministry said.

Deputy director general of health services Dr Hemantha Herath told a news briefing today [25 Nov 2021] that the number of infections has also gone up in rural areas than it was previously. "It is of utmost importance that we need to bring the situation under the control. The only way for it is the strict adherence to health rules," he emphasised.

In addition, Dr Herath said people should be extra keen on following health guidelines in order to avert another lockdown as the festive season is just around the corner. "Earlier, we were accused of not imposing the lockdown on time. However, we cannot afford to go for a lockdown once more as the country has been severely battered by the consequences of lockdowns," he pointed out. "Thus, what should be done is to comply with health practices to prevent the COVID situation from exacerbating," Dr Herath reiterated.

Afghanistan: 157 144 / 7307 / 182
Maldives: 91 122 / 248 / 448
Bhutan: 2633 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 65 808, 1700, 2235, 1978, and 5886 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 75 437, 1552, 2098, 2247, and 6398 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in India, but a state of almost stability in other 4 countries. Bangladesh saw on 20 Nov 2021 a day with no COVID-19 associated deaths for the 1st time after around 20 months. A slight increase in daily case-positivity, above 1%, has been reported in the country although it remains below 1.5%.

Over the course of 24 hours since yesterday (25 Nov 2021), a total of 488 people died in India due to COVID-19. Of them 384 were from Kerala state, comprising 78.7% of the total deaths encountered across the country (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). As of 26 Nov 2021 at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30), India has administered 1 202 703 659 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above 18 years of age. As of 24 Nov 2021, 41% have received the 1st dose and 25.7% of the target population have received both doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php). The country also started vaccinating school children between 12 and 17 years of age from 1 Nov 2021 with the Pfizer vaccine (https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/coronavirus/fallouts-fightback/vaccine/news/students-aged-12-17-40000-get-jabs-day-2208816).

As of 26 Nov 2021 at 07:49 AM, a total of 121 777 985 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

So far, Nepal has administered at least 16 536 009 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/nepal/), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 29 638 112. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 68% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).
