Some Nosara [Guanacaste province] horse owners are concerned about a possible outbreak of infectious equine anemia among animals in the area, due to the death of one horse that tested positive for the disease on 8 Feb 2014.

[CA], a resident of Nosara, said that the horse had the sickness, in addition to an ailment known as laminitis, which affects the animal's hooves and creates pain throughout the body, making it difficult to walk normally and even stand up. "The horse was behind our property [close to the Nosara River] and was loose," explained [CA], who added that the previous owner did not care for the horse, so it was thin and sick.

For that reason [CP], another local resident, decided to buy the horse to take care of it and examine it; those tests resulted positive for infectious anemia.

Currently, equine anemia does not have a cure, which is why the standard procedure is to euthanize infected animals. The sickness can spread if insects or animals bite the infected horse and then do the same on another, healthy horse.

Veterinarian Laura Murillo Marchena, in charge of examining the horse, explained that infectious anemia is like the HIV virus in humans. An infected horse can seem normal and even healthy while in reality it is very sick and weak.

"In these cases, the procedure, after taking a blood sample from the animal and evaluating it, is to mark it with an 'S' to show that it should be euthanized [in Spanish, "sacrificado"] and prevent the virus from spreading."

It was for that reason that on Sat 8 Feb 2014 the veterinarian gave the horse a lethal injection to "put him to sleep." He was then cremated and buried on private property in Nosara.

[CA] has a business through which she rents horses for tours and rides in Nosara. For her the news of the disease is worrying, so she intends to have all of her horses examined to control possible infection.

For her part, Murillo explained that she will be issuing a request to the National Animal Health Service (SENASA - Servicio Nacional de Salud Animal) for the evaluation and relevant sampling of the rest of the animals in Nosara.

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is an infectious and potentially fatal viral disease of members of the horse family. Another name for EIA is swamp fever. The equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is categorized as a lentivirus: it contains genetic RNA material, which it uses to produce DNA. This DNA is then incorporated into the genetic makeup of infected cells. Identified in France in 1843 and first tentatively diagnosed in the United States in 1888, EIA has commanded a great deal of attention over the years. No vaccine or treatment exists for the disease. It is often difficult to differentiate from other fever-producing diseases, including anthrax, influenza, and equine encephalitis.

By far the majority of horses are inapparent carriers: they show no overt clinical abnormalities as a result of infection. They survive as reservoirs of the infection for extended periods. Inapparent carriers have dramatically lower concentrations of EIAV in their blood than horses with active clinical signs of the disease. Only 1 horsefly out of 6 million is likely to pick up and transmit EIAV from this horse. All horses infected with EIAV are thought to remain virus carriers for life. The inapparent form may become chronic or acute due to severe stress, hard work, or the presence of other diseases.

When horses are exposed to EIAV, they may develop severe, acute signs of disease and die within 2 to 3 weeks. This form of the disease is the most damaging and the most difficult to diagnose because the signs appear rapidly, and often only an elevated body temperature is noted. One-fifth of a teaspoon of blood from a horse with acute EIA contains enough virus to infect 1 million horses. The clinical signs of the acute form of EIA are nonspecific; in mild cases, the initial fever may be short lived (often less than 24 hours). As a result, horse owners and veterinarians may not observe this initial sign when a horse is infected with EIAV. These infected horses often recover and continue to move freely in the population. The 1st indication that a horse was exposed to, and infected with, EIAV may well be a positive result on a routine annual test.

If the horse survives this 1st acute bout, it may develop a recurring clinical disease with these signs:
- Fever: an infected horse's temperature may rise suddenly to about 105 F [40.6 C] or, rarely, as high as 108 F [42.2 C]. Then it may drop back to normal for an indeterminate period until the onset of another episode.
- Petechial hemorrhages: minute blood-colored spots appear on the mucous membranes.
- Depression: the horse appears more or less dejected (head hangs low) and generally listless.
- Weight loss: the horse may refuse feed or may eat an inordinate amount but still continues on an obvious decline from normal weight.
- Dependent edema: the horse may develop swelling, which is evidence of fluid collecting under the skin in the legs and under the chest and other underbody surfaces.
- Anemia: the horse's blood may experience a marked drop in its red corpuscle count and appear thin and watery. The animal may also have an irregular heartbeat, and a jugular pulse may become evident.

The horse with chronic EIA is the classic "swamper" who has lost condition, is lethargic and anorexic, has a low hematocrit, and demonstrates a persistent decrease in the number of blood platelets, especially coincident with fever induced by EIAV.

EIA is considered a classic blood borne infection. People have played an important role in EIAV transmission over the years by using blood-contaminated materials on different horses. The EIAV most frequently is transmitted between horses in close proximity by large biting insects, such as horseflies and deerflies. The bites from these flies stimulate defensive movement by the horse, which often results in an interruption of the blood feeding. When interrupted, the fly is motivated to complete the feeding as soon as possible. It then attacks the same or a 2nd host and feeds to repletion. In this manner, any infective material from the blood of the 1st host that is present on the mouthparts of the insect can be mechanically transmitted to the 2nd host. Insect transmission of EIAV is dependent on the number and habits of the insects, the density of the horse population, the number of times the insect bites the same and other horses, the amount of blood transferred between horses, and the level of virus in the blood of the infected horse from which the initial blood meal was obtained. The rate of transmission cannot be predicted accurately because of these variables.

Controlling the spread of EIAV involves minimizing or eliminating contact of horses with the secretions, excretions, and blood of EIAV-infected horses. This has been carried out in most areas of the world by testing and segregating test-positive horses from those with negative test results. Once the reservoirs of EIAV are identified, separated, and maintained a safe distance from the other horses, the transmission of EIAV is broken. Until all horses are tested, one must assume that each horse is a potential reservoir of EIAV and take precautions to see that his or her horses commingle only with horses with impeccable backgrounds (that is, they came from farms with only test-negative horses and have never been exposed to test-positive horses).

Horse owners can take a number of precautions to reduce the risk of infection:
- Use disposable syringes and needles. Follow the rule of one horse-one needle.
- Clean and sterilize all instruments thoroughly after each use.
- Keep stables and immediate facilities clean and sanitary. Remove manure and debris promptly and ensure that the area is well drained.
- Implement insect controls. The local veterinarian or animal health official can provide information about approved insecticides and other insect- control measures. Avoid habitats favorable to insect survival.
- Do not intermingle infected and healthy animals. Do not breed EIAV-positive horses.
- Isolate all new horses, mules, and asses brought to the premises until they have been tested for EIA

While EIA may be common in Costa Rica, this is the 1st time it is reported in ProMED-mail. Checking the internet, in a June 2012 media report, the following was mentioned: "The biggest eye-opener for the vets in Costa Rica and Mexico was the number of horses that had equine infectious anemia, a virus with no known cure. Horses with the disease are permanently quarantined or euthanized in the United States. That's not the case in Costa Rica, where Batker said 35 percent of the horses the vets treated tested positive for EIA." (see http://host.madison.com/entertainment/city_life/healing-hooves/article_3806328c-b71d-11e1-8fd1-0019bb2963f4.html).

More information on the current situation of EIA in Costa Rica would be greatly appreciated.
