Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 14 Oct 2013
Report date: 16 Oct 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 16 Oct 2013
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 20 Mar 2013
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H7N2

This event pertains to a defined within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Young, New South Wales
Date of start of the outbreak: 8 Oct 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 435 000 / 18 000 / 18 000 /0 /0 /
Affected population: free range and cage layer hens aged between 22 and 79 weeks.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 435 000 / 18 000 / 18 000 / 0 / 0 /
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 4.14 percent / 4.14 percent / 100 percent / 4.14 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and /or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: a restricted area of 1 km [0.6 mi] diameter surrounded by a 10 km [6.2 mi] diameter control area has been established around the property, which is under quarantine restriction. Tracing of all movements (birds, people, vehicles, and eggs) are under way. An epidemiological investigation is under way to determine the source of the infection.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: stamping out; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute (Local laboratory) / Birds /polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 14 Oct 2013 / Positive
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (National laboratory) / Birds / gene sequencing / 16 Oct 2013 / Positive
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (National laboratory) / Birds / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 15 Oct 2013 / Positive

Future reporting

[According to the information provided by the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN) Disease Strategy Avian influenza (Version 3.4, 2011), an outbreak of HPAI in poultry in Australia is defined as:
- clinical disease in poultry, with an influenza virus that meets the OIE criterion for lethality to 4- to 8-week-old chicks (where such a virus will probably, but not necessarily, be of H5 or H7 subtype); or
- clinical disease in poultry, with an influenza virus that meets the other OIE criteria for HPNAI (highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza; that is, H5 or H7 subtype and has basic amino acid sequences at the haemaglutinin cleavage site that are close to those observed in HPAI isolates).

In these cases, the AI virus involved would meet the OIE definition of HPNAI. An emergency disease outbreak would be declared under the terms of the Government and Livestock Industry Cost Sharing Deed In Respect of Emergency Animal Disease Responses (EAD Response Agreement), and control measures would be initiated to protect animal and public health. HPAI (H5/H7) is a category 2 emergency animal disease (EAD) and HPAI (not H5/H7) is a category 3 EAD.

Evidence strongly suggests that waterfowl are the likely source in many AI outbreaks. The virus usually transfers to the susceptible flock through close contact between live birds, but transfer could also occur through the use of untreated water from dams or creeks that have been contaminated with waterfowl faeces.

Between 1976 and 1997, 5 outbreaks of AI that occurred in Australia all involved HPAI viruses and this has made decisions on dealing with the infections clear cut. HPAI viruses caused clinical disease in commercial poultry in Victoria in 1976, 1985, and 1992; in Queensland in 1994; and in New South Wales in 1997. Each time, there was severe disease in affected chicken flocks and all had obvious or circumstantial evidence of contact with waterfowl. All the Australian outbreaks to date have involved H7 subtype viruses.

In November 2012 H7N7 HPAI was detected through their AI surveillance program, (highly pathogenic avian influenza had not been detected in Australia since 1997). This outbreak was located in Maitland, New South Wales. The affected birds were free range layer hens. The property has several dams that attract wild ducks. A restricted area of 3 km (2 mi) diameter surrounded by a 7 km (4 mi) diameter, control area was established around the property, which was under quarantine restriction. Depopulation, decontamination, and disinfection were completed on 20 Dec 2012. Appropriate surveillance was completed to demonstrate that the outbreak of HPNAI was eradicated and the event was resolved on 20 Mar 2013.
