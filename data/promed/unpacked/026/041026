A highly infectious deadly disease affecting rabbits and hares was detected in Napa County this week after several wild rabbits were found dead in the area, officials announced.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), caused by a form of viral hepatitis, is currently driving a multi-state outbreak. The disease has been reported across several Golden State [California] counties since 2020, but the rabbit deaths near Yountville are the 1st detections in the Napa area, according to a press release from the county.

The illness does not affect humans and does not pose a threat to humans or food safety, but pet rabbits may be in danger of catching the disease.

RHD is caused by 2 different related viruses -- RHDV1 and RHDV2. The current outbreak is due to the RHDV2 virus.

Of rabbits exposed to the virus, almost all die and many times, rabbits do not show signs before suddenly dying. If they do show signs, they may show fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, muscle spasms, breathing difficulties, blue-colored lips, or bleeding from the mouth and nose. It can take between 1 and 5 days from the time a rabbit is exposed to the virus before it develops signs, county officials said.

The disease can be transmitted by direct contact with an infected rabbit or by contact with an object, person, clothing or equipment having touched a sick rabbit. Rabbits are able to catch the virus by inhalation, ingestion or absorption through scrapes and wounds.

Last October, an RHDV vaccine became available for distribution in California. Those who have pet rabbits are urged to inquire about the vaccination at their local veterinarian's office.

The county offered the following tips to prevent exposure to pet rabbits:

- If rabbits are housed outside, house them off the ground when possible. Do not use material from outside for food or bedding.
- Do not allow wild rabbits to come into your yard and try to prevent dogs, cats, birds, and other animals from bringing rabbit carcasses onto your property. If you do find deceased wild rabbits, contact CDFW using their mortality reporting webpage.
- Do not spread on your hands or clothing. After handling a rabbit, wash your hands. Avoid handling rabbits that are not yours. Before handling rabbits in different locations, change clothes and shoes as well as wash your hands. Ensure everyone who visits your rabbits washes their hands thoroughly before touching your rabbits and wears protective clothing such as coveralls, shoe covers, hair covers and gloves.
- Avoid borrowing equipment. If you need to borrow equipment or if you buy used equipment, thoroughly scrub with a 10% bleach and water solution (1 part bleach, 9 parts water), leaving it to soak for at least 10 minutes before rinsing and letting dry.
- Do not add new rabbits. If you must, make sure they are kept in a separate housing area. Do not use the same equipment for the new and old rabbits.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is a fatal disease in rabbits and is considered a foreign animal disease in the United States. This disease is caused by several virus strains. Animal health officials detected one of these strains, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus serotype 2 (RHDV2), in North America in the past few years. RHDV2 does not impact human health.

RHDV2 can be spread through direct contact or exposure to an infected rabbit's excretions or blood. The virus can also survive and spread from carcasses, food, water, and any contaminated materials. People can spread the virus indirectly by carrying it on their clothing and shoes.

A vaccine for RHDV2 is now available for use in some states. Rabbit owners interested in vaccinating their rabbits should contact their veterinarians for more information on the vaccine. Veterinarians may order the vaccine by contacting Medgene Labs at (605) 697-2600. For more information, visit https://medgenelabs.com/rhdv2-vaccine/.

Although it is not required, identifying rabbits, such as with tattoos or microchips, is highly recommended to aid in demonstrating vaccination status. If using microchips, ensure there will be no interference with their use in meat rabbits. If using tattoos in registered or show rabbits, ensure the rabbits will meet registration or show requirements.

Even with the use of vaccine, it is still recommended owners protect rabbits by practicing good biosecurity. Biosecurity means taking simple steps every day to keep germs and viruses away from animals. These actions will significantly reduce the chance of RHDV2 or other contagious diseases affecting your rabbits.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a highly contagious disease caused by a calicivirus affecting rabbits, including wild and domesticated European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), from which our own domesticated rabbits are descended. Until 2020, RHDV had not been known to affect North American native rabbits or hares, such as cottontails, snowshoe hares, and jackrabbits. In the 2020-2021 outbreak in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, RHDV caused death in wildlife species of rabbits as well.

RHDV was first seen in China in 1984, but it was thought to have originated in Europe. Cases have been confirmed in 40 countries, including in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, Asia, North America (Mexico, United States, Canada), Australia, and New Zealand.

A new strain, RHDV2, emerged in 2010 in France; it quickly spread throughout Europe and in the Mediterranean and has replaced the original strain in many countries. In 2015, RHDV2 was detected in Australia and spread coast to coast -- about 3 million square miles (7.77 million sq km), compared with the United States' 3.8 million square miles (9.84 million sq km) -- in 18 months in the rabbit population, where it became the dominant strain, replacing RHDV1.

Signs may include:

- Loss of appetite
- Lethargy
- High fever
- Seizures
- Jaundice
- Bleeding from nose, mouth, or rectum
- Difficulty breathing
- Sudden death

RHDV is often a very swift and sudden killer, giving little warning. Rabbits may die without showing any symptoms at all. Any sudden rabbit death is suspicious and should be reported to your veterinarian as a possible case of RHDV.

Incubation period
- RHDV1: 1-3 days. Rabbits may die within 12-36 hours to a few weeks after the onset of symptoms.
- RHDV2: 3-5 days. Previous experimental RHDV2 infection found incubation of 3-9 days until onset of symptoms, then death within 3-5 days.

Death rate (mortality)
- RHDV1: 40-100%
- RHDV2: 5-80%+. In the 2020 southwest US and Mexico RHDV2 outbreak, officials reported a death rate of about 90%.

Rabbits who survive RHDV are carriers and shed the virus for a minimum of 42 days, possibly longer. Some rabbits may have few or no signs of RHDV2 (subclinical/asymptomatic) but may shed virus for up to 2 months.

Rabbits are infected by oral, nasal/respiratory, or ocular exposure to the virus, or by blood-feeding insects. RHDV causes necrotizing hepatitis and may cause necrosis of the spleen. There may be internal or externally visible bleeding. Death occurs from liver failure or hemorrhage due to an impairment in the blood's ability to clot.

Rabbit calicivirus is a very hardy virus, remaining viable in the environment outside a host.
- Survives 105 days at 68 deg F (20 deg C) on fabric; it remains stable for 3.5 months at room temperature
- Survives 225 days at 39 deg F (3.9 deg C) (just above freezing temperatures)
- Survives freeze/thaw cycles
- Survives heat of 122 deg F (50 deg C) for one hour

Where the virus has a reservoir in wild rabbits or feral/stray domestic rabbits, seasonal outbreaks are expected year to year. In Australia, outbreaks start in fall and winter, peak in spring, and are mostly absent in summer. Seasonal fly abundance, as flies are a significant vector, may be linked with RHDV activity.

There is no known cure for RHDV. Treatment is supportive care in isolation. There are currently no known effective antiviral drugs or other treatments available (https://rabbit.org/rhdv/).
