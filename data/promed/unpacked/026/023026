Anthrax found in walls of station
ANTHRAX [_B.anthracis_] has been discovered at King's Cross station during
repair work. The bacterium is contained in horse hair used in wall plaster
when the London station was built in the last century.
The station was decontaminated by workers dressed in protective clothing in
the same way that they would deal with asbestos. A spokeswoman for the
Health and Safety Executive said the anthrax was uncovered in 1992: "They
found spores that are still active, but it's all sealed in. We monitor the
site regularly and we are certain no other spores have escaped. It is
absolutely no threat to the public."
The spokeswoman said that anthrax spores were regularly detected in
construction sites and in sandpits in children's playgrounds. They were also
found during development at Liverpool Street station.
There has been speculation that the anthrax [_B.anthracis_] at King's Cross
may become a risk when construction of the Channel Tunnel high-speed link
begins.

[This is not the first time that _B. anthracis_ contaminated horse hair has
been found in the UK. Horse hair was commonly used for insulation as well as
a binder for plaster. Though interesting these site rarely present any
dangers. - Mod.MHJ]
