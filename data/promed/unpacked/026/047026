Multi-organ failure increases mortality of pig-borne disease
-----------------------------------------------
Short latent period and multi-organ failure are ultimate causes for
the higher-than-expected mortality rate of the pig-borne disease in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, a health specialist has said.
"Most patients suffered failures in the kidneys, livers, lungs and
heart shortly after they were contracted, and some of them died
before timely treatment," said Chen Zhihai, head of the expert panel
sent by the Ministry of Health to the epidemic-hit regions.
The latent period of the disease is so short that some patients died
within 10 hours after infection, he said in an interview with Xinhua
on Thu 4 Aug 2005. "In one case, a man died 2 hours after
slaughtering a sick pig." In comparison, it normally takes a week or
2 for an ordinary bacterial infection to break out, he said.
"On the other hand, the disease was caused by _Streptococcus suis_
type 2, the deadliest of all the 35 forms of pig-borne _S. suis _
bacteria," he added. [These are different capsular types of _S.
suis._ Type 2 has always represented the most virulent type in both
swine and humans. - Mod.LL]
Chen said antibiotics are effective in tackling the organism, but not
after it has led to multi-organ failure, which is largely to blame
for the high morality rate of the disease.
"The mortality rate was particularly high in the early phase of the
outbreak, as many patients took it [to be a] cold or flu," said Chen.
Earlier symptoms of the disease are similar to those of flu, with
high fever, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, but many patients became
comatose shortly afterwards and had bruises under their skin.
The epidemic broke out in late June 2005, 1st in Ziyang and Neijiang,
and later spread to 10 cities, including Jianyang and the provincial
capital Chengdu.
The Ministry of Health disclosed that the disease had claimed 38
lives in the province by midday Wed 3 Aug 2005, and the number of
confirmed and suspected cases had risen to 165 and 41 respectively.

This posting speaks to, at least in some cases, a very short period
from the apparent swine exposure and onset of infection and a very
short fulminating course. 2 bacterial pathogens come immediately to
mind that may have a short time, in hours not days, from inoculation
and onset of infection. Both Group A streptococcal and _Pasteurella
multocida_ (the latter usually associated with feline bites) wound
infections can occur within hours of exposure, but the rapidity of
onset does not necessarily correlate with severity or fulminating
infection. Such rapidly fulminating infections can be seen in
pneumococcal (_S. pneumoniae_) postsplenectomy infection and in
meningococcemia. - Mod.LL]

Mystery pig germ baffles experts
-----------------------------------
Experts on a strep. germ that's sickening people and pigs in China
are baffled by reports of 37 farmers suddenly falling ill, bleeding
under the skin and dying, all previously unheard of with the disease.
While not uncommon in pigs, _Streptococcus suis_ is seldom seen in
people and never produces dozens of cases all at once, raising bigger
questions about whether the germ has mixed with some other bacterium
or virus.
"Something is different," Marcelo Gottschalk, one of the world's
leading experts on the disease, told The Associated Press on Wed 3
Aug 2005. "We are worried, and we wonder what's happening. We would
like to have the strain to identify."
Gottschalk works in the world's only reference laboratory for _S.
suis_ at the University of Montreal in Canada and says no one in
China has contacted him for help since the outbreak was reported. So
few people have studied this disease, he is unsure how the Chinese
have been able to identify it and what type of vaccine they plan to
use, since immunizations typically are not effective.
Chinese state media have reported that enough vaccine for 350 000
pigs has already been sent to Sichuan province from a company in
southern Guangdong province and that enough doses for 10 million
swine will be shipped later.
Gottschalk said _Streptococcus suis_ usually takes a while to develop
in people and often causes meningitis followed by partial or
permanent hearing loss. Most people also survived after being treated
with antibiotics, and cases were typically few and far between;
Thailand, for example, usually had less than 20 known cases a year,
he said. China has reported more than 200 confirmed or suspected
human cases since June 2005.
The WHO and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization have questioned
whether _S. suis_ could possibly have combined with some other
disease or bacteria in China.
"Why is it behaving differently all of a sudden?" said Juan Lubroth,
an animal health official at FAO in Rome. "One explanation is you
have additional problems and it's not just _S. suis_ that's causing
it."
Thomas Alexander, retired deputy director of the University of
Cambridge's School of Veterinary Medicine, was a pioneer in studying
this particular strep. germ. He said the bacteria was commonly found
in the tonsils of healthy swine in different parts of the world.
However, it sometimes becomes pathogenic when too many pigs are
crammed together in unsanitary conditions.
"In my experience, it's much more chronic. They're describing death
within 24 hours," he said by telephone from England. "What they're
describing doesn't fit the picture."
Based on his limited information, Gottschalk said he was not overly
concerned about the pig disease spreading across borders, since
bacterial diseases tended to change more slowly than viruses like
flu. He would, however, like the Chinese to send samples so he could
try to identify the strain.
"It's extremely difficult for us get the real information for Chinese
agriculture," he said. "I'm not really sure if they have all the
background necessary to study this bacteria or infection. Few labs in
the world are capable of studying this."

experts on _S. suis_. Their collective thoughts continue to reflect
the differences seen in this cluster attributed to _S. suis_ and what
has been described with human _S. suis_ infection previously. -
