Some areas of northern Egypt reported an outbreak of pinkeye
[conjunctival] infections with the number of cases close to 2000, the
official MENA news agency reported on Sun 24 Oct 2010. The number of
people infected with this viral conjunctivitis, known as pinkeye, has
risen to 1831, Egyptian Health Ministry spokesman Abdel-Rahman Shahin
said, according to the report.

As many as 1703 cases are found in Daqahliya, 92 in Port Said and 36
in Damietta, the report said, adding most of the cases are students,
with 1042 in Daqahliya, 40 in Port Said and 12 in Damietta.

Pinkeye, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, may make the eyes
extremely red and can spread quickly, which usually causes no
long-term eye or vision damage.

[Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the thin layer (conjunctiva)
that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the
eye. Inflammation can cause blood vessels in the eye to become
larger, and that can make the white of the eye look pink or red.
Conjunctivitis is a common health condition worldwide. The 3 most
common types of conjunctivitis are viral, bacterial, and allergic.
Currently, outbreaks are occurring throughout the world (see
ProMED-mail references below).

ProMED-mail does not routinely report outbreaks of conjunctivitis
where there has been no identification of the etiologic agent. This
particular outbreak is reported because it embraces 3 contiguous
coastal governorates in the Nile Delta region of Egypt and is being
attributed to virus infection, although the species of virus is not
stated. Precise information would be appreciated, if available.

Daqahliya, Port Said and Damietta can be located at 7, 19 and 8
respectively in the map of the governorates of Egypt at:
