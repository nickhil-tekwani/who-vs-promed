U.N. agency reports 2nd polio case in Angola
--------------------------------------------
A 2nd case of polio has been found in Angola, suggesting that the deadly
disease could be spreading in the southwest African country, the U.N. health
agency said Tuesday [12 Jul 2005]
"Certainly they've got an outbreak," Oliver Rosenbauer, spokesman for the World
Health Organization's polio eradication program, told The Associated
Press. "The spread of it remains to be seen."
Angolan authorities reported the 2nd case in the port city of Lobito, some 400
miles (644 kilometers) south of the capital city of Luanda, where the country's
1st new case in 4 years was reported earlier this month, Rosenbauer said.
The 2 cases [viruses] are genetically linked, and it is unlikely that the 2nd
case was brought into the country separately, he said.

[The appearance of a 2nd case 400 miles south of the 1st case is circumstantial
evidence of significant spread of the poliovirus. As a reminder, the ratio of
paralytic to non-paralytic infections ranges from 1:50 to 1:1000 with an
average of 1:200 (for every one paralytic case identified there are an average
of 200 individuals infected with the wild poliovirus who show no signs of
paralysis). Hence, the appearance of 2 cases suggests there have probably been
at least 400 others infected with the wild poliovirus in the country.ï¿½
The newswire does not mention whether the cases had known traceable contacts
(narrowing down the range of probable infected individuals) or whether they
were unrelated epidemiologically. That the cases [virus strains] are
genetically linked is further evidence of local transmission of the wild
poliovirus. - Mod.MPP]
