The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) today announced final
test results, which confirm that an H5N1 avian influenza virus detected in
samples collected earlier [in August 2006] from 2 Michigan wild mute swans
is a low pathogenic subtype. This strain has been detected several times in
wild birds in North America and poses no threat to human health.
The USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the
presence of the "North American strain" of low pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza in one of 20 samples collected from the 2 wild mute swans.
Preliminary test results announced on 14 Aug 2006 indicated that an H5N1
strain could be present in 2 of the collected samples. Only one of the
samples contained high enough levels of the virus to conduct confirmatory
testing. As previously announced, genetic testing ruled out the possibility
that either of the samples carried the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1
avian influenza that is circulating overseas.
Low pathogenic strains of avian influenza commonly occur in wild birds and
typically cause only minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease in
birds. Low pathogenic H5N1 is very different from the more severe highly
pathogenic H5N1 circulating in parts of Asia, Europe and Africa. Highly
pathogenic strains of avian influenza spread rapidly and are often fatal to
chickens and turkeys.
The Departments of Agriculture and Interior are working collaboratively
with states to sample wild birds throughout the US for the presence of
highly pathogenic avian influenza. For more information about the
collaborative avian influenza efforts go to <http://www.usda.gov/birdflu>,

avian influenza and human pandemic preparedness: <http://www.avianflu.gov>.
