Chama District in Eastern Province has recorded cases of suspected
anthrax in more than 120 people.

Ministry of Health spokesperson Kamoto Mbewe stated yesterday [2 Sep
2011] that the outbreak was suspected to have been caused by an
infected hippo in Luangwa River. Dr Mbewe said all the patients
recorded since Friday last week [29 Aug 2011] had a history of having
consumed or touched hippo meat.

He said the hippo was said to have died of anthrax upstream of the
Luangwa River, where 62 hippos had so far died after showing signs of
infection. "Areas bordering Chama, or anyone who has consumed hippo
meat in the recent past may be affected," he said.

Dr Mbewe said, however, that the public should not panic because the
disease was treatable and that the ministry had sufficient stocks of
drugs. He said samples had been sent to a laboratory in Lundazi and
that a rapid response from the provincial office was already in
Chama.

"A stakeholders' meeting involving the Ministry of Health, the
Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, a veterinary team from the
University of Zambia, and a University Teaching Hospital laboratory
team was held today [3 Sep 2011]," he said. He said an expert team had
been constituted and dispatched to support the province and the
affected districts. Dr Mbewe said people who had come in contact with
or who had eaten hippo meat in recent weeks and developed skin
swellings like insect bites which later become blisters or which
eventually ulcerate should quickly seek medical attention.

He said the affected areas had been cordoned off and advice provided
to people against eating game meat, while surveillance had been
enhanced.

The Zambia Ministry of Health [MoH] reported on Friday [2 Sep 2011]
that 120 people have been infected with anthrax in the Chama district
in Eastern Province.

MoH spokesperson Dr Kamoto Mbewe says all the patients involved in the
outbreak had a history of having consumed or touched infected hippo
meat.

Breeze News reports that senior veterinary officer Arthur Mubolomena
confirmed at least 3 people had died in the outbreak. Dr Mumbolomena
says that suspected anthrax has killed dozens of hippos in Luangwa
River since the outbreak began some 2 weeks ago.

[In 1987-91, there were multiple outbreaks involving a wide range of
species in the South Luangwa National Park. In a severe epidemic in
2001, some 120 hippos (_Hippopotamus amphibius_) and 4 buffaloes
(_Syncercus caffer_) were reported dead of anthrax, but the actual
numbers were far greater, in the thousands. The aerial photographs of
the Luanga river showed dead hippos clogging the river and were
numbing. And that was just the dead hippos floating in the river. It
was believed that this epidemic was triggered by the population
quadrupling in number, which is both extremely stressful, with
fighting over the limited resources, and facilitates the spread of any
disease.

Readers are encouraged to see the series of postings on anthrax deaths
in the Ugandan Queen Elizabeth Park. It was clear in that region that
the situation was exacerbated by the hippo habit of scavenging their
own. This ensures that that it goes from the odd sporadic death to
being an epidemic, and it complicates any idea of control.
