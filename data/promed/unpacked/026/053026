Brazilian authorities announced yesterday they are investigating a
suspected outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) at a ranch located on
the border with Paraguay and clarified that, although the 1st test results
indicated the existence of a focus, specialists misinterpreted the tests.
The Secretary of Production and Tourism of the Brazilian State of Mato
Grosso do Sul, Dagoberto Nogueira Filho, stated that technicians in the
west-central region of Brazil were waiting the results of new examinations
in order to confirm whether there is a focus of the disease, although they
consider it a remote possibility.
"All preventive measures have been taken. The sanitary technicians are
careful, but there isn't proof of such a focus. These procedures should be
considered routine," said Nogueira Filho, quoted by a press release from
the regional government. Mato Grosso do Sul, a Brazilian State bordering
Paraguay and Bolivia, is one of the largest agricultural regions of the
country, with 22 million head of cattle (the largest bovine herd in Brazil)
and is a major producer of meat.
According to the governmental press agency, a person who was identified
only as a Paraguayan announced the existence of a focus of FMD in a ranch
in the municipality of Paranhos 4 weeks ago.
Before the announcement, technicians from the Regional Agency for the
Defense of Animal and Vegetable Health of Mato Grosso do Sul went to the
ranch in question, which has more than 1000 hectares on the Paraguayan side
and approximately 25 hectares on the Brazilian side.
According to Nogueira Filho, the inspectors took blood samples from 53
animals on the Brazilian side, and the 1st serologic testing gave positive
results for FMD. According to the Secretary, the technicians clarified that
these results were inconclusive, as the animals had been vaccinated against
FMD several days before the specimens were obtained. The Secretary stated
that the specialists suspected that the antibodies in the blood could have
been introduced by the vaccine and may have interfered with the results of
the analyses.
In the event this was the case, the technicians collected specimens of
fluids from the throats of the animals [a probang sample - Mod.TG] and sent
these to a laboratory official in the state of Para, for definitive
analyses, but will take approximately 20 days. "The most likely case,
nevertheless, is that the animals were healthy, considering that the
proprietor showed proof they are regularly vaccinating," affirmed Nogueira
Filho. The Secretary also alleged that the results of tests performed on
other animals were negative.
"Pigs are the most susceptible to FMD, and the pigs on the property were
not sick", he explained. "Thus, we are convinced that we are dealing with a
false rumor," concluded Nogueira Filho. He clarified that in any case, the
animals were isolated and the possibility of culling them is being studied.
The last focus of FMD in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul was confirmed in
2002 in the municipality of Sete Quedas, also on the border with Paraguay.
An earlier outbreak of the disease was detected in the State of Amazonas,
in an isolated region in the north of Brazil that does not export meat.
Russia declared on 20 Sep [2004] an end to its embargo on the importation
of Brazilian meat. Brazil, which receives some 2 billion dollars a year
from meat exports, had achieved eradication of FMD through vaccination in
the southern States of the country such as Mato Grosso do Sul, which uses
sanitary certificates for exporting to almost every other country.

[Indeed, vaccination may interfere with some testing. However, if the pigs
on the same property are not ill, then the disease may not be FMD. Bovine
viral diarrhea is a disease that must be ruled out and may initially
present very similarly to FMD. However, swine do not contract this
disease. There are other disease etiologies that must be ruled out as
well, including vesicular stomatitis virus. We would be most interested in
the definitive results from the tests. - Mod.TG]
