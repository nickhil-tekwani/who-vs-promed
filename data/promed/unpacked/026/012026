Malaria Situation in Kyrzgyzstan
--------------------------------
The State Department of Sanitary Epidemiological Control of the
Republican Ministry of Health has reported that, as of today [19 Jul
2006], more than 100 cases of malaria have been registered in
Kyrgyzstan. [There were 79 cases reported up to 24 Jun 2006; see ref.
below. - Mod.JW]. Last year [2005], 226 cases of malaria were
reported from residents infected in Kyrgyzstan. The rate of
transmission is currently at its peak and will continue up to the 1st
autumn cold weather. Each day, there is information about new cases
of malaria. The government of the republic has adopted the National
strategic plan on the fight against malaria in Kyrgyzstan for the
years 2006-2010; however, there are no funds for it.
Of special concern for epidemiologists are the following districts:
Kalis-Ordo, Ak-Bata and Ak-Bosogo, where small ponds are located,
which are perfect breeding sites for the _Anopheles_ mosquitoes. Many
inhabitants in the area live in half-completed houses without windows
and doors and thus are exposed to the mosquitoes.
Separate cases of malaria have also been found in the Chuyskij
valley, in Nijniy Ala-Archey, in the Alamudunskiy Area of Sokulukskiy
Region. In the 1930's - 1940's in Central Asia, thousands of people
got malaria. When the epidemic began to affect whole cities, the
Central Committee of the Communist Party authorized mass measures,
which eventually bore fruit. At least in Soviet Kirghizia, the last
case was reported in 1959. The situation continued up to the 1980's.
_Anopheles_ mosquitoes were again reported in Kyrgyzstan in 2002 in
the south in the Batkenskaya Area, where about 20 cases have been
found, and also in the city Tash-Kamar of the Jalal-Abad Area.
Preventive measures are necessary for inhabitants of Bishkek [the
capital] also. Pharmacists offer a rich arsenal of measures, for
example, the creams Taiga, Bez-Komarov and STOP, the spray Kedr, the
gel Komareks, etc.

[Please refer to the moderator's comment to the 1st report on malaria in
Kyrgyzstan, 26 Jun 2006. Clearly, malaria is spreading there, and the
authorities do not have the resources to implement appropriate control
measures. Use of home-made "repellents" will not stop the epidemics. We still
assume that the majority of infections are _P. vivax_, but it is important to
know whether _P. falciparum_ is increasing also. - Mod.EP]
[Bishkek is the capital of Kyrgyzstan; its population is 768 000. The
Chuysk region borders Bishkek and has a population of 765 700 people.
