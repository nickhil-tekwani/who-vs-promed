A Torrance County [New Mexico] woman was listed in critical condition Tue 5
Jun 2007, with plague. The state Department of Health said the 58 year old
woman developed bubonic plague, which progressed to plague pneumonia. The
department did not say where the woman was hospitalized. Officials are
investigating her home to determine if there is a risk to other people.
It was the 2nd case of plague confirmed in New Mexico in 2007. A San Juan
County man recovered after being infected in April 2007. [That case was
septicemic. - Mod.LL]
Plague, a bacterial disease of rodents, usually is transmitted to humans
through the bites of infected fleas. However, it can be transmitted by
direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife, and
pets. Prompt treatment with antibiotics can greatly reduce the fatality rate.
Plague takes 3 forms -- bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Symptoms of
bubonic plague in humans include fever; painful swollen lymph nodes in the
groin, armpit or neck areas; chills; and sometimes headache, vomiting, and
diarrhea. Pneumonic plague [affects] the lungs.
Septicemic plague, which occurs when the bacteria multiply in the blood,
also can have symptoms of high fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Most
people become ill 2 to 7 days after being infected.
"With the warmer weather there will likely be an increase in plague
activity in wild rodents, especially in the north central and north western
parts of the state, where we have traditionally found most of the plague
activity in New Mexico," said Dr Paul Ettestad, the Health Department's
public health veterinarian.
New Mexico had 8 cases of human plague, 2 of them fatal, in 2006. Of these,
5 came from Bernalillo County. Santa Fe, San Miguel, and Torrance counties
had a single case each. The state reported 4 human plague cases in 2005,
and none in 2004.
The department recommends prevention measures, including avoiding sick or
dead rodents; teaching children not to play near rodent nests or burrows,
treating pets regularly with flea control products, cleaning up areas near
houses where rodents could live; and keeping pets from roaming.

[Plague pneumonia (pneumonic plague) can be acquired secondarily from
bacteremic spread from the bubonic form (as reported here) or as a primary
form from another human or animal (especially a cat) with plague pneumonia
or from an intentional bioterrorism event.
The following is a capsule summary of the management of plague pneumonia
obtained from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/cd/plaguemd.shtml>
"Epidemiology:
-highly infectious after aerosolization
-person-to-person and animal-to-person transmission occurs with pneumonic
plague.
Clinical:
-incubation period is 1-3 days (ranges up to 7 days)
-aerosolization would most likely result in pneumonic plague
-pneumonic plague presents with the acute onset of high fevers, chills,
headache, malaise, and a productive cough, that is initially watery before
becoming bloody.
Diagnosis:
-characteristic staining features include gram negative coccobacilli with
bipolar "safety-pin" appearance
-organism grows slowly on standard blood and MacConkey agar
-immunofluorescent staining for capsule (F1 antigen) is diagnostic
-bacterial cultures should be handled in BSL 2 (Biological Safety Level 2)
facilities
Treatment:
-streptomycin or gentamicin are the preferred antibiotics
-tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones are alternative choices
-co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is recommended for pregnant
women and children between the ages of 2 months and 8 years
-chloramphenicol should be used for plague meningitis
Prophylaxis:
-antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for all persons exposed to the
aerosol or persons in close physical contact with a confirmed case
-tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones are recommended for 7 days
Patient Isolation:
Strict respiratory isolation until the patient has received at least 48
hours of antibiotic therapy."
