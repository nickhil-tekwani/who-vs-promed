Measles is once again on the rise in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The recent upsurge in cases -- more than 13 000 since 1 Jan 2021 -- is a major source of concern for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

Between 2018 and 2020, the worst measles epidemic ever recorded in DRC tore through the country. In just 2 years, more than 460 000 children contracted the disease and nearly 8000 died from it. Three-quarters of them were under 5.

At the time, MSF deployed emergency teams in 22 of the 26 provinces, tracking virus patients and vaccinating more than 2.3 million children. Emergency responses were followed by supplementary vaccinations set up by the authorities for millions of children, which greatly reduced the number of patients, but did not cut the chain of transmission. Despite this, in August 2020, the Minister of Health declared the end of the epidemic.

"Unfortunately, since the end of 2020, several provinces have started recording new increases in patients with measles, notably the North and South Ubangi provinces," says Anthony Kergosien, coordinator of MSF's emergency response team in the DRC. "We had to urgently send mobile response teams again to help stem the progression and save as many lives as possible."

In December [2020], MSF sent a team to the Bogose-Nubea health zone in South Ubangi. The needs they found there were massive. In only a few weeks, our teams treated nearly 5000 patients with measles -- the vast majority of them children. We vaccinated 70 000 children, quickly halting the spread of the disease. The team then headed to the neighbouring province of North Ubangi, where the Bosobolo health zone was also in critical condition.

"Since we arrived in Bosobolo in mid-February [2021], we have been helping staff to care for their patients in 8 health centres and in the general hospital to which complicated cases are referred," explains Faustin Igulu, who is leading the MSF project in Bosobolo. MSF has trained local staff in how to manage patients with measles and supervises the provision of care, notably for patients with severe measles.

"More than 1200 patients have already been treated thanks to our support," he adds. "The hospital's capacity had been quickly overwhelmed, so we increased the number of beds where they could treat children, some of whom were in a very advanced stage of measles and associated malnutrition."

MSF also launched a vaccination campaign for 66 000 children in this isolated health zone and the work is ongoing with a focus on those living in hard to reach areas. Our teams also trained local health workers in disease surveillance to improve the early detection of new measles outbreaks. However, like many other health zones in DRC, the resources available to local health authorities fall far short of what is needed.

"The local health authority only has one motorbike, and it doesn't work. How can they supervise vaccination activities?" continues Faustin Igulu. "How can they bring vaccines to the most remote areas? It's very complicated."

Measles is a viral disease spread by coughing, sneezing or through direct contact with nasal or laryngeal secretions. Children with the disease can face severe complications, as measles "erases" their immune memory, putting their health and lives at risk for years to come. An inexpensive and 85% efficient vaccine exists, which protects vaccinated people for decades.

"Measles is the most contagious disease in the world, nearly 10 times more than COVID-19," says Anthony Kergosien. "Winning the fight in the DRC against this killer will require a vaccine coverage of 95% with 2 doses per child, and regular mop-up campaigns to vaccinate those who slip through the cracks, including in the most vulnerable, difficult to access areas. But we are still very, very far from this."

In Bosobolo, as in too many areas of DRC, the fight against measles sometimes feels never-ending. Efforts to curb the spread of the disease face enormous challenges. A national vaccination and surveillance programme has been hampered by major weaknesses; a very high birth rate exposes new children to the disease every day; an under-equipped health system is unable to ensure consistent quality healthcare; and health providers trying to access certain regions must overcome entrenched geographic and security difficulties.

While waiting for structural improvements, the urgency is there: stopping the spread and save lives.

Working to overcome these challenges is key to tackling measles in the long-term. Right now, we must not lose sight of the urgent need for an immediate response, which slows transmission and saves lives.

"MSF teams have been deployed in North Ubangi, South Ubangi, Bas-Uele and Maniema provinces, but we sometimes feel quite alone in caring for patients and supporting local health teams," says Anthony. "Given the current increase in cases, it is imperative to increase the emergency response."

[The DRC is challenged by having to combat Ebola and COVID-19 at the same time it must continue to address endemic diseases such as measles, malaria, TB, and malnutrition. This takes resources that the country does not have. It is critical to vaccinate as many children as can be reached to stop the current outbreak of measles. It is one of the most infectious viruses known, with an R0 (reproductive number) of 12-15, significantly higher than SARS-CoV-2, and only vaccination will control its spread.

An outbreak of measles cases has been reported in the northern Sindh districts of Jacobabad and Shikarpur, quoting health officials, ARY News reported on Thursday [1 Apr 2021].

Sindh health department has sent its team to the area after several cases of measles were reported in children in Jacobabad, Thul, Garhi Yaseen and other towns. The team also comprises officials of the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI).

"In March [2021], 75 children infected with measles were brought to the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) in Karachi," NICH head Dr. Jamal Raza said. "In last 3 months over 160 children were brought to the hospital," the NICH chief said. "Fifty percent children of them from other districts were infected with measles," Dr. Raza said.

"Measles is a dangerous and deadly disease for children. Most of the parents avoided measles vaccination to children owing to coronavirus and large number of children remained [who had not had a measles] inoculation," Prof. Jamal Raza said.

"Vaccination is the only safety for children against measles," he said. "Measles is a major cause of the children's death," Dr. Raza said.

According to experts, the respiratory disease is considered to be a highly virulent infection. Nearly 1 to 3 of every 1000 children infected with measles are likely to die from respiratory and neurological complications. Common complications include diarrhea, middle ear infection and pneumonia, which is the major cause of deaths of children with measles.

[Pakistan is another country that is suffering from a measles upsurge. Approximately 41 countries have already put off in 2020, or may put off in 2021, their measles campaigns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is leading to public health disasters for children, and a threat to the global health. - Mod.LK
