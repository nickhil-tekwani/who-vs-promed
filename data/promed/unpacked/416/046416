American researchers found bacteria in chicken feed that are resistant to
vancomycin, a powerful antibiotic. In letter to The Lancet medical journal
[Volume 353 Issue 9154 Friday, Dr Glen Morris of the University of
Maryland in Baltimore said the discovery of vancomycin-resistant
enterococci (VRE) in animal feed raised fears that it could be passed on to
humans.
"The identification of a highly resistant enterococal strain in feed raises
disturbing questions about the potential for penetration of VRE strains
into farms and food animal populations in the USA and subsequent risk of
transfer into human populations," he said in the letter.
Animal feed is not expected to be sterile but researchers believe it is the
first report of VRE from commercially prepared chicken feed in the United
States. Further tests showed that the bacteria were resistant to
vancomycin, streptomycin, gentamicin and ampicillin - all important and
widely used antibiotics. The feed did not contain antibiotic additives
Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at
the Food and Drug Administration, said that he was puzzled by the report,
because feed pellets were normally produced under such high temperatures
and pressure that bacteria would die, adding, "if the feed is contaminated,
and from consuming that feed, our livestock become reservoirs for
vancomycin resistant enterococci, then potentially we could have a
problem." The researchers did not say which company made the chicken feed
or how it became contaminated, but they said drug resistant enterococci was
widespread in at least one lot of feed.
Vancomycin is the last line of resistance to so-called "superbugs" that
have built up a resistance to most conventional drugs. Enterococci produces
intestinal problems, and is a common cause of infection in hospitals and
usually treated with antibiotics. Scientists blame the increase in
"superbugs" on the overuse of antibiotics in people and animals.
