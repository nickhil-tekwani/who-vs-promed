Bovine TB infects farms in southeast Indiana area
-------------------------------------------------
Amid a controversy over private high fence deer operations a few
years ago, some sportsmen groups voiced concerns of disease
outbreaks. Apparently, those concerns were warranted.

Bovine tuberculosis was confirmed at a Franklin County deer farm and
a suspected Harrison County shooting preserve and a Warren County
deer farm have been quarantined for similar concerns. All are located
in southeast Indiana [Franklin County is in southeastern Indiana,
Harrison County in the south central part of the state, and Warren
County on the western border. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]

The Franklin county facility holding captive cervids -- deer or elk
--tested positive for the disease in May [2009], according to the
Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH). Tests are being
conducted on the other 2 locations, which are suspected of containing
infected animals as well.

Bovine tuberculosis is an infectious and chronic bacterial disease
that primarily affects cattle but has become a major issue with deer
held in close proximity. The disease has been an issue in Michigan
deer since the 1990s. In August 2009, an outbreak was confirmed in a
privately owned deer herd in Kent County.

Officials fear the disease could infect the wild, free ranging herd.
Indiana Conservation officers began killing about 30 white-tailed
deer last week in a targeted area of Franklin County to help
determine if bovine tuberculosis has spread outside the fenced area.

More details will be provided as they become available.

[As an overall, the captive cervid raisers in Indiana are very
conscious group of people who want to protect their animals from
disease. But as with many circumstances, one bad apple can sour the
whole bushel. Animal raising is no different in that regard. One
person who wants to step out side of the norms of disease control and
be a rebel causes everyone to suffer and brings a bad name on an
industry that is other wise a clean, healthy alternative livestock.

Let us hope the disease has not spread beyond the one or 2 premises. - Mod.TG]
