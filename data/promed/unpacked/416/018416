Measles outbreak in Utrecht
---------------------------
The Utrecht local health service says it recorded 16 cases of measles
in Utrecht since August [2008], in children of families that oppose
vaccination for religious reasons. The outbreak caused the
authorities to advise parents to vaccinate their children as soon as possible.

Measles is a very infectious disease that can cause deafness and, in
extreme cases, death. A total of 5 percent of all children in the
Netherlands are not vaccinated against the disease.
