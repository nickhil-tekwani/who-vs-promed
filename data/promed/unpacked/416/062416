A Comment on La Crosse Encephalitis Epidemiology
------------------------------------------------
While La Crosse encephalitis is a relatively rare disease, West Virginia
and Ohio have the highest incidence rates in the United States. It is not
uncommon for this institution (serving central Ohio) to have 20+ cases
diagnosed in the summer months.
Diagnosis is made by the presence of IgM on acute serology. If acute
serology is negative, it is ideal to obtain convalescent titers as well.
