Russia's food-safety service found anthrax in 2 slaughtered cows at a
private farm and set up a local quarantine.

The carcasses of the slaughtered animals have been burned,
Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Surveillance], as the service is known, said on its website today [8
Jul 2011]. The farm is in the village of Sorochinka in the Tula region
of central Russia.

Rosselkhoznadzor said it took steps to contain the disease including
local decontamination and vaccination of 160 head of cattle and many
domestic animals in the quarantine area.

[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Russia can be seen at
http://healthmap.org/r/11da. Tula oblast [region] is an industrial
area some 193 km (120 mi) south of Moscow. For reference, go to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tula,_Russia. It is not an area where
we see many reports of this disease; usually it is in southern Russia.
As such this may indicate an active stand by the Russian
veterinary/food-safety services. - Mod.MHJ]
