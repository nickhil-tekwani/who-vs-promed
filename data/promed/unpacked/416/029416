An Australian doctor was charged Friday [27 May 2011] with
endangering his patients' lives after police alleged he infected
nearly 50 women with hepatitis C at an abortion clinic. A 61-year-old
doctor, who worked as an anesthesiologist at the Melbourne clinic, was
charged with 54 counts each of conduct endangering life, negligently
causing serious injury, and recklessly causing serious injury. The
most serious charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.
He was released on 250 000 Australian dollars (USD 267 000) bail when
he appeared briefly in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday [27
May 2011]. He was not required to enter pleas to the charges, which
relate to 49 patients at the clinic who health officials say
contracted the same strain of hepatitis C as Peters between 2008 and
2009.

Hepatitis C can cause serious liver problems, including cirrhosis and
cancer. It is spread through the blood. Police have not released
details on how they believe the disease was transmitted. But Bram
Alexander, a spokesman for the Victoria State Department of Health,
said officials with the department closely investigated all the
infection control procedures at the clinic and didn't find any
problems with them.

"That's precisely why, back in early last year [2010], we referred
these matters to the police for further investigation, because our
investigation could find no plausible reason as to why the infection
took place," Alexander said.

The anesthesiologist had his registration suspended in February 2010.
Under his bail conditions, he must not work in any medical or
health-related field and must not contact staff at a number of medical
centers where he previously worked, including the abortion clinic. He
was also required to surrender his passport. Health officials tested
more than 4000 of his patients during their investigation, and found
49 who were infected with a strain of the virus genetically linked to
his.

[These events occurred in the period leading up to 20 Feb 2010 when
the physician concerned was suspended by the Medical Practitioners
Board of Victoria. They have been recorded in detail in the
ProMED-mail reports archived below.

As of 2 Jun 2010, 44 of 746 women who attended the Croydon Day
Surgery in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia had tested positive for
hepatitis C virus infection. It is highly probable that several (at
least 3) of 55 New Zealand women who were treated at the Croydon Day
Surgery during the same period will have contracted hepatitis C virus
infection also.

Although there could be ample opportunities in an abortion clinic for
transmission of blood-borne infections as a result of medical
negligence, none have been identified so far. The hepatitis C virus
carried by the physician and the patients infected at the clinic
appear to be homologous by genome analysis. However, the Victoria
State Department of Health investigation failed to identify the route
of transmission. It remains to be seen whether the police
investigation will be more successful. It may be some time before the
situation is resolved. - Mod.CP]
