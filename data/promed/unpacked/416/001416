Sick Animals Found Ahead of Festival of Sacrifice
-------------------------------------------------
One week ahead of the festival of sacrifice or Eid al-Adha the
agriculture, fisheries, and animal husbandry office in Cirebon
municipality in West Java found foot and mouth disease [FMD][sic; see
comment] on some of the animals prepared for the festival.

Based on inspection at stocks owned by different traders [from]
various part of the city the disease was identified on some goats.
Head of the Animal Husbandry Office in Cirebon Priyogi Suharto said
some of the animals suffered from orf [see comment]. His office
recommended the seasonal animal trader not to sell the sick animal
but stoppod short of banning sale for or seizing the sick animals.

The regional animal husbandry office said it will issue certification
on a healthy goat or cow for the sacrifice festival. Seasonal animal
traders were common ahead of the Eid al-Adha festival all over
Indonesia. Traders usually use any vacant lot on the sides of main
roads for trading weeks before the festival arrives, due on 27 Nov 2009.

[Indonesia is regarded as being free from FMD since 1983. It is
highly unlikely that the term foot and mouth disease, used in the
above newswire, is accurate. More likely, the source is related to orf.

Orf, or contagious ecthyma, is a highly contagious, zoonotic, viral
skin disease that affects sheep, goats and some other domesticated
and wild ruminants. The skin lesions are painful and often occur on
the mouth and muzzle; hence the other names of the disease,
contagious pustular dermatitis, sore mouth and scabby mouth. Orf is a
parapoxvirus infection. The lesions are of proliferative nature.
Lesions on the udder may result in the abandonment of offspring, and
(less common) foot lesions can cause transient lameness. Secondary
bacterial infections can occur and, in rare cases, the lesions may
extend into the internal organs. Although contagious ecthyma usually
resolves spontaneously and the mortality rate is generally low,
fatality rates up to 10 percent have been reported. This is a very
common infection of sheep and goats, present in all sheep and/or goat
raising countries, globally. In most countries it is not a reportable
disease nor cause for movement restrictions; it is!
not included in the OIE list.

Humans are usually infected by direct contact with animal lesions,
e.g., children in petting zoos/parks, usually by letting infected
lambs licking their fingers. It is not transmitted by consumption of
meat or milk; direct contact with lesions being the common infection
route. Most infections in humans are localized and heal
spontaneously; however, large, poorly healing lesions can occur in
people who are immunosuppressed. - Mod.AS]
