From: Paul Prociv <p.prociv@mailbox.uq.oz.au>

Michael Woodford's message, clearly implying that flying foxes are
susceptible to infection by the same pathogenic microorganisms as affect
humans, is fascinating, and in keeping with the hypothesis that megabats
evolved as "flying primates", distinctly from the microbats, which
developed as "flying rodents".
Our own Professor Jack Pettigrew proposed a strong case for this hypothesis
some time ago, based mainly on his neurophysiological findings (JD
Pettigrew, 1986, Science 231:1304). While it is by no means universally
accepted (e.g. genetic counter-arguments by WJ Bailey et al., 1992, Science
256:86), my own observations of megabat behaviour, intelligence, anatomy
(even at the microscopic level), physiology and haematological parameters
impressed me with how _Pteropus_ species had so much in common with humans.
To me, it would not be surprising if it were found that they are also
susceptible to viruses commonly causing human epidemics, or that we should
be susceptible to viruses normally found in them.
