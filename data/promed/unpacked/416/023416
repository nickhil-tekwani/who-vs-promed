The reports discussed by the National Committee for Combating Bird
Flu in its meeting chaired by minister of Agriculture and Land
Reclamation, Ameen Abaza, on 28 Feb 2009 mentioned that only one
human bird flu case was detected since the beginning of the current
year [2008], and it is receiving the treatment in Menya, as compared
to 44 cases in 2007.

The reports stated that the birds' infections in the farms started to
decrease as 5 cases in the farms and 18 cases in the poultry house
raising were detected, which means 83 percent of house-raising and 17
percent of the farms. [assumed, "house raising" means, in this
context, backyard, family-held poultry, while "farms" are commercial
poultry farms. - Mod.AS]

Spokesman of the Committee, ambassador Ayman Al-Kaffas, said at the
press conference that during January and February [2008], 40 million
birds were immunized to increase the total volume of immunized birds
since July 2007 to 130 million birds equaling 87 percent of birds in
Egypt.

Al-Kaffas added that as a result of increasing awareness of people
concerning the danger of bird flu, so during February [2008] the
Ministry of Agriculture received 297 reports and all the results are
satisfactory.

Moreover, he said that 70 symposia were held, and 5.1 million
pamphlets were circulated to notify people in all governorates, and
there is a website on the internet including information on the bird
flu.

Al-Kaffas noted that the Committee decided in its meeting to continue
in catching violations, killing infected birds, determining a hard
fine reaching to EGP 10 000 (USD 1840) and closing violating farms
and shops for a period of 6 months. He added that 18 farms were
closed for 6 months during January and February [2008]. He also
clarified that the number of notifications received by the Minister
of Agriculture during January and February reached 35 000.

As for farms of pigs, which represent the main source of bird flu
infection [a statement in need of clarification and scientific
evidence. - Mod.AS], Al-Kaffas confirmed that 9 locations outside the
Greater Cairo were chosen to transport 12 000 farms including 140 000
heads of pigs to be far away from the housing complexes.

[The rather encouraging description of implemented vaccination is
somewhat in conflict with the epidemiological data, and in particular
with the human health situation. Has the vaccination efficiency in
Egypt been studied/evaluated? - Mod.AS]

A case of bird flu has been discovered on Sunday [2 Mar 2008] in the
southern Iraqi city of Basra. An Iraqi higher committee Secretariat
in combating bird flu from the Iraqi cabinet council said the new
discovery is in Al-Fedagiya village in the Fao area. The committee,
based on the discovery, prohibited all transfers of poultry and live
birds to other provinces before getting permission from local vet
hospitals.

The committee also issued an order prohibiting the selling and
dealing of birds and poultry in the area, including taking all the
precautionary measures needed.

The committee also called on citizens in the area to avoid bird
hunting the area for their own safety.
