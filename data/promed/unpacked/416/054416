Three confirmed cases of foodborne botulism are being investigated in Denmark. The outbreak occurred earlier this month [March 2021] at a private company in southern Denmark. Six people had eaten together, and 3 initially developed symptoms; 2 other people have since shown signs of being affected. Fodevarestyrelsen (the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration), the National Food Institute (DTU- Food), and Statens Serum Institut are trying to identify the source of infection.

Following a private party on 5 Mar [2021], 3 adults have been hospitalized because of botulism. They are being treated with botulism antitoxin, and the condition of all of them is improving. Analysis of stool from one patient shows it is toxin type B. Another 2 people from the company have developed mild symptoms, and samples from them are being studied.

The Statens Serum Institut examined samples from the patients to confirm the botulism hypothesis. The agency is also analyzing the ingredients and leftovers of food that was eaten at the company. No other patients with botulism are known outside this business.

Botulism is a rare condition caused by toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. In 2018, a botulism outbreak involving 9 people at a company in Sonderborg was caused by a homemade, savory jelly dish. Four became seriously ill, requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation, and were hospitalized for up to 8 weeks. A sample from the food was positive with botulinum toxin type A. The same type was identified in the patients.

[Most cases of foodborne botulism occur from home-prepared foods that are stored or canned improperly. No information is given with regard to the foods involved and how they were prepared, and whether anti-botulinum antitoxin was given.

Botulism occurs when usually preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract; when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II.

A recently published paper (Miyashita S-I, Zhang J, Zhang S, Shoemaker CB, Dong M: Delivery of single-domain antibodies into neurons using a chimeric toxin-based platform is therapeutic in mouse models of botulism. Science Transl Med. 2021; 13(575): eaaz4197; DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz4197) presents a new immunologic technique for delivering a biologic to actually reverse the effects of the toxin.

"Abstract:

Efficient penetration of cell membranes and specific targeting of a cell type represent major challenges for developing therapeutics toward intracellular targets. One example facing these hurdles is to develop post-exposure treatment for botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), a group of bacterial toxins (BoNT/A to BoNT/G) that are major potential bioterrorism agents. BoNTs enter motor neurons, block neurotransmitter release, and cause a paralytic disease botulism. Members of BoNTs such as BoNT/A exhibit extremely long half-life within neurons, resulting in persistent paralysis for months, yet there are no therapeutics that can inhibit BoNTs once they enter neurons. Here, we developed a chimeric toxin-based delivery platform by fusing the receptor-binding domain of a BoNT, which targets neurons, with the membrane translocation domain and inactivated protease domain of the recently discovered BoNT-like toxin BoNT/X, which can deliver cargoes across endosomal membranes into the cytosol. A therapeutic protein was then created by fusing a single-domain antibody (nanobody) against BoNT/A with the delivery platform. In vitro characterization demonstrated that nanobodies were delivered into cultured neurons and neutralized BoNT/A in neurons. Administration of this protein in mice shortened duration of local muscle paralysis, restoring muscle function within hours, and rescued mice from systemic toxicity of lethal doses of BoNT/A. Fusion of 2 nanobodies, one against BoNT/A and the other against BoNT/B, created a multivalent therapeutic protein able to neutralize both BoNT/A and BoNT/B in mice. These studies provide an effective post-exposure treatment for botulism and establish a platform for intracellular delivery of therapeutics targeting cytosolic proteins and processes."
