This is the information we received from Israel. After asking permission
from Dr. Yakobson, this information was forwarded to rabiesr@pasteur.fr.
You can forward this on ProMED-mail if you wish.

Thank you for your interest in the rabies situation in Israel. General
information on the subject until 1996 was summarized by Prof. A. Shimshony
the Director of the Israeli Veterinary Services and Animal and can be seen
at:
<http://www.agri.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabies/shimrab.htm>
Recent information is present in our rabies home page (in Hebrew) at:
<http://www.agri.huji.ac.il/~yakobson>
and the map of the cases diagnosed in 1997 can be seen at:
<http://www.agri.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/mapa97.JPG>
The information in English about the Israeli rabies page can be found at:
<http://www.agri.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/about.htm>
In 1997 we diagnosed 85 positive cases including three human cases one in
November 1996 (a 19 year old soldier, Golan district), and two in December
1997 (a 7 year old girl, Qallansawa, central Israel and a 58 year old man
from Jdeida, north-western Israel). All three were bitten (case 1) or
scratched (cases 2 and 3) by nocturnal unidentified animals while sleeping
outdoors. Human rabies was not diagnosed previously in Israel in last 20
years. The majority of the others positive cases have been in foxes and the
situation is similar to that presented at
<http://www.agri.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabies/shimrab.htm>
The first stage of the Israeli oral wildlife vaccination project (the
vaccine and bait evaluation in jackals) is in progress. A regional project
also including the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Egypt being planned.

[The above was triggered by the following communication out of the blue
from Henry Wilde, written to Henri Tsiang and cc'd to ProMED-mail. - Mod.MHJ

From: Henry Wilde <fmedhwl@chulkn.car.chula.ac.th>

The recent reports of human rabies in Israel are disturbing and
interesting. It appears from limited information obtained from the "rabies
network" as well as individual information from friends in Israel that the
cases all had a history of camping (where?) and being bitten at night by an
unknown small animal. Some of the injuries may have been "scratches". Foxes
have been suspected and an oral wildlife vaccination effort is being
considered, as there has been fox rabies in the region. The viral strain
has not been identified (at least not in any e-mail communications) and it
is not known if studies are pending.
It would seem to me, that a fox bite would be an event that would bring the
victim to a medical facility and not be described as a "scratch". Foxes, in
my experience with several seen in Alaska, are like dog bites. Rabid dogs
often chew and gnaw rather than inflict simple puncture wounds though that
can also be seen. It is thus quite possible that the Israelis are dealing
with bat bites or bites from small rodents. Palm rat bites are small and
palm rats do carry rabies (at least in Sri Lanka and India). If the
responsible animal is a bat or palm rat (or other small mammal) oral
vaccination may not solve the problem. In any case, the Israelis need a
good zoologist, do some survey studies in small mammals and, above all,
send some brain tissue to Tsiang at [the Pasteur [Institute or Smith at
[the US CDC for strain identification.
