Nigeria confirms 1st Ebola death
--------------------------------
West Africa's current Ebola outbreak has spread to a 4th country, after a Liberian man vomited and had diarrhea and a high fever on an airplane to Nigeria. As soon as the plane landed on Tuesday [22 Jul 2014], the 40 year old Liberian was moved into an isolation ward and he died on Friday [25 Jul 2014]. It is the 1st case of Ebola to be confirmed in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, since the current outbreak began in West Africa earlier this year [2014], according to Nigerian health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu.

"All ports of entry into Nigeria, including airports, seaports and land boarders, are placed on red alert," he said. "Ministry of Health specialists have been positioned in all entry points. Active surveillance has also been stepped up." Authorities are currently investigating all persons who may have come into contact with the deceased, said Chukwu. "We have already got in touch with all the passengers," he said. "We are monitoring and investigating."

The man, a Liberian government official, arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday [22 Jul 2014] to attend an international conference and died early Friday [25 Jul 2014]. Blood tests for ebolavirus returned positive from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital later in the day. Ebola, one of the world's most deadly and contagious diseases, has killed at least 660 and infected 1093 in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and now Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization.

[2] Sierra Leone: WHO regional director visit

WHO urges Sierra Leone's president to boost community engagement to stop Ebola transmission
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization's regional director for Africa Dr Luis Sambo continued his visit to the 3 West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. On the 2nd leg of his visit, the regional director arrived in Sierra Leone on Tuesday, 22 Jul 2014, to get more insight, review current outbreak response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak in West Africa. Dr Sambo held a series of high level official meetings with the president of Sierra Leone HE Dr Ernest Bai Koroma, the Inter-ministerial Taskforce on Ebola comprising of strategic cabinet ministers, donor partners, the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC), and the United Nations Country Team, respectively.

President Koroma, during his meeting with Dr Sambo, thanked WHO and the international community for their continued support prior to and during the outbreak. He expressed concerns over the continued outbreak of EVD in the country and called on WHO and partners to strengthen their support to contain the disease. Furthermore, he requested international support to train national staff to be deployed in the field, noting that this is the 1st time the country is experiencing the EVD outbreak.

Addressing the head of state, Dr Sambo appreciated the president's leadership and called for urgent government action to engage communities for behaviour change at the household level to stop the emergence of new cases of infection. He also expressed concerns about the significant number of health workers that have been infected with EVD and the need for continued training and mentoring of staff, especially on matters of infection prevention and control. The regional director assured the president of the commitment from the WHO director general and staff to articulate the international partnership to contain the outbreak in Sierra Leone.

In his meeting with development partners including donors and UN agencies, Dr Sambo informed his audience about the challenges being experienced in controlling the ongoing epidemic. He encouraged them to pool their resources to stop the transmission and "get the number of new infections to zero," he added. Responding to Dr Sambo, the partners pledged their commitment and suggested ways of improving the national response. Furthermore, they requested the urgent finalization of the Accelerated National Ebola Response Plan.

Sierra Leone declared the confirmation of the 1st case of EVD on 25 May 2014. As of 23 Jul 2014, a total of 427 cases have been confirmed positive for EVD and 144 confirmed deaths in 7 districts. WHO continues to provide support to the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in Sierra Leone in all areas of the response.

Ebola outbreak update
---------------------
As of today, 24 Jul 2014, we have 108 cumulative number of survivors, 435 confirmed Ebola cases and 146 Ebola confirmed deaths. 65 patients are currently admitted at the Ebola treatment centers in Kenema and Kailahun.

The Ministry of Health and Sanitization and the World Health Organization have established a dedicated Ebola Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the WHO Country Office in Freetown. The EOC is co-directed by the minister of health, Ms Miata Kargbo, and the WHO representative for Sierra Leone, Dr Jacob Mufunda, and consists of leaders and partners involved in our fight against Ebola.

The EOC will serve as the Sierra Leone national central command and control center for outbreak response activities, and meets every day. The EOC members, under the leadership of the honourable minister of health and sanitation, unanimously decided at the 24 Jul 2014 meeting that the following actions be effected immediately:

- all district medical officers constitute 2 burial teams of 7 members per burial team in their respective districts;
- the regional training for burial teams be completed this weekend (Friday and Saturday [25-26 Jul 2014]) in Bo;
- more health personnel be trained in infection prevention control by MSF [Medecins sans Frontieres] in Kailahun, and the Ministry of Health and Sanitation to provide the finance to support the training;
- all districts to establish EOCs to be chaired by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and be co-chaired by WHO or the major partner operating in their respective district recommended by WHO.

The EOC wishes the general public and all partners working in the healthcare sector to know that Dr Sheik Umar Khan is still alive and responding to treatment, contrary to social media reports of his demise.

[4] Sierra Leone: lost contacts

Sierra Leone officials appealed for help on Friday [25 Jul 2014] to trace the 1st known resident in the capital with Ebola virus disease [EVD] whose family forcibly removed her from a Freetown hospital after testing positive for the deadly disease.

Radio stations in Freetown, a city of around 1 million inhabitants, broadcast the appeal on Friday [25 Jul 2014] to locate a woman who tested positive for the disease that has killed 660 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since an outbreak was 1st identified in February [2014]. "SK of 25 Old Railway Line, Brima Lane, Wellington," the announcement said. "She is a positive case and her being out there is a risk to all. We need the public to help us locate her."

SK, 32, a resident of the densely populated Wellington neighborhood, had been admitted to an isolation ward while blood samples were tested for the virus, health ministry spokesman Sidi Yahya Tunis said. The results came back on Thursday [24 Jul 2014]. "The family of the patient stormed the hospital and forcefully removed her and took her away," Tunis said. "We are searching for her."

Fighting one of the world's deadliest diseases is straining the region's weak health systems, while a lack of information and suspicion of medical staff has led many to shun treatment.

Dozens unaccounted for
----------------------
Earlier this year [2014], a man in Freetown tested positive for EVD, although he is believed to have caught it elsewhere.

According to health ministry data and officials, dozens of people confirmed by laboratory tests to have EVD are now unaccounted for in Sierra Leone, where the majority of cases have been recorded in the country's east. While international medical organizations have deployed experts to the field in an attempt to contain the outbreak, WHO said poor health infrastructure and a lack of manpower were hindering their efforts. "We're seeing many of these facilities simply don't have enough people to provide the constant level of care needed," WHO spokesman Paul Garwood told a news briefing in Geneva on Friday [25 Jul 2014].

The West African outbreak is the 1st time that EVD, which was 1st discovered in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976, has appeared in heavily populated urban areas and international travel hubs. Cases have already been confirmed in Conakry and Monrovia, the capital cities of Guinea and Liberia.

[5] Protective suit limitations
Date: Thu 24 Jul 2014

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/07/24/1316459/--Moon-suit-is-supposed-to-keep-Ebola-virus-out-so-why-do-health-care-workers-keep-catching-it#


[Photo: health care worker in Kailahun, Sierra Leone wearing protective gear includes goggles and head to toe covering, as well as gloves and boots (http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/07/24/ebola-suit-1_slide-361a142046f38abb5fe36da77883619cbb68fd2d-s6-c30.jpg).]

Tommy Trenchard of NPR [National Public Radio, USA] asks, "This suit keeps Ebola out -- so how can a health worker catch it?" (http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/07/24/334948345/this-suit-keeps-ebola-out-so-how-can-a-health-worker-catch-it). In response to my article yesterday, "Dr Sheik Umar Khan, Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor, contracts virus after treating 100 patients" (http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/07/23/1316128/-Dr-Sheik-Umar-Khan-Sierra-Leone-s-top-Ebola-doctor-contracts-virus-after-treating-100-patients), many have asked, "how could this happen, even though he was taking all the recommended precautions?"

Dr Khan is just one of dozens of health workers who have become infected with the virus while caring for patients even while wearing protective gear called PPE, personal protective equipment. Caring for patients requires much contact, and any exposure to bodily fluids of an infected patient can transmit the virus, so this includes vomit, blood, sweat, mucus, diarrhea, semen, spit, etc.

Dr Khan has said, "Even with the full protective clothing you put on, you are at risk." Taking these suits off safely after exposure is not easy, and health workers are also vulnerable to needle sticks and other exposures such as with blood samples, hospital equipment, and laboratory tests.

Tommy Tranchard spoke with Armand Sprecher of MSF, Medecins Sans Frontieres, known also in English as Doctors Without Borders, about the PPE. The yellow suit that MSF uses is [made of] a woven plastic fiber. And they throw a laminate on it. It's very impervious to fluid. But to work, it has to be used in conjunction with a set of behaviors and procedures.... The presumed way you get sick is virus gets into a mucus membrane inside your mouth, nose or eyes. If you were very, very good about keeping your hands off your face, you could probably get away with more exposed skin above the neck. But we like to cover health workers] from the neck up. So when the hand goes to the face in an unconscious movement, it doesn't touch anything.

"31 clinicians and 48 staff touched their T-zones (eyes, nose, and mouth) a mean of 19 times in 2 hours (range, 0-105 times); clinicians did so significantly less often than staff." ref: Elder NC, Sawyer W, Pallerla H, Khaja S, Blacker M. Hand hygiene and face touching in family medicine offices: a Cincinnati Area Research and Improvement Group (CARInG) network study. J Am Board Fam Med. 2014 May-Jun;27(3):339-46. doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2014.03.130242.]

Although in slang, Africans apparently often call these "moon suits", the ones pictured here and used in the field fall far short of the "moon suits" used in Biosecurity Level 4 labs, which are airtight, have their own air supply, and are kept at a positive pressure.

Another issue with the suits is that because they are fluid-resistant they are also air-resistant, and they become uncomfortable in the African heat. Sprecher says, "It's hotter than hell. You're unable to wear the PPE for more than 30 or 40 minutes in tropical heat."

Trenchard also asks Armand Sprecher how the West African medical community is reacting to the news of Dr Khan's infection. "It's shaking things up. A lot of people know Dr Khan.... He took great pleasure in his work and brought an infectious enthusiasm." Please get well soon, Dr Khan. We need you back in the field leading efforts to treat patients and contain this virus. Our prayers and best wishes go out to Dr Khan, and all those afflicted with the Ebola virus, and all of the people of Western Africa who are struggling to stop this terrible outbreak. We also thank all of the courageous health workers of the MSF and WHO who are working on the front lines of this important viral battle to keep us safe.

[The 1st imported case to a country outside the 3-country region, Nigeria, has been confirmed in Lagos, the country's commercial capital and a mega-city of 21 million people. Unfortunately, it is likely that there will be more. This case never left the airport, but must have had close contact with many people there who have travelled into the city.

There is an updated map of the situation before this case, with graphs showing the epidemic curves in the 3 countries, from the NGO Samaritan's Purse, at http://reliefweb.int/map/liberia/ebola-virus-west-africa-july-24-update. It shows that Guinea-Bissau, across the north western border of Guinea, must also be at risk.

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are among the poorest, least governed states in the world. About half of the nations' adults are illiterate. In 2011, the government of Guinea spent on average USD 7 per capita on health. In Liberia, the government spends USD 18 per capita on health. In Sierra Leone, the government spent USD 13 per capita last year (2013) on health (ref: Garrett L. http://www.kspr.com/news/nationworld/garrett-why-ebola-spinning-out-of-control/21051646_27130872). - Mod.JW
