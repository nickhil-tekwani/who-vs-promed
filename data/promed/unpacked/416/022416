Stripe rust may originate in Asia
---------------------------------
A joint research project of the University of Aarhus in Denmark and the University of Peshawar in Pakistan has found that the stripe rust races currently occurring in Europe are mostly identical with samples from the Himalaya region.

Comparison of genotypes from a large number of samples collected worldwide indicates that the invasion of aggressive strains, which has occurred in Europe in recent years, was due to the pathogens being spread by wind currents from Asia. The same stripe rust strains, which are known to cause extensive damage to wheat and triticale, are also present in both crops and wild grasses in valleys of the Himalayas.

The scientists consider that the enormous capability of spread of the rust underlines the importance of international collaboration to determine causes of outbreaks and develop resistant crop varieties.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour, and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge," providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Since about 2000, stripe rust strains with virulence to important resistance genes like Yr27 have emerged and spread rapidly across continents, causing major outbreaks. For example, the highly aggressive Warrior strain, which has been spreading in Europe since 2009 (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20140523.2489629 and 20140122.2224928), seems now to have appeared across the Mediterranean in North Africa.

Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).
