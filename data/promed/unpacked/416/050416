An outbreak of a rare type of _Salmonella_ has been declared over in Sweden after more than 50 people fell sick. The outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Coeln is thought to have been caused by fresh sprouts.

From the end of August 2021 to October 2021, 52 people from 14 regions were found with the same type of _Salmonella_ Coeln thanks to whole genome sequencing. This means it is likely they were infected by a common source.

Salmonellosis cases were aged 0 to 85 years old with a median of 35. Overall, 27 females and 25 males were sick. As there have been no new cases or samples of the outbreak strain from patients since 26 Oct 2021, public health officials believe the outbreak has ended.

Local infection control units and municipalities helped in the investigation with the Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) and Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkh√§lsomyndigheten). A previous update, when the source had not been found, was given when 31 people were ill. The number of people affected by _Salmonella_ Coeln in Sweden in 2020 and 2019 was in single figures.

The Public Health Agency of Sweden conducted a case-by-case study based on questionnaires by regional infection control units that had _Salmonella_ patients. These people answered questions about what they had eaten during the week before illness as part of the epidemiological investigation.

Responses from outbreak patients were compared to answers from _Salmonella_ cases that did not belong to the outbreak. This found a link between illness with the outbreak strain and consumption of sprouts. A suspected link to sprouts had also been identified during investigations in one region.

It is believed that a suspected contaminated batch was delivered to grocery stores, wholesalers and commercial kitchens at the end of August [2021]. Sampling and analysis of remaining sprouts from ill people and from production did not find _Salmonella_, so suspicions that they were the source of infection could not be confirmed by microbiological [analyses].

[A number of significant pathogens, including _Salmonella_, _Listeria_, and enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, have been linked to transmission from ingestion of a variety of different kinds of sprouts in the USA and elsewhere. The following is a relatively recent review on outbreaks caused by sprouts:

Abstract
--------
"After a series of outbreaks associated with sprouts in the mid-1990s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidelines in 1999 for sprouts producers to reduce the risk of contamination. The recommendations included treating seeds with an antimicrobial agent such as calcium hypochlorite solution and testing spent irrigation water for pathogens. From 1998 through 2010, 33 outbreaks from seed and bean sprouts were documented in the USA, affecting 1330 reported persons. Twenty-eight outbreaks were caused by _Salmonella_, 4 by Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, and one by _Listeria_. In 15 of the 18 outbreaks with information available, growers had not followed key FDA guidelines. In 3 outbreaks, however, the implicated sprouts were produced by firms that appeared to have implemented key FDA guidelines. Although seed chlorination, if consistently applied, reduces pathogen burden on sprouts, it does not eliminate the risk of human infection. Further seed and sprout disinfection technologies, some recently developed, will be needed to enhance sprouts safety and reduce human disease. Improved seed production practices could also decrease pathogen burden, but, because seeds are a globally distributed commodity, will require international cooperation."

A 2013 outbreak of this serotype in Norway was attributed to imported, mixed, pre-washed and bagged salad. - Mod.LL
