A specific food item has not yet been identified as the source of this outbreak. Most of the sick people [20 of 22 with residence/travel information] in this outbreak live in [12 cases] or traveled to [8 cases] Florida about a month before they got sick. _Listeria_ symptoms usually start within 2 weeks after eating food contaminated with _Listeria_.

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 23
Hospitalizations: 22
Deaths: 1
States: 10
Recall: No
Investigation status: Active

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 29 Jun 2022, a total of 23 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 10 states (see map https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/monocytogenes-06-22/map.html). Of the 22 people with information, 20 sick people reported living in or traveling to Florida in the month before they got sick, although the significance of this is still under investigation. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 24 Jan 2021 through 12 Jun 2022 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/monocytogenes-06-22/epi.html).

Sick people range in age from less than 1 to 92 years, with a median age of 72, and 52% are male. Twenty-two people (96%) have been hospitalized. Five people got sick during their pregnancy, and one illness resulted in a fetal loss. One death has been reported from Illinois.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. So far, a common food item has not been identified.

Laboratory data
---------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS).

WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from the same food.

Public health actions
---------------------
If you are at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection and have symptoms, especially if you recently traveled to Florida, talk to your healthcare provider. Healthcare providers should report listeriosis illnesses to their health department. This information may help investigators solve this outbreak. Typically, listeriosis affects older adults, pregnant women, infants and adults with compromised immune systems. Pregnant women are approximately 10 times more likely to get listeriosis. Pregnant Hispanic women are 24 times more likely to get listeriosis than other people.

[In the USA, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole genome sequencing. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet also works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source.

_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature. The organism is a gram-positive bacillus that can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat, and poultry, raw (unpasteurized) milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises used to process contaminated meat or fish and vegetables, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, humans, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

_L. monocytogenes_ can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that may be difficult to access.

_Listeria_-contaminated, refrigerated, ready-to-eat products (that is, products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked fish or cold-cut meats like ham or pork) are well-recognized sources of listeriosis because _Listeria_ is able to multiply at refrigerator temperatures. Refrigeration allows small numbers of _Listeria_ that contaminate food at the source to grow to sufficient size to cause disease. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk, as well as milk and milk products contaminated with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization, are other sources of listeriosis.

We await further information as the investigation unfolds. - Mod.ML
