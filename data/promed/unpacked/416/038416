Three swans found dead in eastern France were victims of the H5N1 bird flu
virus that can be fatal to humans, tests have confirmed.

French officials raised the bird flu threat to high from moderate after the
tests near the German border. This is only the 2nd outbreak of H5N1 in
France; early last year [2007], 62 wild birds died of the virus in the
centre of the country [Sic: an HPAI H5N1 outbreak in a turkey farm in
southeastern France was officially reported in February 2006; see posting
20060227.0640. - Mod.AS].

Authorities in France had been carrying out tests on wild birds over the
past week in several locations in the east. The 3 swans that tested
positive for H5N1 were found dead in a pond near the town of Assenoncourt
[see map at the above BBC URL].

With the elevation of the bird flu threat, domestic birds nationwide will
be protected from contact with wild birds.

Last month [March 2008], the virus was found on 2 poultry farms in the
Czech Republic. Outbreaks were reported last year [2007] in 13 European
Union countries, although none has yet resulted in human deaths [nor in
recorded human infections - Mod.AS]. The virus is highly contagious to birds.

[Swans have been found H5N1-infected in many European countries during the
ongoing epizootic, among them Romania, Croatia, Slovenia, Ukraine
(Crimean), Russia, Hungary, UK, France, Switzerland, Germany, and others.
It has been asked whether swans are indeed specifically vulnerable to the
virus and/or play a significant role in its spread or are rather readily
detected by the existing surveillance systems due to their size and colour.

According to EU's ADNS data, 11 swans have been reportedly found infected
during the 1st 11 weeks of 2008, all of them in the UK (see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_wildbirds2008.pdf>).

No birds of the other 4 surveyed groups (grebes, ducks, geese, others) have
so far been reportedly found infected in 2008.

H5N1 infection in EU wild birds was the highest in 2006, involving 14
member states led by Germany, Austria, France, Poland, and Denmark. The
infection faded out towards the end of May 2006. Out of the total of 748
wild birds found infected, 469 (63 per cent) were swans; the others were
121 ducks (16 per cent), 33 geese (4 per cent), 29 birds of prey (4 per
cent) and 96 others (13 per cent). For the complete list of the affected
countries, the numbers for each week, and other details, refer to
