re: GL Nichols, J Freedman, KG Pollock, C Rumble, RM Chalmers, P Chiodini, et al. Cyclospora infection linked to travel to Mexico, June to September 2015. Eurosurveillance 2015;Volume 20(43). http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21284

_Cyclospora cayetanensis_ was identified in 176 returned travellers from the Riviera Maya region of Mexico between 1 Jun and 22 Sep 2015, 79 in the United Kingdom (UK) and 97 in Canada. The UK cases completed a food exposure questionnaire.

This increase in reported cyclospora cases highlights risks of gastrointestinal infections through travelling, limitations in cyclospora surveillance, and the need for improved hygiene in the production of food consumed in holiday resorts.

[A nationwide outbreak of cyclosporiasis took place in the United States and Canada in June to August 2015 (see ProMED-mail reports below). The vegetable cilantro was suspected as the source. Most probably, this report from the UK is part of the same outbreak, and it would be interesting to know whether the 2 outbreaks are linked. - Mod.EP
