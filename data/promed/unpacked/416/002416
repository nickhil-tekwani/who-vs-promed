Health officials in Zambia on Friday [15 Oct 2021] confirmed an outbreak of suspected typhoid in Lusaka, the country's capital. Residents of mostly shanty compounds of the Zambian capital have of late complained of diarrhea cases, forcing the health authorities to conduct tests.

Minister of Health Sylvia Masebo said environmental and water analysis has revealed fecal contamination of water in some shanty compounds in the city. She said in a release that health authorities have since heightened active surveillance-reporting cases and engaged the water and sanitation firm to manage the problem.

The ministry, she said, has also received 6000 bottles of liquid chlorine from the Zambia Red Cross to be distributed to the affected areas, as well as intensified water quality monitoring. "We continue to urge all households to ensure that they practice safe food and water hygiene practices more so during this time of year in order to avoid diseases," she said.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the more common kinds of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

The classic food-related cluster of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City of Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary," an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below). - Mod.LL
