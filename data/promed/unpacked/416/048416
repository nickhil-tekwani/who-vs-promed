This newswire reports the recent death of 6 people in the Andean fringes of
Ecuadorian Amazonia. They were preceded a month before by the death of 4
children and 1 adult. Initially the deaths were attributed to meningitis.
Provisional analyses undertaken on the last 6 deceased were positive for
rabies. Further testing will be undertaken to clarify the etiology. There were
no reports of people bitten by vampires or of bovine cases, but 6 dogs were
found dead in the area.

a Quechua Indian community in the valley of the River Bobonaza. Specimens have
been sent to rabies diagnostic laboratories in CDC Atlanta, USA, and Callao,
Peru for confirmation. - Mod.JW]
