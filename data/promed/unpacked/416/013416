change over time. This means that previously reported cases may be
discarded after further investigation and follow-up.

[C] Update 77 - WHO officials to visit China 10 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_10/en/>
Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases at WHO, is
travelling today to China, where he will confer with health officials about
the SARS outbreak and discuss plans for the future. Other members of the
team include Dr Guenael Rodier, Director of Communicable Disease
Surveillance and Response, and Dr Thomas Grein, who coordinates global
response operations for SARS.
The purpose of the visit is to take stock of the current SARS situation in
China and exchange views on the next steps forward. In particular, WHO
would like to develop, in collaboration with the Chinese government, a
research agenda that fully exploits the many intriguing lines of evidence
uniquely associated with the SARS experience in China. WHO officials also
want to assess areas where Chinese authorities may require more support to
ensure that the disease is securely contained and to protect against a
future recrudescence of cases.
"SARS is a serious disease with many puzzling features," said Dr Heymann.
"Long-term containment depends on finding answers to a long list of
scientific questions. China has much to offer the rest of the world."
Some immediate issues for discussion concern case definitions, procedures
for contact tracing, and the extent of local transmission in specific
areas. The WHO team further seeks reassurance that hospital equipment and
supplies for infection control are adequate, especially in the poorer
provinces.
Measures may need to be found for sustaining China's present monumental
effort to contain SARS, particularly as programmes for responding to other
priority diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and TB, may suffer in the long run.
Weaknesses in the health infrastructure, notably inadequate surveillance,
reporting, and hospital facilities in some of Chinas poorer provinces,
have been of concern since the first report of a WHO assessment team was
issued in early April [2003]. Both WHO and the Chinese Ministry of Health
regard the emergency response to SARS as an excellent opportunity to
strengthen, throughout the mainland, systems for detecting and responding
to all emerging and epidemic-prone infectious diseases. Such long-term and
comprehensive improvements will also strengthen Chinas capacity to respond
to the next influenza pandemic, which many experts now regard as imminent.
WHO officials are also hoping to learn which measures taken by China have
so rapidly brought the countrys SARS outbreak -­- the largest in the world
-­- under control.
The first cases of SARS were detected in Guangdong Province, China, in
mid-November of last year [2002]. That outbreak has since been brought
under control. Initial studies suggest a lower case fatality ratio than
seen elsewhere, and high cure rates. In addition, a report on the
epidemiology of the outbreak, issued in mid-May [2003] by the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, provides evidence suggesting
that close contact with wild game animals is linked to the first sporadic
cases, supporting a hypothesis that the SARS virus may have jumped to
humans from an animal reservoir. In addition, the outbreak in Guangdong
Province shows some features, in terms of incubation period and groups at
highest risk, that differ from the clinical picture seen in outbreaks
elsewhere.
Answers to these and other questions will help build a solid scientific
basis for understanding SARS, predicting its future evolution, and knowing
how to respond should cases surface in new areas or resurface in areas
where the disease has been contained.
Unlike many new diseases that have emerged in the past 2 decades, SARS
shows no sign of burning out on its own. If the disease is pushed back out
of its new human host, this will result from the persistent application of
simple yet highly effective control tools: prompt detection and isolation
of cases, strict infection control in hospitals, and tracing and
appropriate follow-up of all contacts.
Both Viet Nam and Singapore have successfully broken the chain of
transmission and have since remained free of SARS. However, the risk of
importation of cases remains as long as cases are occurring anywhere in the
world.
The visit to China is one in a series in which WHO officials, including the
current Director-General, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, and the Director-General
elect, Dr J.W. Lee, confer with health authorities at SARS outbreak sites
having the greatest experience to date. Dr. Brundtland will be visiting Hong
Kong SAR later this month.

Situation report on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 10 Jun 2003
-------------------------------------------
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
There is one new confirmed case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
today (10 Jun 2003). This is the 26th consecutive day on which the number
of cases has fallen below 5 since 16 May 2003.
Today's case involved a 65-year-old man [with a family member that had
earlier been confirmed to have SARS infection]. He was admitted to Alice Ho
Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital on 23 May 2003 and is now in stable condition.
The number of patients recovered and discharged from hospital is 1368. Of
them, 3 were discharged today. The number of SARS patients in intensive
care units is 17. These cases are part of the 62 cases under treatment in
hospitals. 34 are recovering patients in convalescence and in preparation
for discharge.
2 patients with underlying diseases died, bringing the total of deaths
attributable to SARS to 290.
Meanwhile, temperature checks for all passengers at the airport, ports, and
border points continue to be implemented to watch for travellers displaying
symptoms of SARS. In addition, all incoming travellers are required to
complete a health declaration. 5 passengers were screened out at these
points yesterday. After undergoing further medical checks, 4 were cleared
of SARS symptoms and continued their journey and the other was referred to
hospital for observation.
All household contacts of confirmed or suspected SARS patients are required
to undergo home confinement for monitoring and treatment up to a maximum of
10 days. So far, a total of 1262 persons (from 493 households) had been
covered, of whom 34 had been found to have SARS.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with SARS since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths
(change in past 24 hours presented in parentheses, minus used for decrease)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 386 (0)/ 360

In North Carolina, health authorities confirmed Monday [9 Jun 2003] that a
man developed SARS after returning from a visit [in May 2003] to Toronto.
He is under quarantine with members of his family, none of whom have shown
symptoms, in Orange County, outside Raleigh. The man visited a Toronto
hospital patient sharing a room with people who later came down with SARS,
officials said. His diagnosis raised the possibility of SARS spreading from
people carrying the virus but not showing any symptoms. Until now, health
authorities have worked under the assumption that only symptomatic patients
spread the illness. 11 of the U.S. probable cases, or about 16 percent,
have been linked to Toronto, said Llelwyn Grant, a spokesman for the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[B] Canada from Canada.com <http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/06/10/sars_whitby>
3 of 15 dialysis patients in Whitby, Ontario who were suspected of having
SARS have been cleared, officials said Tuesday [10 Jun 2003].
Investigations are ongoing into the remaining patients, said Dr. Don
Atkinson of the Lakeridge Health Centre. Atkinson said because the facility
wasn't an acute-care hospital, which is where institutional SARS outbreaks
have taken place in the Greater Toronto Area, it wasn't required to put up
protective barriers, although it did do the same screening. Those barriers
were put up Thursday [5 Jun 2003] after it became clear a problem might be
developing, he said. 5 staff are being monitored for possible infection,
he said.
2 other cases in Oshawa General Hospital, however, are being investigated
as potential SARS deaths. Whitby and Oshawa are located east of Toronto
outside the GTA. Those 2 individuals were in intensive care. "We review all
deaths in the intensive care unit," Atkinson said, but the timing and
symptoms of those 2 cases were of special concern. Almost 500 to 1000
people will end up in quarantine as a result of this possible outbreak,
said Dr. Donna Reynolds, medical officer of health for Durham region.
No linkage has been established yet between the people under investigation
and any known SARS cases, Atkinson said. One symptomatic person was from a
long-term care facility, Reynolds said. There is no evidence of SARS
spread in the community, she said.

[As of 10 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8430 probable
cases with 789 deaths reported from 20 countries. In the past 24 hours
there have been 9 new probable cases reported, of which 6 were reported
from Taiwan, and 1 each were reported from Hong Kong, Brazil, and the
United States.
The cluster under investigation in Ontario is still being reported in the
newswires but does not appear on either the Health Canada or Ministry of
Health and Long Term Care of Ontario SARS websites. More information on
the official investigations into these cases would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
