Quarantine enforced as horse dies
---------------------------------
Coast horse lovers are on alert after the death of a horse from Hendra
virus. A Beachmere property was quarantined late yesterday [11 Oct
2011] after the sick horse was euthanised following a positive test
for the virus. A gate on the Beachmere Road property displayed the
warning sign, which read, "The inspector has quarantined the infected
premises for an exotic disease of animals pursuant to section 9 (1) of
The Exotic Disease and Animals Act 1981. The person must not without
the permission of the inspector enter of leave the infected premises
or bring on to or remove from the premises any animal, carcass, animal
product, animal pathogen, biological preparation or property. Maximum
penalty AUD 2000 [USD 2038.80] or 2 years imprisonment."

Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeanette Young said public health
experts inspected the property to assess the situation and determine
how many humans, if any, had contact with the infected horse.
"Queensland Health staff will continue to undertake contact tracing to
work to ensure all people potentially exposed to the sick horse have
been identified," Dr Young said.

Queensland Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Rick Symons said the horse had
become sick over the weekend and was treated by a private
veterinarian. "Samples were taken for Hendra virus testing and the
positive result came back late last night," Dr Symons said.

Dr Symons confirmed another horse had been euthanised at the same
property over a week ago. "Biosecurity Queensland is seeking samples
from that horse as well to test for Hendra virus," he said.

Biosecurity Queensland was in the process of quarantining the property
and would assess and monitor the other 2 horses at the location over
the next month.

Queensland Reining Horse Association secretary Lynda Gray said the
Beachmere incident was "pot-luck".

"It wouldn't stop me from going to competitions, other than monitor
there is nothing we can do as the threat is so random, it's nothing
like Equine Influenza," she said.

"Hendra is no worse now then when it hit Beaudesert." Ms Gray advised
people be responsible and sensible with their horses.

[One person sees it as no worse than other times, but the horse owners
and those people possibly exposed will likely differ with that
sentiment.

People should use caution with their animals. Monitor them thoroughly
and do not travel with them if they are the least bit ill.

Sporting events are likely trying to keep a close eye on horses, as
well as keeping paddock areas clear of attractants to the flying
foxes. People should not be frightened of attending sporting events or
other exhibitions with horses. - Mod.TG]
