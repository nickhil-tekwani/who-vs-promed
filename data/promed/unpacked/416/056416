He is known as the "Bird Man of Harrow Lodge Park," and you don't have to look very far to see why; Michael Lyons, has earned himself this title.

Michael and his wife, Alison, were the 1st ones to discover the outbreak of botulism in the Hornchurch park and, like many others, have said they are devastated. "I saw the cygnets when they were just fresh hatched, so it was very upsetting to see them die like that," said Alison. "It does hurt, but you have got to harden your heart, otherwise you would be in tears 100 per cent of the time."

The pair have become the eyes and ears of the park since setting up the Conservation Society of Harrow Lodge Park in 2002. Alison explains: "We were just fed-up with the state of the park. You would have people come to the park and bring a picnic and then afterwards would leave all their rubbish behind. We just had enough of it and wanted to tidy it up."

Michael's average day starts at 7:45 am. Alison said: "He goes to the park and just does whatever needs doing. This could be feeding the birds or just tidying up around the lake." His day doesn't just end there. There is a lot of litter to clear, and he returns to the park in the late evening to make sure it is clean.

It is all about the birds for Michael. Alison said: "He does it for the birds. He has always been interested in wildlife, and he just loves them. Everyone knows him."

But 11 years after the group was set up, Alison says that very little has changed and believes that it is going to take more than a dedicated team of volunteers to change people's attitudes. "We see it all the time," said Alison. "People turn up with picnics and have a nice day in the park, but when they leave, their rubbish gets left behind, and it gets blown in the lake. It is very typical of people today, and until their attitude changes, it is going to continue happening."

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Spores of these bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. - Mod.PMB
