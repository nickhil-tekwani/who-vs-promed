A new strain of a mosquito-borne disease has led the Texas Department of State Health Services to conduct surveillance programs and tests. The California serogroup strain [virus] has appeared this week for the 1st time in Midland County and staff are testing those mosquitoes that may be carrying the disease [virus].

Zoonosis control specialist Kathy Parker set out 9 traps Monday and Tuesday to catch mosquitoes to send to Austin for testing.
The testing is in conjunction with the regular surveillance testing that is done each year from May through November, said Parker, who covers about 36 counties in West Texas and the Permian Basin.

The California serogroup [virus] disease recently was found in a Midlander when a doctor suspected it could be an arbovirus, she said.

The California serogroup [virus] disease is found mostly in the Eastern states. There have been only 5 known cases in Texas since 1964, according to officials.
