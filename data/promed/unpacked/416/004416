H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of clade 2.3.4.4 detected through surveillance of wild migratory birds in the Tyva Republic [Tuva], the Russian Federation - potential for international spread

Summary
-------
AGoose/Guangdong/96 lineage H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of clade 2.3.4.4 was detected in migratory birds at Lake Ubsu-Nur in the Tyva Republic of the Russian Federation, located on the Central Asian Flyway, in early June 2016 (World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), 2016; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2016).

In past seasons, detection of HPAI virus in this region of the Russian Federation was followed by detection of similar viruses in other locations, especially to the west and south of the Tyva Republic. All countries along this flyway and those to the west in the former Soviet Republics, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and even Africa (especially West Africa) should be on the alert for incursions of this virus. Movement of virus within 18 months of 1st detection in southern Russia to the Korean Peninsula and Japan has also occurred on 2 occasions (2006 and 2010).

Proactive surveillance and early reporting of these results by Russian scientists is an excellent demonstration of how surveillance is used as a tool for early warning. Note that as the virus may not necessarily be fatal for wild birds, the 1st evidence of infection may only be when spillover occurs into domestic poultry populations, especially galliformes, which are more likely to show signs of disease when infected.

[ProMED-mail published in June 2016 OIE's notification of the event in the wild birds population of Lake Ubsu-Nur in the Tyva Republic, with the following commentary by Mod. PMB (see 20160620.4298345):
"It is noteworthy the variety of aquatic bird types in which HPAI H5 virus was detected; namely gull, heron, duck, tern, cormorant, and grebe. Ubsu-Nur Lake is a huge wetland that congregates a great abundance and diversity of aquatic birds. It is a stopover site for migratory birds using the central Asian flyway, which covers a large continental area of Eurasia between the Arctic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. This flyway comprises several important migration routes of waterbirds that migrate over immense distances, and therefore the finding of this HPAI H5 virus in so many species here is of concern for a vast territory".

The current EMPRES alert-paper chapters 'Conclusions' and 'recommendations' follow.

"1. Conclusions
The surveillance conducted at Lake Ubsu-Nur and the prompt reporting by the Russian Federation, providing information on the subtype and clade of the virus, are highly valuable for early warning and outbreak preparedness purposes. Countries and places in Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, Europe and West Africa - especially those that have experienced outbreaks in 2005/06, 2009/10 and/or 2014/15 [see maps 2, 3 and 4 at the source URL] - should be on alert over the next 6 to 12 months, as westward and southern spread of the H5N8 virus is likely. If the virus enters Egypt or West Africa, where H5N1 HPAI viruses are already present or even entrenched in poultry populations it would further complicate disease control. South Asia may also be at risk of incursion of this H5N8 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 virus, potentially arriving there with fall migration in 2016. Based on past experience, this virus could also arrive in the Republic of Korea and Japan within the next 18 months. Clade 2.3.4.4 virus is already circulating widely in China.

Though considered a zoonotic virus, clade 2.3.4.4 viruses have so far shown limited propensity for causing disease in humans (less than 20 human cases of Influenza A(H5N6) and none to date for influenza A(H5N8). Molecular evidence from sequence information is awaited to assess whether the virus identified at Lake Ubsu-Nur has features typical of viruses that can cause disease in mammals.

Retrospective outlook at H5N1 HPAI virus dynamics in the last 11 years strongly suggests that waterbirds of Central Asia can propagate newly emergent avian influenza viruses to their breeding or moulting quarters during spring migration. Once delivered to stopover or moulting locations these viruses have the potential to spread in colonially breeding non-Anatidae species (gulls, terns, cormorants, spoonbills etc.) and result in more or less detectable mortalities (depending on their respective properties). This may facilitate further spread from wetland to wetland. Additional monitoring and systematic seasonal surveillance at selected wetland sites in Central Asia could prove to be a very useful means of forecasting avian influenza epidemics in Eurasia, the Middle East or Africa.

2. Recommendations
Countries located to the west and south of Tyva Republic; in particular, those that have been affected by clade 2.2 H5N1 HPAI in 2005-2006, and clade 2.3.2.1c virus in 2009-2010 and 2014-2015 should be on high alert for incursions of the virus. Likewise, passive surveillance should be intensified in these places through rising of local awareness about the importance of reporting sick or dead birds, both poultry and wild birds. These should be tested for avian influenza viruses. National authorities need to ensure the means for laboratory testing are in place to detect clade 2.3.4.4 viruses.

The OIE/FAO Network of Expertise on Animal Influenza (OFFLU) can advise on appropriate tests and protocols (see www.offlu.net). It is recommended that farmers and poultry producers enhance their biosecurity measures in order to prevent potential virus introduction from wild birds or their faeces".

The issue deserves the immediate attention of public health, animal health and environment protection agencies as well as wildlife protection agencies in Asia, Europe and Africa. - Mod.AS
