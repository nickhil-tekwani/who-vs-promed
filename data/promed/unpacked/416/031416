Following swine flu, another virus is threatening pigs in Switzerland. The
"Porcine circovirus" is on the increase. According to a report from the
University of Zurich, the number of diseased animals rose from 3 pigs in
2003 to 133 in 2006.

"Today, the disease is present in all Swiss pig farms," says Xaver Sidler,
veterinarian of the University of Zurich. The disease usually affects
piglets. Most animals survive the disease but don't grow thereafter; in
addition, they often suffer from diarrhea or cough, and gradually wither away.

The infection occurs primarily through direct contact of animals. Sidler,
however, suggested that where a lot of pigs are present, there is also the
possibility of airborne infection. But not all animals become ill from the
virus. Why the disease affects some pigs and not others is, according to
Sidler, still unclear. Some evidence points to a connection of the
management system (housing conditions). Health and vigour of piglets,
hygiene of the barn and the stable, size of the compartments, and the size
of the barn are decisive factors. "The larger the operation, the higher is
the risk," says Sidler.

The virus can cause serious symptoms. In some cases, there will be
intracutaneous bleeding, just under the skin of the animals, with deadly
consequences; up to 80 per cent of the affected animals die.

The pathogen is not new; it was described for the 1st time in 1974. In the
mid-1990s the virus caused a stir in France, Canada and the United States,
where pigs suddenly became seriously ill. Xaver Sidler and his team from
the veterinary hospital have now discovered that the virus has changed many
times and mutated from a rather innocent agent to a dangerous killer virus.

Circovirosis is the disease currently causing the most serious damage to
the pig industry. Globally, the damage caused by these viruses is massive.
The European Union expects financial losses between 560 to 900 million Euro
[USD 816 million to 1.3 billion] per year. Since about a year ago, a
vaccine is available, and the danger seems to be averted for now. But
Sidler warns: "The virus has rapidly changed, and it can be expected that
this process continues." His warning is not incidental, as it seems the
virus has already mutated in a way that it has been detected in cattle. "At
a veterinary conference this September [2009] in Krakow, the 1st dead
calves were reported. There is a probability they had been affected by the
circovirus" Sidler states.

[Circovirus as a possible cause of postweaning multisystemic wasting
syndrome (PMWS) in pigs in Switzerland was described in the past (See:
Staebler, Buergi, Litzenberger, et al. Schweiz Arch Tierheilkd 2004;
146(10): 461-8.). The novelty of the above findings is to be demonstrated.

The following text is the abstract of a review paper: Segales J, Allan GM,
Domingo M. Porcine circovirus diseases. Anim Health Res Rev 2005; 6(2): 119-42.

"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a member of the family _Circoviridae_,
a recently established virus family composed of small, non-enveloped
viruses, with a circular, single-stranded DNA genome. PCV2, which is found
all over the world in the domestic pig and probably the wild boar, has been
recently associated with a number of disease syndromes, which have been
collectively named porcine circovirus diseases (PCVD). Postweaning
multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy
syndrome (PDNS) and reproductive disorders are the most relevant ones.
Among them, only PMWS is considered to have a severe impact on domestic
swine production. PMWS mainly affects nursery and/or fattening pigs;
wasting is considered the most representative clinical sign in this
disease. Diagnosis of this disease is confirmed by histopathological
examination of lymphoid tissues and detection of a moderate to high amount
of PCV2 in damaged tissues. Since PMWS is considered a multifactorial
disease in which other factors in addition to PCV2 are needed in most cases
to trigger the clinical disease, effective control measures have focused on
the understanding of the co-factors involved in individual farms and the
control or elimination of these triggers. PCV2-associated reproductive
disease seems to occur very sporadically under field conditions, but it has
been characterized by late-term abortions and stillbirths, extensive
fibrosing and/or necrotizing myocarditis in fetuses and the presence of
moderate to high amounts of PCV2 in these lesions. Taking into account that
scientific information on PCV2 and its associated diseases has been
markedly expanded in the last 8 years, the objective of this review is to
summarize the current state of knowledge of the most relevant aspects of
PCV2 biology and PCVD."

A description of the recent Swiss findings, in particular the genotyping
and pathogenicity of the circovirus involved, is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
