Health officials in Kosovo said Monday the devastated post-war province is
suffering from an epidemic of tularemia, a potentially fatal disease spread
by rats.
So far 234 cases of the disease, never before seen in Kosovo, have been
recorded in 90 percent of the Yugoslav province but none have proved fatal.
The strain detected in Kosovo is "relatively mild" said Erik Schouten,
regional health adviser for the World Health Organization (WHO), but warned
people to take extra precautions such as boiling water, avoiding rabbit
meat and not touching dead rats.
It may also be spread by ticks, he said. International experts on the
disease are due to visit Kosovo to study its spread and means of combatting
it.
Isuf Dedushaj of the Epidemiology Department of Pristina's Institute of
Public Health said 16 new cases had been reported on Monday alone.
Most of the cases have been in villages using wells or springs as their
main source of drinking water and no international staff working for the
United Nations mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) or aid agencies had been infected,
UNMIK health official Hannu Vuori said.
Tularemia can cause high fever, body aches, swollen glands and difficulty
swallowing. It is easily treated with antibiotics, health officials said.

[Tularemia is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_ and is also
known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever. Tularemia can be transmitted by
aerosol, direct contact, ingestion or by arthropod vectors. This zoonotic
disease can be acquired by skin or mucous membrane contact with body fluids
or tissues form infected animals.
The bacterium is rapidly killed by heat and proper disinfection but
survives for weeks or months in a moist environment.
The most common source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite
of an infected tick, but persons who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild
game are at increased risk.
There are several forms of this disease; ulceroglandular which forms ulcers
on the skin; oculoglandular which involves the eyes, generally
unilaterally; pneumonic which involves the lungs and dry non-productive
cough; and typhoidal with gastrointestinal manifestations, fever and toxemia.
This pathogen is susceptible to a number of antibiotics, including
aminoglycosides, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Early treatment should
prevent mortality. Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick
infestations and rapid diagnosis and treatment. Recovery confers
long-lasting immunity.
It is noteworthy that ProMED-mail reported a smaller outbreak from the
Serbian villages in Soko Banja region during March of 1999. - Mods.TG and ES
