Abstract
--------
Background
Anthrax continues to be a disease of public health concern in Zimbabwe. Between December 2021 and February 2022, Tengwe [Hurungwe District], reported 36 cases of human anthrax. Gastrointestinal anthrax has the potential to cause serious outbreaks leading to loss of human life. We investigated the outbreak, and identified the risk factors using one health approach to inform outbreak control.

Materials and methods
We conducted a descriptive analysis of the outbreak and a 1:2 unmatched case-control study to identify risk factors for anthrax. A case was any Tengwe resident who developed an ulcer and/or abdominal symptoms and epidemiologically linked to a confirmed environmental exposure. Validated, structured interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect data from the cases and neighbourhood controls. Soil and dried meat samples were collected for laboratory investigations. District preparedness and response were assessed using a checklist. Data was analysed using Epi Info version 7.2.5. The odds of exposure were calculated for each risk factor examined. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent factors associated with contracting anthrax.

Results
Through active case finding we identified 36 cases, 31 were interviewed. Twenty-one (67.7%) were males. The median age was 33 years (Inter quartile range: 22-54). Nineteen (61.2%) cases presented with abdominal symptoms with zero deaths reported. The independent risk factor for contracting anthrax was eating undercooked meat (aOR = 12.2, 95% CI: 1.41-105.74, p = 0.023). All samples collected tested positive for anthrax. No livestock vaccinations or zoonotic meetings were being conducted prior to the outbreak. Notification of the outbreak was done 11 days after the index case presentation however one health response was instituted within 24 hours.

Conclusion
The anthrax was confirmed in Tengwe. Consumption of undercooked meat was associated with gastrointestinal anthrax. The timely one health response resulted in excellent outcomes. Using one health approach in managing zoonotic threats is encouraged.

Discussion
----------
Our investigation documented a cutaneous and gastrointestinal anthrax outbreak with no fatalities. The outbreak was associated with consuming infected meat in a new resettlement area in Hurungwe District, Zimbabwe. Notification of the outbreak was late however the One health response was instituted within 24 hours.

The outbreak occurred in an area where annual vaccinations by the veterinary department had stopped 4 years prior. It meant that the cattle herd was not protected from possible outbreaks. This is consistent with a study by Islam et al. where the absence of vaccinations was associated with an anthrax outbreak [16]. A routine vaccination policy is one of the better strategies for the prevention and control of anthrax [17]. After reporting the first animal death by the villagers, the veterinary extension officer performed a post-mortem, made a diagnosis of Theileriosis and people were assured that the meat was safe for consumption. This misdiagnosis was probably due to poor knowledge on anthrax signs as there were no previous animal cases in the area, consistent with a study by Swai et al. in 2010 [18].

We found out that more cases had gastrointestinal symptoms as compared to the cutaneous form. This is contrary to the studies that have shown that the cutaneous form is the most common form accounting for 95% of cases globally [5, 19]. After the notification of the first case, active case finding commenced. During this active search, healthcare workers had a high index of suspicion, and this might explain the higher number of gastrointestinal cases reported. These gastrointestinal cases were defined by their history of epidemiological linkage. Although the gastrointestinal form is usually associated with fatalities, the symptoms range from subclinical, mild, moderate to severe [20]. The index case whose diagnosis was initially missed had moderate symptoms however he was symptomatically well managed by aggressive fluid resuscitation. During this current outbreak, the early identification and treatment of the other GI cases might help explain the good patient comes, consistent with a study by Nakanwagi et al. in 2020 [21]. However, it is also possible that more than one pathogen has been involved in this outbreak.

The study came up with 4 statistically significant risk factors for contracting anthrax inclusive of, eating undercooked meat, belonging to a household with cattle deaths, assisting with skinning anthrax infected carcasses, and preparing infected meat. Like the findings of several studies with regard to religion, belonging to a religion with restrictive beliefs was protective, however, this was not statistically significant [22]. These restrictive religions did not allow the consumption of meat from animals that had died from unknown causes. Therefore, members of such religions were less likely to consume the infected meat. The position of most anthrax lesions was on the fingers and the face. The reasons are that the hands especially the fingers are mainly in contact with the infected products while the face is exposed during the consumption of probably undercooked meat.

The small sample was a limitation, and this could have reduced some of the measures of association. We did this study during the outbreak, and this affected the knowledge of the respondents as the health proportion activities were being carried out at the same time. Our other limitation was the inability to perform culture for our stool samples and molecular testing.

Low vaccination coverage of livestock and an initial low index of suspicion contributed to the outbreak and to the ongoing risk in the community. The timely response by both the human health and veterinary department contributed to excellent patient outcomes. Eating undercooked meat, skinning without personal protection, and having a history of dead cattle in the homestead were found to be risk factors for contracting anthrax.

We recommend the commencement of routine annual cattle vaccinations against anthrax by the Veterinary department. There is a need for the establishment of a zoonotic committee that meets regularly outside the outbreak periods for the prevention of future epidemics. We also recommend that both the human health and veterinary departments conduct on job training on anthrax for their workers. The health promotion department should continue with health education on anthrax in the whole district.

[Huruingwe District is in north central Mashonaland West Province, and its capital is Karoi; for a map of Zimbabwe, see: https://maps.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zimbabwe_physio-2002.jpg.

This is a lengthier posting than usual but this investigation was initiated during the series of outbreaks and concentrates more on the human cases than the background livestock cases. The latter was a result of the surveillance being weak and that livestock vaccination had ceased four years previously. When there is a risk of livestock anthrax, even if there have been no recent outbreaks, one must be alert to new cases, which might appear as just random sporadic animal deaths. Check them out! In this event, the first death was reported by the villagers but the cause was misdiagnosed. Livestock vaccination was restarted in this district.

That there were no human deaths reflects the care and attention given to new cases, suspended or real, as they appeared. Interestingly there were more gastroenteric than cutaneous cases. This could be from the slaughter and butchering being done by a limited number of people, not as we usually see it scattered from village to village. Also, the health service upped its participation and by making the physicians more aware of the changes being presented with other human cases. Plus public awareness of the real risk of infected meat availability to the public in the district.
