Finches, sparrows, and other species are being hit by the _Trichomonas gallinae_ infection that prevents them from eating and drinking. West Dublin and North County Dublin are among the areas hit by the outbreak.

BirdWatch Ireland spokesman Niall Hatch told the Herald: "The recent outbreak has been nasty in Co Kildare, where over 100 birds were found with the disease in just one garden.

"When it occurred in 2005, it was particularly virulent. A couple of very cold winters froze the ground water which stopped it. But following the wet summer last year [2012], the ground has been very moist which encouraged the disease to spread," he said.

The numbers of sick birds has been increasing this winter. Greenfinches have been hardest hit by the disease.

Birdwatch Ireland said there is no cure but it is not fatal in all cases and some birds may recover. It is not harmful to humans.

Birds suffering from the disease appear lethargic and will sit in one spot for long periods. To prevent the spread of the disease, people are advised to regularly clean bird feeders and baths, and to let them air dry.

[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (Columbiformes), which principally infects the upper alimentary tract where it can cause necrotic ingluvitis. Epidemic mortality in columbiform species has been previously reported, and the parasite infrequently infects other avian taxa such as birds of prey and songbirds. Trichomoniasis has been postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the passenger pigeon _Ectopistes migratorius_ and has been shown to be a significant cause of nestling mortality in the island-endemic pink pigeon _Nesoenas mayeri_ and in the Iberian Peninsula population of the Bonelli's eagle, _Hieraaetus fasciatus_.
