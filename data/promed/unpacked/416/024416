A total of 102 persons, including 30 women and 40 children, were taken ill after drinking water found poisoned with pesticide in an overhead tank at Therkku Melakottai near Tiruvarankulam [Tamil Nadu State] on Saturday [16 Aug 2014].

The residents, who complained of giddiness and nausea, were admitted to the Dr Muthulakshmi Reddy Memorial Government Headquarters Hospital in Pudukottai. Their condition was stable, doctors said.

The problem started after water was supplied from the 30 000 litre tank in the morning. As the water was discoloured, village panchayat [local self-governments at village or small town level] workers climbed up the tank and saw a clump of some pesticide, believed to be copper sulfate, in the water.

They asked the villagers not to drink the water and alerted the 108 ambulance service at Tirumayam and Pudukottai. Medical and paramedical personnel were camping in the village, said Syed Mohideen, Joint Director of Health (in charge).

Village panchayat secretary Arun Kumar lodged a complaint with the Alangudi police, alleging that some persons had dropped the pesticide in the tank with an ulterior motive. Police sources said there had been no enmity in the village in the recent past.

Block Development Officer K Poyyamozhi said the tank, which supplies water to 250 houses (150 on South Street in the morning and 100 on North Street in the evening), was cleaned. Supply would resume after tests on Sunday [17 Aug 2014], he said.

Health Minister C Vijayabaskar; Adi Dravida Welfare Minister N Subramanian; and Director of Public Health Kuzhandaivel visited the villagers at the hospital.

[The only clinical signs reported are nausea and giddiness. Those 2 clinical signs do not sound like a pesticide. However, nicotine has been used as a pesticide and there is a liquid form of nicotine. Nicotine is a stimulant and may cause some excitement, but I am not sure it could be described as giddiness. However, it could very well cause nausea.

However, it would have had to be a lot of it as the water will dilute it and therefore clinical signs may be less.

With only those 2 clinical signs, nausea and giddiness, there is not much to go on to make a potential case for any type of poison. And, of course, if the news was spreading that someone saw someone throw something in the water supply, then perhaps the signs are psychosomatic on the power of suggestion?

Copper sulfate is mentioned in the article. While the nausea remains a sign associated with copper sulfate, there are numerous other clinical signs, of which giddiness is not noted. Furthermore, copper sulfate may be used in some water sources as an algaecide, an herbicide in irrigation and municipal water treatment systems, but the amount used, especially in municipal water systems, is minor. It would still take a very large dose of copper sulfate to poison a water source.

Copper sulfate is a fungicide used to control bacterial and fungal diseases of fruit, vegetable, nut and field crops. Some of the diseases that are controlled by this fungicide include mildew, leaf spots, blights and apple scab. It is used in combination with lime and water as a protective fungicide, referred to as Bordeaux mixture, for leaf application and seed treatment. It is also used as an algaecide, an herbicide in irrigation and municipal water treatment systems, and as a molluscicide, a material used to repel and kill slugs and snails. Copper sulfate is a naturally occurring inorganic salt and copper is an essential trace element in plant and animal nutrition (2, 3, 4, 7, 8). It is available in the following formulations: dusts, wettable powders, and fluid concentrates (9).

Copper is one of 26 essential trace elements occurring naturally in plant and animal tissue. The usual routes by which humans receive toxic exposure to copper sulfate are through skin or eye contact, as well as by inhalation of powders and dusts (8). Copper sulfate is a strong irritant (10).

Copper sulfate is only moderately toxic upon acute oral exposure (9). There have been reports of human suicide resulting from the ingestion of gram quantities of this material (6). The lowest dose of copper sulfate that has been toxic when ingested by humans is 11 mg/kg (5). Ingestion of copper sulfate is often not toxic because vomiting is automatically triggered by its irritating effect on the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms are severe, however, if copper sulfate is retained in the stomach, as in the unconscious victim. Some of the signs of poisoning which occurred after 1-12 grams of copper sulfate was swallowed include a metallic taste in the mouth, burning pain in the chest and abdomen, intense nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, sweating, shock, discontinued urination leading to yellowing of the skin. Injury to the brain, liver, kidneys and stomach and intestinal linings may also occur in copper sulfate poisoning (1).

Copper sulfate can be corrosive to the skin and eyes. It is readily absorbed through the skin and can produce a burning pain, along with the same severe symptoms of poisoning from ingestion. Skin contact may result in itching or eczema (7). It is considered a skin sensitizer and can cause allergic reactions in some individuals (8). Eye contact with this material can cause: conjunctivitis, inflammation of the eyelid lining, excess fluid buildup in the eyelid; cornea tissue deterioration due to breaks, or ulceration, in the eye's mucous membrane; and clouding of the cornea (1).
