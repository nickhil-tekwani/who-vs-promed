The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has quarantined more than
2 dozen farms in Alberta and British Columbia after a case of bovine
tuberculosis was discovered on a B.C. ranch, the Prince George Citizen reports.

Approximately 420 cattle that had been in contact with the infected
bull will have to be put down, CFIA senior veterinarian Maria
Koller-Jones said. 22 farms in Alberta and 6 in B.C. are currently
under investigation.

If any animals on a quarantined farms are found to be carrying the
disease, the entire heard will have to be destroyed, Ms. Koller-Jones
said. "Hopefully, a lot of these farms will find that they've dodged
a bullet, so to speak."

It is unlikely a person eating meat of an animal infected with bovine
tuberculosis could become infected, according to the CFIA website.

The disease can be transmitted from cattle to other farm animals,
bison, and all of the deer species under certain conditions.

Sick animals may show weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss and a
fluctuating fever. Suspicious lesions can be found in organs or body
cavities of diseased animals.

Beef industry experts said that, although serious, discoveries of
tuberculosis in cattle aren't cause for alarm among ranchers or consumers.

"It springs up every once in a while with contact between animals,
but it's highly controllable, and we just don't see it very often
anymore," said Don Curtice, formerly with Alberta Beef Producers and
Canadian Cattlemen's Association.

Mr. Curtice said the greatest challenge with bovine tuberculosis
remains limiting contact with wild deer, elk and buffalo, which can
pass the disease on to cows.

"The government comes in and basically isolates the cattle or has
them slaughtered if it's domestic, but wildlife, they don't even want
to touch them, which is a real sore spot in the cattle industry," he said.

Curtice said cattle can be vaccinated for the disease, though such a
measure is not mandatory. Government regulations dictate that cattle
in areas where bovine tuberculosis has been detected must be
vaccinated for several years following an outbreak, he added.

"It's always a concern, but it's certainly not in the category of BSE
(or mad-cow disease)," said Neil Jahnke, past president of the
Canadian Cattlemen's Association.

"Canada is deemed TB-free, and if we have a case now, you can have 2
or 3 before it becomes a major issue. 30, 40, 50 years ago, it was
quite a concern in Western Canada."

article. - Mod.TG]

The discovery of bovine tuberculosis in a bull will force the
slaughter of 470 cattle and has quarantined almost 30 farms in B.C.
and Alberta.

The bovine TB was discovered when the bull was slaughtered in August
2007 in Quebec.

Canadian Food Inspection Agency senior veterinarian Maria
Koller-Jones says the bull was from a farm in the Vanderhoof, B.C. area.

She says the farmer was down sizing and sent about 400 head of cattle
to a market in Innisfail, Alta., where they were dispersed to about
20 other farms in Alberta.

Koller-Jones says while it's unlikely those animals have been
infected, because they had contact with the bull, they must be
slaughtered and tested before the quarantines on the farms can be lifted.

The last case of tuberculosis found in Canadian cattle was in 2004,
and Koller-Jones says there will be no cause for concern for cattle
exports, because the problem is so rare that Canada is still
considered to be bovine TB free.

[The United States and Canada are alike in many animal and food
safety regulations. It is unlikely that an animal found to have
TB-suspicious lesions would have been passed into the food chain.

I am sure the officials will be making a concentrated effort of
tracing all cattle that have had contact with the index animal. They
will be testing all the herds of the contact animals.

Hopefully, they will provide us with a full report when their
investigation is completed. - Mod.TG]
