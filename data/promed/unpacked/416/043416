Ukraine suspects a new outbreak of bird flu in the Crimean peninsula, a
regional official was quoted as saying on Thursday [5 Jan 2006].
Mykola Kolesnichenko, head of the emergency commission of the Crimean
government, told the 5th television channel that poultry were found dead on
a farm in Solnechnoe village in Crimea. He said officials suspected bird
flu but would wait for laboratory tests for confirmation.
Ukraine reported its 1st outbreak of bird flu in a dozen villages in
Crimea, a major stopover point for migratory birds, in late November
[2005]. Tests from laboratories in Russia and Britain showed it was the
deadly H5N1 strain.
Since then more than 62 000 birds have been destroyed in house-to-house
checks in about 30 villages across the Crimean peninsula. Officials
declared the bird flu outbreak over and lifted the state of emergency at
the end of December 2005.
