Florida state health officials reported one additional case/death due to _Vibrio vulnificus_, according to data published on [Fri 22 Oct 2021].

The latest case/death is reported from Levy County in north-central Florida on the Gulf Coast. This brings the state's death total to 9 in 2021-Manatee (2), Duval, Escambia, Lee, Leon, Levy, Orange and Polk counties. It is also the 31st case through [Fri 22 Oct 2021] - Brevard, Charlotte, Clay, Duval, Escambia (3), Franklin, Hernando, Hillsborough (2), Lee (5), Leon, Levy, Manatee (2), Orange, Palm Beach, Polk (3), Santa Rosa (2), Seminole, Taylor and Volusia (2).

_Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to warm seawater containing the bacteria. Ingestion of _Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. _Vibrio vulnificus_ can also cause an infection of the skin when open wounds are exposed to warm seawater; these infections may lead to skin breakdown and ulcers.

Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however, _Vibrio_ vulnificus infections can be a serious concern for people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease. The bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock) and blistering skin lesions. _Vibrio vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50% of the time. A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop _Vibrio vulnificus_ bloodstream infections than healthy people.

[The following is extracted (and abridged) from the "Bad Bug Book," 1st edition, Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), at https://bit.ly/3Cohttr:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and increased dissolved organics."

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with seawater harboring the organism or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc. followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The 'primary septicemia' form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease [The organism can also enter through damaged skin. - Mod.LL]. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions" (shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: (1) Vibrios are normal flora in warm salt water (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (2) most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
