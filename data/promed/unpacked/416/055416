Authorities say a hot tub display at an East Texas state fair in September [2019] is the likely source of contamination which led to a legionnaires' disease outbreak that killed one person and sickened 7 others. Officials in Tyler have closed the convention center where the state fair took place. The Tyler Morning Telegraph reports officials plan to remediate the convention center's plumbing system.

This is the 2nd outbreak linked to a state fair in the USA this year [2019]. Officials in North Carolina say 4 people have died and nearly 100 were hospitalized after contamination also linked to a hot tub display at a September state fair [ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (26): (NC) fatal, agricultural fair, hot tub display susp. 20191021.6737887].

Legionnaires' [disease] is a flulike illness contracted when infected water vapor is inhaled. The elderly and people with weakened immune systems can be particularly susceptible.

[East Texas State Fair was held in the city of Tyler, Texas, 20-29 Sep 2019 (https://www.etstatefair.com). It brings an estimated economic impact of USD 9.8 million to the City of Tyler and Smith County, with over 250 000 visitors who come to the fair each year, including local families, concertgoers, exhibitors, vendors, contest participants, school groups, entertainers, workers, sponsors, and volunteers (https://www.etstatefair.com/p/about/community-impact). A map of the fairgrounds can be found at https://www.etstatefair.com/p/about/visitor-info/fairgrounds-map.

Tyler, with a population of about 100 000 residents in 2017, is the county seat of Smith County, located in east-central Texas, USA, 100 miles (160 km) east-southeast of Dallas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_Texas). A map showing the location of Tyler can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tyler,+TX.

The news report above fails to say how the 8 cases of legionnaires' disease were identified as a cluster with a common source or how the fair's hot tub display was confirmed as the source for this cluster; however, genotyping clinical and environmental isolates of legionella, the Gram-negative bacillus that causes legionnaires' disease, is usually used to identify clusters of cases with a common source and to identify the source responsible for infection in these clusters when the genotypes match.

Legionella is found naturally in a building's freshwater supply in low amounts that do not cause disease, but can contaminate hot tubs and spas that are not properly cleaned and disinfected (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/downloads/toolkit.pdf). The warm water of a hot tub, between 77 deg F (25 deg C) and 108 deg F (42 deg C), can provide the ideal environment for these bacteria to thrive. Vulnerable people can become infected when they breathe in the bacteria that have been aerosolized during the normal operation of the hot tub. People do not necessarily have to be in the hot tub to develop legionnaires' disease; legionnaires' disease can be caught by just standing or passing nearby. - Mod.ML
