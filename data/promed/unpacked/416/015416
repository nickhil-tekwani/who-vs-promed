Deaths in Sindhuli not due to diarrhea
--------------------------------------
The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has on Sunday [9 Aug 2009]
asserted that 5 deaths in Kalpabriksha and Kyaneshwar [Sindhuli district]
VDCs [village development committees] were not caused by diarrhea [that is,
associated with an outbreak of cholera] as was reported by certain sections
of the media.

"These deaths in the last couple of days are due to an as yet to be
identified disease that causes very high fever, severe headache, difficulty
in breathing, and bleeding from the mouth and nose and discharge of blood
in cough, and not due to diarrhea," acting director of the Epidemiology and
Disease Control Division Dr Bishwa Raj Khanal said quoting his district
officers.

Dr Khanal said a team from the district headquarters reached the area on
Saturday [8 Aug 2009] and confirmed that the deaths were not caused by
diarrhea. "We have sent a team (by road) from Kathmandu this morning [to
carry out] laboratory tests to diagnose the disease which looks like
Japanese encephalitis, dengue, malaria, or leptospirosis," Dr Khanal said.

Another team also flew to the area late in the afternoon to control the
situation while the health ministry has also requested the World Health
Organization (WHO) to send its surveillance medical officer based in
Janakpur to Sindhuli.

[According to the same report, the Epidemiology and Disease Control
Division has stated that a contemporaneous outbreak of cholera in Nepal is
gradually coming under control. The official death toll in this outbreak is
put at 256 with 144 in Jajarkot, 43 in Rukum, 14 in Dailekh, 13 in Achham,
9 each in Baitadi and Surkhet, 4 in Rolpa, 3 each in Dolpa, Salyan,
Dadeldhura, Bajura, and Bajhang, 2 each in Doti and Pyuthan, and one in
Kanchanpur.

The 5 deaths in Sindhuli district are attributed to an outbreak of a
different disease. The symptoms of the disease are not well enough
described to suggest an etiology with confidence, but a hemorrhagic fever
is a possibility. Further information is requested.
