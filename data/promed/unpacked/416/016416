Chagas disease may be a threat in South Texas
---------------------------------------------
Chagas disease, a tropical parasitic disease that can lead to
life-threatening heart and digestive disorders, may be more widespread
in Texas than previously thought, according to research from The
University of Texas at Austin.

"We've been studying this for 4 years now, and this year [2011] the
number of disease-causing insects is quite amazing," says Sahotra
Sarkar, professor of integrative biology and philosophy at The
University of Texas at Austin and lead author of a paper on the
disease published in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases.

Endemic to rural areas of Latin America, Chagas disease is often
transmitted by triatomine bugs, also known as "kissing bugs". In order
to assess the prevalence of Chagas disease in Texas, Sarkar is working
with a network of health professionals and researchers around the
state.

After collecting and classifying insects from the field, Sarkar sends
them to Philip Williamson, an assistant professor at The University of
North Texas Health Science Center. Williamson determines how many of
the bugs carry the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, which causes the
disease.

>From the data Sarkar creates epidemiological maps showing the number
and location of carrier insects, recorded human Chagas infections and
hospitable habitats for the insects.

The maps suggest South Texas is an area of high risk for Chagas
infection. [The article includes a composite risk map for Chagas
disease in Texas. According to Sarkar's analysis 11 counties are at
particular risk: Bee, Bexar, Brooks, Cameron, DeWitt, Goliad, Hidalgo,
Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kleberg, and Nueces.] Sarkar says there may already
be hundreds of undiagnosed cases of the disease.

Chagas can be hard to detect because it can look like the flu at
first, with symptoms similar to pains and fever. The symptoms appear
to go away but the disease can live in a person for decades, sometimes
reappearing in the form of digestive or heart failure.

In Texas, where most doctors are not familiar with the disease and are
not required to report it to public health officials, they may
misinterpret its late-onset symptoms as an old age problem, says
Sarkar. "So it doesn't get diagnosed at the beginning, and it doesn't
get diagnosed at the end," he says.

Until further research is done, Sarkar and his colleagues won't be
able to say for sure how widespread the disease is. They believe the
risks are high enough, however, to recommend a few low-cost,
low-impact changes to the way the Texas public health system deals
with Chagas.

They say Chagas should be designated as a reportable disease, which
would require health professionals to report incidences of it to the
Texas Department of State Health Services. Efforts should be launched
in South Texas to more thoroughly determine the prevalence of Chagas
in humans, dogs, and wild species (particularly rats) that often act
as reservoirs of the disease. And there should be mandatory screening
of blood donations for the presence of Chagas. Currently, screening is
voluntary and only done with about 65 per cent of samples.

In the future, Sarkar would like to see Mexico and the US collaborate
on a multi-layered attack on the disease. He points to the success of
the Southern Cone Initiative in South America as a model. Simple
changes in lifestyle, such as keeping piles of wood away from the home
and encouraging people to switch from adobe or wooden houses to
concrete, have been effective. Selective spraying for the insects has
also been key to decreasing the burden of the disease in South
America.

[The article refers to a paper published in 2010 (Sarkar S et al:
Chagas disease risk in Texas. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2010; 4(10). pii:
e836; available at
http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000836).

The weakness of the study is the use of historical records to estimate
the rate of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ infection in the triatomine vectors.
The finding of _T. cruzi_ in triatomine bugs is not equivalent to risk
of infection to humans. Triatomine bugs live in cracks and crevices in
mud plaster walls, and thus the risk of infection is related to poor
living conditions. Few people in Texas live in houses with mud plaster
walls, and thus the distribution of the vector and the parasite may
not indicate a high risk to humans if they do not come in contact with
the triatomine bug.

Serosurveys in the areas identified by the study as potential high
risk areas could help answer that question. We agree that
autochthonous acquired Chagas should be a notifiable infection.
