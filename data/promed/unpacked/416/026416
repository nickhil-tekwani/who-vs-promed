Mountain lion, cow latest rabies victims in eastern El Paso County
------------------------------------------------------------------
Back-to-back cases of a rabid mountain lion and a cow in eastern El Paso
County have provided the latest evidence of the fatal disease's sudden
resurgence in the area in recent months.

The animals were euthanized late last week [week of 21 Sep 2009] after
displaying bizarre behavior, and their positive tests for rabies were
announced Monday [28 Sep 2009]. The cases come just 2 weeks after a rabid
horse was euthanized in the Black Forest area, and Colorado's top
veterinarian says northern and eastern El Paso County appear to be among
the worst places for rabies statewide. "This area around Calhan and Peyton
seems to be rather interesting right now," said Keith Roehr.

It's not clear how the lion and cow were infected, but health officials
speculate the cases are tied to skunk rabies, which recently surfaced in El
Paso County for the 1st time since 1970. Since then, 8 skunks have tested
positive, most in the north and eastern parts of the county.

The mountain lion attacked a man's pet dog about 2:30 pm Thursday [24 Sep
2009] in the Peyton area, said Michael Seraphin, a spokesman with the
Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW). The man kicked the lion, which at
first did not let go but eventually retreated to the man's garage. The man
trapped it in the garage until DOW officers arrived. DOW tranquilized the
lion and decided to submit it for rabies testing, because the daytime
attack, the lion's location, and its response to the man were all unusual.
The results came back positive Monday evening [28 Sep 2009]. It was not
known Monday whether the dog was current on its rabies vaccine. [To test
the lion for rabies, the animal was dead and its head and brain submitted
for testing. - Mod.TG]

On Friday [25 Sep 2009], a rabid cow in the Calhan area was euthanized.
Veterinarian Robert DeAngelo examined the cow, which was standing on its
back legs only and had a look in its eyes "like nobody's home," DeAngelo
said. He got the cow to stand and it wobbled, another tell tale sign of
rabies. DeAngelo, his veterinary technician, and the cow's owner were all
exposed to the virus from the cow and are getting treated. DeAngelo
received 7 injections Saturday [26 Sep 2009] and must undergo one injection
a week for the next month [see
<http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/postexposure.html> for CDC's guidance
on post exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.SH].

Veterinarians and health officials are urging people to vaccinate their
pets, and in many cases their livestock. Although livestock in Colorado is
not traditionally at risk of rabies, the cow and horse are evidence that's
changing. Roehr said skunks tend to reside near outbuildings, so animals on
the open plains are at as great of a risk as those on ranchettes or closer
to neighborhoods and buildings.

DeAngelo also warned livestock owners against buying vaccine from supply
stores and doing it themselves. Without a veterinarian's supervision,
there's no way to know whether it was done properly or if the animal is
adequately protected.

Although confirmed cases are generally occurring in the same parts of the
county, health officials are working under an assumption that the disease
could be anywhere, and they say the public should do the same. "You have to
assume it's in the whole county and not just these isolated areas," said
Shannon Rowe, communicable disease program manager for the El Paso County
Department of Health and Environment.

Rabies prevention
-----------------
a. get pets, horses, and other high-value livestock vaccinated;
b. don't feed wild animals or allow your pets around them. Make sure
children stay away from wild animals;
c. contact the vet if a pet is bitten or scratched by a wild animal;
d. call a doctor immediately if you suspect you've been exposed to rabies;
e. stay away from an animal exhibiting bizarre behavior, such as a
nocturnal animal like a skunk wandering about during the day;
f. if you must remove a dead skunk on your property, wear rubber gloves or
lift the carcass with a shovel or other tool, and double-bag it for the trash.

[If the virus was typed, it would tell us what strain of rabies these
animals had. It would also give the DOW insight into what animal and strain
is causing the problem. While skunk strain may be found in raccoons, it is
not nearly as likely as skunk strain in skunks.

Also, the cow exposed a number of people. Rabies in cattle mimics so many
diseases that generally many people are exposed before rabies percolates to
the top of the differential list. It is an excellent reason why even cattle
need to be vaccinated against rabies.

Post exposure prophylaxis can be given shortly after exposure to rabies and
prevent the disease in the exposed person. It is a series of shots but they
are administered in the muscle of the arm or buttocks, not the stomach as
the old rumor had it.
