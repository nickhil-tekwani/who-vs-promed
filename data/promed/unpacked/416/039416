Following is a message from Dr. J. Foianini at Santa Cruz. I received it
this morning.

Today I called Dr Fernando Gil of the YF program and reviewed the situation
of the current epidemic (we had a recent four day holiday).
The total number of cases is 29 (confirmed), three new cases are being
investigated. Total number of deaths is 10 not 21. Postrervalle and Cabezas
have been controlled. San Ignacio and Santa Ana still under study. Diagnosis
of the virus is being made by IgM-ELISA, some cases have been identified by
PCR isolation, others by cell culture (genome being evaluated at University
of Texas by Dr.Allan Barrett) and liver studies at necropsy.

The following is information I received from Dr Chiaki Miyoshi, Project
Coordinator, The Health and Medical Care Delivery System in Santa Cruz, a
JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) -supported bilateral
cooperation in Bolivia. As he was going back to Japan attending meeting, it
[has taken time to get his approval and [so this news is not so recent.
He reports on the situation of Yellow Fever outbreak in Santa Cruz. Reports
on
the Yellow Fever outbreak are also available in Japanese and Spanish.

The situation as of Feb 12 is as follows;
Yellow fever is a really serious problem here.
According to the local newspapers, 33 cases of Yellow Fever have been
registered, and 10 of these have died. All cases were from the Department of
Santa Cruz. The Santa Cruz Health Authority announced an emergency yellow
fever
control programme. In this report, 53 cases were registered and 23 cases
died in 1999 (13 cases were confirmed yellow fever.)
In Hospital Japones to date, 8 cases have been referred from provincial
areas
and 5 have died. Among these 5 deaths, 3 were confirmed both serologically
and
pathologically to have Yellow Fever. Another 2 cases are now under
examination.
The Brazilian Government donated 200,000 doses of vaccines. Paraguay and
Peru also donated vaccines, bringing the total to around 250,000 doses
available. Mass vaccination is now underway in both Santa Cruz city and in
provincial areas.
I have sent 3 reports in Japanese to JICA as well as to AMDA (A Japanese
NGO, and
its Bolivian branch is located here in Santa Cruz). According to JICA
information, the Embassy of Japan is considering providing an urgent
donation of Yellow Fever vaccine.
There is now just one case in our hospital, which perhaps indicates that the
outbreak is diminishing. However, other information indicates that there
are Yellow Fever cases in border areas of Brazil. Therefore, all people
living in border areas in Bolivia must be vaccinated.
Coverage of yellow fever vaccination is reported as being 51% in Bolivia and
in order to bring that up to 80%, it is estimated that more 500,000 doses
are needed.
