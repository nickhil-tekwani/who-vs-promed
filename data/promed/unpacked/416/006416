The Danish Veterinary and Foods Board has found the multi-resistant
_Salmonella_ DT104 bacterium among samples from a shipment of frozen guinea
fowl from France. The tests were carried out on October 8. The meat,
originating from the French company Sofral was imported by Tannis Food A/S
in Hirtshals and sold on to restaurants and retail outlets.

[_Salmonella typhimurium_ DT104 is typically resistant to multiple
antibiotics including quinolones. The strain may be increasing in
prevalence worldwide (see ProMED-mail references cited above). (For the
USA, Glynn et al. have published definitive evidence for a large increase
in the prevalence of the DT104 strain during the past two decades. See N.
Engl. J. Med. 338:1333-38, 1998 - Mod.PHA). Infectious can be particularly
problematic for the elderly and immunocompromised. The last ProMED-mail
report from Denmark identified a Danish slaughterhouse as the source. This
isolate is from France. Thanks to Paul H. Axelsen of the University of
Pennsylvania for commenting on this posting. - Mod.ES
