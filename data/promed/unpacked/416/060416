In Oct 1997, a case of _S. suis_ type 2 meningitis in a 30-
year-old male butcher was notified. 30 days later a new case was
reported, a 22-year-old male who works in an slaughterhouse. Both
from different towns of the same county (Castellon, Spain).
The patients were treated with ceftriaxone and other antibiotics.
They recovered, however both developed a mild neurosensorial
hypoacousia.
Three pig farms were linked with the cases, and were investigated
looking for the origin of the disease. 274 pig tonsils were submitted
to the laboratory. 22 from one farm and 2 from another were
positive for _Streptococcus suis_ type 2 group R phenotype
MRP+EF+, the strain [that was isolated from the patients' CSF
[cerebro-spinal fluid.
Preventive measures were implemented when handling pig tonsils
(use of gloves, health education). No more cases were reported.
Illness was initialy diagnosed as pneumococcal meningitis in the
first case. When there are risk factors, such as occupational, in
previously healthy people, _S. suis_ has to be considered.

14, whereas these & the Canadian case were type 2 - Mod.JW
