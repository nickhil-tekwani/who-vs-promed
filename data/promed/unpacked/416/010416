A Drexel University student who died from bacterial meningitis was killed by the same strain that infected 8 students at Princeton University, federal health officials said Tuesday [18 Mar 2014].

[The student], 19, died earlier this month [March 2014] after being infected with [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup] B, a rare bacterial infection. The outbreak at Princeton prompted a vaccination campaign at the school using an unlicensed, imported vaccine because the usual meningitis vaccine [available in the United States] doesn't protect against it.

"CDC's laboratory analysis shows that the strain in Princeton University's serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak matches the strain in the Drexel University case by 'genetic fingerprinting'," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. "This information suggests that the outbreak strain may still be present in the Princeton University community and we need to be vigilant for additional cases."

CDC's Dr Thomas Clark says the case doesn't represent a new outbreak at Drexel. [The Drexel student] had been in contact with students from Princeton, which is about 45 minutes away.

CDC and state health officials have been tracking everyone in close contact with [the Drexel student]. "That investigation did identify some Princeton students as close contacts and they were given antibiotics," Clark told NBC News. "The fact that the strain matches means that they are most likely [the] source (of infection)," he added.

CDC has vaccinated more than 5000 Princeton students against [_N. meningitidis_ serogroup] B using a vaccine in wide use in Europe called Bexsero. Its maker, Novartis, plans to apply for a license to use Bexsero in the United States. Bexsero was also used in an unrelated outbreak of meningitis B at the University of California Santa Barbara [last fall 2013].

Most of the Princeton students [the Drexel student] had been in contact with had been vaccinated against the [serogroup B] strain. Clark says it's possible people can be vaccinated and be protected themselves, while still able to spread the bacteria to others. "We just don't know," he said. Clark said there are no plans for vaccinations at Drexel. "Right now it's one case and it doesn't tell us there is going to be an outbreak," Clark said.

But the case shows that college students in particular need to be careful. Meningitis isn't particularly easy to catch, but kissing and other close contact are good ways to spread it. Meningitis can kill very quickly and unexpectedly and students with symptoms such as high fever, stiff neck, or a rash need to seek immediate medical attention.

About 500 cases of bacterial meningitis are reported in the US each year, with more than a third caused by [serogroup] B. About one in 10 people who get sick die and 20 percent are permanently disabled.

[The news report above says that there is an epidemiologic link between the Drexel student and the Princeton meningococcal meningitis outbreak, which is supported by matching genotypes for the Princeton and Drexel meningococcal strains. The Drexel student had contact with students from Princeton and this contact occurred relatively recently, after the Princeton students had been vaccinated with the Bexsero serogroup B vaccine.

The 1st dose of the serogroup B vaccine was given to 5268 Princeton individuals, which represented 91 percent of the approximately 5800 University community members who were said to be eligible to receive the vaccine, between 9 and 12 Dec 2013 (http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S38/68/80C91/index.xml) and by mid-February 2014, 95 percent of the approximately 5800 eligible individuals received the 1st dose of the vaccine. Full immunity requires a 2nd dose of the vaccine and 4709 individuals received the 2nd dose by 20 Feb 2014 (http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S39/26/72G66/index.xml).

_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days, but can range between 2 and 10 days.

The protein conjugate meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines (unlike Bexsero, which is based upon meningococcal protein antigens) have been found to induce a higher and more sustainable immune response and reduce the rate of nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci and thus its transmission. Bexsero is the only broad coverage serogroup B vaccine; it has been approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia to help protect against invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. Its effect on nasopharyngeal carriage rate is not known.
