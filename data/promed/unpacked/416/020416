Officials with the United Nations (UN) confirmed that the cholera epidemic
in Haiti has spread from the countryside of the tiny island nation to its
capital of Port-Au-Prince, a development that could affect millions.
According to Emmanuella Schneider, a spokesperson for the UN Office for
Humanitarian Aid in Haiti, one person has died because of cholera in the
Port-Au-Prince neighborhood of Cite Soleil, with at least 115 suspected
cases overall in the city. Across Haiti, there are at least 9123 people
hospitalized and 583 deaths, caused by the waterborne disease. Officials
expect the numbers to climb.

During a press briefing in Washington DC on Tuesday [9 Nov 2010], Dr Jon
Arbus, the deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO),
said that he expected an "upsurge" of cases because of the effects of
Hurricane Tomas that neared the country last week. "The flooding and
mudslides from last week's hurricane pushed rivers over their banks, very
likely spreading cholera even further. We have every reason to expect that
the widespread flooding has increased the risk of cholera spreading," Arbus
said. "The conditions are ripe."

PAHO, an arm of the World Health Organization, is also preparing to
encounter cholera for the long term in the impoverished nation. Arbus
emphasized that the disease has established itself with a strong "foothold"
in Haiti's water systems, and that the overall collective battle with the
disease could take years.

[2] Possible Dominican Republic spread

In the south of the Dominican Republic, a man with all the symptoms of
cholera has been admitted to a hospital. If this case is confirmed, this
would be the 1st official case of cholera in the Dominican Republic.

The patient, 43 years old, is currently being treated in the regional and
university hospital of Barahona. According to reports, he is a businessman
who had just returned from Haiti. This patient is the 3rd suspected to be
observed in the Dominican Republic.

In late October 2010, Dr Loida Gonzalez, of the National laboratory Doctor
Defillo confirmed having received 2 samples of suspected cases from Moca
and Santiago, in the north of the Dominican Republic. She then explained
that the review process took 4 days and that the results would be
communicated at the end of this period. 8 days later the Dominican
authorities have still not reported on the results of these 2 cases.

A cholera epidemic would have a catastrophic effect on tourism in the
Dominican Republic. More than 3 million passengers each year choose this
destination. Tourism in the Dominican Republic represents 12 per cent of
gross domestic product.

a more developed sewage system and less flooding from Tomas, the effects of
cholera in DR may be diminished. - Mod.LL
