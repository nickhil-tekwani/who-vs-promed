The Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) has confirmed rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) in a feral domestic rabbit found dead in Milwaukie, a suburb of Portland [Oregon].

RHDV2 is a viral disease, causing sudden death in rabbits. The virus is highly contagious among rabbit populations and can spread through contact with infected rabbits, meat, fur, or materials coming into contact with them. RHDV2 poses no human health risk. The virus only infects rabbits.

On [14 Mar 2021], the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) received a report from a veterinarian in Portland that 8 domestic or feral rabbits were found dead in Milwaukie. Dr Ryan Scholz, Oregon's State Veterinarian, was immediately notified and had one of the rabbit carcasses delivered to Oregon State University for further testing. On [24 Mar 2021], the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the rabbit tested positive for RHDV2.

"At this point, we are confident all 8 of the rabbits died from RHDV2, and the virus has taken hold in the feral rabbit population," said Dr Scholz.

To prevent the virus from spreading further into the domestic rabbit population, the state will be collecting and testing feral rabbits in the vicinity where the 8 deceased rabbits were found.

ODFW is concerned about this disease spreading to wild rabbits such as cottontails because infections in other states have caused high mortality in wild rabbits and hares. Wild rabbits and hares have an important role in the ecosystem.

ODA and ODFW are asking the public to report rabbit mortalities to track the virus's presence and movement. Please call 1-800-347-7028 or visit https://oda.direct/RHD to report domestic or wild rabbits which are suspected to have died from RHDV2. Domestic rabbit owners should contact their veterinarian for more information on preventing RHDV2.

How can I prevent the spread of RHDV2?
- Wash and disinfect hands, clothing, gloves, footwear, cages, and equipment between rabbits from different sources.
- Quarantine new rabbits away from existing ones for 30 days.
- Keep pet rabbits inside to avoid exposure to environments potentially contaminated by wild/feral rabbits or by people, vehicles, or implements that can spread the disease.
- Immediately contact ODA (800-347-7028) if you suspect RHD or have sick or freshly dead rabbits.
- If you have animals not freshly dead, double plastic bag them and dispose of them in a landfill.

The United States Department of Agriculture Veterinary Services has confirmed a domestic rabbit in northeast Arkansas was tested for rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV-2) with a positive test result. Additional histopathology test results are still pending.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHDV-2) does not infect humans or other animals, including dogs and cats. RHDV-2 is highly contagious and affects both domestic and wild rabbits.

Many times, the only signs of the disease are a rabbit's sudden death and perhaps blood stained noses. Other signs include lethargy, decreased appetite, or trouble breathing.

Rabbits can become infected through direct contact or exposure to an infected rabbit's urine, feces, and blood. The virus can survive for months in the environment.

People can spread the virus by carrying it on their shoes or clothing, contaminated feed/hay, using uncleaned cages and water bowls, or petting and carrying infected rabbits.

Rabbit owners should be mindful of the heightened risk of adding new rabbits to their facilities at this time.

Biosecurity is the best defense against RHDV-2 infection of your rabbits. Avoid contact with other rabbits, their owners, kids for playdays, vehicles, equipment, and feed supplies. Change shoes before entering any of your rabbit housing; dedicate a pair of easily cleaned shoes to the rabbit shed and do not wear them outside the enclosure. Fence your animals away from access to your rabbitries, especially feed trays and water sources. Sack all bedding for disposal and secure storage. Burning used rabbit litter may be hazardous.

Testing is difficult to schedule and would only be done on premises that lose rabbits in a characteristic manner. Vaccines for RHDV-2 are not readily available, can take weeks to obtain a supply and are typically quite expensive.

The following is extracted from < https://rabbit.org/rhdv/>:
"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious disease caused by a calicivirus affecting rabbits. This includes wild and domesticated European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), from which our own domesticated rabbits are descended. Until 2020, it had not been known to affect North American native rabbits or hares, such as cottontails, snowshoe hares, and jackrabbits. In the 2020-2021 Southwest outbreak, RHDV is causing death in wildlife species of rabbits as well.

"RHDV was first seen in China in 1984 but was thought to have originated in Europe. There have been confirmed cases in 40 countries, including in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, Asia, North America (Mexico, United States, Canada), Australia, and New Zealand.

"RHDV2, a new virus, emerged in France in 2010, and quickly spread in Europe and the Mediterranean, and has replaced the original strain in many countries. In 2015, RHDV2 was first detected in Australia - it spread coast-to-coast in the rabbit population in 18 months (~3 million square miles, compared to United States' ~3.8 million square miles) and became the dominant strain replacing RHDV1.

"Clinical signs may include: loss of appetite; lethargy; high fever; seizures; jaundice; bleeding from nose, mouth, or rectum; difficulty breathing; sudden death

"RHDV is often a very swift and sudden killer, giving little warning. Rabbits may die without showing any symptoms at all. Any sudden rabbit death is suspicious and should be reported to your veterinarian as a possible case of RHDV.

"Incubation period
- RHDV1 1-3 days. Rabbits may die within 12-36 hours to a few weeks, after the onset of signs.
- RHDV2 3-5 days. Previous experimental RHDV2 infection found incubation of 3-9 days until onset of signs, then death within 3-5 days.

"Death rate (mortality)
- RHDV1 40-100%
- RHDV2 5-80%+. In the 2020 Southwest US and Mexico RHDV2 outbreak, officials report a death rate of about 90%.

"Survivors
Rabbits who survive RHDV are carriers and shed the virus for at least 42 days, perhaps longer.

"Asymptomatic carriers
Some rabbits may have little to no signs of RHDV2 (subclinical/asymptomatic) but may shed virus for up to 2 months.

"Transmission routes
Rabbits are infected by oral, nasal/respiratory, or ocular exposure to the virus, or by blood-feeding insects.

"Cause of death
RHDV causes necrotizing hepatitis and may cause necrosis of the spleen. There may be internal or externally visible bleeding. Death occurs from liver failure or hemorrhage due to an impairment in the blood's ability to clot.

"Durability of virus
Rabbit calicivirus is a very hardy virus, remaining viable in the environment outside a host.
- Survives 105 days at 68F [20C] on fabric -- it remains stable for 3.5 months at room temperature
- Survives 225 days at 39F [3.9C] (just above freezing temperatures)
- Survives freeze/thaw cycles
- Survives heat of 122F [50C] for one hour

"Seasonal outbreaks
Where the virus has a reservoir in wild rabbits or feral/stray domestic rabbits, seasonal outbreaks are expected year to year. In Australia, outbreaks start in fall and winter, peak in spring, and are mostly absent in summer. Seasonal fly abundance, as flies are a significant vector, may be linked with RHDV activity.

"Treatment
- There is no known cure for RHDV
- RHDV treatment is supportive care in isolation
- There are currently no known effective anti-viral drugs or other treatments available."
