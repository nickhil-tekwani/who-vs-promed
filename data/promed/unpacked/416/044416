Be careful not to jump to conclusions. There were cases in cats >12 years
as early as 1990. Also note, that data as posted (by Robert LaBudde) on
Promed unfortunately had errors compared with the 'original' data set -- in
the last column, cases with onset 1997. The error might give falsely the
impression that the proportion of older cases started to increase in 1996.
There is no significant change in the data set as it was originally
posted by Charles Arthur on the BSE-L:

FSE in UK: by year and age, of onset of clinical signs.

[The nice thing about ProMED-mail is that it teaches one to not take
oneself too
seriously. Torsten is correct, I had overlooked 1990.
In the words of Punch, "Back to the drawing board" for possible
explanations. However, comparing 1990&91 with 1996&97 when 2/26 were >12yo
vs 3/10 later does suggest a shift to older cats which would be more
persuasive if the data were harder. But until recently the median diagnosed
FSE cat had stayed around 6 years, which would indicate the persistence of an
underlying ongoing exposure, whatever might be happening in an older
cohort. - Mod.MHJ
