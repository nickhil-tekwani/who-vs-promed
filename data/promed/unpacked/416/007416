RABIES, DOG - SWITZERLAND EX MOROCCO: EMERGENCY
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Rabies [has been] diagnosed in a puppy in Switzerland imported from Morocco.
A female puppy (two months) has been imported to Switzerland from Morocco
(area of Agadir) by a Swiss tourist from the canton of Zurich on October
19. Two days later, the dog showed changes in behavior and bit its owner.
The puppy was given to a local veterinarian for treatment and observation.
It was finally killed by euthanasia on October 27 and sent to the Swiss
Rabies Center for analysis. Rabies infection was confirmed by IF on
October 29. Persons who were in contact with the dog (family members of
the dog owner, veterinarian and personnel) received full antirabies post
exposure treatment. An active search of one person who probably had
contact with the dog s saliva in the aircraft has been initiated by the
cantonal authorities.
The free-roaming puppy was found by an unidentified Austrian couple in the
area of Agadir (Morocco) and brought to the Taghazout camp site (12 km from
Agadir) on October 15. According to information given by the Swiss
tourist, the two Austrians (aged about 35 years, probably residents of
Vienna) are on a three-month caravan trip in Morocco. At present, they may
still be in or near Taghazout. The rabid puppy had contact with a large
number of visitors and domestic animals (especially other dogs) in the
campsite of Taghazout before it was brought to Switzerland. As the first
rabies symptoms were observed on October 21 it is possible that the dog
shed virus before its importation into Switzerland.
Therefore, each person who was exposed to saliva of this animal (bite,
scratch, saliva on mucous membranes) in Taghazout, in the airports of
Agadir and Casablanca, or in the aircraft from Agadir via Casablanca to
Zurich (AT 934 Casablanca-Zurich on October 19,1997) should receive
antirabies post exposure prophylaxis.

[Although usually coincident with the onset of symptoms, rabies virus has
been found in the saliva of dogs up to 14 days prior to the onset of
clinical signs. This could be a potentially nasty situation, so anyone in
a position to help disseminate this information to people who were at the
campsite at Taghazout, PLEASE DO SO. This is especially true for the
Austrian couple who apparently had fairly close contact with the puppy. We
can assume the puppy licked or put it's mouth around their hands and
probably faces regularly. So, they may very well be exposed. Anyone who
can think of a way to get in touch with these unnamed Austrian tourists,
should do so. With over 15,000 subscribers we stand a chance. - Mod.PC]
