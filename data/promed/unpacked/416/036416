I withdraw the following comment from this post:

"[This is unclear. We suppose it means that a resident of a frontier
town in Argentina was hospitalized in Brazil in the state of [Rio]
Grande do Sul and died there. - Mod.JW]"

This is because I mistakenly inserted the word "Argentina" into the
sentence: "The victim was a housewife 31 years of age of Santo Angelo
in the region of Missiones, Argentina." I should have put the country
name in square brackets to show it was an editorial addition.

The Portuguese original has "Santo Angelo, na regiao das Missoes."
Since "Missoes" is the Portuguese translation of "Misiones" (correct
spelling with no double s), I was misled into thinking the locality
was in the neighboring province of Misiones, Argentina, from which
deaths from suspected YF had been reported only 10 days ago (see
ProMED ref. below), and which shares the frontier with the state of
Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. In fact, there is a city in Rio Grande do
Sul state called Palmeira das Missoes, and the surrounding region is
known locally as Missoes (see map at URL below).

In the final paragraph of text is written:
"That is what happened to the owner of the home [housewife] in Santo
Angelo, who traveled through rural areas in Eugenio Castro, the
neighboring area." The locations of Santo Angelo and Eugenio de
Castro in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 50 mi from the
Argentinean frontier, are shown at:

Zoom in and out to see the frontier and the 2 locations.
