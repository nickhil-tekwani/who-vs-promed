A brand of spaghetti sauce sold in Quebec has been recalled by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The sauce, made by Érablière Godbout, could cause botulism, according to an advisory by the agency. The sauce did not have a "keep refrigerated" label on the jars.

The spaghetti sauce, which was sold in 500 millilitre and one-litre jars, should be returned to the store or thrown out. No one has fallen ill after eating the sauce, but the recall has been ordered as a precaution, the agency said.

Symptoms in adults can include facial paralysis or loss of facial expression, fixed pupils, difficulty swallowing, drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, slurred speech, and hoarseness.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
