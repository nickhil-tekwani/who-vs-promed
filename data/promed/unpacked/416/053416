Emergency report
Synthesis of a fax received on 26 August 1998 from Dr. E. Stougaard, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Frederiksberg:
Date of diagnosis: 24 August 1998.
Location of the outbreak: Ringkoebing county (in Jutland, west of the
country).
Total number of animals in the outbreak: 40 susceptible sheep (12 ewes with
offspring), 1 case, no deaths, none destroyed or slaughtered.

Diagnosis:
A. Causal agent: further investigations will be carried out by the Danish
Institute for Virus Research (Lindholm) and other international
laboratories to try to determine whether the sheep was infected by a
European bat lyssavirus.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: although contact between bats and
domestic animals must be considered as unusual, the case in Ringkoebing
county can only be explained to date as having been caused by contact
between the sheep and an infected bat. This contact might have taken place
during the stabling period.
B. Other epidemiological details: in Denmark, rabies has not been present
in foxes since 1982, but has been found in bats since 1985. During 1997, 17
bats were submitted for examination and rabies was diagnosed in 8 of these.
Control measures during reporting period: the sheep flock is under
restriction, i.e. no animal can be moved without a permit issued by the
Danish Veterinary Service.

[Could one of our Danish members inform us as to the results of any PCR
fingerprinting of this virus, and whether it was a 'bat' or 'fox' strain. -
