Off-market pork products in Canada source of _Salmonella_ outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Ministry of Health in Ontario are warning foodservice operators not to buy, use, or serve shredded pork skins and pork rinds that were sold to restaurants that make Vietnamese/Asian meals in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) due to possible _Salmonella_ contamination. The affected products were sold frozen in clear plastic bags with no labels, no lot codes, no identifiers, and no cooking instructions, CFIA said. "At this time there is no evidence of these products being sold directly to consumers and they do not appear to be available or sold at supermarkets," the agency said.

A foodborne illness outbreak of salmonellosis triggered a food safety investigation by the agency. Public health officials confirmed that the outbreak is associated with the consumption of meals containing shredded pork rind and/or shredded pork skin from certain restaurants serving Vietnamese/Asian meals in the GTA. The number of cases has not been confirmed at publication, however, the Ministry of Health in Ontario, in collaboration with Public Health Ontario, local public health units, and food safety partners are investigating the outbreak.

The CFIA noted that food contaminated with _Salmonella_ may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause illness. Healthy people may experience short-term symptoms such as fever, headache, vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Long-term complications may include severe arthritis, according to the agency.

[A similar outbreak from UK-produced pork products was reported on ProMED earlier this year (2021) due to _S._ Infantis. The serotype or serotypes involved here and the number of identified cases are not stated at this point related to the pork products. Likewise, it is unclear if the products were distributed in other provinces or countries. - Mod.LL
