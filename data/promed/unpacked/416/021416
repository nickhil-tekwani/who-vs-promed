PLAGUE - UGANDA (MASINDI) (O2): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

According to a ministry of health official, the plague that has infected 15
people and killed 9 in Masindi (in the north west of Uganda) is in fact, a
modified strain of the bubonic plague that killed an estimated 25 million
people in just 5 years (1347-1352.)
The director general of health services, Sam Zaramba, said the 1st case was
reported 3 weeks ago but the spread has been contained. There has not been
a new infection reported in the last week. When the 1st deaths occurred in
Masindi, initial suspicions were that either meningitis or Ebola were the
cause.
Blood samples from the deceased were quickly tested [and the results
confirmed] that it was bubonic plague that caused the deaths. [The results
of additional tests performed] in South Africa and in Denmark, further
confirmed the suspicions.
This is not the 1st time bubonic plague has occurred in Uganda in the
recent past. Dr Zaramba said it has occurred on and off in Nebbi [also in
north western Uganda] a number of times over the past 30 years. He further
said that after discovering the occurrence of plague, the 1st priority is
to contain the spread. Plague originates in rats and spreads to humans
through fleas.
The 1st measure taken in Masindi was to stop people from sleeping on the
floor. Dr Zaramba said this reduced the prevalence of rats. Smearing floors
with cow dung also helps contain the spread of plague as it discourages
rats from entering domestic environments.

[In yesterday's ProMED-mail posting (Plague - Uganda (Masindi): pneumonic
20070301.0725), the newswire mentioned that the form of plague in this
current outbreak was the pneumonic form. In the above newswire describes
the plague as bubonic (see yesterday's [1 Mar 2007] moderator comment for a
description of the different forms of plague). In the pneumonic form of
plague person-to-person transmission occurs at a higher frequency than in
the bubonic form as there is respiratory spread from aerosolized droplets.
The mortality rate with pneumonic plague is much higher than seen with the
bubonic form. In the above newswire, the "observed" case fatality rate is
60 per cent, within the range expected with untreated disease. ProMED-mail
would appreciate clarification of the epidemiologic picture in this current
outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPP]
