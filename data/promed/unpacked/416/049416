Hepatitis E virus on the rise in Kitgum
---------------------------------------
Uganda's Ministry of Health has sent a team of experts to the
northern district of Kitgum to investigate an outbreak of hepatitis E
virus (HEV) infection in camps for internally displaced persons
(IDPs) which has killed 64 people over the past 8 months. The team
will assess the extent of the epidemic, the level of intervention
against the disease and identify response gaps, Kitgum District
Chairman Komakech John Ogwok told IRIN.

"The biggest challenge we have is the attitude of the population," he
said, explaining that many people preferred to visit traditional
healers first and only go to health centres as a last resort. No
treatment is available for patients who have reached an acute stage
of infection, "but HEV infections are usually self-limited and
hospitalisation is generally not required", according to the World
Health Organization. "Unless people change their attitude, it will be
difficult to get rid of the disease and more people will continue
dying," said Ogwok.

Community mobilisers in affected areas said sanitation and hygiene
conditions were very poor in IDP camps and the villages to which
people were returning in the wake of a rebel insurgency in the north.

Hepatitis E is a viral disease spread via the faecal-oral route.
Outbreaks tend to be linked to contaminated water or food supplies.
Mortality rates are generally low, ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 percent.
But among pregnant women in their 3rd trimester this rate can rise to
20 percent.

"The number of hepatitis E cases is continuing to increase in the
district... Over 3082 cases have been registered in the district
since October 2007, with 64 deaths," Kitgum District Health Officer
Alex Olwedo told IRIN. "The majority of those getting the infection
and dying are women who are pregnant and it's really disturbing," he said.

A report by the Kitgum health directorate said the worst affected
areas of the district were Madi Opei sub-county, which is the
epicentre of the disease with 1114 cases, followed by Agoro with 685
cases, Paloga with 607 cases, Padibe 304 cases, Mucwini 277 cases and
Lokung with 25 cases. Others are Layamo with 16, Orom 12 cases,
Kitgum town with 12 cases, Akwnag with 3 and Palabek Gem with 2 cases.

At Padibe health centre, an 82-year-old, had recently been diagnosed
with the viral disease. "He is the 4th person to suffer from
hepatitis E in our family. Two of his sons and his elder brother died
of hepatitis E last month," said the patient's son. Gustave Opoka,
the doctor in charge of Padibe emergency health unit, said 60 cases
were reported there within a period of 3 weeks. A near-term pregnant
woman who had been brought to the health centre critically ill had
recently succumbed to the disease, said Opoka.

[The hepatitis E outbreak in the Kitgum region of northern Uganda
which began in October 2007 has not yet been contained. Since 28 May
2008 the number of cases has risen from 1797 to 3082, and the number
of deaths from 35 to 64. It is likely that control of the outbreak
will require provision of improved sanitation and adequate supplies
of clean water.
