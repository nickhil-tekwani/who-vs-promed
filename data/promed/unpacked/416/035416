Federal and state health officials are investigating a salmonellosis outbreak in 19 states and the District of Columbia, according to the CDC. The CDC reports 90 people in 19 states and the District of Columbia have been sickened by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Bareilly. The CDC has not yet released which states are involved. The 1st case report of this particular foodborne illness was reported on 28 Jan 2012. The most recent case was reported Mon 2 Apr 2012.

"CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the FDA to investigate a multi-state outbreak of _Salmonella_ serotype Bareilly infections," CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said in a statement to CNN.

News of the investigation first surfaced late Tue 3 Apr 2012, when an internal memo was inadvertently sent to everyone at the FDA, according to FDA spokesman Curtis Allen. He says the memo speculates about a possible source of contamination, sushi, but he says the FDA doesn't know the origins of the outbreak at this time.

According to the CDC, state public health officials are interviewing those who became ill to find out what they may have eaten and been exposed to in the week before they got sick. This is the how investigations into foodborne illnesses are typically conducted.

Russell said "on initial interviews, many of the ill persons reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or similar foods in a variety of locations in the week before becoming ill." However, it is still early in the investigation.

According to the CDC, consumers are not being told to avoid any particular food or restaurants. Once a particular food is identified for this outbreak, the public will be notified, according to a CDC statement.

At least 90 people in 19 US states and the District of Columbia have been infected with a single outbreak strain of _S._ Bareilly, according to a preliminary report released this morning by CDC.

Many of the confirmed outbreak patients reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or similar foods in a variety of locations in the week before becoming ill. The investigation, CDC says, has not "conclusively identified a food vehicle." This is an ongoing investigation and state public health officials are continuing to interview outbreak victims.

The news leaked yesterday (3 Apr 2012) via a memo that was inadvertently circulated throughout FDA, spokesperson Curtis Allen told JoNel Aleccia of msnbc.com.

A survey of state health agencies, combined with the information contained in the original FDA memo and today's [4 Apr 2012] CDC news release has yielded the following information as of 3 Apr 2012:

Confirmed cases have been reported by Texas, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Missouri, New York State, and Louisiana. The remaining 11 states have not yet been identified.

No confirmed cases have been reported, and no suspect cases are currently under investigation, in Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Oklahoma, or Utah.

Restaurant-associated illness clusters were identified in Texas, Wisconsin, Maryland, and Connecticut. Illness clusters of this nature are often instrumental in determining the source of an outbreak strain.

New York State has confirmed 17 cases of _S._ Bareilly, excluding cases that may have been detected in New York City, which is served by its own Department of Health. One of the 17 New York State cases was hospitalized; the victim has since been discharged and is recovering. No additional cases are under investigation by the state's Department of Health.

Louisiana has reported 2 confirmed cases, both of whom were hospitalized and are described as "doing well." No additional cases are under investigation in Louisiana at this time.

New York State spokesman Peter Constantakes declined to comment on the possible association between the outbreak and the consumption of tuna roll sushi, preferring to defer to CDC, which is the lead investigating agency for the outbreak. Louisiana spokesperson Speakes confirmed that 1 of 2 Louisiana victims reported having eaten spicy roll sushi; there was no food history available from the other victim.

While early media reports have pointed an accusing finger at spicy tuna roll sushi, it is too early to conclude that this is the definitive source of the outbreak. Even if the sushi proves to be a common element, FDA will need to carry out a trace-back investigation to determine, if possible, which component of the sushi roll may have been contaminated.

CDC has "no specific advice to consumers" at this time. The public is NOT being advised to avoid any specific foods or restaurants.

[Outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish for eating are uncommon and are more likely to be related to contamination of the fish after they are caught. A central location with continued contamination of the outbreak strain would be needed for the outbreak to continue over 2+ months since the storability of the fish is quite limited. It is more likely that, if the sushi continues to be implicated, another ingredient in the sushi such as a spice, a vegetable, or seaweed wrapping would be the vehicle. - Mod.LL]
