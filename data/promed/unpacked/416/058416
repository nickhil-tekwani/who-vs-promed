The 1st cases of sleep syndrome took place in March and April of 2013 when around 10 local residents came to the clinic with similar symptoms. The ages ranged from 14-70, but all of them suffered from drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, loss of coordination and partial loss of memory. Later in January 2014 more residents of the village complained about sleepiness.

The blood tests did not give any [abnormal] results. The psychologists and psychiatrists who examined the patients did not find any psychological disorders. The only pattern that has been identified is that syndrome strikes the Kalachi village in times when the outside temperature surges upwards in a sharp spike.

It is certainly is a nightmare for the parents as they are afraid to let their children go to school. The symptoms are sudden and there is no way to predict when and who the sleep syndrome is going to strike next. "The first one was a 9th grade student who fell asleep, you know he started having hallucinations (...) Some of the symptoms resembled a stroke, but it was not a stroke. Several adults and 2 children were in the intensive care with continuing hallucinations," local resident Nadezhda Yakimova said.

2 more people have been hospitalized at Kalachi village with sleep syndrome symptoms, Tengrinews reports citing Interfax-Kazakhstan.
On 20 Feb 2014, a 53-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman were hospitalized to the Esil District Hospital. The new cases of sleep syndrome have a mild form: while patients are feeling dizzy and sleepy they have no hallucinations and loss of memory.
Both patients were admitted to the therapeutic department of the hospital with encephalopathy of unclear origin, said Doctor Kabrashyt Almagambetov. The symptoms started showing during warmer days. The symptoms manifest themselves only during thawing weather and sudden warmings.

"The Ministry of Healthcare informs that since the 1st cases of hospitalization in March 2013, the situation at Kalachi village, (population 680) has been under control," the press office of the Ministry reported. There have been 33 patients suffering from similar symptoms of drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, loss of coordination and partial loss of memory. "The symptoms are temporary and disappear after 2-3 days. The condition of the patients is considered satisfactory and appropriate for their gender, age and the time of the first symptoms (...)," the report said.

While the committee continues its work there, 5 more people were admitted to the hospital with encephalopathy of unclear origin. The patients have the sleep syndrome symptoms such as partial memory loss, drowsiness, weakness and dizziness.

A team of the finest ecologists, virologists and toxicologists has arrived in the Kalachi village of Akmola Oblast to determine the cause of the mysterious sleep syndrome that has affected more than 30 villagers, Tengrinews reports citing KTK. It is the 1st time such a team of research scientists has been gathered to deal with the issue. They will have to find the cause of the sleep syndrome and come up with a plan for countermeasures. If the scientists find a serious health hazard then villagers will be evacuated from Kalachi.

"We have separated our team into 2 groups. The first group will be examining the patients. The 2nd group will be gathering data in the village. We have some preliminary data from the tests. At the moment, our main goal is to determine the cause of the illness as soon as possible," Yesenbai Akadilov of the Healthcare Department of Akmola Oblast said.

The 1st case of the sleep syndrome was registered back in spring of 2013. Villagers aged from 14 to 70 sought medical help due to fatigue, drowsiness, loss of coordination and partial loss of memory. Later in January of 2014, more patients were admitted to the local clinic with similar syndromes. The patients would just fall asleep for a number of days straight.

Despite all the attempts to uncover the truth behind the mysterious illness, doctors and researchers have not found the poisoned apple or any other cause for the sleep syndrome. [The reference is to the Grimm fairy tale "Snow White" in which a jealous queen gives her more beautiful stepdaughter a poisoned apple to eat that plunges her into a deep sleep for a very long time. She is aroused when her glass coffin is dropped by the servants of a prince who had fallen in love with her beauty, seen by him through the glass. - Mod.JW]

One more Kalachi native falls asleep to wake up in Kokshetau
----------------------------------------------------
While the team or doctors and scientist is working in Kalachi village to determine what is causing the mysterious sleep syndrome, one more patient has fallen asleep. The new victim of the sleep syndrome, a 23-year-old PE [Physical Education] instructor, fell so fast asleep that he had to be brought to a hospital.

"I came from work and had my dinner. I went to the shower right before going to sleep. Then I fell asleep and I do not remember anything after that. It appears I was brought to Yesil and later to Kokshetau city. I woke up to find myself in Kokshetau," he said. [Kokshetau is 224km from Kalachi village. - Mod.JW]

The scientists gave a preliminary statement concerning their work. They think that radon gas discovered in the air in small amounts might be the cause of the sleep syndrome. The Minister of Healthcare Salidat Kairbekova said that after a talk with the Yesil Hospital more scientists were sent to Kalachi. "We will report on the results as soon as we can," she added.

7000 tests have been made in Kalachi village in Akmola Oblast over the past 12 months, Tengrinews reports citing the Ministry of Health Care of Kazakhstan.

"7000 tests of the possible causes of the encephalopathy have been made since March 2013. We have ruled out infectious and bacterial diseases. The gamma-background [radiation] of the village is within the normal range. No increase in salts or heavy metal concentrations has been detected," the report said.

The investigation of the Kalachi case continues. Ministers from several Ministries have been put in charge of the research. The team is responsible for making a comprehensive ecological research and analysis with the use of instruments.

Earlier, the team of Kazakhstani researchers announced their preliminary findings. They concluded that the sleep syndrome was not a transmissible disease.

[New information from these earlier reports is that the age range of the victims is 14 to 70 years, the sleep episode could last for number of days and the experts were leaning towards a toxic etiology (radon gas).

They do not appear to have considered catatonia, which may be of neurologic or pharmaceutical origin. Catatonic patients will sometimes hold rigid poses for hours and will ignore any external stimuli, similar to cases of encephalitis lethargica and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. There are a variety of treatments available; benzodiazepines are a first-line treatment strategy. Electro-convulsive therapy is also sometimes used. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of NMDA antagonists for benzodiazepine resistant catatonia [see ref. (1) below]. Ref. (2) describes a diagnostic test and treatment alternatives. Ref.(3) suggests that micronutrient deficiencies should be examined.

Abstract [edited]
Catatonia, a disorder of movement and mood, was described and named in 1874. Other observers quickly made the same recognition. By the turn of the century, however, catatonia was incorporated as a type within [the] syndrome of schizophrenia. There, catatonia has lain in the psychiatric classification for more than a century. In the 1970s, the tie was questioned when catatonia was recognized among those with mood disorders. The recognition of catatonia within the neuroleptic malignant syndrome offered effective treatments of high doses of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), again questioning the tie. A verifying test for catatonia (the lorazepam sedation test) was developed.
