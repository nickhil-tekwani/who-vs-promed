Outbreak of LegionnairesÂ’ disease in Spain
Seven cases of Legionnaires' disease have been associated with a hotel in
Benidorm in Spain. Five of the seven cases were men and two were women,
aged between 50 and 77 years. One, a 77 year old man, is known to have
died. The first case arose in August, the second in October, and the rest
in December 1998. Three cases have been confirmed as due to _Legionella
pneumophila_ serogroup 1. The hotel was closed at the beginning of January
[1999. An epidemiological and environmental investigation, which began in
Dec [1998 is still in progress.
