Department of Agriculture (DOA) news release: bovine tuberculosis detected in cow on Molokai
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Hawaii Department of Agriculture (HDOA) reports a cow in a herd on Molokai has been infected with bovine tuberculosis, _Mycobacterium bovis_ (bTB), a contagious, infectious, communicable disease of animals capable of infecting humans. This is the 1st detection of the disease in a cattle herd in Hawaii since an outbreak of bTB on Molokai 25 years ago.

The infected cow originated from a beef cattle herd in Ho'olehua in the central part of Molokai and was temporarily pastured in Mapulehu on the east end of Molokai due to the ongoing severe drought. Bovine tuberculosis has been present on Molokai, particularly on the east end of the island, with sporadic outbreaks in cattle herds since the 1940s.

The recently infected cow was one of 30 in the herd tested by a veterinary medical officer from HDOA's Animal Industry Division on 22 Jun 2021. The herd is currently isolated and under HDOA quarantine in Ho'olehua. HDOA is working with US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop a clean-up plan, including the depopulation of the infected herd with indemnity being paid to its owner. Although the balance of the herd tested negative, due to the insidious nature of bTB, a decision has been made to depopulate the entire herd to ensure infected animals do not remain in the Molokai cattle population. Exposed, adjacent, and area herds will be subject to testing to ensure the infection has not spread.

"While the detection of bovine tuberculosis has only been confirmed in one animal to date, it is the foremost priority for the department to isolate and control this disease before it can spread to other cattle herds on the island," said Phyllis Shimabukuro-Geiser, chairperson of the Hawaii Board of Agriculture. "Of all people, Molokai ranchers understand the importance of containing this disease, and we appreciate their continued cooperation and assistance."

In 1985, HDOA made the decision to depopulate all cattle on Molokai in an effort to eradicate bTB, and more than 9000 cattle were removed. Following the depopulation, Hawaii received "bovine tuberculosis-free" status from USDA in 1993, which allowed the interstate movement with no restrictions for bTB.

In 1997, the status was suspended when a 10-year-old cow was infected with bTB on Molokai. It was suspected the cow was infected by feral pigs carrying the disease. The entire herd was depopulated, and Hawaii regained the bovine tuberculosis-free status in 1998.

Since the last outbreak 25 years ago, HDOA's Animal Industry Division and the USDA - Animal, Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services (USDA-APHIS-VS) have been monitoring cattle herds and wildlife on the east end of Molokai, which involves testing cattle herds annually and conducting surveillance and laboratory testing on wildlife turned in by hunters. Bovine TB was found to persist in the feral pigs on the east end of Molokai, and there has been ongoing concern about the possible transmission of the disease back into managed cattle herds. Historically, bTB was also detected in axis deer and mongoose on Molokai, but not within the past 25 years.

Bovine tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_), and cattle are the primary host. Other species of animals, including humans, may also become infected. Although _M. bovis_ can also infect humans, the transmission to humans occurs mainly in countries with high infection rates of _M. bovis_ and poor disease-control programs.

In 1917, the US began a bTB eradication program in cattle, which has been highly successful. However, occasional outbreaks continue to occur in the US, and certain areas in Michigan and Molokai, which have endemic infections in wildlife with sporadic outbreaks in cattle herds. Infected wildlife are known carriers of bTB, which can be transmitted to cattle associating with the wildlife. Research has been ongoing to develop vaccines and other preventive measures to be used in wildlife to eradicate bTB in these endemic areas.

More information on bTB may be found at the USDA-APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/cattle-disease-information/national-tuberculosis-eradication-program.

["Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals. Once the most prevalent infectious disease of cattle and swine in the United States, bovine TB caused more losses among US farm animals in the early part of the 20th century than all other infectious diseases combined."

"Cattle and bison usually show no clinical signs to TB unless the disease has affected multiple organ systems and is very advanced, which is quite rare. Typically, infected cattle are asymptomatic and are only detected by skin testing or at slaughter during our national slaughter surveillance program.

"TB is spread mostly either by inhalation from nose-to-nose contact between animals or by ingesting contaminated feed or water. Herds are usually affected by one of 2 ways: either by purchasing infected animals or being exposed to infected cattle or wildlife. A 3rd way of possible transmission may be human-to-animal transmission, but regulatory officials are unable to quantify this risk at this time.

"The prevalence of TB in cattle, bison, and captive cervids is extremely low in the US, occurring roughly 7 times per 1 million cattle herds on an annual basis. Producers can reduce their risk of getting the disease by adding only test negative livestock from known negative herds to their own herds. When TB is found in a herd, it is eliminated by either depopulating the affected herds or by testing and then removing reactor animals from affected herds."

"The primary source of TB surveillance is carcass inspection at all federal- and state-inspected slaughter establishments. The other main sources of TB detection are by testing animals during traces, pre-movement tests, and, finally, for accredited free herd status. Live animal testing is performed by using a screening test followed by a confirmatory test if the 1st test is positive. Contact your local accredited veterinarian for more specific information."

"In 1917, the US Bureau of Animal Industry began the national TB eradication program due to human and livestock concerns regarding bovine TB. It started out as strictly an eradication program for cattle but eventually included both bison and cervids. Benefits from the program are estimated at 12X the cost of the program due to decreased slaughter condemnations and decreased human infection. Although the program has been extremely successful in reducing livestock infection, there is still work left to do."

The decrease in human infections and in animal infections has been a great improvement for the health of all. Perhaps this was one of the 1st "One Health" programs as it was started in 1917.

"Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious and communicable granulomatous disease caused by the acid-fast bacilli bacteria of _Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_). It is commonly a chronic, debilitating disease, but occasionally may assume an acute, rapidly progressive course. _M. bovis_ is a widespread zoonosis, global in magnitude, and affecting nearly all species of vertebrates (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, bison, buffalo, and camelids.) The disease is spread by direct contact, inhalation of infected droplets expelled from infected lungs, and ingestion of contaminated feed or milk. In most countries, TB is a notifiable disease. Overall, TB has an important worldwide impact on animal industries and human health. Control measures are based on prevention and eradication. Surveillance is a key element for the management of preventions and control programs.

"Surveillance for TB serves the purpose of enabling Veterinary Services to obtain an accurate picture of the scope of the disease in the US livestock populations; in the event of a disease outbreak, the course TB follows in livestock and wildlife populations for a given area over time; and permits timely intervention if the trend observed deviates from what is expected."
