A total of 803 cases have been reported since 19 Dec 2016 in Sindh province, including 29 cases reported in various towns in Karachi during the week of 10-16 Feb 2017. Of the 92 samples sent to the National Instituted of Health for testing, 71 have been laboratory-confirmed positive for chikungunya virus.

WHO is in close coordination with the Ministry of Health and partners in response efforts. Capacity-building has been conducted and instructions issued to district and town health officers, primary health care providers and hospitals on chikungunya treatment and preventative measures.

The community has been advised through a door-to-door campaign through the Lady Health Workers programme. Affected areas have been fumigated and high-risk areas have been treated with insecticides using indoor residual spraying.
