Around 150 people have been exposed to measles by a person sick with the virus who visited several Auckland locations, a public health official says.

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service appealed last week [week of 15 Aug 2016] for those feeling unwell who had visited the Auckland City Hospital emergency department or 3 other places at certain times earlier this month [August 2016] to seek medical help in case they were coming down with measles.

Medical officer of health Dr David Sinclair said this week 150 people were known to have been exposed to the sick person, but "this is an evolving number as we contact people". No new cases of measles had been notified, Sinclair said. "At this stage we are monitoring some contacts who are at risk of becoming unwell, but we have had no secondary confirmed cases."

The original case is an adult who had recently returned from travel to South East Asia. The person was not infectious during the return plane trip, but did require hospital admission. "2 per cent of measles cases are of sufficient severity to warrant hospitalisation, while up to 30 per cent will suffer other complications, hence our efforts to contain spread."

Public Health listed the locations and times at which the measles case was present [see source URL above]. Visitors to those places at the listed times were likely to have been exposed to the virus and if not immune could fall sick with measles. People were considered immune if they had received 2 doses of the measles vaccine, had had measles disease, or were born before 1969. Those who had received only one dose of the vaccine should see their doctor for a free 2nd dose, Public Health said.

Those infected were likely to experience symptoms from 7 days after exposure to the virus. The 1st symptoms are a fever, and one or more of a runny nose, cough and sore red eyes. After a few days a red blotchy rash starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.

People who felt unwell and had visited the listed places at the times stated were urged to phone their doctor -- or Healthline on 0800 611 116 -- for advice rather than turning up unannounced because measles is so highly infectious and could easily spread to others in a medical waiting room.

[2] Myanmar (Naga Self-Administered Zone, Sagaing Region)
Date: Tue 30 Aug 2016

A local lawmaker in Sagaing Region said yesterday [29 Aug 2016] that although the measles outbreak in the Naga Self-Administered Zone is under control in Lahe township, neighbouring Nanyun township is still struggling to contain and treat a spate of illnesses, which some are now saying is not the same malady.

The situation is stable in Lahe. Currently, Nanyun is worse off than Lahe. [According to] the latest data, 2 more people were killed, one on [23 Aug 2016] and another one on [25 Aug 2016], said regional MP U Law Yone (NLD; Lahe 1).

We got news that 82 patients were killed in Naga, he said, while noting that the death toll was unconfirmed. A team that includes an official from the Naga administrative office has gone into the field to confirm the situation, he added.

Medicine and food assistance is needed for locals because they have been facing malnourishment. Currently, donors and the government are offering supporting aid.

U Law Yone added, "Health experts said that Nanyun is not a measles outbreak but the accounts of civilians said the symptoms of patients from Nanyun resembled Lahe's symptoms."

U Aung Htut, president of the Naga Traditional Literature and Cultural Centre Committee, said a lack of both transportation and education was causing the high casualty count from the infectious disease, exacerbated by high rates of malnutrition in the self-administered zone. The roads situation is worse in Nanyun than Lahe, he said. "I reached both Lahe and Nanyun. I saw children suffering severe malnutrition," said U Aung Htut. MoH [the Ministry of Health] has implemented a vaccination program to inject the measles vaccine. They announced that Nanyun is not a measles outbreak it is knock-on health problems caused by malnutrition and a lack of hygiene.

Children under 5 years old have constituted a majority of the outbreak's victims.

At a press conference on [26 Aug 2016] covering the 1st 100 days of the new government, the Ministry of Health said that in addition to difficulties physically accessing affected populations, language barriers were also stymieing effective treatment. The ministry said its vaccination drive since the outbreak first made headlines had covered 85 per cent of the region, including 15 054 children.

With the Naga Self-Administered Zone's healthcare woes highlighted by this month's [August 2016] outbreak, Dr Htar Htar Lin told The Myanmar Times yesterday [29 Aug 2016] that the government would draw up a long-term plan to address the problems. In the near term, said Dr Htar Htar Lin, the Ministry of Health's deputy director for immunisation, there are plans to administer 10 other vaccines in October, November, and December [2016] to protect against other potential health threats in the region.

At the 100-day press conference last week [week of 22 Aug 2016] , Union health minister Dr Myint Htwe warned that outbreaks of measles and other infectious diseases were likely to be seen in regions other than Naga as well. When we examined why that disease was occurring, it was found that most people in our country are pretty lacking in health knowledge, he said, noting that the risk of contracting measles could be avoided with preventative immunisation.

Of the Naga region's underdeveloped healthcare and transportation infrastructure, he said, "We have many areas like that. If there are satellite phones to report information from remote areas, we can know in time and many people would not have died like now." He added that the Naga region would be used as a case study to help inform the development of a broader national health plan. We will have to consider the case that occurred in Lahe on the whole, he said. We will have to consider it as [part of] a national plan not to allow such diseases to occur, especially in remote areas.

[3] UK summer festivals
Date: August 2016
Source: Gov.UK HPR 10 (25): news (5 August) [edited]
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-report-volume-10-2016/hpr-volume-10-issue-25-news-5-august#measles-associated-with-summer-festivals


Since June 2016 a significant number of measles cases have been confirmed in teenagers and young adults who attended or worked at music and arts festivals around England. This follows an increase in measles this year with 234 cases confirmed between January and June 2016, compared with 54 cases reported for the same period last year [1]. Measles is extremely infectious and events like festivals, where people are mixing closely with each other, provide the ideal place for the infection to spread.

Public Heath England (PHE) is currently aware of 36 reported measles cases linked to at least 8 music and arts festivals across England this summer (mid-June to end July) (see table in full article). Thirty (83 per cent) of these cases are laboratory confirmed, and 6 are considered likely to be measles on the basis of their clinical and epidemiological features.

Cases have been identified across England as well as Wales (2) and Scotland (1). Most cases reside in the South West (12) and London (9) regions with the South East (6), West Midlands (4), East of England (2), and North West (1) all reporting linked cases.

The vast majority of cases were unvaccinated (30) or partially vaccinated (3)* teenagers and young adults, with a median age of the 20 years (range: 11 to 42 years). PHE is aware of at least 3 cases who attended festivals despite being symptomatic.

The current data are provisional, and it is likely that more cases linked to festivals will be identified as investigations are ongoing. PHE is reminding teenagers and young people who are unsure about their vaccination status to check with their GP and make an appointment, if needed, to ensure they receive the two doses of MMR vaccine required. All age groups are urged to be aware of the symptoms of measles and not to attend festivals if they are unwell. Young people planning to attend other festivals over the summer are in particular urged to follow this advice.

* The vaccination status of 3 of the cases was not known.

[4] Ireland outbreak

National measles outbreak -- April to July 2016; 17(8); August 2016
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Measles is a highly infectious viral disease which can be prevented if people are vaccinated against it. 2 doses of a measles containing vaccine, included in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine are recommended to prevent measles. The disease caused by the virus presents as a fever-rash illness, typically characterised by a high temperature, fever, cough, runny nose (coryza), and conjunctivitis.

Approximately 30 per cent of all measles cases report one or more complications. Complications are commoner in children less than 5 years of age and adults 20 years of age and older. [1]

The measles virus is readily transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols from infected individuals to those who are non-immune. Transmission occurs from 4 days before rash onset (before the person realises that they have measles) until 4 days after rash onset. Direct face-to-face contact is not needed for transmission to occur as the virus is airborne via very small respiratory droplets when the infected person coughs or sneeze. The virus can survive in the air for up to 2 hours. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch surfaces contaminated with the virus, and then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 per cent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become. [2]

Measles outbreaks occur when non-immunised people are exposed to and become infected with measles. This exposure often occurs without the person even knowing that they have been exposed to the virus (in public settings, in health care facilities).

In this report we present preliminary data on measles epidemiology in Ireland between week 18 2016 (early May) until week 29 2016 (week ending 24 Jul 2016). Most cases included in this report are linked to a national outbreak that followed importation of measles from a European country where measles outbreaks were occurring and spread rapidly. A report on preliminary data from this outbreak was recently published in Eurosurveillance. [3] For some cases reported during this time period it has not yet been possible to identify clear epidemiological links to other outbreak related cases (and further investigations are being done to determine if linked). Only 1 case (notified in week 29; week ending 24 Jul 2016) is clearly not linked to the outbreak and was imported from another European country. ...
