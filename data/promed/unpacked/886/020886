----------------------------------------------------------------------
If TB [tuberculosis] infected the patient's meninges, and newborns don't cough forcefully enough to aerosolize the organisms, and [infection was due to] _Mycobacterium bovis_ and not _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the route of transmission/portal of entry is unclear to me from the report. Hospital staff and close contacts are suspected of having been infected by the patient.

Can someone clarify this, thanks. I will also make some inquiries if I can reach someone in the local public health department and will forward the answers if I receive them.

[ProMED-mail thanks the correspondent for the question. Transmission of tuberculosis (TB) primarily depends on the contagiousness of the source patient, the conditions in which the exposure takes place, and the duration and intensity of the exposure. If this patient is the source of the outbreak, she undoubtedly has pulmonary in addition to meningeal TB. Patients with exclusively extra-pulmonary tuberculosis are unlikely to transmit their infection to others.

Because _Mycobacterium bovis_ behave just like _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, transmission would be expected to be proportional to the density of organisms in sputum, with some exceptions, perhaps related to characteristics of the particular strain. For the patient to have been highly contagious, as this patient was to have infected at least 26 others, the mycobacterial density in her sputum would likely have been very high, allowing discharge of enormous numbers of _M. bovis_ into the environment. Acid-fast stained smears of her sputum should have been positive, that is, the mycobacterial density of her sputum should have been at least one million acid-fast bacilli (AFB) per mL of sputum. This occurs usually when pulmonary cavities are present. Her treatment status is also important; treatment of tuberculosis decreases contagiousness of the organisms. Also, patients who cough more frequently are likely better disseminators, as are patients with laryngeal TB.

A closed, small, poorly ventilated environment facilitates transmission. Household contacts of the patient are particularly at risk and presumably any infected family members were household contacts. We are not told of the types of hospital personnel who may be infected. Technicians in microbiological laboratories dealing with identification of the organism and hospital workers involved with procedures that induce coughing, such as bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, induction of sputum, and inhalation therapy are at risk. Dr Kent Sepkowitz wrote an excellent discussion of the contagiousness of a patient with tuberculosis (Sepkowitz KA: How Contagious Is Tuberculosis? Clin Infect Dis 1996; 23: 954-62. Available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/5/954.full.pdf .) - Mod. ML]
