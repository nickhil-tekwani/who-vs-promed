On behalf of the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit, I'd like to offer this response to the post:

At this time, the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit's investigations, including genotyping of clinical and environmental isolates, do not indicate a link between the Barrie and Orillia clusters of Legionnaire's disease.

[ProMED-mail recently posted 2 reports of a Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Ontario, Canada -- one involving 4 cases of Legionnaires' disease in the city of Barrie (Legionellosis - Canada (04): (ON) RFI 20191214.6840544) and the other involving 8 cases in Orillia, a nearby city about 40 km (25 miles) northeast of Barrie (Legionellosis - Canada (02): (ON) 20191013.6724136.) Both Barrie and Orillia are located geographically within Simcoe County, but are politically independent, in a densely populated and industrialized region of Ontario (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcoe_County). A map showing the location of Barrie can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Barrie,+ON,+Canada.

I questioned in my moderator comments if the 2 outbreaks could be related and appreciate Heidi Pitfield's prompt response from the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit that genotyping of clinical and environmental isolates does not indicate a link between the Barrie and Orillia clusters of Legionnaire's disease. - Mod.ML
