A banana plantation in Tully has been quarantined after a devastating disease that has wiped out banana crops in other areas [was found]. Dr Jim Thompson, Biosecurity Queensland, said initial tests came back positive for Panama disease tropical race 4. Samples were taken after a plant showing symptoms of the disease was discovered.

Further confirmation is expected within the next week or 2 as more tests are undertaken with samples to also be tested at a 2nd laboratory. But Dr Thompson said he was confident of the testing conducted so far. "We are working with the property to effectively manage the incident," Dr Thompson said. "Tropical Race 4 is a serious threat to the banana industry in Australia, and Queensland represents 95 per cent of that industry."

He said TR4 was found in the Northern Territory in 1997 [see ProMED-mail post 20120817.1248624]. "Effectively, there is no commercial banana industry left in the Northern Territory now," he said. "We are very concerned that it could have a devastating impact, so it's important that we address the issue now."

Exactly where the disease may have come from is unknown at this stage.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But Tropical race 4 (TR4), which is at present devastating Cavendish production throughout Southeast Asia, has recently also been reported for the 1st time outside that area in Jordan (ProMED-mail post 20131107.2044265) and Mozambique (ProMED-mail post 20131206.2095450). It is of great concern worldwide.

In Australia, race 1 and temperate race 4 are present in parts of the country (ProMED-mail posts 20081212.3908 & 20071024.3451), and TR4 was reported for the 1st time in 1997 in the Northern Territory. When a new TR4 outbreak occurred there in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20120817.1248624), it was concluded that quarantine restrictions had no effect, and they were lifted. This has increased the risk posed by TR4 to the main banana growing areas on the east coast considerably, but a source for the outbreak above still needs to be determined. Development of TR4 resistant cultivars has now become a top priority for the national banana industry.
