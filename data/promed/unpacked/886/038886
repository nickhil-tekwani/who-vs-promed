Australia: Norovirus Outbreak in Brisbane Hospital Contained
---------------------------------------------------
Health authorities say they are confident they have controlled an
outbreak of the highly contagious norovirus at Brisbane's Princess
Alexandra Hospital. 7 patients with symptoms including vomiting and
diarrhoea have been isolated in 3 of the hospital's wards until they
recover. A total of 29 patients and 24 staff have been infected with
the virus in the past 2 weeks, and all have recovered. District
manager at the hospital, Dr Richard Ashby, says he is hopeful the 3
closed wards will reopen next week.
"The actual incubation period is 1-2 days, but we essentially need to
empty out those wards completely, thoroughly clean those wards and
then we can start to re-admit, so we would expect hopefully that over
the next 5 to 6 days we will completely empty out those wards and
then we'll be back to normal," he said.
