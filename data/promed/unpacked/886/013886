WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A shipment of 200,000 doses of anthrax vaccine destined
for U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf was stopped because it apparently had
frozen during shipment, destroying its effectiveness, CNN has learned. At
$3.50 per dose, the shipment is valued at some $700,000, defense officials
said. It is not clear when the temperature change took place.
The problem was discovered about two weeks ago. Another shipment of 200,000
doses was sent shortly thereafter to replace the damaged batch, so the
inoculation of troops in the Gulf could take place on schedule, to protect
them against the potentially lethal germ-warfare agent.
The first in a series of shots is to be administered to troops next week.
Officials, speaking on the condition they not be named, said the vaccines
were shipped from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, to Germany en route to the
Middle East. In Germany, someone noticed that at least one of the 20,000
vials had suffered a radical temperature change, apparently freezing and
rendering the doses useless.
Army Surgeon Lt. Gen. Ronald Blanck sent specialists to Germany to examine
the shipment to see if any of it could be salvaged. The results of their
examination are not yet available, the officials said.

Just last December, A.P. Pomerantsev and colleagues at the State Research
Center for Applied Microbiology in Obolensk near Moscow reported they had
genetically engineered a new strain of anthrax [bacillus, one that
vaccines did not
work against.
Anthrax, a disease seen mostly in animals, is produced by a bacterium known
as _Bacillus anthracis_. Writing in the journal Vaccine, Pomerantsev's group
said they used genes from a closely related bacterium, _Bacillus cereus_, to
change the way _Bacillus anthracis_ works.
They vaccinated hamsters and then exposed them to normal anthrax and
genetically engineered versions. The vaccine protected against the normal
strains but not the genetically engineered ones.
Paul Jackson (scientist from Los Alamos Laboratories) said it did not even
sound hard to do. "Frankly I think I could make the original construct in a
few weeks."
U.S. researchers are forbidden to do anything like that under a presidential
order banning research that might lead to biological weapons, and Jackson
stressed, "I wouldn't even consider doing it."
But he said such technology would not be beyond the abilities of Iraqi
researchers. "Today they can do it and it's not trivial. Underestimating
your adversary is one of the most dangerous things you can do. I would
believe the Iraqis have that technology."
But Lt. Gen. Ronald Blanck told reporters this was unlikely. "While it is
possible to do that, there is no evidence that it has been done -- at least
in the threat areas that we're concerned about."

In 1972 the United States signed the UN's Biological and Toxin Weapons
Convention, banning the development, use or stockpiling of biological
weapons. But the notion that America had done away with its biological
weapons was thought of by Moscow as nothing but a bald-faced lie and,
according to reports, most Soviet scientists involved in biowarfare never
even heard of the U.N. Convention.
When George Bush and Margaret Thatcher were brought up to speed on the
startling Soviet advances in biological warfare, they put pressure on their
friend Mikhail Gorbachev to open up his facilities to a joint team of
American and British inspectors. Eventually Mr. Gorbachev agreed, and
inspectors were allowed to examine tanks obviously built for making enormous
qualities of something deadly but which were now oddly clean and sterile.
The inspectors met the same reception U.N. Special Inspectors later met in
Iraq: denials, evasions, and spotless empty rooms.
In the U.S., interestingly, the scientific community let its humanism run
away with it and was passionately convinced the Soviet Union was not
violating the Biological Weapons Convention, accusing those who thought the
Russians were cheating of being enslaved by right-wing ideology. It took the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to waken the world to the horrors of
nuclear warfare. What will it take to waken it to the horrors of biological
warfare? The possibility of a biological holocaust has as yet failed to
ignite a national frenzy. People don't like to even think about it.
But last week, ABC's "Prime Time Live" devoted a whole program to the
frightening lethal power of what people still call "Germ Warfare" (the
old-fashioned term), while interviewing for the first time on television Ken
Alibek himself. Richard Preston, moreover, author of "The Hot Zone," has
written for the New Yorker a superb, detailed article examining the whole
question.
Joshua Lederberg of the National Academy of Sciences, a Nobel Prize winner,
is a member of a working group of scientists trying to maintain a dialogue
with Russian biologists to bring them into the international community of
science. "There is no technical solution to the problem of biological
weapons," he says. "It needs an ethical, human, and moral solution if it's
going to happen at all. There is no other solution."

scientists had the integrity to publish their results in a widely-read
peer-reviewed journal, bringing the information to the attention of
concerned parties. - Mod.ES
