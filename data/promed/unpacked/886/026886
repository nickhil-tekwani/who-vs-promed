Massive fish kill in Milwaukee harbor linked to virus
-----------------------------------------------------
A massive fish kill last month [March 2011] in the Milwaukee harbor
has been linked to a deadly fish virus that was first discovered in
Lake Michigan in 2007. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
[DNR] reports it is the 1st time the disease known as viral
hemorrhagic septicemia, or VHS, has been found in Lake Michigan waters
since 2008.

VHS is sometimes referred to as a fish-specific version of the deadly
[ebolavirus]. It is harmless to humans, but can affect several dozen
fish species, including popular sport and commercial fish such as
perch, trout and whitefish.

The virus targeted thousands of gizzard shad in last month's [March
2011] fish kill. It's the 1st time that species has tested positive
for VHS in Wisconsin waters, according to the DNR.

Nobody knows how the virus got into the Great Lakes, but a likely
explanation is it was carried in by oceangoing freighters. To keep it
from spreading to the state's inland waters, the DNR has implemented
restrictions on the bait fish industry, including no minnow harvesting
on VHS infested waters, which include Lake Michigan, Lake Superior,
the Mississippi River, and Lake Winnebago. It also requires boaters
and anglers to drain their gear when leaving a body of water or before
entering the state.

Those may be slowing the spread of the virus, but it's clear from the
fish kill last month [March 2011] that the disease hasn't gone away.

"The important message here is VHS is still out there and we have to
be vigilant about cleaning our boats and not moving fish around," Al
Kaas, the DNR's fish hatchery operations chief, said in a news
release.

[Information about the disease viral hemorrhagic septicemia may be
found in ProMED-mail post 20100130.0325.

This virus is of serious concern to the Great Lakes and the
associated departments of natural resources. Therefore, it seems that
there would have been ongoing surveillance on Lake Michigan. If that
is the case, then one has to wonder why the virus has not been found
in the years from 2008 until 2011. This is not a new species, nor is
the virus new to the Great Lakes. If there is a reason for the gap in
the years, with surveillance in place, we would be interested in
knowing it. - Mod.TG]

[If the virus is being spread by oceangoing freighters crossing the
lakes, then precautions being taken by fishermen will not solve the
problem. But it is impractical to prevent cargo ships flushing their
bilges in the Great Lakes. It was just such a practice in an ocean
port that brought cholera to Peru after 100 years of freedom from the
disease. - Mod.JW]
