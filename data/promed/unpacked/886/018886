Today, Saturday (24 Jul 2021), the Veterinary Hospital in Diyala announced its rejection of the preventive ban on marketing livestock and sheep from Al-Khalis district, which was imposed after the 1st death from [Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever, was recorded in the governorate.

The director of the veterinary hospital in Diyala, Riyad Al-Tai, said in an exclusive statement to (Baghdad Today) that "the preventive curfew imposed on Al-Khalis district and its villages, which lasted for 3 continuous weeks, after the 1st death of a woman with hemorrhagic fever was recorded, was lifted at present, as no other case was recorded until now."

He added, "The veterinary teams sprayed sterilization materials twice in the deceased's house and the rest of the neighboring houses, as well as taking a series of preventive measures around the area with a comprehensive preventive ban on Khalis and its villages to prevent the movement of animals, whether from cattle or sheep outside them, to avoid transmission of infections, especially since the disease is common between man and animal."

The Director of the Health Promotion Department in the Iraqi Ministry of Health, Haitham Al-Obaidi, confirmed that the most vulnerable people to infection and infection with [Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever are health and medical personnel, and workers in the animal and sheep care sector, stressing that cases of infection are dealt with great caution and that preventive measures are taken. Al-Obaidi told Rudaw Media Network, today, Sunday (18 Jul 2021), that this disease is not new, and the 1st case of infection was recorded in Iraq in 1979; other cases were recorded in 1997, and then in 2014 and 2018.

New cases of the disease were recorded during the past 2 weeks, which aroused anger and suspicion, and the ministry spread awareness about the disease to alert people and workers in the animal and sheep sector and warn them of the danger of the disease. During the past days, 3 deaths were recorded due to hemorrhagic fever, one in Kirkuk and 2 in Dhi Qar.

According to Al-Obaidi, a doctor who was treating the injured in Dhi Qar was diagnosed with the disease, and there are cases recorded in Al-Anbar and Muthanna. The infection is transmitted in 3 ways, including through the transmission of ticks that live on livestock, a type of disease-carrying insect, as well as through blood droplets that can enter the eyes, nose, or ears, or into wounds in the skin. This stage is important, dangerous, and sensitive at the same time to the spread of the disease, due to the large number of (operations/events) dealing with animals in the sacrificial season and, therefore, caution must be taken against this disease, according to Al-Obaidi.

Al-Obaidi pointed out the difficulty of diagnosing cases of hemorrhagic fever infection among animals, due to the absence of any sign of those infected animals, so they appear completely safe and this is what makes the disease hidden in animals, pointing out that "while it is not possible to identify the infected animal, prevention methods must be followed."

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for these reports on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) cases and the public health efforts in Iraq to increase community awareness in high risk groups and the general public.

"The incidence of CCHF in Iraq has not been well described. The disease was first reported in the country in 1979; a total of 10 cases and 7 deaths were reported in the Baghdad area. Several cases were also reported in 1980 in the city of Halabja in [Sulaymaniyah governorate]. According to published reports, the number of confirmed cases annually, between 1998 and 2009, ranged from 0 to 6; however, 11 confirmed and 28 suspected cases were reported during 2010 in a single province over a period of 3 weeks, with a case fatality rate of 36 percent."
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217300656).

Another publication reports, "There are about 192 confirmed cases of CCHF which have been reported from different provinces in Iraq (between 1992 and December 2010); however 5 cases of nosocomial infections were recorded in 1979, 1992 and 1996."
(http://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/viewFile/3969/3793)

The reports above indicate that there have been recent cases of CCHF in Dhi Qar (a hospital physician), Al Anbar, and Muthanna as well as in Diyala governorates of Iraq, perhaps related to increased cattle and animal movement before and during the Eid-ul-Adha (Festival of the Sacrifice) festivities in the 2nd half of July [2021].

Prevention and control of CCHF include raising awareness about the risk factors of the disease and taking precautionary measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as wearing gloves and protective clothing while handling animals. - Mod.UBA
