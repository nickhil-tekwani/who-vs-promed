Three South Australians have been diagnosed with meningococcal infection in the past week, prompting a public health warning. So far this year [2016], there has been a total of 11 cases of the potentially deadly infection -- ranging from a one-year-old to a 94-year-old -- up from 7 cases at the same time last year and 30 for all of 2015.

Of the 11 cases this year [2016], 10 have been the meningococcal [serogroup] B strain, which is not covered on the national vaccine register, prompting calls for it to be added to the list. Health Minister Jack Snelling said the federal government should give "careful consideration" to adding the [serogroup] B strain vaccine. "In the meantime, probably the most important thing is for parents to speak to their local GP about whether it is advised to have that particular vaccination for meningococcal B," he said.

At present, the meningococcal C vaccine is available through the National Immunisation Program, but the meningococcal B vaccine is only available from GPs at a cost of USD 125 per vaccine. Four shots are needed in total. SA [South Australia] Health chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said it was an individual decision between parents and GPs about whether to vaccinate children against the B strain. "It's a safe vaccine, and it's an effective vaccine, but is not on the free list at the moment," he said.

A federal government spokesman said the government could not include a new vaccine on the register unless it was recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. "On each occasion, the application was rejected on the basis of clinical uncertainty; that is, where the clinical evidence for its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in the applicant's submission," the spokesman said.

SA Health would not disclose the ages or suburbs of the latest 3 people diagnosed with the infection. "Some are doing very well. Some were in hospital ... Thank heavens none have died," Prof Phillips said.

While the infection is most common among children under 2 and people aged between 16 and 25, it can affect anyone at any age, especially during the cooler months when there are more respiratory infections around. Symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, a stiff neck, sore muscles and, in some cases, a rash of red and purple spots.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Kathleen Harriman for providing the news report that says that 10 of the 11 cases of meningococcal meningitis in the state of South Australia have been due to serogroup B.

South Australia (SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. Its population of 1.7 million people is the most highly concentrated, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs; other population centers in the state are relatively small (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia). - Mod.ML
