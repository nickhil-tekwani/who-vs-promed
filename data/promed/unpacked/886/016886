Outbreak of tobacco streak virus causing necrosis of cucumber (_Cucumis
sativus_) and gherkin (_Cucumis anguria_) in India.
M Krishnareddy, Devaraj, Lakshmi Raman, Salil Jalali, DK Samuel, Division
of Plant Pathology, Indian Institute of Horticultural Research,
Hessaraghatta Lake PO, Bangalore-560089, India. Plant Dis 2003; 87: 1264;
published online as D-2003-0804-03N, 2003. Accepted for publication 6 Jun 2003.
Cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_ L.) and gherkin (_Cucumis anguria_ L.) are
important cucurbitaceous vegetables grown in India for slicing and
pickling. During the 2000 to 2002 rainy season and summer, a new viral
disease, causing yield losses of 31 to 75 per cent in Bangalore, Bellary,
Davanagiree, and Tumkur districts of Karnataka State, infected cucumber and
gherkin.
Symptoms were tip necrosis characterized by necrotic lesions on leaves, and
a general leaf and stem necrosis extending to mid veins, petioles, flower
buds, and tip, eventually resulting in die-back of vines.
Tissue extracts from symptomatic leaves of cucumber and gherkin were
mechanically inoculated on several herbaceous indicator plants (cowpea,
cucumber, pepper, Zinnia, watermelon, _Chenopodium amaranticolor_,
sunflower, _Nicotiana glutinosa_, _N. tabacum_, and _Gomphrena globosa_).
On most hosts, symptoms of chlorotic or necrotic lesions followed by mottle
or systemic necrosis were observed.
Back-inoculation from the symptomatic indicator plants onto cucumber and
gherkin resulted in symptoms typical of those observed in the field.
Electron microscopic examination of leaf-dip preparation and ultra-thin
sections of virus infected plant samples showed the presence of isometric
particles 25 to 28 nm in diameter. Similar types of particles were observed
when infected samples were trapped in immunosorbent electron microscopy
with polyclonal antibodies specific to tobacco streak ilarvirus (TSV) but
not to watermelon silver mottle tospovirus (WSMoV).
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay tests using leaf extracts of
field-collected samples and sap-inoculated plants showed positive reaction
to antibodies of TSV (1) but not to antibodies of cucumber mosaic
cucumovirus, WSMoV, watermelon bud necrosis tospovirus, papaya ringspot
potyvirus W strain, and zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of RNA extracts of
infected samples of field and inoculated symptomatic plants was done by
using primers derived from TSV RNA3 specific for the coat protein (CP)
region of TSV (2). A 800-bp specific DNA fragment was amplified from
infected cucumber and gherkin but not from healthy control plants.
Sequence analysis of cloned PCR fragments revealed nucleotide identities of
99 per cent with TSV isolates from cotton, mungbean, sunnhemp, and
sunflower (GenBank Accessions Nos. AF515824, AF515823, AF515825, and
AY061929) and 88 per cent with TSV-WC (GenBank Accession No. X00435).
On the basis of host range, serological relationship, electron microscopy,
and sequence analysis of the CP region, the virus was identified as a
strain of TSV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural
occurrence of TSV on cucumber and gherkin in India.

[TSV is transmitted by several species of thrips (genera _Frankliniella_
and _Thrips_). I could not find any reference to TSV naturally infecting
cucurbits, so this report may be the first ProMED-Plant report of natural
infection of cucurbits by TSV. According to the VIDE data base, _Dahlia_
spp., _Gossypium herbaceum_ [levant cotton], _Melilotus alba_ [white sweet
clover], _Trifolium pratense_ [white clover], _Phaseolus vulgaris_[common
bean], and _Glycine max_ [soybean] are natural hosts. 2 cucurbit species
(_Cucumis sativa_ [cucumber] and _Capsicum frutescens_[chili pepper]) are
susceptible to experimental transmission. In 2000, TSV caused significant
damage (USD 200 million) to sunflower and groundnut in Andhra Pradesh and
Karnataka states. This is the third ProMED-mail report of the virus causing
disease in India, and thus it may be an emerging pathogen. Disease
management would be difficult in open-field production systems. Presumably
genetic resistance would be a viable option, but I don't have any
information on that point. Perhaps our readers in India may have some
comments. - Mod.DH]
