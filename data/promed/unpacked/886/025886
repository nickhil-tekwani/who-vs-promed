_Staphylococcus aureus_ has been recovered from ocean water in Hawaii
and elsewhere. This organism can survive in salt water. I suspect
that MRSA can survive in this environment just as well as
methicillin-susceptible _S. aureus_. This certainly does not prove
that these infections were acquired in the ocean, but I do not think
it is necessary to invoke _V. vulnificus_ unless there are clinical
data to implicate that organism.

In response to the message about _S. aureus_ infections related to
seawater in Florida, I would like to share our experience in Hawaii.
More than 10 years ago an association was noted between _S. aureus_
cellulitis and infections of skin wounds acquired during recreational
ocean sports such as swimming and paddling (1, 2). This was
investigated with sampling of seawater at a variety of beaches under
the direction of Roger Fujioka in the microbiology department at the
University of Hawaii (3). He found up to 100 colonies of _S. aureus_
could be recovered from some of the most popular and busy beaches at
peak-use times. The colony counts dropped rapidly at night when the
swimmers left the water and were considerably lower in the water
tested at less popular beaches.
We have recently sampled some beaches again and have found 3 strains
of MRSA -- which comprise about 1 percent of _S. aureus_ strains
recovered. This is roughly the percentage of patients carrying MRSA
when cultured at a local ambulatory care clinic (4). We are also
working to refine our methodology for ocean water sampling with
selective media and have submitted an abstract for the International
Ocean Health conference to be held here in February.
_S. aureus_ has been recovered from the seawater of a number of
countries and is thought to play a role in human disease -- in fact,
it is used as a water quality indicator (5-7). It has also been
recovered from fresh water and swimming pools, where it has a high
tolerance to chlorine (8-10). There were proposals to use _S. aureus_
as an indicator of water purity in the United States as early as 1964
(11), but the role it plays and whether it would add anything to the
established markers, such as coliform counts and enterococci, has not
been clear.
It is interesting to note that _S. aureus_ or very similar strains
have been recovered from marine mammals -- apparently unrelated to
captivity and obviously not related to hospital care (12).
It may also be of note that the PEW Oceans Commission has declared
"America's oceans are in crisis and the stakes could not be higher."

on healthy swimming that deals with fresh as well as sea water
problems <http://www.cdc.gov/healthyswimming>.

Are the Florida sources saying that the MRSA came from creatures from the
deep?
The commercial fishermen and the surfer were probably self-colonized
with MRSA, and a marine injury simply provided the portal of entry.
