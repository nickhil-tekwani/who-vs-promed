[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants. Once introduced, the virus can infect up to 90 per cent of an animal heard, and the disease kills anywhere from 30 to 70 per cent of infected animals.
The PPR virus does not infect humans (http://www.fao.org/ppr/en/).

PPR occurs in Africa except Southern Africa, in the Arabian Peninsula, throughout most of the Near East and Middle East, and in Central and South-East Asia (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.11_PPR.pdf).

According to the epidemiological comments in the OIE report above, the attending veterinarian indicated that the virus had been present on the farm for a long time before the outbreak occurred. It would be interesting to know what is meant by "long time". Based on official information sent to the OIE, the disease had been absent since June 2011. If in fact the disease had been present some time before the noted outbreak, then the Animal Health Authorities should have notified its presence in a timely manner, thus helping reduce any further spread. Having a strong network of producers, private veterinarians, etc. in order to report suspect diseases is fundamental to the epidemiological surveillance of any veterinary services. - Mod.CRD
