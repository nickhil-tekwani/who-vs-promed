[As stated in the above Saudi MOH reports, there have now been a total of 828 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 357 deaths (case fatality rate 43.1 percent) reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012. The newly reported laboratory-confirmed case from Najran is now the 4th case reported from Najran since the beginning of December 2014 and the 2nd case reported in the past week (the previous case from Najran was reported on 30 Dec 2014).

The newly reported fatality, a 70-year-old expat male from Dammam, is most likely the 70-year-old expat male reported from Jubail on 16 Dec 2014 (see MERS-CoV (66): Saudi Arabia, new cases, deaths 20141216.3037408). Dammam is located 74.2 km (46.1 miles) to the southeast of Jubail; both are located in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia (for a map showing the locations of both cities, see http://www.mapsofworld.com/saudi-arabia/road-map.html). At the time of the initial report on this case, the individual was in critical condition, and had a history of frequent camel contact and of raw camel products consumption.

The newly reported recovery, the 79-year-old Saudi male from Quriat, was most likely the individual reported as a laboratory-confirmed case on 26 Dec 2014 (see MERS-CoV (68): Jordan, Saudi Arabia, RFI 20141229.3057913), at which time he was noted to be in stable condition, and while a history of possible animal exposure was under investigation, there was no history of exposure to confirmed or suspected MERS-CoV individuals during the 14-day incubation period preceding his onset of illness.
