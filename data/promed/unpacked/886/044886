[No epidemiological commentary has been included in the above
notification. In view of the fact that the laboratory test was
"bacteriological examination" and of the specified number of cases
(1284, an apparent morbidity rate of 5.84 percent), it may be assumed
that mass abortion has been observed.

To evaluate the possible public-health implications of this outbreak,
the biovar of the _B. suis_ involved should be determined. The
pathogenicity for humans of _B. suis_ biovars 1, 3 and 4 is well
established, whereas _B. suis_ biovar 2 seems to be less pathogenic.
