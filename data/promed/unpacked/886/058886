In recent hours, the Tapalque municipality confirmed the diagnosis of a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in a rural area of this locality.

According to public information on the Olavarr√≠a home page, "On Line News", the reported case occurred in the rural area of San Bernardo, and, after its detection, an alert for the area was issued by Zoonoses. Few details are known about the affected patient and the situation.

Nonetheless, this is a new case in the region, which adds to one registered in February [2018] in La Madrid, a woman who died, and a case in Tandil, a man who also died of this virus [infection].

[With this new case, the number of cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase in Buenos Aires province this year (2018). The symptoms that this patient had were not specified, nor was the test used to establish a hantavirus infection diagnosis. The above report indicates that 2 fatal cases of the infection in this region of the province have already occurred in 2018. The environment in which these individuals might have acquired their infections was not mentioned.

As with the report above, the reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED-mail receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the case. However, a previous report from Argentina in 2017 (Hantavirus - Americas (16): Chile (LR), Argentina (BA), USA (PA) 20170220.4850930) indicated that the hantavirus involved in Buenos Aires province was Buenos Aires hantavirus. The cases mentioned above might have been due to infection by the Buenos Aires virus. The rodent host of this virus has not been determined.
