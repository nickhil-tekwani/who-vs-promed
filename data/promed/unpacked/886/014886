April to May every year is the high point for rats to breed, meaning the risk of rodent-spread disease also increases. In recent days, Changsha Central Hospital of Huanan University admitted 2 patients who experienced fever and headache after being in contact with rats. They mistakenly thought they had influenza, but after arriving at the hospital they were diagnosed with epidemic hemorrhagic fever.

[ProMED thanks Dan Silver for this contribution.

The information available from the report is limited at present, and inferences cannot be drawn whether this is in fact an "outbreak." Also no hemorrhagic symptoms are mentioned among the clinical features of the admitted patients. Details on the exact contact with rats would also be helpful. Any further information from the clinical staff, epidemiologists and public health staff, as well as diagnostic confirmation tests/results, would be highly appreciated.

The _Arenaviridae_ are a family of viruses whose members are generally associated with rodent-transmitted diseases in humans. Each virus usually is associated with a particular rodent host species in which it is maintained. Arenavirus infections are relatively common in humans in some areas of the world and can cause severe illnesses.

The rodent hosts of _Arenavirus_ species are chronically infected with virus; however, the viruses do not appear to cause obvious illness in them.

Human infection with an arenavirus is incidental to the natural cycle of the viruses and occurs when an individual comes into contact with the excretions or materials contaminated with the excretions of an infected rodent, such as ingestion of contaminated food, or by direct contact of abraded or broken skin with rodent excrement. Infection can also occur by inhalation of tiny particles soiled with rodent urine or saliva (aerosol transmission). The types of incidental contact depend on the habits of both humans and rodents. For example, where the infected rodent species prefers a field habitat, human infection is associated with agricultural work. In areas where the rodent species' habitat includes human homes or other buildings, infection occurs in domestic settings. - Mod.UBA]
