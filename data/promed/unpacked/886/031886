Abstract
--------
Following the 11 Sep 2001 terrorist attacks, letters containing _Bacillus anthracis_ were distributed through the United States postal system killing 5 people. A complex forensic investigation commenced to identify the perpetrator of these mailings. A novel liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry protocol for the qualitative detection of trace levels of meglumine and diatrizoate in dried spore preparations of _B. anthracis_ was developed. Meglumine and diatrizoate are components of radiographic imaging products that have been used to purify bacterial spores. 2 separate chromatographic assays using multiple mass spectrometric analyses were developed for the detection of meglumine and diatrizoate. The assays achieved limits of detection for meglumine and diatrizoate of 1.00 and 10.0 ng/mL, respectively. _Bacillus cereus_ T strain spores were effectively used as a surrogate for _B. anthracis_ spores during method development and validation. This protocol was successfully applied to limited evidentiary _B. anthracis_ spore material, providing probative information to the investigators.

Introduction
------------
In the weeks following the 11 Sep 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, 4 letters containing _Bacillus anthracis_ spores were collected. These letters were addressed to 2 media outlets in New York City and to 2 members of the United States Senate in Washington, DC. As a result of the distribution of these letters through the United States Postal System, 5 victims died and at least 17 victims demonstrated symptoms of inhalational or cutaneous anthrax.

The investigation to determine the individual(s) responsible for the most disruptive terrorist attack on the United States involving the use of a biological agent was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). Because of unprecedented challenges, this was among the most complex investigations the FBI or the USPIS had ever conducted. The investigation team, known as the Amerithrax Task Force, worked with subject matter experts and the scientific community to develop novel analytical/forensic assays to leverage all possible information from the evidentiary _B. anthracis_ spore materials.

The _B. anthracis_ spores recovered from the letters were determined to be of the Ames strain and were of a high degree of purity. While the spores recovered from the mailings to media outlets in New York City were characteristically different (for example, off-white in color, more granular, some cellular debris, and growth media components present) from the spores sent to Washington, DC., both had high colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of material, on the order of 1011 CFU/g, indicating that both were high-quality spore preparations. Spores of such purity are often used in conducting aerosol challenges to minimize the incidence of nebulizer obstruction by cellular debris or growth media components during an experiment.

The investigation determined that some laboratories conducting _B. anthracis_ research with the Ames strain were purifying spores using a density gradient of RenoCal-76(R) or similar products. Meglumine diatrizoate and sodium diatrizoate are the primary constituents in RenoCal-76(R), Hypaque-76(R), and Renografin-60(R), which are commercially available radiographic imaging products. In addition, meglumine diatrizoate, meglumine, and sodium diatrizoate are readily available from commercial chemical suppliers. The literature reports, as early as 1966, the use of products containing meglumine diatrizoate in spore purification.

The Ames _B. anthracis_ used in the New York City and Washington, DC mailings had a number of identified morphological variants, which were isolated and their complete genomes sequenced. The sequences of these variants were compared to the wild-type Ames _B. anthracis_, and a number of genetic differences were identified. Assays were used to screen over 1000 samples of Ames _B. anthracis_ collected from research institutions within the United States and internationally. Of the samples screened, all samples positive for all of the genetic markers were determined to originate from a common source of spores, known as RMR-1029. The RMR-1029 spores were known, from laboratory records, to have been purified using a density gradient of RenoCal-76(R). Some investigative questions became: "Were the evidentiary spores from the mailings directly diverted from RMR-1029? Could an analytical method identify residual RenoCal-76Â® in a spore preparation known to be purified using RenoCal-76(R)?"

This paper describes the development, validation, and application of a novel, highly sensitive protocol using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) to detect trace amounts of meglumine and/or diatrizoate, components of RenoCal-76(R), in a single spore sample preparation. This analytical capability was applied to limited evidentiary spore material and RMR-1029 to provide probative information about a possible production method of the evidentiary samples. During the investigation, it was determined that the number of researchers who used gradients of RenoCal-76(R), or similar products, to purify spores and who had access to the Ames strain of _B. anthracis_ was limited. Therefore, if meglumine and diatrizoate were identified in the _B. anthracis_ spores used in the mailings, the number of potential sources for the spore material could be significantly reduced.

Conclusions
-----------
A sensitive and selective analytical protocol has been developed for the detection of meglumine and diatrizoate in samples of _Bacillus_ spores. A tiered approach of capturing chromatographic separation, full-scan MS, MS2, and MS4 data was developed for both meglumine and diatrizoate. System carryover concerns with meglumine were resolved by changing the stationary and mobile phases. The method validation demonstrated both sensitivity and selectivity by obtaining detection limits of meglumine and diatrizoate at concentrations ranging from 1.00 to 10.0 ng/mL. Maximizing the data that could be derived from the analysis of a few milligrams of evidentiary material was paramount to the FBI. The application of this novel method proved to be a valuable tool during the investigation. As the genetic data that linked the _B. anthracis_ spore material from the mailings to RMR-1029 was being compiled, investigators were uncertain whether an aliquot of RMR-1029 was used directly. The absence of meglumine and diatrizoate on the evidentiary material, using the protocol described herein and when taken together with other forensic examinations, was supportive to the investigation in indicating that the evidentiary spore material was not diverted directly from RMR-1029.

[The key sentence is the last: "The absence of meglumine and diatrizoate on the evidentiary material ... was supportive to the investigation in indicating that the evidentiary spore material [in the letters] was not diverted directly from RMR-1029." So Bruce Ivins could not have brewed up these spores working after hours as proposed by the FBI. It had to have been done elsewhere in an institute that did not employ "RenoCal-76(R) or similar products to purify spores."

It is hard to understand why it has taken so long for this information to be published, more than 10 years since the events of October 2001. One can think of various scenarios but Swider and her colleagues, and their superiors, are to be congratulated on their institutional courage as there must have been pressures to not do so. - Mod.MHJ]
