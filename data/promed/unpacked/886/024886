Acting on massive virus infestation of the banana industry of the
province [Kalinga, Philippines], the provincial agriculturist office
here sought the help of banana experts from Isabela State University
(ISU) who came here and lectured on tissue-cultured banana.
Dr. Billy Temanel, department director of Cagayan Valley Agricultural
Research & Development Center, and Dr. Nilo Padilla, both based at
ISU, lectured on the new banana technology to banana farmers, whose
industry has been ravaged by the banana bunchy top virus (BBTV).
Provincial Agriculturist Gerry Jose said that about 30 percent of the
province's banana is infested by BBTV. Infested banana plants show
withered leaves, are stagnated and produce smaller fruits.
Experts said there is a need to disinfect the planting area before
introducing the new tissue-cultured banana plantlets and that the
only way to eradicate the virus is by burning the host plant.
Tissue-cultured banana plantlets are laboratory-grown and have been
proven to be disease resistant, but technology still requires
sanitation of the place, the experts added.
This will prevent any tendency of the virus present in the place to
react with the cultured variety which may result in the formation of
new viruses, Temanel said.
The program is seen to be an inter-agency activity, with involvement
from ISU, Kalinga Apayo State College and other research
institutions. There is also a memorandum of agreement signed by these
agencies and the province, Jose added.
Among the 8 towns of the province, Pinukpuk, Rizal and Tabuk are the
top producers of banana. These are mostly exported to major cities.
Disease resistant varieties produced from tissue-cultured plantlets
are lakatan, tundal and dippig.

[The crop plant banana, _Musa x paradisiaca_, develops symptoms of
the disease bunchy top when infected by banana bunchy top virus
(BBTV, family: _Nanoviridae_; genus: _Babuvirus_).
BBTV causes irregular streaking in the veins and lower portion of the
leaf. The streaking resembles dots and dashes, sometimes referred to
as 'Morse code streaking'. New leaves on mature plants infected with
BBTV have difficulty emerging. These new leaves are narrower than
normal, wavy rather than flat, and have yellow leaf margins. They
appear to be 'bunched' at the top of the plant, resulting in the name
of this virus. Severely infected plants do not usually produce fruit
or, if they do, the banana hands and fingers are usually distorted and twisted.
BBTV was first reported in banana (_Musa_ spp.) in Fiji in 1879. It
has subsequently spread throughout the South Pacific, Asia, and
Africa, and Australia. It has not appeared in Central or South
America. BBTV is vectored by the banana aphid (_Pentalonia
nigronervosa_). Disease management is predicated on integrated pest
management (IPM). Strategies include long-term aphid control (killing
of weed hosts for aphid control, use of predators and parasites,
control of aphids on alternate hosts), frequent scouting for diseased
plants, and destruction of diseased trees. BBTV is an ongoing
problem for banana production in the Phillipines. Abaca bunchy top,
a related disease probably caused by BBTV, has also been reported in
_Musa textilis_ (abaca, Manila hemp) from the Philippines.
Once infected banana and weed plants are removed from an area it is
possible to replant with virus-free plantlets obtained via tissue
culture, and in Australia a successful program is in place based on
this approach (See "Links", final link). This is what is being
attempted in the Philippines. The banana rehabilitation project is a
coordinated program of the Provincial Government and the Local
Government Units with the hope of completely eliminating "bunchy
top." The level of infection in banana is stated to be about 30
percent in Kalinga Province, Philippines, the area reported on in
this article. Total eradication of old infected bananas, alternate
hosts like abaca, and weeds so as to prevent re-infection of newly
replanted virus-free plants by aphid transmission may well prove to
be a challenge to this ambitious program.
