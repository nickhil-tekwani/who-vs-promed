Online hook-up apps are posing challenges for health officials dealing with a syphilis outbreak in Manitoba [Canada]. The province says they saw 200 cases last year [2015]. They used to see an average of 20 per year. Rates have really increased over the past 3 years and among different age groups, not just young people.

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Joss Reimer says they don't have any data to say hook-up apps caused or help contribute to the outbreak. But she says they do make it more difficult to track who may be infected when they only have a username. "It's been a big challenge for public health to do what we used to do very simply and just call someone up or show up at their house and talk to them about their risks and get them tested," she said. "We don't know how to find people if all we have is a username, whereas what we used to have is an actual physical person at a physical location that we could go and talk to them."

Manitoba is also experiencing a shortage of Bicillin, one of the most common drugs used to treat syphilis. Reimer says an increase in demand and a shortage in supply are to blame.

[Manitoba, with a population of 1.2 million people in 2011, is a province located in the center of Canada on the border with the USA; its capital and largest city, Winnipeg, is Canada's 8th-largest metropolitan area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba).

For a discussion of syphilis, see my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below.

Bicillin, which the news report above says is in short supply in Manitoba, contains benzathine penicillin G. However, there are 3 Bicillin products available for adults: Bicillin L-A (benzathine penicillin G alone); Bicillin C-R (a mixture of equal amounts of benzathine and procaine penicillin G); and Bicillin C-R 900/300 (a mixture of 0.9 million units (MU) benzathine and 0.3 MU procaine penicillin G). Only Bicillin L-A (benzathine penicillin G alone) is recommended for the treatment of syphilis. - Mod.ML
