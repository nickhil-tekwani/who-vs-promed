Hepatitis A, a waterborne disease, has broken out in epidemic proportions
mainly in the Gampola area, with about 200 cases admitted to the Gampola
Base Hospital alone, hospital sources said yesterday [Fri 18 May 2007].
"This is not a chronic disease, and the patient recovers within one week to
2 weeks. The symptoms are fever, discoloring of the eyes and urine, and
spinal pain. There are no after effects following full recovery,"
epidemiologist Risinta Premaratna told the Daily Mirror yesterday [18 May
2007].
Meanwhile, when the Daily Mirror contacted the Gampola Base Hospital,
Minister DM Jayaratna was inquiring into the needs of the patients at the
hospital. Minister Jayaratna said the main reason for the spread of disease
in epidemic proportions is contaminated water. "People living on the
estates in particular drink unsafe pipe-borne water supplies, which are
contaminated. People in and around Gampola, Pussellawa, Tundeniya and
Tholuwa do not have access to safe drinking water," Minister Jayaratna said.
The minister has given instructions to the water board officials in Kandy
to take immediate measures to supply clean water to the population of Gampola.

Hepatitis A is a benign liver infection caused by hepatitis A virus.
Outbreaks of hepatitis A occur worldwide and are associated with inadequate
personal hygiene and poor standards of sanitation. Outbreaks of hepatitis A
infection can be consequences of social deprivation, natural disasters,
deficient water supplies, and contamination of food supplies. No doubt, the
political conflicts and environmental disasters that have afflicted Sri
Lanka in recent times have contributed to the current epidemic in West Sri
Lanka.
Good personal hygiene and proper sanitation can help prevent hepatitis A.
Fortunately, there are no long term consequences of hepatitis A infection,
and recovery from infection confers permanent immunity. Vaccines are
available for long term prevention of hepatitis A virus infection in
persons 12 months of age and older. Immune globulin is available for
short-term prevention of hepatitis A virus infection in individuals of all
ages.
Vaccination is recommended by the United States CDC for travelers to areas
with increased rates of hepatitis, for men who have sex with men, for
injecting and non-injecting drug users, for persons with clotting-factor
disorders, for persons with chronic liver disease, and for children older
than 12 months living in areas with increased rates of hepatitis. - Mod.CP]
