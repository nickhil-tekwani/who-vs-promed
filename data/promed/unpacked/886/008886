To date, there have been four confirmed cases of St. Louis encephalitis
(SLE) reported to the Texas Department of Health for Public Health Region
6/5South. All four cases have resided in Harris County [Houston]. As of
10/29/98, Harris County Mosquito Control District has identified 22 _Culex_
sp. mosquito pools have tested positive for SLE.
Epidemiologists with Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services
are conducting reviews of all recently reported aseptic meningitis cases to
rule out potentially unrecognized cases of SLE.
The four confirmed cases are summarized below. With each of the cases, the
individual's work-related duties or lifestyle placed them at heightened
risk for _Culex_ bites due to dusk or evening outdoor activities with no
personal protective measures.
Case 1: This 45 year-old male became ill on 8/19/98 and was hospitalized on
8/21/98. The patient recovered without long-term sequelae. The case was
reported by the Houston Department of Health and Human Services.
Case 2 summary: This 31 year-old man became ill on 8/28/98 and was
hospitalized on 8/31/98. Patient was discharged 9/3/98 and recovered
without long-term sequelae. The case was reported by the Houston Department
of Health and Human Services.
Case 3 summary: This 40 year-old male became ill approximately 8/20/98 and
was hospitalized on 8/24/98. Patient was discharged to a long-term care
facility on 10/2/98 with multiple long-term sequelae. The case was reported
by the Houston Department of Health and Human Services.
Case 4 summary: This 50 year-old female became ill approximately 8/30/98.
She was hospitalized on 9/18/98 and discharged 9/25/98. The patient
recovered with only limited sequelae of intermittent, mild headaches. The
case was reported by the Harris County Public Health and Environmental
Services.
