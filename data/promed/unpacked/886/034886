Ringrot Outbreak In Wales Contained
--------------------------------------
Tracing and testing work associated with potato stocks at the farm in
Wales, where an outbreak of potato ring rot was detected, has confirmed
that the outbreak has been contained and that no other farms have grown or
received infected stocks.
More than 165 000 potato tubers were tested during the outbreak. On the
outbreak farm, one stock of the Provento variety and one stock of a
Provento/Almera admixture were found to be infected.
Apart from these 2 stocks, all tests were negative, including for the
remaining 20 seed potato stocks on the outbreak farm.
The testing included: all potato stocks on the outbreak farm; other stocks
of Provento from the United Kingdom 2003 harvest; other stocks of Almera
from the UK 2003 harvest; seed potatoes from the UK 2003 harvest grown from
2002 stock from the outbreak farm; seed potatoes from stocks with a clonal
link to stocks grown on the outbreak farm in previous years; seed potatoes
on farms with a machinery link to the outbreak farm.
A substantial testing programme was also carried out in the Netherlands,
where the Provento seed potatoes grown on the outbreak farm originated.
A Lessons Learned review will be initiated shortly, to assess the handling
of this first outbreak, and UK controls against ring rot.
This review is being planned in consultation with the National Farmers'
Union (NFU) and will provide an opportunity for all those affected,
including individuals, trade organisations and Government officials, to
contribute their views.
Ben Bradshaw, Plant Health Minister, said: "It is extremely good news that
this outbreak has been contained. This is thanks to good co-operation with
those in the industry and the substantial Government resources committed to
the containment exercise."
Potato ring rot is a serious disease and its establishment in the UK would
have significant consequences for potato growers and others.
"It is now time to take a step back to assess the handling of this outbreak
and the controls that are in place against ring rot."

[The attention to detail exercised by the those responsible for testing
potato stocks is very impressive. Kudos to those who contained this
outbreak of bacterial ring rot (caused by _Clavibacter michiganensis_ ssp.
_sepedonicus_).
It will be very interesting to see what recommendations ensue from the
final report of this incident. - Mod.DH]
