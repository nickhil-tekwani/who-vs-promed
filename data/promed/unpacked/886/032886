Diarrhoea outbreak kills five in Phikwe
--------------------------------
The Selebi-Phikwe Government Hospital Superintendent, Dr Joseph Sharma has confirmed that a diarrhoea outbreak has killed 5 babies in the copper mining town. Sharma told Mmegi this week [week ending 20 Jul 2012] that they have recorded 151 cases of diarrhoea since the outbreak was noticed on 4 Jul 2012 when many babies were admitted at the hospital. He said the stools of 99 percent of the babies tested positive for rotavirus infection. He said during the 1st week, 71 babies were admitted while in a normal week, they receive only 15 diarrhoea patients. He noted that during the 2nd week, the number increased to 80. Sharma revealed that one of the babies that were brought in was already dead. He explained that the child was admitted before but the mother decided to discharge herself against doctors' orders. He said that the mother then took the baby to a traditional doctor, only for the child to die. Sharma advised parents that they should not take their babies to traditional doctors because that can only make the situation worse. He stated that the 1st thing they should do is to give their children Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) or zinc sulphate tables before taking them to a health facility.

He added that the hospital has put in place all the necessary medications targeted at assisting sick babies. "The disease affects babies under the age of 5 and the outbreak has so far only affected Selebi-Phikwe as we have not yet received any cases from the surrounding villages. "We are working on measures that will arrest the situation. Some of these measures include advising parents to wash their hands after changing nappies, to wash food before cooking, to dispose of stools in time and to increase personal hygiene," he said.

Sharma said the District Health Management Team (DHMT) has also visited 19 churches in Selebi-Phikwe where they had a chance to address parents on the outbreak of the disease and inform them on ways to prevent it. He also pointed out that the rotavirus [infection] is common in winter. He called upon mothers of babies who are 8 weeks old to bring them to health centers for vaccination against [rotavirus] diarrhoea to avoid the same scenario happening next year [2013].

Sharma also stated that tap water that is supplied to Selebi-Phikwe could not be blamed for the outbreak because it has been analyzed and has tested negative for rotavirus [contamination].

[Diarrhoeal disease is the 2nd leading cause of death in children under 5 years old, and is responsible for killing 1.5 million children every year. Diarrhoea can last several days, and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. Most people who die from diarrhoea actually die from severe dehydration and fluid loss. Children who are malnourished or have impaired immunity are most at risk of life-threatening diarrhoea.

Diarrhoea is a symptom of infections caused by a host of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms, most of which are spread by faeces-contaminated water. Infection is more common when there is a shortage of clean water for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Rotavirus and Escherichia coli are the 2 most common causes of diarrhoea in developing countries.

Treatment is by rehydration with intravenous fluids in case of severe dehydration or shock and/or oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution for moderate or no dehydration. ORS is a mixture of clean water, salt and sugar, which can be prepared safely at home. It costs a few cents per treatment. ORS is absorbed in the small intestine and replaces the water and electrolytes lost in the faeces. Zinc supplements reduce the duration of a diarrhoea episode by 25 percent and are associated with a 30 percent reduction in stool volume.

Currently 2 different rotavirus vaccines are licensed for use in infants. The vaccines are RotaTeq (RV5) and Rotarix (RV1). Before being licensed, both vaccines were tested in clinical trials and shown to be safe and effective. In these studies, during approximately the 1st year of an infant's life, rotavirus vaccine was found to prevent almost all (85-98 percent) rotavirus illness episodes that were severe and to prevent 74-87 percent of all rotavirus illness episodes.

The town of Selebi-Phikwe is situated in the north eastern part of Botswana. The town is is a mining centre. A map of Botswana showing the location of Selebi-Phikwe in the Central Province of Botseeana can be accessed at: http://www.mapsofworld.com/botswana/botswana-political-map.html. Mod.CP]
