[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Syria.

A recent review of the global distribution of leishmaniasis (Alvar J, V.ID, Bern C, Herrero M, Desjeux P, Cano J, Jannin J, den Boer M; WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team; Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671) cites national reports from 2004 to 2008 showing that 14 cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were reported during that period, with the true incidence being between 30 and 60 cases. In the same period, 22 882 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) were reported, with the estimated range being between 64 100 and 105 300 CL cases.

CL caused by _L. tropica_ is still endemic in its traditional home of Aleppo but also in Edlib, Lattakia, Tortous, Hama, and the city of Damascus. CL caused by _L. major_ is found in and around Damascus. VL caused by _L. infantum_ is found in the northwest in the provinces of Al Ladhiqiyah, Idlib, and Halab.

The reservoirs for _L. tropica_ are humans, and not all cases are treated, and the study by Alvar et al. estimated that the human reservoir is increasing. The reservoirs for _L. major_ are small rodents and for _L. infantum_, dogs.

Leishmaniasis is transmitted to humans by the sandfly, _Phlebotomus_, and it was expected that the number of cases would increase during the civil war. Breakdown of vector control programmes, an expected decrease in the number of human cases treated, and general poor housing conditions and crowding will increase transmission.

With the increasing numbers of refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, cases can be expected in these countries as well. ProMED will be happy to post any further information on the number of cases.
