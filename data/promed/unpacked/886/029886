[The following is extracted from the OIE COVID-19 Q&A section (last updated 31 Jan 2022):

"There is no evidence that companion animals are playing an epidemiological role in the spread of human infections of SARS-CoV-2. However, as animals and people can both be affected by this virus, it is recommended that people who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 virus avoid close contact with their companion animals and have another member of their household care for them. If they must look after their companion animals, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask, if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 virus should be kept indoors in line with similar lockdown recommendations for humans applicable in the country or area. There is no justification in taking measures which may compromise the welfare of companion animals.

"As a general good practice, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented when handling and caring for animals. This includes handwashing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, being licked by animals, or sharing food." - Mod.CRD
