Reemergence of Plasmodium vivax Malaria in the Republic of Korea. Brian
H. Feighner, Son Il Pak, William L. Novakoski, Lori L. Kelsey, and
Daniel Strickman, U.S. Army, Republic of Korea
_Plasmodium vivax_ malaria re-emerged in the Republic of Korea in 1993. The
number of cases has tripled each year since, with more than 1,600 cases
reported in 1997. All 27 cases in U.S. troops resolved uneventfully with
chloroquine/primaquine therapy. Disease is localized along the western
Demilitarized Zone and presents minimal risk to tourists.
