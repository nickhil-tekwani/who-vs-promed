Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is being blamed for an increase in admissions at Auckland's Starship Children's Hospital, as many as 3 a day. The current strain is unusual in that it is infecting adults as well as children, says Dr Michael Shepherd, clinical director of Starship's emergency department. "The strain we've got at the moment is more severe," he said on Firstline this morning [6 Jun 2013].

Dr Shepherd says HFMD is a fairly common disease that most children will get at some stage but isn't usually as serious as some other infectious diseases, which is partly why it persists, says Dr Shepherd. "We've tended to focus vaccines on illnesses that cause long-term consequences. HFMD hasn't quite reached that threshold. We worry more about measles and chickenpox, and things like that. I think that it's pretty unpleasant to get it, but I think in terms of seriousness, it doesn't cause a whole range of long-term consequences. But I think it's causing quite a lot of distress and problems for the community generally, particularly with kids being out of daycare and off school."

HFMD typically manifests as a rash on a child's hands, feet and mouth, but the current strain seems to affect other parts of the body too. "It can be a more diffuse rash, a bit more all over your body," says Dr Shepherd. "The rash is typically a blistering-type rash, a little bit like chicken pox. Often the mouth lesions are the real problem in terms of getting fluid into kids; it's very painful."

The worst thing that can happen is that a victim's nails can fall off. Dr Shepherd says it's "pretty dramatic" and unusual, but they do grow back again. "If you think your child had HFMD, it would be nice if you didn't take them to daycare," he says. "We ask people to keep them away until their fever has gone away and until they're not getting any new lesions and the old ones have scabbed over or started to heal up."

[HFMD occurs worldwide, and several different enteroviruses have been associated with outbreaks of HFMD. Since 1997, however, large outbreaks of HFMD caused by human enterovirus 71 have been reported, mostly in children in east and Southeast Asia, and cases of flaccid paralysis have occurred in Cambodia associated with a particular strain of human enterovirus 71. In these outbreaks, most children have typical symptoms of HFMD and recover without complications. However, a small number of children with this disease have developed severe complications requiring prolonged hospitalization or, rarely, death. These cases have been associated with prevalence of a particular strain of human enterovirus 71, a genogroup C4a strain. This strain was 1st identified in Cambodia and more recently detected in Australia.

It would be relevant to establish whether this strain is responsible for the current outbreak of HFMD in Auckland. Exceptionally, cases of poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis have been associated with this particular strain. Further information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP
