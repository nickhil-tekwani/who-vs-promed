["Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is considered to be a disease caused by infection with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV; synonym: Egtved virus).

"VHS is a disease of farmed rainbow trout, farmed turbot, farmed Japanese flounder, as well as a broad range of wild freshwater and marine species caused by VHSV, a virus belonging to the genus _Novirhabdovirus_, within the family Rhabdoviridae. All VHS virus isolates can be identified by immunochemical tests using the monoclonal antibody IP5B11.

"Diseased fish may display nonspecific clinical signs in the early stages of infection, including rapid onset of mortality (which can reach up to 100% in fry); lethargy; darkening of the skin; exophthalmia; anaemia (pale gills); haemorrhages at the base of the fins, gills, eyes, and skin; and a distended abdomen due to oedema in the peritoneal cavity. In the chronic state of infection, affected fish do not in general exhibit external signs. VHS can also occur in a nervous form, characterised by severe abnormal swimming behaviour, such as constant flashing and/or spiraling."

In 2017, Slovakia reported VHS in the same location where the current outbreak is located. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=24176. - Mod.CRD
