The comment below comes from the "OIE Global Situation report of African Swine Fever," Report No. 1, period 2016-2018 (update 4 Oct 2018), available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/Report_1._Global_situation_of_ASF_Updated_191018.pdf:

"The 1st occurrence in China in 2018 represents a threat to the Asian region. In this context, the work of GFTADs Global Steering Committee in empowering regional alliances in the fight against transboundary animal diseases (TADs), in providing capacity building and in assisting the countries establishing programmes for the specific control is of pivotal importance for the control and eradication of the disease at global level.

Member Countries are reminded that the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code provides comprehensive guidance to Veterinary Authorities for establishing a country, zone and compartment free of African swine fever (ASF) as well as recommendations relating to the trade of pork and pork products. These products, when handled in accordance with hygienic practices complying with international standards, are not a source of infection. The OIE also encourages Member Countries to implement enhanced national sanitary measures on waste disposal from aircrafts/vessels/passengers and enhanced on-farm biosecurity measures, including the protection of pigs from untreated swill feeding and the effective separation between domestic pigs and wild boar, and stresses the importance of OIE international standards for risk management of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) to reduce the risk of exporting disease to trading partners." - Mod.CRD
