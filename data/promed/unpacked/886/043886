[Further to the previous messages posted on PACNET related to the possible
occurrence of dengue cases in Samoa, the following message has been written
by the moderators, based on official communications with the Samoa
Department of Health. We would like to thank Dr. Eti Enosa, Director of
the Department of Health, in Apia, Samoa, for giving us permission to
disseminate the information on PACNET - YS/TK

Occurrence of an outbreak of dengue type 2 in Samoa.
After an increase of monthly reported cases of dengue-like illness between
March and August this year (altogether 30 cases at the end of August),
another 27 clinical cases of suspected dengue were reported in September by
the Health Department. Laboratory confirmation and virus typing have been
obtained on 9/32 specimens, from the WHO Collaborating Center for
Arbovirus, in Queensland Health Department (Dr. Debbie Phillips). Out of
two suspected related fatalities, one was confirmed as being subsequent to
a dengue infection. [No further information on severe cases (DHF or DSS)
has been made available so far - YS/TK
A comprehensive public health response has been rapidly put in place, under
the supervision of a National Dengue Control Committee, chaired by Dr.
Nu'ualofa Potoï, Acting Chief Division of Public Health. Particular
emphasis is placed on vector control at the community level, on
strengthening public and professional awareness on dengue signs and
symptoms, and on the actions to be taken accordingly at the different levels.
Presently the number of suspected new cases seems to stabilize, and the
situation is thought to be under control.
[Thanks to Dr. Souares for completing this picture for our readers. Every
child born in an area where dengue is endemic or which is at risk for
dengue (just about everywhere competent mosquito vectors occur) is a
potential victim and amplifying host. This problem is not going away.
