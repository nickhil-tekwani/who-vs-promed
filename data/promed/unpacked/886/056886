Rates of sexually transmitted infection could rise in some of Adelaide's most disadvantaged communities in the long term because of a decision to close community sexual health clinics, a public health organisation has warned.

SHINE SA (Sexual Health Information Networking & Education South Australia) currently runs four clinics across Adelaide, which provide sexual health services, offering key advice about contraception and support to people with unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is blaming a decision to close 2 suburban clinics in the city's north and south, as well as an HIV counselling service in Adelaide's CBD [central business district], on SA [South Australia] government funding cuts flagged in September's [2018] state budget.

"It is with regret that we give you this early warning of pending SHINE SA clinic closures at Davoren Park and Noarlunga, planned to occur in February 2019," the organisation said in a statement. "The sexual health sector has been one of the hardest impacted sectors."

SHINE went into more detail in a letter, telling its staff and collaborators it had lost [AUD] 547 000 [about USD 400 000] per year in funding and that "we now unfortunately find ourselves forced to close" the 2 clinics. "We fully appreciate that this significant loss of service will create difficulties for our partners, colleagues, and collaborators who have been ... working with us to deliver seamless services to people in the north and the south over many years," it said. The funding cut coincides with a syphilis outbreak being declared in Adelaide last week, which has prompted SA Health to issue an alert to medical practitioners.

Figures showed 49 people had been diagnosed with syphilis in the state's far north and west, and Eyre Peninsula, since the outbreak was declared in those areas in November 2016. A further 15 cases have been diagnosed in metropolitan Adelaide, with an increase in carriers in the past 6 months.

The government has expressed surprise at SHINE SA's decision to close clinics, conceding it had cut funding but calling on the organisation to reconsider. "Similar services interstate are operating more efficiently. We think there are more opportunities for SHINE to access Medicare revenue," health minister Stephen Wade said. "They need to think again about how they can more cost-effectively deliver services. It's a 9 per cent reduction in the grant but they're talking about a 50 per cent reduction in their clinics. I really question their decision to close the northern clinic and the southern clinic -- 2 areas where there is a particularly high socioeconomic need."

The president of the national Public Health Association's SA branch, Kate Kameniar, said the syphilis outbreak demonstrated why there was such a strong need for SHINE SA's clinics to remain open. "The risk is that we will see a resurfacing of some of the conditions and concerns we've had previously," she said. "In north Queensland, there was recently an outbreak of syphilis which has been a terrible outbreak that has spread down to South Australia and other states. Tragically, 6 babies died in that outbreak."

Mr Wade said the SA government was working with the federal government and Aboriginal health agencies to address the syphilis outbreak. He said "as far as I know" that SHINE SA was not involved in combating syphilis in the remote north west of the state, where Aboriginal health groups delivered those services.

Key points
----------
- A syphilis outbreak has spread to Adelaide [capital of the Australian state of South Australia/SA].
- There have been 64 cases reported in SA, including an infant, since 2016.
- An outbreak of the disease started in Queensland in early 2011.

SA Health issued an alert to medical practitioners, advising the syphilis outbreak had formally been extended to Adelaide after previously being in place in the state's Far North, Eyre Peninsula, and western regions. [See ProMED-mail. Syphilis - Australia (02): increasing cases, congenital, indigenous 20181030.6119580.] The outbreak began in regional Queensland in 2011, and since then thousands of people across 4 states have been infected. The federal government's response to the outbreak -- which includes rapid response tests -- is yet to reach South Australia. It has been rolled out in regional centres in Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia.

SA Health communicable disease control director Louise Flood said there had been a "small but sustained increase in syphilis cases in metropolitan Adelaide over the past 6 months. All doctors are advised to offer syphilis testing to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to assist in controlling the outbreak," Dr Flood said. "Locating, testing, and treating the partners of infectious people is also important in controlling syphilis. We are working with the Commonwealth as part of the Multijurisdictional Syphilis Outbreak Working Group to monitor the outbreak and coordinate the public health response."

SA Health figures showed 49 people had been diagnosed with syphilis linked to the outbreak in the Far North, Eyre Peninsula, and western regions since the outbreak was declared in those areas in November 2016. A further 15 cases have been diagnosed in metropolitan Adelaide, with an increase in carriers in the past 6 months. Among the cases diagnosed in regional South Australia last year [2017] was an infant born with congenital syphilis -- the 1st baby to be born in the state with the potentially fatal disease in 18 years.

In October [2018], health professionals told the ABC it would take years to bring the infection rate down nationally, and called for the government to fund a sustained and long-term prevention program combining sexual health education with training.

According to Federal Health Department data, there have been more than 2300 syphilis cases notified across the 4 jurisdictions. Up to 7 babies have died. SA Greens [green political party] MLC [member of the Legislative Council] Tammy Franks said urgent action was needed from both levels of government to get the outbreak under control. "We have a plan to tackle this, but that plan is lacking in both resources and rollout," she said. "We know what to do, but we're not doing it. The national strategy should be bringing this under control and clearly the government needs to give more resources as a priority to this. It's just unbelievable that in 2018 we're seeing syphilis diagnosed in a capital city."

SA health minister Stephen Wade said the state government would "continue to do what we can try to deal with this outbreak. One of the things we've done is to establish a South Australian syphilis register to strengthen our capacity to treat and follow up confirmed and probable cases of infectious syphilis," continuing: "We'll continue to work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and with other health professionals and organisations to make sure our resources are targeted for the maximum impact on this outbreak."

A federal Health Department spokeswoman said it was engaged in discussions with SA Health, the Aboriginal Health Council of SA and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services about the outbreak, as well as "potential sites and approaches to rollout of the syphilis-enhanced response in the state". "It is important to note that outbreak response is primarily a state responsibility," she said.

The alert sent out by SA Health warned that the highly infectious disease could be transmitted from pregnant mothers to their unborn babies, which could result in perinatal death, premature delivery, and congenital abnormalities. In South Australia, there have been 5 cases of infectious syphilis diagnosed in pregnant women.

Syphilis also increases the risk of HIV infection, and if left untreated can cause long-term damage to internal organs. It can usually be treated with antibiotics including penicillin.

[The news reports above add 5 additional cases to the 44 cases of syphilis that were reported in ProMED-mail. Syphilis - Australia (02): increasing cases, congenital, indigenous 20181030.6119580 in South Australia's Far North, Eyre Peninsula, and Western regions since November 2016. Now, a further 15 cases are being reported in metropolitan Adelaide, for a total of 49 cases in South Australia. The syphilis outbreak is occurring in the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people (Indigenous Australians) and cases of infectious syphilis include pregnant women with one reported case of congenital syphilis.

70 per cent of the indigenous population live outside major cities, of which about a third live in remote communities, where access to health services is likely to be poor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians): "Only 20 per cent of Aboriginal people who live in remote communities of more than 50 people have access to a doctor on a daily basis according to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures from 2006. A further 41 per cent have local access to a doctor once a week or once a fortnight" (http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/health/hospitals-doctors-health-aboriginal-people#ixzz3fk6Jag2m).

The Far North is a remote, least populated area in the north western corner of South Australia; Port Augusta is the largest community in the region (http://www.rdafn.com.au/our-region). A map showing the location of the Far North can be found at http://www.rdafn.com.au/content/images/RDAFN%20MAP.JPG. The Eyre and Western Region includes the Eyre Peninsula, a triangular peninsula, and the coastline extending west to South Australia's border with Western Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_South_Australia#Far_North). The city of Adelaide is the state capital with an estimated population of over 1.3 million residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide).
