Mumps outbreak reported on QU campus
------------------------------------
The Adams County Health Department (ACHD) and Quincy University (QU)
say several cases of mumps have been reported on the college campus.
In a press release, QU officials said students have received
information about mumps and are being given the opportunity to get
vaccinations to reduce the risk of contracting the mumps. The press
release stated the department does not consider this cluster of cases
will increase risk of mumps disease to the general public "since cases
are limited to a single localized population."

Jerrod Welch, director of clinical and environmental services for the
ACHD, says the number of cases of mumps is believed to be under 10.

"Mumps is a disease that by the time you have symptoms, you are no
longer contagious or very contagious," Welch said. "The symptoms
usually resolve themselves within a number of days."

Mumps is an acute viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms may
include fever, headache, muscle ache and swelling and tenderness of
the salivary glands under the ears or jaw on one or both sides of the
face. Infection takes place through direct contact with respiratory
droplets from the nose or throat, through saliva, coughing, sneezing
or from any surface contaminated with mumps virus. Because it's a
viral infection, mumps does not respond to antibiotic treatment. QU
students and faculty have been provided with a campus contact hotline
number for questions or concerns about mumps. Welch urged people who
believe they have mumps or any communicable disease to contact their
health care provider by phone. "The thing we least want to do is
expose people by going into a waiting room," Welch said.

[Quincy University is an independent, coeducational, primarily
undergraduate institution which is rooted in the Catholic and
Franciscan tradition. It is located In Quincy, Illinois. The student
population numbers approximately 1300.

Outbreaks of mumps virus infection occur frequently where young adults
are housed in close contact on university campuses. Such outbreaks are
generally a consequence of either deficiencies in MMR vaccination
coverage in the home communities of the students, or the lesser
immunogenicity of the mumps virus component of the MMR vaccine. -
