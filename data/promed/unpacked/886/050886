Croatia
-----
This is the 1st time that WNV cases have been reported in humans in Croatia. In July and August 2012, WNV cases were reported in horses in Vukovar-Syrmia region. In 2011, a low intensity of WNV was found in horses through serological testing. A higher intensity of WNV was found through seroprevalence surveys in horses in the eastern and continental parts of the country.

On 17 Sep 2012, 5 probable West Nile cases in humans were reported by the Croatian National Institute of Public Health in the East of the country: 4 autochthonous WNV cases:
- One was in Slavonski Brod, and 3 were in Osijek-Baranja and Vukovar-Syrmia, at the border with Serbia.
- One imported WNV case from Serbia in Slavonski Brod. Seroneutralisation tests are in process.

Kosovo
-----
This is the 1st time that human WNV cases have been reported in Kosovo. No equine WNV case has ever been reported in the country. Considering that WNV is circulating in several Balkan countries neighbouring Kosovo since 2010, the occurrence of WNV human cases in Kosovo was not unexpected. A permanent, passive human WNV surveillance system has been implemented in Kosovo.

On 19 Sep 2012, one confirmed WNV case and 2 suspect cases were reported by the National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo in the country.

Tunisia
-----
On 18 Sep 2012, the Tunisian ministry of health reported to EpiSouth 3 additional confirmed West Nile virus cases in humans:
- 2 women aged 29 and 33 years old from north of Kebili city (Rabra and Tombar, cf. map 3) were hospitalized at the end of August 2012 for fever, severe headache, and vomiting.
- An 80-year-old male farmer from Zeramine, Monastir governorate, was hospitalized on 1 Sep 2012 with meningocencephalitis.

The Pasteur Institute in Tunis confirmed that these 3 cases were infected with WNV. Samples of sporadic suspect cases in the Gabes area have been tested: 2 cases were negative, while 6 other cases are still under investigation.

The last WNV human case in Tunisia was reported on August 2012 in Ksar Helal, Monastir governorate. To date in Tunisia, a total of 4 WNV human cases were reported.

Italy
-----
On 13 Sep 2012, the National Centre for Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promotion reported 3 confirmed cases of WNV in Treviso province and 2 in Venice province.

[WNV human infections continue to occur in small numbers around the Mediterranean Basin. Croatia and Kosovo reported their 1st WNV human infection cases this year [2012]. ProMED-mail posted a report on equine WNV infections earlier in 2012 (see archive no. 20120823.1258325) and human cases in Italy (archive no. 20120906.1283932). This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of human WNV infections in Tunisia.
