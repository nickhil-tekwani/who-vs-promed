H7N9 patient saved from death bed
------------------------------
HANGZHOU: A man who contracted H7N9 bird flu was discharged from hospital in east China's Zhejiang Province on Friday after facing death for days. The 38 year old is the first H7N9 patient with severe symptoms to recover. He was treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in the city of Hangzhou.

"I must thank the medics. They pulled me back from the verge of death. They let me live again," the patient said while leaving the hospital in which he had stayed for 22 days. The medics, advised by an expert panel consisting of more than 20 top doctors, decided to treat Cao with life-support systems that replaced the functions of his liver and lungs, as no H7N9 patients with symptoms as severe as his had been saved.

Nine other H7N9 patients were also discharged on Friday from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.

[3] Diagnostic & Treatment protocols
Date: Sun 5 May 2013
Sources: As indicated below

Several official organisations have formulated Diagnostic and treatment protocols for human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9)
---------
These can be accessed a follows:

http://www.chinacdc.cn/en/research_5311/Guidelines/201304/t20130425_80443.html
http://www.chinacdc.cn/en/research_5311/Guidelines/201304/W020130425363145259626.pdf

Human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) are known to cause acute and severe respiratory illness and death. The first known human case became ill on February 19, 2013 and through April 11, 2013 38 cases with nine deaths have occurred, all in Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang. The cases are distributed in a sporadic manner.
It is recommended to detect early, report early, diagnosis early and treat early severely ill patients with efficacious medicines, emphasizing the comprehensive effects from both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. These measures play a vital role in effective prevention and control, improving the cure rate, and reducing mortality related to avian influenzas A (H7N9).
