WASHINGTON, D.C. - Yuasa Trading (America) Inc. pleaded guilty to three
misdemeanor counts of the Federal Seed Act on Nov. 14, 1997, for
smuggling rice and agreed to pay a $550,000 fine. This sends a
tremendous message to companies that jeopardize U.S. agriculture and the
national food supply by smuggling plants and plant products into this
country, said Michael V. Dunn, assistant secretary for USDA's marketing
and regulatory programs. Companies that break the law may face criminal
prosecution and heavy fines.
Yuasa Trading admitted that on at least three occasions from March 26 to
April 8, 1997, it shipped illegal rice from Japan to employees of
Quality Rice Management, Inc. or California Pacific Rice Milling, Ltd.
On Oct. 22, 1997, the California Pacific Rice Milling, Ltd. pleaded
guilty to a felony count of smuggling and agreed to pay a $550,000 fine.

Officers of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a part of
USDA's marketing and regulatory programs mission area,
intercepted 82 boxes of paddy rice at an Oakland U.S. Postal
Service mail facility between March and April 1997. Mislabeled as
canned goods, these boxes were shipped from six different addresses in
Japan to ten people in northern California, eight of them California
Pacific employees. APHIS' plant protection and quarantine and
investigative and enforcement services officers worked cooperatively
with the U.S. Attorney's office, U.S. Customs Service, and Colusa County
Agriculture Commission to disband this smuggling circuit.
APHIS is constantly trying to deter smuggling activities because illegal
shipments present serious risks of introducing plant pests and diseases
into the United States, said Terry L. Medley, administrator of APHIS.
APHIS prohibits the importation of paddy rice from all countries because
it poses a significant risk of introducing exotic rice diseases. Each
time a foreign pest or disease is established in the United States, it
places the costs of ridding the disease onto American consumers, as well
as threatens our food supply, said Dunn.
