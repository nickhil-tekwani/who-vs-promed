The Department of Health (DoH) in Bicol is not only dealing with COVID-19 but also with bacteria and parasites that cause various diseases and infestations, specifically among farmers wading in farmlands here.

[A 29-year-old] father of 2 from Tula-Tula Granda, Ligao City, could still be toiling his half-hectare farmland, but his life was cut short by leptospirosis. [He] died in December [2021] due to leptospirosis based on the medical certification issued by Dr. Tirzo de los Reyes, attending physician from Zone Medical and Intervention Hospital Inc. in Ligao City. [The farmer] was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure secondary to acute kidney injury and leptospirosis on 24 Nov 2021. He was a computer science graduate but opted to become a farmer, his aunt said. His aunt, who is based in Australia, was the one who encouraged him to plant cassava and vegetables but noted that he might have waded in infected puddles near the farm.

Noemi Bron, DoH Bicol Health and Promotion chief, said that [in 2021] at least 13 Bicolanos died due to leptospirosis. As many Bicolanos wade in farms and flood water, the DoH urged the public to take extra precautions to prevent getting the deadly disease.

Based on DoH Bicol cumulative number of cases from 1 Jan to 18 Dec 2021, there are 136 reported cases of leptospirosis with 13 deaths. Among the 6 provinces of Bicol, Camarines Sur has the highest number of cases with 97, followed by Camarines Norte with 14; Sorsogon, 8; Albay, 7; Catanduanes, 5; and Masbate, 3.

Leptospirosis, a bacterial, water-borne disease, is a disease of epidemic potential, especially after heavy rainfall or flooding. Bron said it can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death when not treated properly. She said people and animals can get infected when they are exposed to the urine of infected animals. They can also get infected from water, soil, or food contaminated with infected animal urine.

The _Leptospira_ bacterium can enter the body through the skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth). Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, jaundice (yellow eyes and skin), red eyes, and skin rash.

[Leptospirosis is an infection transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, freshwater swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals.

Bicol is an administrative region of the Philippines, designated as Region V, which consists of 6 provinces: 4 on the Bicol Peninsula mainland (the southeastern end of Luzon) -- Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Sorsogon -- plus the offshore island provinces of Catanduanes and Masbate. The regional center is Legazpi City (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicol_Region).
