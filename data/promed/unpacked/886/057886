Uganda's Ministry of Health said on Wed 21 Aug 2013 that a 27-year-old woman in Kampala had died after contracting the deadly Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The woman was married to a South Sudan-based Ugandan trader who had suffered from the disease while in South Sudan and had recently returned to Uganda, where he is receiving additional treatment.

In a statement on Mon 19 Aug 2013, the Ugandan health ministry declared that the fever, which was 1st reported in northern Uganda, was under control. "The Ministry of Health informs the general public that the situation regarding CCHF is under control with no new confirmed cases reported since the outbreak was announced on 16 Aug 2013," the statement reported.

But by Wednesday [21 Aug 2013], the Ministry was announcing the 1st death in the country from the fever. The deceased woman is not thought to have come into contact with the earlier reported cases of the fever in northern Uganda. Ugandan health authorities suspect she contracted the disease from her husband who had recently returned from South Sudan. South Sudan has not officially declared an outbreak of CCHF in the country.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says CCHF causes severe fever outbreaks and has a fatality rate of up to 40 percent. The WHO adds that the disease is transmitted to humans from ticks and from human to human via blood, secretions, and body fluids from affected persons. There is no vaccine available for either humans or animals.

[The Ugandan Health Ministry said on Friday [16 Aug 2013] that 3 people have died in northern Uganda from a suspected outbreak of CCHF [ProMED-mail: Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Uganda: (AG) fatal 20130816.1885056]. A male farmer is still being treated as a confirmed case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and the 3 other deaths are being investigated, junior health minister Elioda Tumwesigye told a news conference. The Ministry said it was tracking 6 other people who had come into contact with the sick farmer, who is being treated at Kalongo Hospital in Agago district, 450 km [280 miles] north of the capital Kampala, and that an isolation facility had been set up.

Subsequently, it was reported that the Ministry of Health informed the general public that a hemorrhagic fever outbreak had been confirmed in Omot sub-county, Agago district. Following tests done by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), Entebbe, the samples obtained from one person have tested positive for CCHF virus infection [ProMED-mail: Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Uganda (02): (AG) conf. case 20130819.1888823].

Most recently, Mulago hospital in Uganda confirmed their 1st case of CCHF [ProMED-mail: Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Uganda (03): (KM, AG) fatal 20130824.1899673]. The ministry of health confirmed that CCHF has claimed the life of one female, aged 27. The deceased was admitted at Mulago Hospital. Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the Director-General of health services, said the patient was admitted on 16 Aug 2013 with severe anemia, vomiting, headaches, and inter-menstrual bleeding.

The current report reveals that the recent fatality is unconnected with the outbreak in northern Uganda and that the deceased woman contracted CCHF infection from her husband, recently working in South Sudan.

This report reveals for the 1st time that CCHF is present in South Sudan. - Mod.CP
