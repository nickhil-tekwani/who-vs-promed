Indonesia: Human avian influenza death toll reaches 56
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia recorded 2 [more] bird flu cases on Monday [13 Nov 2006] with one
fatality, bringing the total death toll to 56 out of 74 infected people in
the vast [Indonesian] archipelago, the Health Ministry said.
A 2-and-a-half-year-old boy, who died on Monday [13 Nov 2006] morning after
3 days in hospital, and a 35-year-old woman were confirmed by laboratory
tests [in Indonesia to have contracted avian influenza], said an official
of the Anti-bird flu Center of the Ministry. Both [victims had] been
treated in Jakarta's designed bird flu hospital [Sulianti Suroso], the
official said. "The results of their tests are positive for bird flu; the
boy died at 6:00 this morning," the official told Xinhua. The boy, who was
from Kerawang in West Java province, had a history of contact with fowl,
but the [source of infection] of the woman, who was from Tanggerang, in the
outskirts of Jakarta, was still not clear, said the official.
Indonesia, which has been hit the hardest, has become one of the front
lines in the fight against the H5N1 virus. Concern over the country's top
position in terms of the number of victims of the virus has [placed] the
bird flu [outbreak] at the top of the agenda for the forthcoming meeting
between U.S. President George W. Bush and his Indonesian counterpart Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono in Bogor, a town near Jakarta, on 20 Nov 2006, Indonesian
presidential spokesman Dino Pati Djalal said. The huge territory of
Indonesia, [the extent of] back yard centered farming and the relatively
sparse budget have hampered the authorities of Indonesia in fighting avian
influenza.
