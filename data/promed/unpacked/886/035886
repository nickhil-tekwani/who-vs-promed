News of the response
Social mobilization
-------------------
Motorcycle taxis are the main means of transportation for people in the city of Beni, and they have agreed to get involved in raising public awareness about Ebola virus disease. The communication and mobilization committee of Beni organized information sessions for the various biker associations present in Beni to make them aware of the disease, the methods of prevention and the risks involved in transporting patients. Handwashing kits were placed in several biker parking lots in the city. Stickers with messages of awareness and the green numbers were distributed to the bikers moving on the 4 priority road axes, namely, Beni-Mangina, Beni-Butembo, Beni-Oicha and Beni-Kasindi.

Vaccination
-------------------
Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 6820 people have been vaccinated, including 3338 in Mabalako, 2047 in Beni, 1067 in Mandima, 121 in Oicha, 107 in Butembo, 70 in Katwa and 19 in Kinshasa.

[Because motorcycle taxis are so commonly used, they present a major risk factor for transmission of virus between sick and healthy individuals, especially as they are used to transport potentially infectious people. But it may be that unrest in the region serves to limit taxi usage, thereby decreasing risk of infection of this class of workers. Nonetheless, it is important that taxi drivers are vaccinated against Ebola virus, in addition to being given handwashing kits and educated on means of prevention and risk, but all steps minimizing risk help limit spread of the virus. - Mod.LK]

- Fri 7 Sep 2018. Disease Outbreak News from WHO [edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/7-september-2018-ebola-drc/en/

1 Sep 2018 marked one month since the declaration of this Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Good progress has been made in detecting and responding rapidly to new cases, and providing protection and therapeutics when appropriate. However, significant risks remain that could lead to further spread of this outbreak: reluctance by some communities to adopt Ebola prevention measures, transmission in health care facilities because of weak infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, delays in patients reaching Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) once they develop symptoms, and potential for the virus to spread to insecure areas that will be more difficult to access.

In recent weeks, we observed a slight increase in case incidence (see Fig. 1 in source file). The focus of transmission has shifted from in and around Mangina in Mabalako Health Zone to the city of Beni; 15 of the 22 confirmed and probable cases in Beni, as well as at least 3 confirmed cases in other health zones, have been linked to a single transmission chain. Since the last Disease Outbreak News on 31 Aug 2018 (data as of 29 Aug 2018), 13 new EVD cases (12 confirmed and one probable) were reported, including 8 confirmed and one probable from Beni, 2 from Mabalako, and one each from Mandima, Butembo and Masereka health zones. Although the situation has significantly improved in Mangina and Mandima health zones, sporadic cases are still being observed. The risk of spread was heightened by the movement of 2, subsequently confirmed, cases from Beni to the city of Butembo and a nearby village in Masereka Health Zone (see Fig. 2 in the source file). Given the mobility of populations in the affected areas, these 2 cases were expected, rapidly detected and additional response measures swiftly activated to interrupt further spread of the virus.

As of 5 Sep 2018, 129 EVD cases (98 confirmed and 31 probable), including 86 deaths (55 confirmed and 31 probable) have been reported in 7 health zones in North Kivu Province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene and Oicha), as well as Mandima health zone in Ituri Province (see Fig. 2 in the source file). Although cases have been recorded in other areas, recent confirmed transmission events were localized to Beni, Mabalako and Mandima health zones. Of 123 probable and confirmed cases with known age and sex, adults aged 35 to 44 years (24%) and females (58%) accounted for the greatest proportion of confirmed and probable cases (see Fig. 3 in the source file). A total of 17 cases have been reported among health workers, of which 16 were laboratory-confirmed: Mabalako (14), Beni (one) and Masereka (one). All health worker exposures occurred in health facilities in Mandima and Beni outside of dedicated ETCs, and 2 health workers have died. In addition to confirmed and probable cases, 7 suspected cases from Mabalako (5), Beni (one), and Mandima (one) are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude EVD.

The presence of response teams and the implementation of Ebola control measures have by and large been accepted and supported by local communities in the affected areas. In some areas, challenges remain. Teams are continuing to address sporadic instances of reluctance toward response activities.

Instances of insecurity and conflict in the immediate vicinity of response activities are also being monitored closely. WHO and UN security teams ensure that internal safety policies and procedures are strictly observed and complied with. The UN policy for the use of armed escorts (as applied in past outbreaks) continues to be observed with the use of military escorts in separate vehicles only when required, but with no direct involvement of security personnel in the response operations.

Public health response
-----------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces. WHO and partners are also conducting preparedness activities in neighbouring countries.

More than 4500 contacts have been registered to date, of which over 2100 have completed 21 days of follow-up evaluation. As of 5 Sep 2018, 2265 contacts remain under surveillance, of which 93% to 97% were followed up daily during the past 7 days. In some areas, contact tracing teams have faced various degrees of community refusal, but also insecurity and challenges posed by the continuous movement of contacts.

As of 6 Sep 2018, 44 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 10 rings of health workers and other frontline workers. These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of the 52 most recently confirmed cases. To date, 6830 people consented and were vaccinated, including 1746 health care or frontline workers and 1762 children.

As of 5 Sep 2018, WHO has deployed 194 experts to support response activities, including logisticians, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, communicators, clinical care specialists, community engagement specialists and emergency coordinators. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the response as well as readiness and preparedness activities in nonaffected provinces and neighbouring countries.

The subnational Health Cluster Coordinator who was deployed in Kananga through the Standby Partner (SBP) NORCAP has been reassigned to North Kivu to support the EVD response. Efforts are ongoing to backfill positions through additional SBP deployments. SBPs are also prepared to support and deploy health professionals for EVD preparedness and response activates.

ETCs are fully operational in Beni and Mangina with support from the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). In Beni, ALIMA is planning to expand treatment cube capacity over the next 2 weeks. A 20-bed ETC is being constructed in Makeke (Ituri Province) with the support of International Medical Corps (IMC), which is expected to be operational during the week of 9 Sep 2018. A 7-bed MSF transit centre is already operational in Makeke. Samaritan's Purse continues to support the isolation unit in Bunia with infection, IPC and isolation training.

ETCs continue to provide therapeutics under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with the MoH and the Institut National de Recherche Biom√©dicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical clinical expertise onsite and is assisting with the creation of a data safety management board. As of 6 Sep 2018, 27 patients have received investigational Ebola therapeutics, including mAb114 (13 patients), remdesivir (9 patients) and ZMapp (5 patients).

A team of IPC specialists is holding daily training with health care and frontline workers, assessing and decontaminating facilities and providing essential hand hygiene solutions and personal protective equipment. A team of experts deployed by WHO are supplementing local capacity, working with dozens of health care centres to see where there are gaps, and providing training and supplies as needed. They are assisting the health centres to set up triage to ensure that patients with suspected EBV can be separated and treated away from other patients, to decrease transmission risks.

The MoH, WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Red Cross and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in Beni, Butembo and Mangina. Local leaders, religious leaders, opinion leaders and community networks such as youth groups and motorbike taxi drivers are being engaged to support community outreach for Ebola prevention and early care-seeking through active dialogues on radio and interpersonal communication. Local frontline community outreach workers are working closely with Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care and safe and dignified burials (SDBs).

As of 6 Sep 2018, more than 642 religion leaders, traditional healers, magistrates/judges and teachers were oriented to support the encouragement of community members to practice Ebola prevention measures, seek early treatment and assist with surveillance, SDB and other response measures.

The Red Cross of the DRC, with support from the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), is coordinating SDB. As of 6 Sep 2018, the Red Cross has established 3 operational bases in Beni, Mangina and Butembo; in total, 9 SDB teams are operational, and initial training has been conducted for teams in Bunia and Mambasa. To date, 112 SDBs are reported to have been successfully conducted.

Health screening has been established at 45 points of entry (PoE). More than 2 million travellers have been screened at these PoE.

WHO risk assessment
-----------------
This outbreak of EVD is affecting northeastern provinces of the DRC that border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g., cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis) and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels, and low globally.

As the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advice
-------------
WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the DRC based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no countries have implemented any travel restriction to and from the DRC. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

[The entire report is included here because it is a thorough and comprehensive summary of the DRC outbreak situation to date. It is basically a very positive report but does recognize risks that are exacerbating control of the outbreak, including "reluctance by some communities to adopt Ebola prevention measures, transmission in health care facilities because of weak infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, delays in patients reaching Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) once they develop symptoms, and potential for the virus to spread to insecure areas that will be more difficult to access." It brings up the very real threat of spread beyond the borders of the DRC, and the infrequently discussed issue of other disease problems in the region, such as cholera and vaccine-derived poliovirus, and not mentioned but also health problems are malaria and measles, among others. Even without Ebola, these diseases are problems in areas of insecurity in the country and world but exacerbated by Ebola. It should be noted that the MSF emergency coordinator in Beni, Berangere Guais, said the latest epidemic is at a crucial point. "...the number of patients in the treatment center has reduced significantly, but new cases from a number of different chains of transmission have emerged in recent days," as reported in CIDRAP 7 Sep 2018 (Submitted Rapportuer.Mary Marshall). - Mod.LK]

- Fri 7 Sep 2018. North Kivu: Death of a suspected Ebola patient in Luoto (Lubero, NK, DRC)
Radio Okapi [in French, online trans., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/09/07/actualite/sante/nord-kivu-mort-dun-malade-suspecte-detre-atteint-debola-luoto

A patient suspected of having Ebola died Thu 6 Sep 2018 in Luoto in the health zone of Masereka in Lubero territory. According to the administrator of the Lubero territory, Patrick Nyembo wa Nyembo, who delivered the information, the deceased patient came from Beni. He also denounces what he describes as the diversion of the vehicles of administrators of North Kivu territories.

"There is a case of probable death of the Ebola virus disease, from a gentleman who came from Beni. We continue to work. And you know here in Lubero we live the consequences of armed groups on a daily basis, and today nature imposes the situation of Ebola. But we face the logistical problems because there are teams that should necessarily go to Luoto," said Patrick Nyembo wa Nyembo.

According to the Ministry of Health, 127 cases of haemorrhagic fever have been reported in the Beni region, of which 96 are confirmed and 31 probable. The coordination of the response recorded a 1st confirmed death in the town of Butembo.

[Excerpted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubero
Location
---------
The town is lies at an average altitude of 1900 m (6200 ft), in the Virunga Mountains, at the western edge of Virunga National Park, close to the international border with Uganda. Lubero lies approximately 210 km (130 miles) by road north of the provincial capital of Goma. This location is approximately 98 km (61 miles) by road southwest of Beni, the nearest large town. The coordinates of Lubero are: 0 deg 09'18''S, 29 deg 14'0''E (latitude: -0.1550; longitude: 29.2400).

Overview
---------
Lubero is a medium-sized town with several modern amenities, including an airport, Lubero Airport, with a grass runway. In the hills around the town, a mini-hydropower station, Lubero Hydroelectric Power Station, is planned to complement Mutwanga Hydroelectric Power Station and Rutshuru Hydroelectric Power Station, in supplying power to the communities in and around Virunga National Park. Like most localities in North Kivu, Lubero has witnessed plenty of violence as the various militias have battled each other for real estate and treasure during the last 2 decades. Battles have also been fought between the militias, government forces and UN peacekeepers. The toll in human lives has been high. Many have been left with physical disabilities. More suffer long-term psychological war trauma.

Population
---------
As of March 2014, the population of Lubero is not publicly known. - Submitted by Rapporteur Mary Marshall

It is important to note that the fatal case has not yet been confirmed as Ebola. There have been several suspected cases in which Ebola ends up being ruled out. - Mod.LK]

[2] Risk factors, health workers
- Fri 7 Sep 2018. Review of the literature, infection rates and risk factors for health workers.
Selvaraj SA, Lee KE, Harrell M, et al. Infection rates and risk factors for infection among health workers during Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks: a systematic review. J Infect Dis 2018. https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy435

Abstract
Background
Infection in health workers (HWs) has characterized outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Marburg virus disease (MVD). We conducted a systematic review to investigate infection and mortality rates and common exposure risks in HWs in EVD and MVD outbreaks.

Methods
We searched the EMBASE and PubMed databases to identify articles posted before 27 Dec 2017, with no language restrictions. Data on the number, frequency, and mortality of HW infection and exposure risks were extracted.

Results
[A total of] 94 articles related to 22 outbreaks were included. HW infections composed 2% to 100% of cases in EVD and 5% to 50% of cases in MVD outbreaks. Among exposed HWs, 0.6% to 92% developed EVD, and 1% to 10% developed MVD. HW infection rates were consistent through outbreaks. The most common exposure risk situations were inadequate personal protective equipment and exposure to patients with unrecognized EVD/MVD. Similar risks were reported in past EVD/MVD outbreaks and in the recent outbreak in West Africa.

Conclusions
Many outbreaks reported high proportions of infected HWs. Similar HW infection rates and exposure risk factors in both past and recent EVD and MVD outbreaks emphasize the need to improve the implementation of appropriate infection control measures consistently across all healthcare settings.

[This is an important epidemiologic study addressing the occupational hazard of being a health worker (HW) where highly infectious diseases, specifically as Ebola and Marburg, occur. It is always unfortunate when HWs become infected while treating patients and even more so when the cases are serious and even fatal. With the Ebola vaccine now available, these frontline workers can be vaccinated to protect them from serious disease. There are also various vaccine strategies in trial for Marburg virus. It is no surprise that nurses were the most highly affected because they are most directly involved in physical care of patients. As stated in the study, in the early stages of the West African Ebola outbreak, a time when clusters of cases were seen in HWs, there was likely "less awareness among HWs of circulating EVD and the precautions necessary to prevent infection, as well as lower stocks of appropriate PPE and limited numbers of Ebola treatment centers and trained staff relative to the size of the outbreak." Ideally, if HWs could be vaccinated preemptively in areas at risk, as well as before beginning work in the ETCs, clinics and hospitals for volunteers from other countries, that would afford them protection before actual direct contact with patients. - Mod.LK
