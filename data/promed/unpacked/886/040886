The NZ Government has just changed the law, so possession and spreading of
RHDV is no longer illegal. By not prosecuting the farmers, and enforcing
the law, many people are now asking, how good are our biosecurity laws? and
if these farmers can get away with bringing RHD into NZ, what's to stop
someone else who is not happy with their situation, from bringing other
exotic diseases in to New Zealand.

[I am posting this for the final sentence, the rest of the message had been
covered in previous postings. It is one thing for a government to be
behind the curve with respect to social issues but this RHDV introduction
incident brings to the fore more serious questions as to the proper role of
governments in governing. When farmers take things into their own hands in
a situation such as this one, the broader implications are obvious.
Frankly, I think this is a frightening development. -- Mod CHC]
