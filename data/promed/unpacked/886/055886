The following background information on botulism in Canada was
abstracted from Gideon:
The 1st outbreak of botulism in Canada was recorded in 1919.
- A total of 100 outbreaks involving over 230 cases had been reported to 2005.
- Canada's 1st case of infant botulism was reported in 1971.
Botulism is primarily encountered among the 1st Nations and Inuit people.
- Rates of 30 per 100 000 per year are reported among the Inuit.
- Most cases in recent years have been caused by fermented salmon roe
("stink eggs" or "gink") in British Columbia and fermented sea mammal
meat among the Inuit.
Disease rates are comparable to those of the Usa. See
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/botulism-canada.jpg> and
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/botulism1-canada.jpg>.
Notable outbreaks:
- 1974 - Outbreaks (10 cases in 4 outbreaks, 4 fatal) of type E
botulism among indigenous peoples were related to ingestion of
walrus, arctic char, seal and fermented salmon eggs.
- 1988 (publication year) - An outbreak (38 cases) in Vancouver was
caused by contaminated chopped garlic.
- 1995 - Outbreaks (16 cases in 7 outbreaks, 0 fatal) and one case of
infant botulism were reported - implicated foods included muktuk,
micerak (fermented fat of marine mammals), seal, walrus and
marinated/smoked fish.
- 1996 - Outbreaks (10 cases in 5 outbreaks, 0 fatal) of foodborne
botulism were reported - implicated foods included seal, fermented
fish, beluga whale and micerak.
- 1997 - Outbreaks (18 cases in 7 outbreaks, one fatal) were
reported, including 9 cases in Quebec acquired from seal and 4 cases
in the Northwest Territories acquired from beluga whale and caribou fat.
- 2001 - Outbreaks (4 cases in 2 outbreaks, one fatal) in British
Columbia were ascribed to fermented salmon roe.
