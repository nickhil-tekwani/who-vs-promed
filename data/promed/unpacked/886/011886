More than 30 people have been confirmed sick in Sweden with salmonella infections since early October 2021. The national monophasic _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium outbreak has affected 33 people. Whole genome sequencing has shown that patients have the same strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium, so are suspected of having been infected by a common source of infection. Affected local infection control units, the Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) and the Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhalsomyndigheten) are investigating the outbreak.

The source of infection has not been found but is believed to be a food with a wide distribution in Sweden. Cases range in age from 2 to 89 years old with a median age of 29. They live in 7 different regions of Sweden. Sixteen people younger than age 18 and 13 more older than 60 have been infected. Women make up 21 cases and 12 men are ill.

Monophasic _Salmonella_ Typhimurium was in the top 3 for the causes of salmonella patients infected in Sweden in 2020.

[The serovar Typhimurium (4,[5],12:i:1,2) is the most frequently isolated serovar in case of salmonellosis in Europe, and its monophasic variant (4,[5],12:i:-) has been increasingly responsible for salmonella outbreaks in humans.

The source of this outbreak is not yet known. ProMED would appreciate more information about this cluster of cases. - Mod.LL
