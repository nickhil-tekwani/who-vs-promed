Hawaii: Dengue Fever Update
---------------------------
As of 15 Mar 2002, Hawaii state health officials reported one additional
recent case of dengue fever and 6 cases that occurred last year but were
not confirmed by laboratory testing until 2002. The single recent case
occurred in February 2002 in Haiku, Maui, and 5 of the cases from last
year occurred among residents of Hana, Maui. The other case from last
year occurred in early December [2001 in a visitor from New Mexico
who stayed in a private residence in a forested area of Hana.
A total of 118 cases of dengue fever have been reported since 10 Jun
2001. Of these, 77 occurred in the Hana area. Overall, the severity of
illness has been relatively mild and the outbreak appears to be waning.
Available data suggest that the risk of dengue infection to most visitors
to Hawaii is very low. Nevertheless, returning travelers who develop
any dengue-like illness are encouraged to inform their Health
Departments and health care provider of a potential exposure to this
illness.

Ecuador: Dengue/DHF and Malaria Epidemics Unleashed in Coastal
Provinces
----------------------------------------------------------------------
According to a spokesperson from the State Tropical Medicine
Secretariat in Guayaquil, the intense rainstorms that have hit the coastal
provinces of Ecuador beginning Feb 2002 have unleashed epidemics of
dengue/DHF and malaria.
The spokesperson reported that, to date, there are 816 cases of
suspected dengue fever, 23 of which have been confirmed [including 2
cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). [The Ministry of Health
indicated that an additional 21 cases of suspected DHF are being
investigated. [The vector mosquitoes have increased because of the
intense rainstorms that have affected the coastal provinces of Guayas,
Manabi, El Oro, Los Rios, and Esmeraldas during the past weeks.
The Tropical Medicine Secretariat revealed that cases of Asiatic
[serotype 2 and serotype 3 dengue virus infection have been
identified, and that they probably reached Ecuador through Venezuela
and Central America. The spokesperson remarked that in 2001, 4
persons died of type 2 dengue virus infection in this region. The
severity of the winter season has forced the government to declare a
state of public health and economic emergency in the coastal states as
well as in 2 Andean states also affected by torrential rains.
Patricio Hernandez, Deputy Director of the Infectious Diseases Hospital
in Guayaquil, noted that the case curve for both malaria and dengue
fever would show a doubling during the second trimester of this year.
He further explained that climatologic changes and a decrease in
rainfall starting in April [2002 would facilitate the propagation of
disease-transmitting vectors in stagnant water in large and small spaces.
[It is estimated that in Guayaquil alone there are 1.5 million water
storage tanks, of which 70 per cent are potential breeding sites for
[mosquitoes. However, people do not give adequate care to water
storage facilities. Tanks are not adequately covered and are left either
open or covered with wood wrapped in plastic.

[The Ecuadorian authorities are to be commended for their continuing
practice of recording the types of dengue virus in circulation in dengue
fever outbreaks in Ecuador. Similar information from elsewhere would
enhance the value of these dengue fever outbreak updates. - Mod.CP

Cuba: Dengue Virus Declared Eradicated
--------------------------------------
President Fidel Castro declared victory in his government's military-
style campaign against dengue fever during a ceremony honoring those
whose efforts helped wipe out the mosquito that spreads the virus.
"The dengue virus has been eradicated in our homeland," Castro said
late on Wed 27 Mar 2002 after handing out diplomas to representatives
of groups recruited for the campaign. "Today is a day of satisfaction
for all residents of the capital and the entire country."
Cuba had earlier reported 2 deaths among dengue cases in Havana in
recent months. Castro on Wed 27 Mar 2002 confirmed that was the
final fatal toll.
The Cuban leader on 12 Jan 2002 launched a highly organized and
widespread education and fumigation campaign aimed at wiping out
the mosquito that [transmits the virus. ... During the campaign in
Cuba, homes and other buildings, especially in the hard-hit capital of
Havana, were repeatedly sprayed over a period of more than 3 months,
sometimes several times a week. Cuba's government-controlled
newspapers printed educational articles about clean-up efforts,
alongside a logo of a mosquito in a circle with an "X" through it.
Because the virus was seen here as a matter of national security,
cooperation in the campaign was obligatory. Residents who refused to
let their homes be fumigated were sometimes fined.
Cuba suffered a serious dengue epidemic in 1971 that made more than
400 000 people sick. During another dengue epidemic 10 years later,
Cuba reported 350 000 cases.

[Cuba's dengue epidemics have occurred at irregular intervals: 1971
(type 1), 1981 (type 2), 1997 (type 2) & 2002 (type 3). If the country
has the misfortune to import type 4, & is unable to maintain control of
_Aedes aegypti_, which is continually arriving on its shores in small
boats, imported tires and other cargo, they will suffer again. - Mod.JW

Dengue cases double those of first quarter last year
---------------------------------------------------
Dengue cases reported in Brazil in the first quarter of the year [2002
were more than twice the number of those in the same period last year,
the local press reported Sunday.
Between January and March this year [2002, 317 787 cases of dengue
were reported in Brazil, compared to 153 148 in the same period last
year, according to a report published Sunday by the daily Folha de Sao
Paulo, based on health department data from each of the states in the
country.
The newspaper says that if the disease spreads at last year's rate, [it
could break the 1998 record, when 559 237 cases were confirmed.
Hemorrhagic dengue has killed 59 people around the country in the
first quarter of the year, more than doubling the 28 deaths last year, and
could exceed the 75 deaths reported between 1990 and 2001, according
to Health Ministry data.
The hardest-hit state is Rio de Janeiro, with 129 920 cases, accounting
for 41% of the national total and more than quadrupling the number
reported in the first quarter last year [2001.
There were 1373 cases of hemorrhagic dengue reported between
January and March [2002, of which 1271 (53%) were in Rio de
Janeiro. Rio has the highest number of deaths from hemorrhagic
dengue, with 47 cases.
The campaign against dengue has mobilized various sectors of
Brazilian society, including the army, whose members in some states go
house-to-house to eliminate breeding [sites of _Aedes aegypti_, the
mosquito that carries the disease.
