[1] Ugandan doctors deployed to Liberia

A team of Ugandan doctors and health workers are deployed by WHO to provide medical support for an Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia, Liberia. This team comes with vast experience in managing Ebola outbreaks, having faced many cases of this disease since 2000. They work shifts alongside their Liberian colleagues to provide around the clock care and to help maintain strict infection control measures. ...

[The 1st African doctor from outside West Africa to die from the current EVD pandemic was also Ugandan. Dr Samuel Muhumuza Mutooro (Dr Sam) and his wife and children had been living in Liberia for 3 years under a pre-epidemic contract; see ProMED-mail: Ebola virus disease - West Africa (78): Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia 20140702.2583396. - Mod.JW]

[2] China: new EVD antiviral drug
Date: 1 Sep 2014

China's 1st drug against EVD has obtained manufacturing approval for emergency use, a military newspaper reports. The drug, named JK-05, was developed by Professor Wang Hongquan with the Institute of Microbiological Epidemiology under the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, according to the PLA News.

"JK-05 is a micro-molecular chemical, and its pharmacological mechanism is to selectively contain the RNA polymerase of the Ebola virus to inhibit virus replication," Wang told the newspaper.

Wang's study showed JK-05 resisted the replication of Ebola cells in experiments and animal tests. The drug, after 5 years of study, has passed pre-clinical testing and the clinical safety test. However, the drug currently is strictly limited for emergency use only, Wang said.

[3] Prevention, suspected cases

Nigeria: fatal case in Abuja
----------------------------
1 Sep 2014: (iREPORTS-NG) A suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD) patient has [died] in one of the biggest government-owned hospitals in Abuja, Asokoro General Hospital, in the nation's capital city, barely 3 weeks after another suspected patient died in a private hospital [there]. The death, which was said to have occurred last weekend [30-31 Aug 2014] has already caused serious panic in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). In a statement released yesterday [31 Aug 2014], spokesperson of FCT Health Secretariat Badaru Salisu Yakasai said the results of the tests conducted on the deceased have yet to either confirm or refute claims that the patient died of EVD.

Sweden: negative
----------------
1 Sep 2014: (MSN News NZ) A man suspected of being infected with the deadly ebolavirus ravaging several African countries has tested negative in Sweden, local health officials say. "We analysed the tests and can say there is no sign whatsoever that the patient was suffering from EVD," a statement said. The man, a foreign national who travelled to Sweden from an EVD-affected area last week, was hospitalised on Sun [31 Aug 2014].

Sudan: hemorrhagic fever case in Darfur
---------------------------------------
31 Aug 2014: (StarAfrica) The minister of health affairs for the Darfur Regional Authority, Firdos Abdel Rahman Yousif, denied reports of the deadly Ebola virus disease in El Geneina, capital of West Darfur State. The Sudan News Agency quoted the minister as saying the suspected case had come from Abeche in Chad. The patient suffered from hemorrhagic fever, began taking treatment from the health center, and was then transferred to a hospital in El Geneina, she claimed. ...

[There have not been any reports of EVD or any other hemorrhagic fever in Chad, but yellow fever (YF) needs to be excluded, because there was an outbreak of YF in 2012 in Darfur, Sudan, which also affected Chad, and 6 million people were vaccinated in Darfur in 2013; see ProMED-mail: Yellow fever - Africa (12): Sudan (Darfur) 20130302.1567578.

It is highly unlikely that EVD has arrived in the region, as I don't think there is much human through traffic all the way from Bamako in Mali, just north of the Guinean border, and the Chad-Sudan border, around 4000 km (2500 miles) further east by the trans-African highway (see map at: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Map_of_Trans-African_Highways.PNG), nor many air passengers from West Africa via Khartoum. If anyone has information to the contrary, ProMED-mail would be glad to receive it. - Mod.JW
