Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has so far claimed more than 3 dozen
cattle over the past 2 weeks in Gulmi district.

As many as 40 livestock have perished in 12 VDCs, including Tamghas,
Arkhale, Hastichaur and Jaisethok, where the deadly disease is said to
be raging, and a large number of people are in the dairy business.

Around 150 cattle have been vaccinated against the disease by the
District Livestock Office, said Resunga Conservation Committee, a
social organization working to control the cattle disease.

Worried over the situation, the livestock office has been making
efforts to fight the disease.

It is unknown where the disease was 1st reported.
