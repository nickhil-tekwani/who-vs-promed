25 workers in Penang suffering from malaria.

Twenty-five Indonesian construction workers, including three women, have
been admitted to the Penang Hospital with malaria, sparking fears of an
outbreak in the state. But health officials assured that the situation was
under control, saying that it was contained in a residential area and
ruling out an outbreak. Northeast District Health Officer Dr Yasmin
Sulaiman said the infected workers were among 59 who came for blood tests
on Monday and were admitted to prevent the disease from spreading,
according to Bernama.
A [52 year-old local resident from Batu Lanchang who lives 1 km from the
workers' quarters, was also admitted with malaria on Tuesday. A police
spokesman told The Sun that a policeman's seven-year-old son was also
admitted with malaria over the weekend. The boy lives in his father's
quarters at the Farlim police station opposite the construction site.
Bernama quoted Penang state director of health, Dr Zainul Hamzah, as having
said that the outbreak was caused by Indonesian construction workers who
brought the disease into the state. Health authorities have initiated four
preventive measures in Bandar Baru Air Itam Farlim -- fogging, residual
spraying at the area, blood screening and medication for other workers.
The health authorities have advised the public, especially those living in
the Farlim area, to take precautions. Following the case, Dr Yasmin said
the authorities had intensified efforts to trace others who might be
suffering from the disease, caused by mosquitoes. She said the department
had contacted the Indonesian consulate to seek its co-operation to conduct
blood tests on other Indonesian workers in the state. Until recently,
Penang had been free from malaria for the past 10 years. Universiti Sains
Malaysia Vector Control Research Unit coordinator Associate Professor Dr
Zairi Jaal has ruled out a malaria outbreak in the state because the "most
efficient vectors" of the disease were not found in the state.
"[A malaria epidemic in Penang is unlikely as there aren't many reservoirs
for the protozoa in the state, unlike in the east coast areas. The
population of the vectors in the state are not all high," he told The Sun.
"We have to look at the situation in total as we do not know where the
Indonesian workers have been or whom they have come in contact with. In
fact, they may have contracted the disease in their country as malaria is
endemic there."
