Lumpy Skin Disease in cattle in Turkey: Preliminary Outbreak Assessment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
-----------------
Turkey has reported an outbreak of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) in a cattle holding in Kahramanmaras Province. There were 15 cattle in the affected holding, of which 9 were clinically affected, and 2 of these died. According to the disease report, suspicions were raised when cattle developed a fever and died. Skin nodules seen beforehand had been put down to an allergic reaction to mouldy food [see comment]. Disease control measures are in place and vaccination will be applied (OIE, 2013. Lumpy Skin Disease, Turkey. Immediate Notification Report Number: 14106; Date: 17 Sep 2013).

2. Situation Assessment
-----------------------
Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a [capri] pox virus of cattle and buffalo which is mainly transmitted by insect vectors (as mechanical, not biological vectors), but also by direct contact and contact with infected body fluids. The vectors involved have not been easily identified, but the involvement of _Stomoxys_ (stable flies), _Culex_ or _Aedes_ (mosquitoes), _Tabanidae_ (horse flies) and _Glossina_ (tsetse flies) has been implicated. Outbreaks therefore occur where fly density is high, during heavy rainfall or along river systems.

LSD is generally considered a significant production disease in cattle, as the mortality rate is relatively low, but infection damages the hides and affects beef and milk production. It is endemic in some countries bordering the Middle East, such as Egypt, and has more recently caused outbreaks in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine, while Syria is also understood to have outbreaks. Turkey has not reported LSD before.

In Israel the disease has circulated for several months and appears to have been brought under control by vaccination with a LSD-specific vaccine. Initially a sheep pox vaccine was used, which appeared to have a limited effect [see comment].

Turkey at present has been reporting outbreaks of other ruminant diseases, namely FMD [foot-and-mouth disease], PPR [peste des petits ruminants] and sheep and goat pox. This new outbreak of LSD is not entirely surprising given the proximity to Syria and the movement of refugees as well as the transhumance which takes place in the region. The source of infection (infected live animals or movement of vectors) and the possibility of further vector transmission are not known at present. Turkey shares a border with the EU and the latest reports of outbreaks of sheep pox as a result of likely movement of wild or pastoral animals across the Evros river into Northern Greece highlights the importance of this region for transboundary diseases.

Turkey is not on the approved list for export to the EU in live cattle or products of animal origin for human consumption. The exports of hide are only permitted if the hides have come from an approved establishment, been treated (dry or wet salt) and kept separate for 21 days. The virus can persist for months in untreated cattle hides, but the hide from an infected animal would be poor quality because of the nature of the infection. Any treated hides are considered negligible risk. According to TRACES, the EU trade notification system, there have been no consignments of treated cattle hides entering the UK from Turkey in the last few months.

3. Conclusion
-------------
Lumpy skin disease is spreading across the Middle East region, and given the political situation and level of human movement, including transhumance, animal diseases may spread relatively easily.

Although the risk of introduction into the UK has not significantly increased as a result of this outbreak, it highlights the general concerns about the Middle East and East Europe with respect to transboundary diseases. We will continue to monitor the situation.

The relatively long time-span between the start of the Turkish LSD event (reportedly, 6 Aug 2013) and the date of the pre-confirmation of the event (13 Sep 2013), with allergy initially suspected, should not surprise. On 20 Aug 1989, an experienced, well-equipped, knowledgeable veterinary practitioner was called upon a 4-year-old, lactating dairy cow on a dairy farm in southern Israel, the owner complaining about decreased milk production. He initially diagnosed it as a case of allergy, then (24 Aug 1989) allergy and urticaria. The cow eventually deteriorated to "severe urticaria, edema of lungs and legs" (15 Sep 1989). By that day, several similar cases began to appear on the same and neighbouring farms. This eventually led the attending practitioner to involve experts; soon, the preliminary diagnosis of the 1st occurrence in Israel of an exotic, unfamiliar cattle disease, lumpy skin disease, was established. Electron microscopy was followed by other laboratory means. The outbreak was limited to one village (63 clinical cases out of a susceptible population of 633 cows, negligible mortality). The outbreak was eventually eradicated by stamping out on 29 Sep 1989. The event may serve as another reminder to veterinary clinicians about their ever-required alertness and awareness, as well as about the potential advantage of timely call upon specialists, if available, when addressing a "mystery" disease.

Regarding the vaccines applied during 2013 for cattle vaccination in Israel, subscribers are reminded that general, countrywide vaccination of cattle has become operational there since March 2013 and the incidence of disease has dropped abruptly, though sporadic cases are still being seen. Two live attenuated vaccines have been applied, namely the (10-fold fortified) sheep pox vaccine "POX-10," manufactured by JOVAC, and the Neethling lumpy skin vaccine, manufactured by OBP. Investigations into the safety and efficacy of both vaccines under field conditions have been undertaken cooperatively by the State Veterinary Services, the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, and the "Hachaklait" Clinical Veterinary Services. Preliminary results are expected.

A media report of LSD in Turkey, including a picture of a local diseased animal with the typical lesions (http://tinyurl.com/pp33dwj), was published by ProMED-mail on 31 Aug 2013.

Turkey's immediate notification on LSD was submitted to the OIE on 17 Sep 2013. It indicated "vaccination in response to the outbreak" as "a measure to be applied." Information on the applied vaccination (and, if possible, on the vaccine applied) is anticipated in the due follow-up reports. - Mod.AS
