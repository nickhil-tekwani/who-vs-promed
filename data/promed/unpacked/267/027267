A Sudanese man suspected of having avian influenza has now tested
negative for the virus, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on
Thu [20 Apr 2006].

Sudanese health officials reported on Tue 18 Apr 2006 that the man
had avian influenza, according to local test results. But a team of
WHO experts sent immediately to the country with a mobile laboratory
tested the man's sample and found no trace of the virus, WHO
spokeswoman Maria Cheng said. "The sample came back negative," she
told Reuters in Geneva. The man, a poultry farmer, remains
hospitalised in Khartoum in stable condition, she added. It was not
immediately clear what illness he was suffering from.

"There are no other suspect cases. There aren't any other people
under observation," Cheng said. Sudanese officials had said the man
and 5 chickens had proved positive for avian influenza but did not
say if the virus was the deadly H5N1 strain. The infected chickens
were found at 2 farms in Sudan's Khartoum and Jazeera provinces. The
man owned one of the farms.

The H5N1 strain of bird flu has been found in neighbouring Egypt,
where national health authorities have reported 4 deaths among 12
cases. [To date, the WHO has confirmed 2 human deaths among 4 cases
in Egypt: see below. - Mod.CP]

Worldwide, the WHO has confirmed 110 deaths among 196 cases of bird
flu since 2003.
