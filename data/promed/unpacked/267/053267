Costco's El Camino Real store in South San Francisco, California, is recalling 9043 units (approximately 39 755 lbs.) of rotisserie chicken products that may be contaminated with a strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg, the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 12 Oct 2013.

The products subject to recall are:
- 8730 "Kirkland Signature Foster Farms" rotisserie chickens,
- 313 total units of "Kirkland Farm" rotisserie chicken soup, rotisserie chicken leg quarters, and rotisserie chicken salad.

The products were sold directly to consumers in a Costco located at 1600 El Camino Real, South San Francisco, CA, between 11 Sep 2013 and 23 Sep 2013.

This recall was initiated due to concerns about a group of _S._ Heidelberg illnesses that may be associated with the consumption of rotisserie chicken products prepared in and purchased at the Costco El Camino Real store. The PFGE [pulsed field gel electrophoresis] pattern (0258) associated with this outbreak is reported rarely in the USA. FSIS, working with the CDC, the California Department of Public Health and the County of San Mateo Public Health Department, determined through epidemiologic and traceback investigations that there is a link between the Costco El Camino Real rotisserie chicken products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC, public health partners in California and Costco on the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available.

This group of illnesses is part of a larger cluster of _Salmonella_ Heidelberg illnesses that are known to be multi-drug resistant. For more information about the larger cluster, visit http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. Costco has already taken steps to contact every customer who purchased rotisserie chicken products. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/current-recalls-and-alerts.

Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact Costco at (800) 774-2678.

FSIS reminds consumers to properly handle raw poultry in a manner to prevent contamination from spreading to other foods and food contact surfaces.

FSIS further reminds consumers of the critical importance of following package cooking instructions for frozen or fresh chicken products and general food safety guidelines when handling and preparing any raw meat or poultry. In particular, while cooking instructions may give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each side of the product in order to attain 165 deg F [74 deg C] internal temperature, consumers should be aware that actual time may vary depending on the cooking method (broiling, frying, or grilling) and the temperature of the product (chilled versus frozen) so it is important that the final temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] must be reached for safety. Please do not rely on the cooking time for each side of the product, but use a food thermometer.

All poultry products should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] as determined by a food thermometer. Using a food thermometer is the only way to know that food has reached a high enough temperature to destroy foodborne bacteria.

Recommendations for preventing salmonellosis
--------------------------------------------
Wash hands before and after handling raw meat and poultry with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes, and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.

Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing.

If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.

Keep raw meat, fish, and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures (160 deg F [71 deg C] for ground meat such as beef and pork and 165 deg F [74 deg C] for all poultry, as measured with a food thermometer) before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within 2 hours after purchase (1 hour if temperatures exceed 90 deg F [32 deg C]). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within 2 hours after cooking.

Investigators are still unsure how cooked rotisserie chicken sold at a Costco store in South San Francisco, CA, was contaminated with a strain of salmonella involved in a national outbreak linked to Foster Farms brand poultry. At least one person was sickened by one of the chain's roasted chickens, prompting Costco to order a recall over the weekend [12-13 Oct 2013] of nearly 40 000 pounds of rotisserie chicken products sold between 11 Sep 2013 and 23 Sep 2013 from the store at 1600 El Camino Real.

The Department of Agriculture and Foster Farms have assured consumers that poultry contaminated with salmonella is safe to eat so long as it is cooked to a minimum of 165 deg F [74 deg C]. Costco rotisserie chicken is cooked to at least 180 deg F [82 deg C], said Craig Wilson, Costco's vice president for food safety.

"It was well-cooked," Wilson said in a phone interview Mon 14 Oct 2013. How someone got sick is "part of the mystery." He added: "It may have been a very, very uncommon cross-contamination issue. We're still researching." Wilson said the company contacted 7807 customers who had bought one or more of the recalled products. So far, no one else has reportedly fallen ill, he said.

Consumer advocates have called for a mandatory recall of Foster Farms chicken, but the poultry producer and the USDA say such a move is unnecessary. Costco is currently carrying new batches of Foster Farms chicken. The only other major chain to pull Foster Farms poultry was Kroger Co, parent of Ralphs and Food 4 Less. The supermarket company removed chicken from the 3 Foster Farms plants linked to the outbreak. The chicken in question can be identified in supermarkets with USDA marks of inspection P6137, P6137A, or P7632.

Since March 2013, 317 people have been sickened by a surge in _S._ Heidelberg, which has been tied in the past to human illness. The CDC said the strain was particularly virulent and, at times, resistant to antibiotics. It's one of the reasons people are being hospitalized at twice the rate as in a typical salmonella outbreak, experts say.

The USDA threatened last week [week of 7 Oct 2013] to close the 3 Foster Farms plants, but it chose not to when presented with plans to clean up the facilities. 2 of the plants are in Fresno and one is in Livingston, CA, where the company is headquartered.

CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said it was unlikely a properly cooked chicken could sicken someone with salmonella. It's more common for prepared foods to be undercooked, she said. One potential cause: The Costco warehouse with the recall roasts 1000 chickens a day, a number Wilson said was extremely high compared with other stores. "We have to figure out if there was a slip-up in procedures," he said.

[If the chicken was adequately cooked, the most reasonable scenario for the roasted product to be a salmonellosis vehicle would be contamination post-cooking with bacteria-contaminated surface, utensils, or raw chicken itself. Only one case, to this point, has been linked to the cooked chicken and it has not been reported if positive cultures have been obtained from unopened packages of the chicken. - Mod.LL
