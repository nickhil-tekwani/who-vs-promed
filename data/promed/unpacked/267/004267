A Response to the Query about the Accuracy of Diagnosis of West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot comment on the cases seen at the Nebraska lab [see: West Nile
Virus, caprine & ovine - USA (NE) (03) 20020919.5356], but the "proof" in
Wyoming is the following on one of the clinically affected mountain goats:
Positive virus isolation from the brain.
Positive TaqMan RT-PCR from the brain.
Positive immunohistochemistry on the brain.
Appropriate microscopic lesions in the brain.
As an aside, there is no IgM capture ELISA test commonly available for
mountain goats or sheep -- these tests are species specific, and for mammals
(of the non-human variety) the only readily available test at most labs is
for equines.

Further information from Nebraska
---------------------------------
Both of these animals [see: West Nile virus, caprine & ovine - USA
(Nebraska) 20020914.5306] tested positive by IHC in the brain, as well as by
PCR on brain tissue. The National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in
Ames IA confirmed our PCR findings and isolated virus from brain tissue of
both animals as well. They also confirmed an serum neutralization titer of >
1:100 in the ovine serum.
Unfortunately, after our initial posting, all further discussion has taken
place on the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians
(AAVLD) list serve. Sorry for the lack of follow-up. Here in Nebraska we are
so buried in West Nile virus cases that these kind of follow-ups have
slipped through the cracks. We have also observed 2 squirrels with positive
IHC staining in the brain as well as positive PCRs.

Further Clarification on West Nile Virus in Mountain Goats and Sheep
--------------------------------------------------------------------
On 13 Sep 2002 the following information was posted. The Lincoln Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory of the University of Nebraska announced today that
samples from a mountain goat and a sheep have been shown to be positive for
West Nile Virus (WNV). Samples from both animals were positive on the
Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for WNV. The
samples were also positive by immunohistochemistry for WNV. The PCR results
were confirmed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) and
virus isolation results are pending at NVSL.
The National Veterinary Service Laboratory (NVSL) has now confirmed that
West Nile Virus was isolated from both the sheep and mountain goat samples
by virus isolation(VI).
Summary: The NVSL has confirmed West Nile virus in samples from a sheep and
a mountain goat by: (1) Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR), (2) Indirect immunofluorescence assay using a monoclonal antibody
specific for WNV, and (3) Virus Isolation.
