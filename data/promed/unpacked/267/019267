Deaths from Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever in Honduras
----------------------------------------------------
TEGUCIGALPA: In the last 3 months there have been at least 10 deaths caused
by the epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Honduras, and hundreds of
persons [have been affected, reported the [health authorities today.
"In addition there are 185 cases that [remain unconfirmed or will not be
confirmed until January," said Guadalupe Romero, Director of Epidemiology
of the Health Secretariat at a press conference. He added that in the year
2000, there were 711 suspected cases nationwide. Of these, 306 were
confirmed, exceeding [prior estimates.
He added that: "This makes us consider that the epidemiologic situation [is
not under control." In 1999 there were only 60 cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever reported in Honduras. Nevertheless, the disease has
caused 17 deaths in the country since 1995. Romero stated that the
majority of cases were detected in the [heavily populated poor
neighborhoods of Tegucigalpa [the capital city, usually in children less
than 12 years old. The 28 governmental hospitals have been working at
their maximum capacity since October, especially in their pediatric wards.
In addition, as of 6 Dec 2000, there were 6000 cases of classic dengue
fever reported in Honduras. In 1995, classic dengue fever affected more
than 28 000 Hondurans; in 1996 there were 7500 cases; in 1997 12 000 cases;
and in 1999 11 000 cases.
On 27 Oct 2000 more than 1.2 million public employees, soldiers and
students were mobilized for 15 hours by the government to fight dengue in
Honduras, in a campaign that was designated as D-day. Romero stated that:
"The epidemic has diminished with the arrival of the cold season in
November because the mosquito that transmits dengue [cannot survive in
colder weather. The government declared a preventive health alert status
on 4 Oct 2000 as a result of the epidemic. It also maintains an intensive
campaign, insisting that the population eliminate standing water in their
households in which the mosquito that transmits dengue fever, _Aedes
aegypti_, breeds.
