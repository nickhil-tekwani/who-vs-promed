The Manipur health department today declared an outbreak of Japanese
encephalitis [JE] in the state and sounded an alert among health
institutes and people residing in the affected areas. After issuing a
notification, director Y. Yaima asked all hospitals and medical staff
in private and government health institutes as well as people,
particularly in the 4 valley districts where the outbreak has been
reported, to be on maximum alert.

The department declared the outbreak of the disease after 34 of the
40 blood samples sent to the Regional Medical Research Centre,
Dibrugarh, and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New
Delhi, tested positive. Of the 40 samples, 27 were sent to the
Dibrugarh centre. Test results received by the state health
department today showed that 24 of the 27 samples had tested positive
for Japanese encephalitis.

"Of the 27 samples sent to Dibrugarh centre, 3 patients have already
died," the director said. The Delhi institute also informed officials
at the state health department over phone today that of the 13
samples sent to it, 10 had tested positive, sending alarm bells
ringing in the department. "Since 34 of the 40 samples tested
positive and many more people are reported to be suffering, we
consider this an outbreak of the disease. Therefore, we are issuing
the declaration," a senior official of the health department told
this correspondent.

The latest information received by the department says at least 88
patients from Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal and Bishnupur
districts have been admitted to 4 hospitals in and around Imphal
city. These are the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, the
government-run Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital and 2 private hospitals. The
department has issued guidelines to the hospitals on how to treat
patients affected by the disease. The director said since Japanese
encephalitis was a viral infection, there was no curative treatment.
The only way to deal with the situation was to continue with
symptomatic treatment.

Officials of the department said since the 1st report of suspected
cases of the disease came last month [June 2010], fogging had been
intensified in the valley areas to kill mosquitoes. Officials of the
department have also stepped up an awareness campaign called
information education campaign in these areas. The department
appealed to people residing in the affected areas not to expose
themselves to mosquitoes.

Official sources said the disease had been reported once in a while
in recent years but this was the 1st time that an outbreak of such a
magnitude had hit the state. They said the department was finalising
a strategy to control the outbreak.

The department will henceforth introduce mass vaccination programme
starting from November and December of this year [2010]. Among the
states of the country asked for taking up mass vaccination programme
by the Central government, Manipur [is] also included. As the
vaccination programme is normally not carried out when the disease
causing virus is active, the mass vaccination programme is to be held
in November and December, [the official] clarified.

The outbreak of Japanese encephalitis has claimed 3 lives while 5
other persons are suspected to have died of the disease, stated
Health and Family Welfare Minister Pheiroijam Parijat during the
Assembly session today [15 Jul 2010].

Responding to a call attention motion raised by MPP MLAs Dr Ng Bijoy,
RK Anand and Dr I Ibohalbi, Parijat said that 3 confirmed cases of
death due to Japanese encephalitis were reported from RIMS. However,
5 other fatal cases could not be confirmed whether they were caused
by Japanese encephalitis [virus] or not.

Out of around 75 people admitted in different hospitals for treatment
with symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, only about 4-5 people remain
in the hospitals.

It is said that apart from infections from mosquito bites at Khunthak
village claiming the life of a 14-year-old boy and scores still
awaiting hospitalisation, suspected JE cases has been spreading at
the Indo-Myanmar border village since the last few days. According to
Kasom Khullen Sub-division Development Association chairman Jojo
Robertson, out of the 9 persons infected in Khunthak village, the
condition of 4 is stated to be serious.

[This report suggests that the outbreak is continuing in rural areas
along the Indian-Myanmar border. It is not clear how many, if any, of
the cases in this report have been or will be laboratory confirmed as
JE virus infections. Since neither JE virus nor the _Culex_ mosquito
vectors of this virus will be constrained by international borders,
it would be of interest to know if cases are also occurring in
Myanmar. - Mod.TY]
