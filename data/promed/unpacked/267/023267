HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE - NIGERIA (02): (KWARA)

[A request for information (RFI) on the hemorrhagic disease outbreak reported in Nigeria was sent to EpiCore surveillance project volunteers. Below is a synopsis of the responses received. ProMED is grateful for the numerous Epicore and subscriber responses to the request for information on the mysterious disease with hemorrhagic manifestations characterized by "black vomit" that reportedly has killed approximately 74 people, mostly the Fulani people, in the Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara State, Nigeria. These responses have fallen into 3 categories. The 1st takes the middle road stating that the outbreak is real, but fewer than 10 people have died and only a single child has exhibited vomiting with hemorrhagic manifestations. The 2nd set is confirmation of the numbers and event; and the 3rd is absolute denial of an outbreak by the government and community. - Mods.LK/JH]

Responses to RFI:
[1] Apparent confirmation of outbreak with fewer victims
[2] Apparent confirmation of outbreak as originally described
[3] Government statement denying outbreak

[1] Apparent confirmation of outbreak with fewer victims
Date: 12 Aug 2017
Source: EpiCore Surveillance Project [edited]


Babalobi Olutayo stated "I am following-up initial information from a Kwara State based Fulani pastoralist who mentioned 17 fresh mortalities, all male, mainly Fulani but including 3 Yorubas, in the last 3 days in Oke-Ode village/settlement in Ifelodun LGA of Kwara State. They suspect ecological poisoning [meaning unclear] and are asking for post-mortem of mortalities. There is no report of animal mortality.

"I am expecting information from the Sarkin (Fulani Head) of the area.

"Share is the headquarters of the Ifelodun local government (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifelodun,_Kwara). Share (Saare) is an ancient Yoruba town in Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara State, Nigeria. The people of Share belong to the Igbomina extract of Yoruba tribe who are mainly harvest crops (including cassava and cocoa) and have had some reported clashes with Fulani pastoral farmers. I suspect some geographical location-related epidemiological factors."

[3] Government statement denying outbreak

The Kwara State Government on Friday denied a report that an outbreak of a mystery illness had claimed 70 lives in Oro-Ago in Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state. Suleiman Alege, the State's Commissioner for Health, said the report is a mere rumour as the ministry has no confirmed outbreak of disease or fatalities in any part of the state.

Mr. Alege said there are epidemiological systems for reporting suspected disease outbreaks in the state and that if any occurs, the State Health Response team would be the first to know and is always ready to swing into action.

The commissioner recalled that when there were reported cases of Cholera in some communities in the state, the state government immediately deployed emergency kits to the affected areas and also commenced vaccination in most of the state primary healthcare centers to forestall outbreak of an epidemic.

There had been unverified reports of outbreak of disease in the community on Thursday [10 Aug 2017].

But the commissioner noted that immediately the rumour of the strange disease broke on Thursday, the state Ministry of Health deployed a team from the endemic unit under the department of public health to Gaa Okuta community along Oke-ode road in Ifelodun Local Government area.

The team, however, found no evidence of any strange illness or casualties, he said. He disclosed that members of the community also insisted that there was no disease outbreak in the area.

He added that the community's water source was also tested to ascertain if there was any form of contamination.

Similarly, the Ifelodun council Chairman, Mukaila Ayinla, on Friday [11 Aug 2017] said the reports of the alleged disease outbreak in the community are false and should be disregarded.

A statement by Muideen Akorede, senior special assistant to the State Governor on Media and Communication, quoted Mr. Ayinla as saying the council was working on posting a new medical team to the primary health care facility in the area, following the transfer of the staff at the facility.

[A similar response was also received from an Epicore Surveillance Project member denying any outbreak was occurring. - Mod.JH]

ProMED-mail also thanks Irene Lai (<irene.lai@internationalsos.com>), affiliation: International SOS, for submission of this report in response to the RFI.

[If a diagnosis is received for the reported cases or a determination made that the cases are not real, ProMED will post what it learns about this situation in Nigeria. We appreciate Epicore members and ProMED subscribers having taken the time to submit what information they had available to them, and look forward to learning more as it becomes available. At this time, there appears to be no consensus of opinion as to the etiology, or whether there actually is an outbreak.
