China & Thailand: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 47
--------------------------------------------------
China
----
The Ministry of Health in China has confirmed a further case of human
infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case is a 31-year-old
female farmer from the north-eastern province of Liaoning. She developed
symptoms on 30 Oct 2005 and subsequently underwent extensive hospital care
for severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. She recovered and was
discharged from hospital on 29 Nov 2005.
Initial tests on this case produced negative results for infection with the
H5 virus subtype. Diagnostic confirmation was made following antibody
testing using a microneutralization test. Using this test, a positive
diagnosis is made when antibody levels in a blood sample taken late in
illness are at least 4 times higher than those found in a sample taken
early in illness. Diagnostic confirmation using antibody tests, though
reliable, is thus slower than that achieved using direct tests for virus RNA.
Beginning in late October 2005, Chinese authorities have reported several
outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in Liaoning
Province. Investigation of this case has linked the woman's infection to
direct exposure to diseased poultry. Agricultural authorities have detected
the H5N1 virus in samples taken from poultry in the province.
As a precaution, local authorities placed contacts of the woman under
medical observation pending definitive laboratory results. No signs of
influenza-like illness were detected, and all contacts have now been
released from observation.
This is China's 5th laboratory-confirmed case. Of these cases, 2 were
fatal. The cases have been reported from 4 provinces: Anhui, Hunan,
Guangxi, and Liaoning.
Thailand
--------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed a further case of
human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case occurred in a
5-year-old boy, who developed symptoms on 25 Nov 2005, was hospitalized on
5 Dec, and died on 7 Dec 2005. The child resided in the central province of
Nakhonnayok. A thorough investigation of this case is currently under way.
Early results suggest that the child may have acquired his infection from
dead chickens in the neighbourhood. His family members and neighbours have
been placed under medical observation. All remain healthy to date.
The child is the 5th laboratory-confirmed case in Thailand in 2005 and the
2nd death. Since Jan 2004, Thailand has reported 22 cases, of which 14 were
fatal.

A 5-year-old boy became Thailand's 2nd avian influenza fatality in 2
months, while Viet Nam announced 2 new outbreaks and China its 5th human
case amid concern that infection rates could soar this winter. The Thai
Health Authorities stated on Fri 9 Dec 2005 that lab tests showed the boy
died from H5N1 avian influenza, which international experts fear could
trigger a human pandemic if it mutates into a form easily passed between
people.
The boy, from Nakhon Nayok province district about 70 kilometers (45 miles)
northeast of the capital of Bangkok, was ill for 9 days prior to being
hospitalized. His parents failed to tell doctors that a relative raised
chickens at their house -- the likely source of exposure to the virus,
public health officials said. "We can confirm that he died from H5N1 avian
influenza," said Thawat Suntrajarn, Director-general of the Department of
Communicable Disease Control. The cause of death was not yet been confirmed
by the World Health Organization.
The boy's case was Thailand's 4th reported infection since October 2005,
and the 2nd death. They were Thailand's first new human cases of the virus
in a year, and coincided with fresh outbreaks in poultry in several parts
of the country. The WHO has confirmed 69 bird flu deaths and 135 infections
since late 2003 when the virus began sweeping Asia, and most of them have
been traced to contact with infected birds. m of flu
In Viet Nam, the country worst hit by avian influenza, the Agriculture
Ministry on Fri 9 Dec 2005 reported new outbreaks in 2 more provinces
which had killed or forced authorities to destroy some 10 600 chickens and
ducks. Avian influenza outbreaks have been reported in almost 1/3 of the
country since October, and more than 3 million birds have been culled
nationwide. Of the total [human] bird flu deaths, 42 have been in Viet Nam.
Agriculture Minister Cao Duc Phat urged people not to avoid eating poultry
because of bird flu fears, which he blamed for 700 billion dong (US$ 44
million) in losses each month in the industry. "We need to have specific
actions to help poultry farmers sell their products and limit their
losses," Phat was quoted as saying in Friday's state-owned Pioneer
newspaper. "Eating chickens is a way to help farmers to overcome this
difficult time."
Meanwhile, the [Chinese] official Xinhua News Agency reported that a farmer
in northeast China tested positive for the H5N1 virus, but recovered after
being hospitalized. The 31-year-old woman fell ill on 10 Oct 2005 in
Heishan County in Liaoning province, making her the country's 5th confirmed
human case, the Xinhua stated. She suffered a fever and pneumonia-like
symptoms, and developed breathing problems after she was hospitalized, but
responded to treatment and she was discharged 29 Dec 2005. While China has
mounted an aggressive campaign to fight bird flu, repeated outbreaks have
been reported in poultry flocks, increasing the potential risk to humans.
Since 19 Oct 2005, the authorities have reported 25 bird flu outbreaks in
poultry around China. Tens of millions of birds have been culled and
vaccinated as a precaution. 2 farmers in the eastern province of Anhui died
of the disease in November 2005, while a 9-year-old boy in central Hunan
province recovered. A 10-year-old girl in southern Guangxi province was
also hospitalized and has undergone emergency treatment.
