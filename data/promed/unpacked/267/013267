MAD PIG DISEASE? (03)
=====================

Given the normal rate in humans of 0.5-1.5:1,000,000 of sporadic
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD), and the occurrence of many other
transmissible spongiform encephalophathies (TSEs) in other species (sheep,
mink, deer, elk) and the susceptibility to cross-species direct or indirect
infections (mice, monkeys, cats, swine), it is illogical (although
understandable) to take the position that such diseases absolutely do NOT
occur in particular species (poultry, swine) or particular countries (US,
Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France) simply because no post-mortems
have conclusively shown evidence of disease.
The USDA has performed ~ 7,000 brain and spinal examinations of US cattle
which were known to behave irregularly before death. If we presume the
selected animals are 100x more likely to have the disease than randomly
selected ones, this still leaves the infectivity rate at about 1:10,000.
This would mean there would only be a 50% chance of detecting a positive in
7,000 examinations (even if the examinations were 100% accurate!). In order
to provide even a 90% assurance of no disease, it would take 23,000+
examinations.
Consequently all we can say is the rate of BSE in the US is less than
1:1,000 with good confidence. We really can't say anything constructive
about swine.
We obviously don't have a "mad cow", "mad pig" or other epidemic in the US
(except Alsheimer's in humans). This we know from the surveillance data.
However, it is prudent to ban (as FDA has proposed) ruminant-ruminant or
even mammal-food animal feeding practices to eliminate the feedback
amplification necessary to even have such an epidemic.
We still, of course, are allowing food animal (ruminant or otherwise)-human
feeding practices (viz., eating meat), but since humans are not re-fed to
cows or swine, there is no feedback (no pun intended!) present.
Without the amplification from feedback, it is clear from the UK "mad cow"
experience that any sporadic occurrence will not propagate significant new
cases and no epidemic will result.
