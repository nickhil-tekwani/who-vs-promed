Abstract
--------
Climate change is impacting ecosystem structure and function, with potentially drastic downstream effects on human and animal health. Emerging zoonotic diseases are expected to be particularly vulnerable to climate and biodiversity disturbance. Anthrax is an archetypal zoonosis that manifests its most significant burden on vulnerable pastoralist communities. The current study sought to investigate the influence of temperature increases on geographic anthrax suitability in the temperate, boreal, and arctic North, where observed climate impact has been rapid. This study also explored the influence of climate relative to more traditional factors, such as livestock distribution, ungulate biodiversity, and soil-water balance, in demarcating risk. Machine learning was used to model anthrax suitability in northern latitudes. The model identified climate, livestock density and wild ungulate species richness as the most influential features in predicting suitability. These findings highlight the significance of warming temperatures for anthrax ecology in northern latitudes, and suggest potential mitigating effects of interventions targeting megafauna's biodiversity conservation in grassland ecosystems, and animal health promotion among small to midsize livestock herds.

Discussion
----------
This investigation is the 1st to describe anthrax suitability across the temperate, boreal, and arctic North of both the eastern and western hemispheres. We found that climate and the distribution of domestic livestock and wild ungulate species richness were important predictors of suitability. Warming annual temperature anomalies were associated with increasing suitability, as was a water-soil balance that favored mild to moderate water stress. This is the 1st study to show an increase in anthrax risk across the northern latitudes associated with a warming climate, an association that was highly influential to predicted suitability. Moreover, anthrax suitability is predicted to expand and increase within a relatively short period of time (approx. 30 years) with continued warming. The effects of livestock densities and soil composition notwithstanding, these results highlight the potential effects of rising temperatures and moderate water stress on anthrax risk in northern latitudes. (...)

In conclusion, this investigation revealed the novel finding that, mean global temperature increases between 1950-1980 and 2005-2016 identified high anthrax suitability in the northern latitudes during the early decades of the 21st century. Continued warming in northern latitudes predicted expanding anthrax risk. In addition, livestock density and wild ungulate species richness were also associated with anthrax suitability. These results provide the 1st evidence that climate change may influence the risk of this impactful zoonotic disease across a large extent of the northern latitudes. Additional findings from this study suggest that interventions targeting animal health promotion among small to midsize livestock herds (e.g. vaccine promotion among pastoralist communities) may reduce the overall suitability to future outbreaks, possibly mitigating some of the effects of climate change. The association between anthrax suitability and ungulate species richness is also intriguing for the potential One Health implications of megafauna's biodiversity conservation in grassland ecosystems, however the current results are not yet sufficient to make a claim for specific conservation intervention strategies and will require validation from more localized studies to confirm the possibility of real benefit.
