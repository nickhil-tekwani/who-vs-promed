The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced Friday [2 Oct 2020] that an adult from Epsom has tested positive for Jamestown Canyon virus. The diagnosis marks the 4th person in the state to test positive for the mosquito-borne disease, officials said. The arboviral risk level has been elevated to high for the Epsom community.

The patient was hospitalized with a fever, abdominal and neck pain, and a headache. They have been discharged and are recovering at home.

Jamestown Canyon virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes. There are no vaccines to prevent it. Officials say people can be infected and not develop any symptoms, or only develop very mild symptoms for all mosquito-borne diseases, including Jamestown Canyon virus.

People infected with Jamestown Canyon virus can develop more serious central nervous system disease, including meningitis or encephalitis. Early symptoms can include flu-like illness such as fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue.

[This is now the 4th Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) case in New Hampshire this year (2020).

As noted previously, JCV cases are not new in New Hampshire. They were diagnosed in the state last year (2019) and in 2013, 2015, and 2017. JCV infections are extremely rare, and, if laboratory confirmed, the 2018 case was the 1st documented death due to the virus (see Jamestown Canyon virus - USA: (NH) fatal, susp 20180629.5882078).

As noted in previous ProMED posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal (northern) _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. The previous report provided related references. - Mod.TY
