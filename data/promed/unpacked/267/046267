With Eidul Azha less than 2 weeks away, officials in Balochistan reported 2 Congo virus cases on Thursday [8 Jul 2021]. The cases were confirmed by Dr Sadiq Baloch, additional medical superintendent at Quetta's Fatima Jinnah Chest and General Hospital. He said the 2 patients had been placed in an isolation ward.

"Their condition is stable," he said. According to the official, one of the patients was an 11-year-old boy from Chaman, while the other was a 40-year-old man from Loralai.

He said both patients came to the hospital complaining of fever and bleeding from the mouth. Baloch added that during the last one-and-a-half months, 7 Congo virus patients were brought to the facility.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, or Congo virus, is a viral infection transmitted by ticks to both animals and humans. The virus is transmitted by ticks living on the skin of goats, cows, buffalos, and camels, feeding on their blood. The disease is rare in infected animals, who mostly act as carriers of the disease which they transmit.

It is prevalent in Asia, Africa, Middle East, and southeastern Europe and is more common between March to October.

[In view of the upcoming Eidul Azha (20-23 Jul 2021), which entails large-scale movement and sale of cattle and livestock, it is important to take measures to prevent exposure to the virus, which is the key to preventing tick-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-human transmission in the community. Educating the general public about handling sacrificial animals and raw meat/blood, etc., can help minimise exposure and potential transmission.

In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.

Public health advice should focus on several aspects.
1. Reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission:
- wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers);
- wear light-coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes;
- use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing;
- use approved repellent on the skin and clothing;
- regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely;
- seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns; and
- avoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active.

2. Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission:
- wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home;
- quarantine animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides 2 weeks prior to slaughter.

3. Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community:
- avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people;
- wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people;
- wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people.

4. Controlling infection in health-care settings
- Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection-control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices, and safe burial practices.
- As a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection-control precautions.
- Samples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.

The WHO recommendations to prevent CCHF are available at https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever. - Mod.UBA
