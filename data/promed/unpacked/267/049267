Three children died, and more than 50 people are in critical
condition in hospitals in Tbilisi in connection with mushroom
poisoning.

They were delivered to Tbilisi from the Khashaursky district.
Physicians say that the poisonings were caused by one specific type
of mushroom that has not yet been identified. Physicians warn the
public not to consume unknown mushrooms.

[As stated in another source
<http://www.vz.ru/news/2008/10/31/225052.html>,
the mushrooms were bought in the market of Khashauri, west of Tbilisi.

As of 1 Nov 2008, there are about 100 people in hospitals in Georgia
who have suffered from mushroom intoxication. Cases of mushroom
poisoning have been seen in Borjomi, Khashuri, Sachkhere, Chiatura,
Zestaphoni and Kvarel. See also

[There are numerous toxic mushrooms. Some cause neurological
symptoms; some cause gastrointestinal disturbances. There are not
enough clinical signs mentioned here to hazard a guess as to which
toxic mushroom may have been involved. However, with so many people
involved, it sounds like there was access to some distribution chain,
or the mushrooms were misidentified as being edible and routed
through a normal process and distribution chain. - Mod.TG]
