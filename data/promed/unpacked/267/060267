A survivor of melioidosis who spent 10 days in an induced coma in
Royal Darwin Hospital during his treatment, says he was not an
obvious candidate for catching the disease.
Melioidosis is caused by a bacterium in the soil, which can be
exposed during heavy rain and has killed 2 people in the Northern
Territory this wet season. The patient says he did not have any
pre-existing illnesses and doctors suspect he contracted it while
mowing his lawn in bare feet or by breathing it in during heavy rain.
"Couldn't hardly walk and I just kept coughing and there was a point
when I was coughing blood," he said. "It was originally phlegm and by
the 4th day it was blood coming out of my mouth so I knew I didn't
want to be at home trying to deal with it."

[Infection due to _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ (melioidosis) is
endemic in focal areas of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.
Because _B. pseudomallei_ is deemed to be a category B biowarfare
agent, ProMED-mail may continue to post cases of the infection even
if from these endemic areas. It is primarily an infection of humans
with underlying diseases such as alcoholism, malnutrition, cirrhosis,
and immunosuppresion, but can also affect healthy individuals, as in
this report. In animal models, higher inocula can cause more serious
infection in immunocompetent individuals. Additionally, the lawn
moving may have created a substantial aerosol of organisms as has
been suggested for the tularemia pneumonias associated with
landscaping on Martha's Vineyard (USA).
The manifestations of illness in this patient are not stated.
Clinically, however, infection due to _B. pseudomallei_ can be
subclinical, but rapidly progressive disseminated disease involving
the skin, liver, or spleen can occur. Pneumonia may be the presenting
form, either acute or chronic. The latter may present years after
exposure, when the individual is no longer in an endemic area and may
look very much like pulmonary tuberculosis. The diagnosis can be
confirmed microbiologically and/or serologically. Ceftazidime,
chloramphenicol, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can be used therapeutically.
