Please note the following message from Alan Hampson. As I am
living in New Caledonia, I should feel somewhat ashamed, however
the report was copied straight from the WHO press release.

Your message on ProMED incorrectly specifies the influenza
A(H1N1) vaccine component for 2000 as A/Caledonia/20/99
whereas it should be A/New Caledonia/20/99.
There's not much difference in the name but they are a long way
apart and rather different in climate!
