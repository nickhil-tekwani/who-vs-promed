Anthrax - Russia (Stavropol)
----------------------------
In Zelenokumsk city in the Stavropol area, a case of anthrax was registered
on 24 Apr 2001. A patient (a cattle slaughterer) has been hospitalized with
the diagnosis "anthrax, a local skin form" in the infectious department of
the district hospital. The diagnosis was confirmed by the skin allergic
test with anthraxin on 29 Apr 2001.
The Stavropol center of the state sanitary and epidemiological surveillance
and veterinary administration is investigating the case and is carrying out
epidemic and epizootic measures against the dangerous disease.

culture, the Russians prefer to use the 'anthraxin' skin test. - Mod.MHJ]
