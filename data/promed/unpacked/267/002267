Tsunami survivors struck down by tetanus
----------------------------------------
Scores of survivors of the tsunami are dying of tetanus, a rare but often
deadly disease whose outbreak has caught health officials completely off
guard. Deaths have been reported in Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, at either end
of the Indonesian disaster zone in Sumatra. They are almost certainly being
replicated in the cut-off towns and villages along the coast in between,
say experts.
Tetanus, once better known as lockjaw, has been almost wiped out in the
West through childhood immunization and is now uncommon even in disaster
areas. One doctor said this was the worst outbreak the world had seen in
years. "I might have expected to see 1 case in my career," said Dr Charles
Chan Johnson, from Singapore, who is working in Banda Aceh's general
hospital, Zainal Abidin. "Now I have 20 patients in a single ward." Most
had symptoms too far advanced to be treatable. "I am afraid nearly all
these patients will die," he said.
Immunization is regarded as the most important means of prevention because
once symptoms appear the mortality rate is high. But in Sumatra primary
health care was limited even before the tsunami which killed more than 100
000 Indonesians.
Medical workers say the disaster provided perfect conditions for tetanus.
Many people were injured by the debris the waves picked up, even if only
with minor cuts, and ended up lying in the dirty water. Nevertheless, the
number arriving at hospitals and field clinics with the classic "smile" of
lockjaw has taken them by surprise. [The "smile" referred to is "risus
sardonicus", a characteristic expression with a fixed grin and elevated
eyebrows caused by spasm of the facial muscles produced most often by
tetanus - Mod.LL] Workers had been on the lookout for cholera, dysentery
and malaria, classic refugee-camp sicknesses, rather than tetanus.
There have been 40 confirmed cases and 20 deaths in Banda Aceh, and 7 cases
and 5 deaths in Meulaboh. But patients were still arriving at Zainal Abidin
last night, and Meulaboh hospital is seeing several suspected cases every day.
Officials have still not assessed the scale of the outbreak along the
coast, where hundreds of thousands of survivors have fled. But workers
there may not even know why people are falling sick, said Dr Tony Stewart,
a consultant epidemiologist to WHO in Banda Aceh. "This is totally
unprecedented," he added. "This is now a really rare disease."
He had imported to Indonesia Australia's entire stock of specific tetanus
immunoglobulin. It amounted to 15 vials, a sign of how few cases the West
now suffers. Dr Johnson's ward is 1 of 3 which reopened on Tue, 11 Jan
2005, in the hospital, which was inundated by mud during the disaster.
