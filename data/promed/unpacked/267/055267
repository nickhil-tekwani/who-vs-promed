Due to suspicion of a possible infectious disease, and on the basis of the reported death of one pig in the village Rabrovac, the competent services of the Veterinary Directorate carried out euthanasia of pigs in the said village and in the village Velika Krsna.

Euthanasia was carried out in accordance with the procedures laid down, and all preventive measures were taken to protect the health of the animals in the area.

The Veterinary Directorate told Tanjug that pig samples had been sent for laboratory analysis, and upon receipt of the results, all necessary measures would be taken in accordance with established procedures.

They are currently in the process of paying compensation to owners of euthanized animals, which has been determined on the basis of the market price and has so far been received by most pig owners.

[African] swine fever is a highly contagious disease that can affect domestic and wild pigs, but not humans. Animal death can occur very quickly.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Pavle Banovic for bringing the above media report to our attention. This is the 1st report on a (suspected) ASF case in Serbia. Serbia borders, on its east and north, 3 infected countries: Bulgaria, Romania (the most severely affected), and Hungary. Rabrovac is some 65 km (about 40 mi) westward from the Romanian border; map at https://tinyurl.com/yyjvp8ne.

An official confirmation of the above, and additional details, pertaining to the affected population (domestic swine, backyard holding?), number of susceptible animals, data that may be indicative of the route of virus introduction, and findings from the other 2 mentioned villages, will be welcomed.

Velika Krsna is nearly 10 km (6 mi) north of Rabrovac.

At present, 10 of EU's 28 member states are considered as being ASF-infected, involving their respective domestic swine and/or wild boar populations: Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Belgium (wild boar only), Slovakia and Italy (Sardinia only - unrelated epidemic situation). The Czech Republic has successfully eradicated ASF that affected wild boars exclusively. The regional ASF situation is presented in OIE's interactive map (global) at https://tinyurl.com/yyd2kql6 (click on the Balkan cluster, zoom in to Serbia).

Serbia's domestic swine population (OIE's 2018 data) is 2 782 000, kept in 148 970 holdings.

Serbia's ASF surveillance activities in wild boar were presented during a regional ASF wild boar management workshop recently convened in Belgrade, Serbia (21-23 May 2019; presentations at FAO document GCP/RER/060/CHC, http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/reu/europe/documents/events2019/ASF_reg/R5.pdf).

The passive surveillance covered boars found dead: a total of 7 during the hunting season 2017/2018 and 25 animals during the hunting season 2018/2019. All were found ASF negative.

The active surveillance covered, for the period 1 Nov 2017 to 31 Oct 2018, a total of 751 shot and tested animals out of the total of 11 179 hunted wild boar. Since 1 Nov 2018, 1918 additional wild boars were sampled and tested. The samples included blood, tonsils, mesenteric lymph node, and part of the spleen and kidney. All were found ASF negative. For additional information, please refer to the URL of the workshop report.

During the workshop, similar presentations were delivered by Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Kosovo and Montenegro; all are accessible at
http://www.fao.org/europe/events/detail-events/en/c/1194316/.

Serbia is the 2nd European country added to the list of ASF-infected countries during the recent fortnight; Slovakia was added on 26 Jul 2019. - Mod.AS
