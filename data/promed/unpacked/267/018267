Tanzania: measles outbreak in Zanzibar
--------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles in Zanzibar, where 184 cases have been reported in
one district on the island of Pemba since mid-December [2006], has prompted
health officials to plan a 2-day emergency immunisation campaign beginning
on Sat 20 Jan 2007 to curb the disease. The majority of cases -- 166 --
have been reported in the Micheweni District of Pemba in the past 2 weeks,
Sultan Mohamed Mugheiry, Zanzibar's Minister of Health and Social Welfare,
told reporters on Thu 18 Jan 2007. The outbreak is the 1st on the islands
in about 5 years, Mugheiry said.
"The situation is not good. We have had one death, and we have been
receiving an average of 5 cases a day, including some adults," said
Abdulhamid Ameir Salum, the manager of Zanzibar's Expanded Programme on
Immunisation. A house-to-house awareness campaign is underway. The campaign
is supported by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and targets 44
653 children aged between 6 months and 15 years in Micheweni District.
Salum attributed the latest measles outbreak to frequent travel between the
islands and mainland Tanzania, especially Dar es Salaam, where measles is
more common. "Another reason for the outbreak is reluctance by parents to
bring their children to health centers for vaccination and failure to
respond to immunization campaigns," Salum said.
According to the UN World Health Organization, measles is a major killer of
young children, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine
for the past 40 years. Measles is an acute viral respiratory illness
associated with high fever, rashes, and vomiting.
