Outbreak of myxomatosis in rabbits Grafton and Maclean, New South Wales, Australia -- half a dozen cases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just as Rabbit Rescue Sanctuary owner Kim Cooney was deciding what colour to paint the newly constructed bunny barn, she got a call she had been dreading. The call was from South Grafton [New South Wales (NSW)] veterinarian Chris Gough, to let her know the clinic had just euthanised a pet rabbit suffering from symptoms of myxomatosis, a deadly virus with the potential to decimate domestic rabbit populations.

Having lost close to 100 rabbits to the disease in 2010 and early 2011, there was no way Mrs Cooney was going to let it happen again. "I literally broke out in a cold sweat and contacted everyone I could to help us catch the outdoor rabbits," she said. "The minute I got off the phone it was just panic stations. It took us 2 days and 2 nights to catch them all and put them in the bunny barn; there were just people everywhere for 2 days."

The bunny barn was purpose built to keep the rabbits safe from myxomatosis during an outbreak, which is spread predominantly by mosquitoes and fleas. And it was finished just in time.

Since the 1st case in March [2015], others have been reported in Grafton and Maclean [New South Wales]. Dr Gough said about half a dozen cases in the past few weeks had been seen at Riverbank Animal Hospital, most from around the South Grafton area.

The disease is one he feels strongly about; in 2011, he had to euthanise 80 rabbits from the rescue sanctuary in one afternoon. He described it as one of the worst days in his veterinary career. "It was a very sad day and hopefully we won't have to go through that again," he said. "It's a very, very important issue for people with pet rabbits and it has the potential to spread quite quickly." Because the virus is spread mainly through mosquitoes and fleas, Dr Gough said the best thing to do was keep any pet rabbits indoors in an insect-proof environment and make sure their flea treatments were up to date.

"In the UK there's a very effective vaccine, but we're not allowed to vaccinate in Australia," he said. "It's quite frustrating from a clinical point of view, but all rabbit owners can do is keep their rabbits away from biting insects as best they can. They can train them to use a litter tray."

What is myxomatosis?
--------------------
Myxomatosis is caused by the myxoma virus, spread between rabbits by close contact and biting insects such as fleas and mosquitoes. The virus causes swelling and discharge from the eyes, nose and anogenital region of infected rabbits. Most rabbits die within 10-14 days of infection.

The virus was introduced to Australia by the CSIRO to cull pest rabbits in 1950. It was at 1st highly efficient, but resistance to myxomatosis has increased in the wild rabbit population. Pet rabbits, however, do not possess any resistance to myxomatosis and mortality rates are 96-100 percent.

NSW Local Land Services invasive species team leader Dean Chamberlain said that the virus had not been released in the Clarence Valley for at least 16 years, but tended to spring up when there was a lot of moisture and insects. Mr Chamberlain said the wet weather in the past 2 weeks would help any virus spread. "It is constantly in the population and as populations increase, it will too," he said. "The only way to stop any spread is to ensure any rabbit you've got is insect proof."

There are 2 vaccinations against myxomatosis available in other countries, but they are not permitted for commercial use in Australia due to a concern the weakened virus in the "live virus" vaccine could build up an immunity in wild rabbit populations.

Mr Chamberlain said the most common form of wild rabbit control was to bait them with a poison called Pindone, which worked in a similar way to rat poison and carried little risk of secondary poisoning for other species. He said it was a landholder's responsibility to control their own properties but poisons and fumigants could be bought and equipment associated with rabbit control could be hired from a Local Land Services office for a nominal fee.

[I remember when we got myxomatosis in our wild rabbits in the UK. It is a killer and spreads fast.

According to the Merck Veterinary Manual (http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/exotic_and_laboratory_animals/rabbits/viral_diseases_of_rabbits.html): "Myxomatosis is a fatal disease of all breeds of domesticated rabbits caused by myxoma virus, a member of the poxvirus group. Myxomatosis is called 'big head' and is characterized by mucinous skin lesions or myxomas. Wild rabbits such as the cottontail (_Sylvilagus_) and jackrabbits (_Lepus_) are quite resistant. Myxoma virus-infected _Sylvilagus_ develop fibroma-like lesions similar to those caused by rabbit fibroma virus. All other mammals are refractory to the virus. Myxomatosis has a worldwide distribution. In the USA, myxomatosis is restricted largely to the coastal area of California and Oregon, where epidemics occur infrequently but sporadic cases are common. These areas correspond to the geographic distribution of the California brush rabbit (_S. bachmani_), the reservoir of the infection. Losses in rabbitries may be 25-90 percent. Transmission occurs via mosquitos, fleas, biting flies, and direct contact.

"The initial sign is conjunctivitis that rapidly becomes more marked and is accompanied by a milky ocular discharge. The rabbit is listless and anorectic, with a fever that frequently reaches 108 deg F (42 deg C). In acute outbreaks, some rabbits may die within 48 hr after signs appear. Those that survive become progressively depressed and develop a rough coat. The eyelids, nose, lips, and ears become edematous, which gives a swollen appearance to the head. In females, the vulva becomes inflamed and edematous; in males, the scrotum swells. A characteristic sign at this stage is drooping of the edematous ears. A purulent nasal discharge invariably appears, breathing becomes labored, and the rabbit goes into a coma just before death, which usually occurs within 1-2 wk after clinical signs appear. Occasionally, a rabbit survives for several weeks; in these cases, fibrotic nodules appear on the nose, ears, and forefeet. Rabbits inoculated experimentally with laboratory strains of the virus invariably develop small nodules at the point of injection after several days; similar nodules develop later on other parts of the body, particularly the ears.

"Few characteristic gross lesions are found at necropsy in the acute form of the disease. The spleen is occasionally enlarged and is almost always devoid of lymphocytes when examined histologically. In rabbits that survive longer, subcutaneous edema and nodular skin tumors are seen. The seasonal incidence of the disease, clinical signs (especially the swollen genitalia), and high mortality are all of diagnostic significance. Large, eosinophilic, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the conjunctival epithelial cells are also helpful in diagnosis.

"An attenuated vaccine prepared from a myxomatosis virus has protected rabbits infected under both field and laboratory conditions. This vaccine is not available in the USA, and because there is no effective treatment, euthanasia and burying or burning of affected rabbits is indicated. Preventive measures include protecting rabbits from exposure to arthropod vectors."
