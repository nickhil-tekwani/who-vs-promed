The number of enterovirus D-68 cases continues to climb in the province. Alberta Health Services [AHS] says there are now 111 confirmed patients with the virus, up 18 since the last report in mid-October 2014.

Over half of those cases are in Calgary, where 60 people have been infected.

AHS is reminding Albertans to help fight off getting sick by washing hands regularly, keeping hands away from faces, staying home when sick, and avoiding people who are coughing and sneezing.

Two children on P.E.I have had confirmed cases of enterovirus. Health P.E.I. officials say both children have been released now from hospital. They said both children are under the age of ten. Officials said the children are doing well.

The 1st case on the island was reported earlier this month [October 2014]. Only hospitalized cases in P.E.I. with respiratory illness are being tested for EV-D68. The virus usually causes mild respiratory infections and cold-like illnesses. It can be spread through coughing and sneezing or by close contact with infected persons. Health officials note most people who become ill with the virus will recover at home, but anyone experiencing difficulty breathing or shortness of breath should see a doctor.

The nationwide outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infections in children is continuing to fade, but another possibly related death has been reported, and the number of unexplained polio-like illnesses potentially linked to the virus has risen by 13, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In an update yesterday [30 Oct 2014], the CDC said 39 states reported low EV-D68 activity last week, while 7 cited elevated activity, with 4 not reporting. That compares with 34 states reporting low or declining activity and 8 reporting elevated cases the week before. The number of confirmed cases, 1105, has stayed the same since 28 Oct 2014.

The CDC said the number of deaths in patients who were infected with EV-D68 is now 9, one higher than cited a week earlier. The agency has not released any information about the cause of death in those cases, saying states are taking the lead in investigating them. Earlier this month [October 2014], New Jersey health officials said EV-D68 caused the death of a 4-year-old boy. The EV-D68 outbreak involves severe respiratory illnesses almost exclusively in children, many of whom have asthma or a history of wheezing.

In a separate update yesterday [30 Oct 2014], the CDC said it has identified 64 recent cases of unexplained neurologic illness with limb weakness in children in 28 states, up from 51 cases in 23 states a week earlier. The polio-like illnesses were 1st noticed at a Denver hospital in August 2014, where at least 10 cases were reported. Four of those children tested positive for EV-D68. The CDC is investigating whether the neurologic illnesses are linked to the EV-D68 outbreak, among other possible causes. Officials have not reported any conclusions yet.

The Agency did not reveal how many of the 64 patients with a neurologic illness fitting the case definition have tested positive for EV-D68. The agency said investigators are working to verify about half a dozen additional reports of unexplained neurologic illness.

"In addition to the cluster in Colorado, several other smaller clusters have been identified; this remains one of the most unusual features of these cases," the statement said.

As of Tue 4 Nov 2014, the CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 1108 people in 47 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. CDC expects that, as with other enteroviruses, EV-D68 infections will likely begin to decline by late fall [2014]. CDC has received informal reports from some hospitals and states that are seeing signs of decreasing EV-D68 infections. CDC is gathering more information from states and assessing whether this represents a national trend.

Every year, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses cause millions of respiratory illnesses in children. This year [2014], EV-D68 has been the most common type of enterovirus identified, leading to increases in illnesses among children and affecting those with asthma most severely. Other rhinoviruses and enteroviruses continue to be detected as well.

CDC has received substantially more specimens for enterovirus lab testing than usual this year [2014] due to the large outbreak of EV-D68 and related hospitalisations. Of the more than 2000 specimens tested by the CDC lab, about 40 percent have tested positive for EV-D68. About 1/3rd have tested positive for an enterovirus or rhinovirus other than EV-D68. EV-D68 has been detected in specimens from 9 patients who died and had samples submitted for testing.

CDC is reporting test results to state health departments as we obtain them. Comparison of these sequences to sequences from previous years shows they are genetically related to strains of EV-D68 that were detected in previous years in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

[Overall, the association of enterovirus D68 virus infection with any specific clinical disease remains unconfirmed. Reports of human enterovirus D-68 infection in the United States are beginning to decline, despite improvements in diagnosis and greater transparency in the posting of results. Overall, few fatalities have occurred, and their association with a specific physical outcome has yet to be established. Reports of enterovirus D68 virus infection are increasing in Canada, perhaps due to improved diagnostic methods rather than an actual spread of the virus northwards, although this remains to be established. - Mod.CP]
