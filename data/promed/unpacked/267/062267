Rabies kills northern Virginia man
-------------------------
A northern Virginia man is dead from rabies, the state's first fatal
case in nearly 5 years. The man died in mid-March 2003, but the
diagnosis wasn't confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control until
this week.

The Virginia Department of Health won't say exactly where in
northern Virginia the man was from, or give the precise date of
death [or whether the suspected source was canine or bat bite? -
Mod.JW]. Spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell says health officials are
now working with people who'd been in close contact with him.
They're also trying to figure out how he got rabies, which Caldwell
says a person can have and not realize.

The last fatal rabies cases in Virginia was in December 1998, when
a prisoner died at the Nottoway Correctional Center. That was the
first rabies case Virginia had seen since 1953, and was blamed on
a bat.
