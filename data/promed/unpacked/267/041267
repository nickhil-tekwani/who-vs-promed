Newcastle disease breaks out in Belgium
---------------------------------------
The Belgian veterinary authorities have sent an immediate
notification to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)
regarding a new outbreak of Newcastle disease.

The immediate notification, dated 6 Apr [2009], covers 2 outbreaks of
Newcastle disease (paramyxovirus type 1) in pigeons. Both cases
started on 11 Mar 2009. One case was in Bevel in the province of
Antwerp and the other was in Nieuwerkerken in East Flanders.

The last occurrence of the virus in Belgium was in June 2008.

According to that OIE report, the birds were "Pigeons in a hobby
holding", thus probably not for producing eggs or meat for
consumption, and therefore not qualifying as poultry, which in any
case is the term usually restricted to gallinaceous birds. Belgium has
a history of pigeon outbreaks of NDV -- see ProMED refs. below. -
