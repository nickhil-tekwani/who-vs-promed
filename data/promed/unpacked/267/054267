Occurrence of soybean stem canker (_Diaporthe phaseolorum_ var.
_meridionalis_) in Wisconsin
---------------------------------
S Li, National Soybean Pathogen Collection Center, Department of Crop
Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana; NC Kurtzweil, CR Grau, Department
of Plant Pathology, University of Wisconsin-Madison; GL Hartman, USDA-ARS,
Department of Crop Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana. Plant Dis
2004; 88: 576, published online as D-2004-0315-01N, 2004. Accepted for
publication 29 Jan 2004.

Soybean (_Glycine max_) developed symptoms characteristic of stem canker
during the 2000 to 2003 growing seasons in Wisconsin. Symptoms were
widespread in 2003 and were associated with yield losses of about 1 per
cent statewide and as much as 25 per cent in individual fields. Affected
plants expressed dieback of foliage beginning at growth stage R3 and
progressed until the R6 growth stage. Dark brown lesions were frequently
observed at a single node on the lower portion of stems of plants
expressing foliage dieback.

Fungi were isolated from symptomatic plants collected from 7 growers'
fields in Rock, Sauk, Veron, and Walworth counties and the Arlington and
Marshfield Agricultural Research Stations. Stems with lesions were cut into
approximately 5 mm pieces, surface disinfested with a 0.5 per cent NaOCl
solution for 3 min, rinsed 3 times in sterile distilled water, and placed
on water agar (WA) or potato dextrose agar (PDA) at pH 4.5.

Hyphal tips from colonies of interest were excised and placed on acidified
PDA at 25 deg C under continuous light for 25 to 30 days. In addition to
_Diaporthe phaseolorum_ var. _caulivora_ (the cause of northern stem
canker), 4 isolates of _D. phaseolorum_ var. _meridionalis_ (the cause of
southern stem canker) were isolated.

Colonies of _D. phaseolorum_ var. _meridionalis_ isolates were white,
lanose, and became tan with age as previously described for _D.
phaseolorum_ var. _meridionalis_ (1). Pycnidia with alpha conidia (no beta
conidia) and perithecia with 3.1 to 3.4 x 9.5 to 9.8 micrometers ascospores
formed on oat flakes on acidified WA after 30 days. Stromata were brown to
black and irregularly shaped.

4 isolates of _D. phaseolorum_ var. _meridionalis_ were tested for
pathogenicity in a controlled environment using a cut stem inoculation
method (2). Stems of 3-week old seedlings of cv. Sturdy were cut at the
midpoint between the 2nd and 3rd node, and a PDA mycelial plug (4 mm
diameter) was placed on the surface of the cut stems. This method was used
to inoculate 15 plants in 3 replicates for each isolate tested. Inoculated
plants were placed in a mist chamber in the dark at 25 deg C for 4 days and
later moved to a greenhouse with a 16 h photoperiod at 24 Â± 3 deg C for 3 days.

All plants challenged by this method exhibited stem lesions that were 2 to
3 cm long and of similar color to lesions observed in field-grown plants.
For each isolate tested, _D. phaseolorum_ var. _meridionalis_ was
reisolated from 3 randomly selected symptomatic plants. Negative controls
with a PDA plug did not produce lesions.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of _D. phaseolorum_ var.
meridionalis on soybean in Wisconsin. The significance of this report
relates to the potential spread of _D. phaseolorum_ var. _meridionalis_
beyond its known southern range in the United States.

[Stem canker has been reported in Europe, South America and in most soybean
regions of Canada and the United States. During the early 1950s, northern
stem canker was prevalent in the north-central US, causing losses of up to
50 per cent. Southern stem canker was first observed in the southern US in
1973, caused widespread losses in the early 1980s, and is now considered
endemic throughout the south, where losses of 100 per cent have been
reported. There does not appear to be any overlap in geographical range of
these 2 stem canker diseases.

There are 2 different types of stem canker, northern and southern. Northern
stem canker is caused by the fungus _Diaporthe phaseolorum_ var.
_caulivora_ [Dpc], and southern stem canker is caused by _D. phaseolorum_
var. _merdionalis_ [Dpm]. Both pathogens can overwinter in infested soybean
residue and may be spread with infested seed. Stem canker is closely
related to pod and stem blight, which is caused by the related pathogen
_Diaporthe phaseolorum_ var. _sojae_.

Stem canker is best managed by planting resistant or moderately resistant
varieties. Although resistance genes are known for southern stem canker,
apparently none is available for northern stem canker. Delayed planting may
be helpful, and tillage may reduce disease in fields where stem canker has
been a problem. Foliar fungicides may be useful in managing the disease.
