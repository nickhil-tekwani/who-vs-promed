[These are the new cases reported from Saudi Arabia since 3 Jul 2015. On initial review, both cases would be classified as "sporadic" cases as there is no identifiable history of contact with other known MERS-CoV infected individuals for either case. Both have also been reported from locations with no recently reported cases. The previous case reported from Jeddah was on 5 Jun 2015, approximately 6 weeks ago.

According to the information available, this is the 1st report of a case from Jazan, although there have been occasional cases reported from elsewhere in Asir province in May 2015, in 2014 and in 2013.

Notable is that the last reported case in Hufoof was reported on 25 Jun 2015 and had a date of onset of 14 Jun 2015, 29 days ago, suggesting that the healthcare-associated outbreak may be over, as more than 2 incubation periods (28 days) following the date of onset of the most recently reported case have passed without a newly reported case.

A map showing the locations of the newly reported cases can be found at the source URL.
