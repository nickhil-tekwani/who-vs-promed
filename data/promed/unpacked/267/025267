A man who recently travelled to Western Africa is in critical condition in hospital in Saskatoon, according to provincial health officials.

The nature of the illness was not released, but the man has a high fever, in addition to other symptoms. Officials say a diagnosis has not been confirmed.

Saskatchewan's deputy medical health officer Dr. Denise Werker said on Monday [24 Mar 2014] that the patient -- who had visited Liberia -- was being examined for a suspected case of viral hemorrhagic fever.

"Viral hemorrhagic fever is a generic name for a number of rather exotic diseases that are found in Africa," Werker said, noting one of the fevers could be Ebola.

Ebola was 1st reported in 1976 in Congo and is named for the river where it was recognized. Ebola outbreaks were reported in Congo and Uganda in 2012 [see ProMED archives below]. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person or objects that have been contaminated with infected secretions.

The illness was serious enough that officials wanted people to know about steps that have been taken. "Measures have been taken to isolate the patient to ensure the illness is not transmitted," officials said. "Public health officials believe the risk to the public is low and are investigating."

According to Werker, depending on the nature of the disease, the people most at risk are health-care workers tending to the patient who do not wear protective clothing.

Werker acknowledged that an outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been identified in Guinea, Africa and may have spread to Liberia. Werker would not say which hospital in Saskatoon the patient is at in order to protect the man's privacy. He was doing work in Africa, although Werker did not know how long he had been there. She added that people who may have come into contact with the man's body fluids, such as urine or saliva, have been asked to self-isolate and monitor their health and watch for any signs of fever.

Health-care workers are wearing goggles, masks, gowns, gloves and boots when around the patient.

Werker said officials believe the man was not ill at the time he travelled, noting that a 3-week incubation period is normal for 2 of the suspected diseases. He fell ill after arriving in Canada.

"For the most part, people are not very infectious or contagious in the incubation period," she explained. "This is when their body is becoming ill."

Werker said the course of treatment will depend on identifying the fever involved and said that a preliminary finding could be available on Tuesday [25 Mar 2014]. Werker was notified about the case late Sunday [23 Mar 2014] night and has reported it to national authorities.

"There is no risk to the general public," she repeated, when asked about the danger of Ebola. "We recognize that there is going to be a fair amount of concern, and that is why we wanted to go public with this as soon as possible."

[Clearly, more information from reliable sources would be greatly appreciated, including locations of travel within Liberia as well as more information on the clinical presentation and laboratory results.

The details provided in the flurry of media reports that have accompanied this announcement do not provide information on the clinical picture of the case other than "high fever and other symptoms" and that the man was in Liberia, and that viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) is being considered in the differential diagnosis.

Given the recent announcement of the ebolavirus outbreak in Guinea and the suspected geographic spread into neighboring Liberia, any person returning from this general area with a high fever and signs of a serious illness should be evaluated for possible viral hemorrhagic fever. Ebolavirus disease has not been previously identified in Liberia, and the reports of suspected cases there (in Liberia) related to the confirmed outbreak in neighboring Guinea have not as yet been confirmed. Other possible VHFs known to occur in Liberia include Lassa fever and yellow fever.

While current reports state that Ebolavirus disease has not been reported in Liberia, a review of the history of Ebolavirus disease in the ProMED-mail archives revealed that, in 1994, there was a single case of Ebolavirus disease confirmed in Cote d'Ivoire, which involved the isolation of a new species of the virus called Cote d'Ivoire Ebola virus, in a woman who had done a necropsy on a chimp that had died of Ebolavirus disease (see http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=342 for more details). In addition, in 1994, there was a WHO report posted on ProMED-mail of a 25-year-old male from a village in Liberia who was admitted to hospital in the Tabou Prefecture (south of Tai National Park) in whom a diagnosis of Ebolavirus infection was confirmed by serological tests done at the Institute Pasteur in Paris (see Ebola - Cote d'Ivoire/Liberia 19951219.1294).
