Primary cause of Lake Mohave carp die-off identified
----------------------------------------------------
A virus has been identified as the probable cause for a carp die-off
in Lake Mohave. Koi herpes virus (KHV) -- which can impact carp as
water temperatures warm in late spring -- impacts gill function and
can lead to suffocation and/or secondary infections. While there were
bacterial issues, lab tests show KHV as the primary cause of the die-off.

"This is not a threat to public health, and it is not affecting other
wildlife," said Andy Clark, fisheries program manager for the Arizona
Game and Fish Department's Kingman office. "However, people should
still avoid handling the dead fish along the shoreline and, until
this die-off ends, we'd suggest anglers avoid taking carp and focus
on the other species the lake has to offer." Clark added that this is
not a water quality issue, which would have impacted all species of
fish in the lake.

In the middle of May, carp began washing up on shorelines along Lake
Mohave and within a week, the numbers began to multiply. Arizona Game
and Fish Department fisheries biologists visited Lake Mohave
shoreline areas to examine the extent of the die-off, with the dead
numbering in the thousands. The gills of the carp had white spots
along the sides and lacked blood.

"The lab test results are close to what we expected," Clark said. "We
recognized the need to get a sample, but it wasn't that simple. We
needed a live specimen, and carp we found close to the surface were
dying shortly after capture. The problem was, we suspected this to be
viral, and a virus dies when the host dies."

After Clark managed to secure several live carp, they were shipped to
Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab (WADDL) for testing. The
results came back late Friday afternoon [5 Jun 2009].

While Lake Mohave remains the primary area of this die-off, there
have been several recent reports at Lake Havasu. However, while that
number remains low, it is possible KHV is the cause. If a die-off
begins at Lake Havasu, Clark said there's little that can be done to stop it.

"There's no method in place to change the water temperature in a
short period of time that might prevent this," he explained.
"However, I want to remind everyone that we have no confirmation that
an event of the same scale will occur on Lake Havasu. Only time will tell."

As for a possible end to the die-off at Lake Mohave, Clark is
uncertain, but believes we've already seen the worst. For fishing

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a herpesvirus infection capable of
inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp
(_Cyprinus carpio_) and varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp.

KHV was 1st isolated in the UK in 2000 during a disease outbreak in
northern England. Outbreaks of clinical disease with signs similar to
KHV disease had been reported in 1998 and 1999. More KHV outbreaks
were confirmed in each of the years 2001-2003 using PCR and cell
culture-based assays. Later, KHV DNA was detected in tissue samples
taken in 1996 during an unexplained mass-mortality of koi and common
carp in the UK.
