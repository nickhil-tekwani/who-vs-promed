Minor dies of food poisoning
---------------------------------
A 10-year-old boy died, and his entire family was taken ill after eating
fish cooked in oil, the expiration date of which had lapsed, in Upland
Colony here on Friday [16 Dec 2005].
According to a release here today [18 Dec 2005], issued by K. Savi, legal
advisor of Kohima Municipal Council, the family of a police constable
started complaining of headache, dizziness and vomiting after eating fish
fried in mustard oil, the expiration date of which had lapsed.
The 10-year-old son died, while the victim's mother and uncle were taken to
a nursing home in an unconscious state by the neighbors.
Meanwhile, police have arrested the fishmonger, and the search was on to
nab the mustard oil seller, the release said.

[Unfortunately, poisoning from mustard oil has been occurring for a long
time; the earliest recorded case may be 1872 in West Bengal.
The syndrome in people is often called epidemic dropsy, which refers to
swelling of the body caused by the consumption of mustard oil adulterated
with oil of prickly poppy.
Prickly poppy (_Argemone mexican_) contains physiologically active toxic
alkaloids, sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine.
The prickly poppy grows as a wild weed with a yellow flower, but the seeds
are black to black brown with a wrinkled seed coat or surface. Mustard
seeds have a smooth round surface. Mustard seeds are usually harvested
earlier than those of the poppy, which would present little chance of
accidental mixing. However, most cases of contamination result from being a
little late on the harvest of a crop, resulting in contamination of the
mustard seeds.
Sanguinarine causes an increased permeability of the blood vessels. Heart,
liver and eyes are affected.
Symptoms of dropsy include acute nausea, vomiting, ataxia, bloated stomach,
erythema and swelling of hands and feet (edema). In extreme cases, glaucoma
and even death due to cardiac arrest can occur.
As little as one percent contamination of the oil can result in toxicity.
Treatment seems to be primarily symptomatic. - Mod.TG]
