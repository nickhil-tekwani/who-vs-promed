ANIMAL HEALTH ADVISORY: BLISTER DISEASE IN NEW MEXICO HORSES COULD AFFECT
INTERSTATE COMMERCE
OLYMPIA, Wash -- Dr. Robert Mead, state veterinarian, today advised that
you talk to your veterinarian before you move horses to New Mexico. An
outbreak of vesicular stomatitis virus in that state may require special
testing or restrictions on horses that have been in New Mexico before they
are allowed to cross into other states.
Vesicular stomatitis virus, commonly called "blister disease," primarily
affects horses, cattle and swine. Blisters develop around the mouth, on the
tongue, hooves or teats two to eight days after exposure. Infected animals
typically lose weight, because they are unable to eat or drink adequately
until healing begins, usually within two weeks. The virus is rarely fatal.
The virus has not appeared in Washington since the early 1980s. It is
spread by insects that bite infected horses and carry the virus to other
animals in the herd.
"Although there have been only two horses diagnosed with illness, vesicular
stomatitis mimics a devastating foreign animal disease called 'foot and
mouth disease.' This could cause some changes in requirements for moving
horses across state lines," Mead said.
For example, to take a horse into Kentucky, a veterinarian must certify
that the animal has not been in New Mexico, or the states that surround it,
during the last 30 days. Canada is restricting the entry only of horses
from New Mexico. The European Union is requiring testing of all U.S. horses
for vesicular stomatitis virus. "We will keep horse owners, cattle
producers and accredited veterinarians informed about changes in interstate
or international restrictions," Mead said.
Washington animal import rules prohibit the entry of livestock from
quarantined, affected and exposed premises in states with confirmed cases.
Post-entry checks of livestock from the southwest will be increased in this
state.
As of May 18, two horses were diagnosed with the virus in Otero County,
near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The Washington Department of Agriculture may
enact emergency rules requiring prior permits and certifying statements on
health papers if the situation in the southwest worsens.
Outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis occurred in southwestern states from New
Mexico north to Wyoming in 1995 and 1997. The 1995 outbreak was caused by
the New Jersey strain. Last year's outbreak was caused by the Indiana
strain. The Indiana strain has been isolated from one of the New Mexico
horses infected this year.
Humans can contract the virus if they do not wear gloves or wash their
hands after handling infected animals. In humans, the virus causes acute
influenza-like illness with symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache
and malaise.
Owners, producers and veterinarians are encouraged to contact the State
Veterinarian's Office, 360/902-1878, if they suspect vesicular stomatitis
in horses, cattle or other species.
"A definitive diagnosis is needed to rule out foot and mouth disease," Mead
said. "Blisters could also be caused by exposure to insecticides, toxic
plants or allergies. A final diagnosis is made based on a physical
examination of the animal, blood tests or isolating the virus from the
sores."
For information about international livestock shipments, call the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Veterinary Services in Olympia at 360/753-9430.
