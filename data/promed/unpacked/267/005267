From: "Miller, Barry R." <brm4@cdc.gov>
[Received by Barry R. Miller, CDC, Ft. Collins, CO, USA from Dr. Julius
Lutwama, Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe on Sept. 2, 1997]

In the last month we were requested to investigate an ONN epidemic in
Central Western Uganda. We found that [it] had continued its wave
north-westwards of the area where we [sic] had stopped in Mbarara district.
The area that has recently been affected is at the border between Kabalore
and Mbarara district. Part of Sembabule area in north Masaka District
(this area has recently been turned into a new district, Sembabule
District) has also been affected. The area has several rivers and swamps
just like in the Rakai and Mbarara area [Dr Miller] visited.
During the month of May, after the beginning of the rains in April, cases
started appearing. By mid July there were so many cases and as the
epidemic moved on, it followed the valleys and swampy area. We have so far
paid one visit to the area because we received the information a bit late
in July. With the problem of getting funds for our investigations we only
managed to go there after mid August. While the dry season had started
again when we visited, in two days we were able to see over 30 cases with
the characteristic rash and lymph nodes.
[Many thanks to Drs. Lutwama and Miller for this update. ONN is caused by
a virus carried by malarial mosquitoes (see previous posts referenced
above). It causes high fever, severe joint pains and often a rash, but no
death has ever been recorded from it. It seems to be spreading more slowly
than the African pandemic of 1959-61.
