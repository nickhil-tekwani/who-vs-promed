According to a report carried by the official Antara agency, about 90
percent of the orangutans in Wanaariset Samboja refuge center in
Indonesia's East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo have contracted human
diseases - including hepatitis, influenza, intestinal worms, and tuberculosis.
The center's chief, Boem Purnama, was quoted saying that by using
sophisticated medical equipment, workers were able to save some of the
orangutans, including one found early this year with Hepatitis C.

[Some of our members will remember the severe stress orangutans came under
earlier this year from the extensive forest fires in their various refuges
in the region. This also brought them into much closer contact with _H.
sapiens_ and the attendant disease risks as we can now see. - Mod.MHJ]
