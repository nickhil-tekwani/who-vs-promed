MEASLES - AUSTRALIA (VICTORIA) EX UK: CORRECTION

Elizabeth Hoile has drawn our attention to the following inaccuracy which
may affect understanding of the content of the report posted in ProMED-mail
under the heading "Australia (VIC) ex UK" (archive number 20060519.1410).
Elizabeth Hoile states that: "The title leads all but the most careful
readers to think that this case was exported from UK to Australia, which is
not true, and we tried to be very clear about this in our own title
(Measles case imported from Europe to Victoria, Australia, March 2006). The
text clearly indicated that the patient had not travelled to the UK. This
case has provided useful information for our European colleagues by raising
the possibility that this strain may be circulating undetected in other
European countries as well as in the UK."
ProMED-mail regrets this inaccuracy. The heading was intended to reflect
the observation that the nucleotide sequence of the virus recovered in
Australia was identical to that of a virus in circulating in the UK, and
different from viruses circulating in some of the European countries
visited by the traveller.
To correct this understanding, the ProMED-mail post will be re-titled
"Measles - Australia (VIC) ex Europe"
