In the 1st coverage in the area by Public Health, 4 suspected cases
[of St. Louis encephalitis virus infection] have been detected, that
is to say were febrile. The Ministry of Health confirmed the
appearance of a case of [St. Louis encephalitis virus infection] in
San Luis del Palmar. The case is a 68-year-old man who is admitted to
the Corrientes Instituto de Cardiologia, recovering from this disease
that is transmitted by the _Culex_ mosquito, the most common of these
insects. This is the 1st case this year [2011]. The virus is not
transmitted [directly] between people.

The disease is produced by a virus which is in the flavivirus family,
along with dengue and yellow fever [viruses].

The health agency mounted a vector control operation, fumigating on
the periphery of San Luis where the patient lives [in order] to
establish a vector barrier. In this regard, the professional
[Subdirector of Zoonoses of Public Health] said that the patient lives
in this peripheral neighborhood near the countryside where this virus
proliferates, mainly in wild animals [birds]. "Many animals are
reservoirs of this virus, and once the mosquito bites them, later it
can transmit [the virus] to humans," explained Benitez Suarez
[Subdirector of Zoonoses of Public Health]. In regard to the
prevention tasks and vector control, the official explained that
fumigation is being carried out with insecticides [adulticides?] and
larvicides within the block and its 4 sides after confirmation of the
case. The experts agreed that eradication of the vector is the key to
prevention of the disease.

The Subdirector of Zoonoses of Public Health, Claudia Benitez Suarez,
commented that although the patent is progressing well, considering
that he is a person over 60 years of age, his condition is considered
serious. "Any neurological case is a serious one," said the
professional. Usually, this infection is mild, although in this case
caused encephalitis. "This pathology [encephalitis] does not occur
very often in humans," the official said.

[This case is quite distant from the locale of the previous cases in
April 2011 in San Juan province. The tests used to confirm this case
as a St. Louis encephalitis virus infection are not specified. ProMED
would be interested in receiving information about the suspected, but
not confirmed, cases as it becomes available.
