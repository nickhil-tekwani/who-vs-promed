Two people have died and another 9 villagers have been taken to hospital as
a result of an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Kotelnikovskiy District,
Volgograd Region, a correspondent was told at the administration of
Kotelnikovskiy District, where no instances of this disease were registered
before. This year, for unknown reasons, the area has been plagued by hordes
of ticks which transmit [viruses that cause haemorrhagic fever.
