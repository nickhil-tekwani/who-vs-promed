[1] Case update
- 6 Jun 2018. Epidemiological situation 5 Jun 2018, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=8e6ccd9518

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 5 Jun 2018:
- a total of 60 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 37 confirmed, 14 probable, and 9 suspected;
- 6 new suspected cases, including 2 in Bikoro, 3 in Iboko, and 1 in Wangata. Three of these cases are known contacts;
- 4 samples were negative;
- no deaths reported today [total of 27 deaths; 13 of them among the confirmed cases];
- no new cases confirmed today.

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on [21 May 2018], 1579 people have been vaccinated, including 622 in Mbandaka, 372 in Bikoro, 555 in Iboko, and 30 in Ingende.

Sensitization
- This Wed 6 Jun 2018, teams of communicators from the Ministry of Health, WHO, and UNICEF organized an awareness session for 50 traditional healers (traditional doctors) of the city of Mbandaka. During this session, they discussed the generalities of Ebola virus disease as well as the prevention methods and the hygiene measures to respect in order to stop the transmission of the virus.
- These traditional doctors or healers are an important target for awareness because they are the first resort of the inhabitants when they are sick. It is therefore essential for the Ministry of Health to work with these healers so that they can spread the good messages to the people and invite them to adopt more responsible behaviors.
- At the beginning of the session, the healers were invited to share their opinion on the Ebola virus disease. Many of them said that it was not a real disease but rather a curse of ancestors that could be broken through traditional remedies.
- However, the session was successful and the traditional healers were convinced by the messages of health communicators. They are committed to the recommended hygiene measures, such as the use of gloves during consultations.

[It is critical that the traditional healers understand how Ebola virus is transmitted so they too can become involved in the control of virus spread. The people are much more likely to follow the guidance provided by the healers than that from foreign healthcare workers.
Of the 6 new cases, only 3 are reported as being contacts. We can only hope the other 3 are not part of new transmission chains. - Mod.LK]

- 6 Jun 2018. Ebola outbreak appears to be slowing in Congo as vaccines spread
[The Hill, edited]

[byline: Reid Wilson]

Early signs suggest that an Ebola outbreak in Congo, which has killed 27 people since erupting in a remote rural village 2 months ago, is being contained before it can spread further.

A total of 58 suspected or confirmed cases have been documented in the Equateur province, a few hundred miles up the Congo River from the capital, Kinshasa. In recent days, 2 more victims have died, and 5 new suspected cases -- all of whom had contact with someone else with the virus -- have been identified.

The outbreak began in the small village of Ikoko Impenge, then spread to the lakeside town Bikoro before arriving in Mbandaka, a city of more than a million residents on the Congo River.

The latest situation report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said the last confirmed case was identified on 28 May [2018]. Peter Salama, the WHO's deputy director general for emergency preparedness and response, said on Twitter early [Wed 6 Jun 2018] that the number of cases had grown to 58.

The current eruption is the first to test a new vaccine, which appeared effective in Guinea late in 2015.

The 1st doses of the vaccine arrived in the 3 Congolese cities on 21 May [2018], and in the following 2 weeks about 1200 people have received the drug, WHO said.

Front-line health workers, those most at risk of coming into contact with a victim of the Ebola virus, are the first to receive the vaccine. The 2nd priority is those who have come into contact with an Ebola victim, and those with whom they in turn have been in contact with -- a practice known as ring vaccination -- used to stop the spread of a virus.

Guinean doctors who helped deploy the vaccine in their home country have spent weeks in the hot zone administering the drug. Still, health officials are worried about the virus spreading outside the Equateur province. The Congolese government and WHO have identified 115 possible points of entry and exit from the province and Kinshasa, setting up special screening measures at airports in Mbandaka and Kinshasa.

Partner organizations and governments have already raced about USD 25 million to the region for a rapid response, aimed at containing the virus before it spreads to other cities up and down the Congo River. The US Agency for International Development has contributed about USD 5.3 million of that total, and governments in the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, Canada, and Italy have also chipped in. WHO has said a full-scale response could cost up to USD 57 million.

Teams from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which maintains a satellite office in Kinshasa, have been sent to Mbandaka and Bikoro to help with the response. More than 170 WHO experts have been sent to the 3 epicenters of the outbreak, and Doctors Without Borders [Médecins sans Frontières; MSF] is operating isolation facilities in Mbandaka and Bikoro. The group is building 2 more Ebola treatment centers in the towns of Iboko and Itipo.

The Ebola virus can incubate in a human body for up to 21 days before a person shows any symptoms. Once a virus has been identified, a country must make it 2 successive incubation periods -- 42 days -- without a new case before being declared free of the Ebola virus.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The number of points of entry and exit cited from the province and Kinshasa -- 115 -- is probably a low estimate of the number of possible locations of transit an individual could use. How to control those points that are not official points of entry/exit is a challenge. See report from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) below for more on monitoring points of entry.
A further challenge is the number of days Ebola virus can incubate in the body, that is, 21, before symptoms are evident. The question is whether the infected individual is silently infectious during the incubation period. -Mod.LK]

[WHO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, edited]
http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272761/SITREP-EVD-DRC-20180605-eng.pdf

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains active. On 3 Jun 2018, 6 new suspected EVD cases have been reported in Bikoro (5) and Wangata (1) health zones. 3 laboratory specimens (from suspected cases reported on 2 Jun 2018) tested negative. No new confirmed EVD cases and no new deaths have been reported since our last situation update on 1 Jun 2018.

Since the beginning of the outbreak (on 4 Apr 2018), a total of 56 EVD cases and 25 deaths (case fatality rate 44.6 per cent) have been reported, as of 3 Jun 2018. Of the 56 cases, 37 have been laboratory confirmed, 13 are probable (deaths for which it was not possible to collect laboratory specimens for testing), and 6 are suspected. Of the confirmed and probable cases, 25 (50 per cent) are from Iboko, followed by 21 (42 per cent) from Bikoro and four (8 per cent) from Wangata health zones. A total of 5 healthcare workers have been affected, with 4 confirmed cases and 2 deaths.

The outbreak has remained localised to the 3 health zones initially affected: Iboko (23 confirmed cases, 2 probable, 5 deaths), Bikoro (10 confirmed cases, 11 probable, 5 suspected, 17 deaths), and Wangata (4 confirmed cases, 1 suspected, 3 deaths). As of 31 May 2018, a total of 880 contacts remain under active follow-up.

[2] Response
- 5 Jun 2018. IOM (International Organization for Migration) DR Congo - Migration Health Division - Ebola Response Bulletin, 5 Jun 2018
[UN OCHA, ReliefWeb, IOM report, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/iom-dr-congo-migration-health-division-ebola-response-bulletin-5

IOM'S response focus
--------------------
- Population mobility mapping (PMM) at border-crossings and in the affected province.
- Points of entry (POE) surveillance (health screening).
- Infection prevention and control measures (hygiene promotion) at POE.
- Risk communication at POE.
- Cross-border coordination between Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Central African Republic (CAR), and Republic of the Congo (ROC).

The Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Equateur province of DRC has been declared a public health emergency. IOM is working closely with the Congolese Ministry of Health (MoH) and WHO to contain the outbreak and address the needs of affected communities.

Population mobility, including cross-border movements, was identified as a significant risk for disease transmission in this outbreak, as the epicentre of the disease is well linked with heavily populated areas through land and by the Congo River. In order to mitigate transmission risk and control the outbreak, IOM, MoH, and WHO conducted joint assessments at various points of entry (POE) to DRC's capital Kinshasa, to gauge the strength of the area's epidemiological surveillance system. IOM has supported the deployment of 16 epidemiologists, medical doctors, veterinarians, and hygiene specialists to key border areas to conduct POE surveillance, risk communication, infection prevention and control (IPC).

Harnassing the expertise in migration to guide the Ebola response
-----------------------------------------------------------------
IOM's partnership & immediate response
--------------------------------------
IOM works closely with the MoH, particularly with the National Programme of Hygiene at Borders (PNHF), to support their response efforts and coordination at points of entry (POE). IOM is supporting PNHF's surveillance activities at 30 sites (20 in Mbandaka, 3 in Bikoro, 2 Ntondo, 2 Iboko, 1 Ingenge, 1 Irebu) and 1 site in Lukolera of Mai Ndombe. The POE surveillance is conducted along with risk communication and hygiene promotion. IOM will soon provide on-site supervision and predeployment training to strengthen the POE surveillance capacity, and expand activities to Kinshasa and the areas along the Congo river in Mai Ndombe.

IOM is also conducting daily flow monitoring at 16 data collection sites in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, Ingenge, and Lukolera, in order to understand the mobility volume and profiles of travelers, including internal and cross-border movements (to/from the Central African Republic and the Republic of the Congo).

- 5 Jun 2018. Ebola DR Congo: church response
[National Catholic Reporter, edited]
https://www.ncronline.org/news/world/church-suspends-sacraments-deadly-ebola-outbreak-spreads
[byline: G Jeffrey MacDonald]

An Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo last month [May 2018] has led Roman Catholics to stop administering several sacraments temporarily in an attempt to keep the deadly disease from spreading.

Catholics will not be baptized, confirmed, ordained, or anointed until further notice in the country's northwestern regions hardest hit by the outbreak, which has claimed at least 25 lives since 8 May [2018], when the outbreak was first confirmed. The new regulations cover the Archdiocese of Mbandaka-Bikoro, which spans about 59 000 miles [about 95 000 km]. Some 650 000 of the region's 1.2 million residents are Catholics, according to church statistics.

Archbishop Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, apostolic administrator for the archdiocese, announced the order suspending the use of sacraments that require physical contact to administer. A [30 May 2018] diocesan statement said the purpose is to prevent the spread of Ebola virus disease, also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever [an unfortunate misnomer as hemorrhagic fever is rare. - Mod.LK]. The disease has infected one priest so far, but he has recovered, according to Besungu. "This is to prevent the spread of Ebola haemorrhagic fever," Besungu said. A government tally found at least 54 people have been infected over the past month.

In parishes where new regulations take effect, bishops and priests will administer communion to the hand, not the mouth. The sign of peace, which typically involves handshakes and hugs, will be given verbally instead. ...

The church is now trying to raise awareness of high-risk behaviors that are to be avoided. For instance, Besungu noted the disease can spread when family members handle Ebola victims' corpses, including those recently seen being carried on motorcycles for burial.

Many locals in the area believe the disease resulted from a curse after victims ate stolen meat of a wild animal in the countryside, according to church officials. Church leaders aim to help locals understand that Ebola can spread from one species to another. "The people are very poor and hunt wild animals for food. This has put many of them at risk. We are speaking strongly against (eating meat from wildlife)," said the Rev Josue' Bulambo Lembe-Lembe of the Church of Christ in Congo in Bukavu in a telephone interview with Religion News Service. His church has put water cans and soap at entrances for visitors to wash hands as a preventative measure.

For Caritas, a Catholic relief organization, the focus is on prevention through proper hygiene, sanitation, community mobilization, and communication. "We are counting on the involvement of priests, men and women religious, teachers, and healthcare workers," said Jeanne Marie Abanda, Caritas coordinator for the Mbandaka region, in a statement posted on the organization's website.

The DRC government and WHO, working with church-based aid organizations and others, have mounted a massive effort to contain the virus. For the first time WHO has used a vaccine to prevent the disease. ...

[byline: Jillian Kestler-D'Amours]

Medics and officials say swift action, awareness campaigns, and central leadership key lessons in dealing with disease. According to Chikwe Ihekweazu [national coordinator of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control], the biggest challenge with Ebola remains a lack of understanding about the disease and its causes, which then leads to uncertainty about where it will pop up next.

Countries also need to build health networks that will be able to rapidly collect samples and transport them to laboratories for testing. "Once you get that architecture right, you'll be in a much better position to detect [Ebola], and once you can detect, you're in a much better place to mount an appropriate response," he said.

[3] Treatment
- 6 Jun 2018. Experimental drugs approved for use in Congo Ebola outbreak
[CNN, edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/06/health/ebola-drugs-therapeutics-compassionate-use-intl/index.html
[byline: Meera Senthilingam]

Five experimental drugs have been approved for use on patients in the Ebola outbreak under way in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The treatments were allowed [Mon 4 Jun 2018] by a Congo ethics committee on the grounds of compassionate use. Such treatments have never before been widely available or used during an Ebola outbreak, WHO said [on Wed 6 Jun 2018]; at least one of the drugs was used on a limited basis in the 2014 West African outbreak.

There have been 58 cases of Ebola reported, including 27 deaths, since the outbreak was declared 8 May 2018. 37 cases have been confirmed with laboratory tests. Control of the outbreak has focused on efforts such as patient isolation and care, contact tracing, community awareness and the use of an experimental vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV. Vaccination began in the urban setting of Mbandaka and spread to rural regions like Bikoro, where the outbreak began.

Last week [week of 28 May 2018], WHO was "cautiously optimistic" about the outbreak, as Mbandaka seemed relatively safeguarded and officials hadn't "seen an explosive increase in cases," said Dr Peter Salama, the deputy director-general of WHO's Emergencies Program.

The 5 approved experimental therapeutics are the monoclonal antibody cocktails ZMapp, REGN, and mAb 114 and the antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir. All but favipiravir are already in Congo, WHO said on Wednesday. "Clinicians working in the treatment centres will make decisions on which drug to use as deemed helpful for their patients, and appropriate for the setting. The treatments can be used as long as informed consent is obtained from patients and protocols are followed, with close monitoring and reporting of any adverse events," WHO said.

Some of the treatments require IV infusion, while others require daily assessment of liver and kidney function, according to Dr Michael Ryan, WHO assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response. Use of the drugs will also form part of a clinical trial to assess their effectiveness and inform use in future outbreaks.

In 2014, ZMapp was used to treat 2 American missionary workers, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who contracted Ebola in Liberia. Previously, the experimental drug had been tested only in monkeys. It was later used to treat other patients during the same outbreak.

Vaccination, therapeutic, and control efforts have and will be carried out through partnerships between WHO, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), and many other nongovernmental organizations on the ground in Congo.

Ebola virus disease, which most commonly affects people and nonhuman primates such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees, is caused by 1 of 5 Ebola viruses. On average, about 50 per cent of people who become ill with Ebola die. ...

- 7 Jun 2018. Ebola outbreak may open door to finding drugs that work
[The Business Times, Bloomberg report, summ., edited]
https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/consumer/ebola-outbreak-may-open-door-to-finding-drugs-that-work

Scientists are seeking a way to offer compassionate treatment for patients with few options while doing painstaking data collection to evaluate the drugs. "There's a consensus that we really need to move forward," said Vasee Moorthy, an infectious diseases doctor at WHO, who coordinated vaccine research during the last Ebola epidemic. "We hope that by the end of this outbreak we gradually have more information about which drugs provide benefits to patients."

The obstacles are steep. Normally, researchers test an individual drug against a placebo, but they'd forego it in this case for ethical reasons. They must also devise a way to randomly assign patients to various treatment groups while taking into account individual medical needs and watching for side effects. Carrying out a trial that pits multiple untested medicines against one another would be challenging in the best of conditions. This one would take place in an impoverished, equatorial nation of 78 million that's home to the river that gave Ebola its name and much of the world's 2nd-largest tropical forest. Drugs will need to be shipped by riverboat, on unpaved roads or by helicopter to overcome a lack of infrastructure inland. Some must be kept cold in the hot, humid climate.

"This is no simple piece of work," Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, said at a briefing in Geneva last week. "But if we don't learn now, then we'll never know which are the better drugs to use."

One of the medicines, called ZMapp, has been through another potential pitfall of testing experimental treatments during a public-health crisis. Because it was only tried towards the end of the last Ebola outbreak -- just as international aid agencies were getting the contagion under control -- it wasn't given to enough patients to reach conclusive results. ... Still, the drug showed promise. 8 of 36 people who took it died, compared with 13 of 35 who had standard care alone. Larry Zeitlin, president of closely held Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, which developed the treatment with the US and Canadian governments, said the need for clinical data must not eclipse treatment priorities. "The goal is to provide it for compassionate use," he said by telephone. "You obviously don't want to compromise the public health process by being too concerned about a clinical trial."

[Antiviral compounds are always going to be needed even if a vaccine is successful, thus this is an opportune time to test them. They carry many of the same challenges as the vaccine, such as needing a cold chain. But even under the best of circumstances, it is going to be difficult to interpret results with 5 different antivirals under evaluation, and trying to do the most for the patients without jeopardizing their well being. The trials are going to need to be monitored very closely. - Mod.LK]

White House reverses taking away Ebola funds
--------------------------------------------
The Trump Administration yesterday [5 Jun 2018] removed cuts in Ebola funding, along with a few other items, from its proposed budget rescissions yesterday, Roll Call reported. The Ebola money targeted for cuts last month [May 2018] was USD 252 million in unspent funds that the last administration had allocated for West Africa's Ebola outbreak, funding that was meant to help countries at risk for the disease improve their health and emergency response systems.

The originally proposed rescissions were first announced in early May 2018, as news was emerging of the current DRC outbreak, for which the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has contributed up to USD 8 million. The Trump Administration has praised the DRC for allocating its own funds and other countries for their significant contributions to the response.

[This is welcome news, but there should exist a protected readily available preparedness fund to address outbreaks of any agent. These events are not diminishing, but rather increasing - such as mosquitoborne agents West Nile, chikungunya, Zika; zoonotic diseases MERS, SARS, Nipah, Lassa, in addition to Ebola. The US ramped up its response to terrorists, but nature provides the greatest challenge to our safety and remains unpredictable. We only know we will experience more infectious disease events against which we must be prepared before they re/emerge. - Mod.LK
