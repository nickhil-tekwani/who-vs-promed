Charlie Brown di Rutigliano & Figli S.r.l, in Bari, Italy is
recalling Cerignola Olives, Nocellara Olives and Castelvetrano Olives
from distribution, because they have the potential to be contaminated
with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium that can cause a
life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use
the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.
The recalled olives were distributed to wholesalers, who then
distributed them nationally to restaurants and retail stores. This
recall covers all sizes of cans, glass jars and pouches of Cerignola
Olives, Nocerella Olives and Castelvetrano Olives containing codes
beginning with the letter "G" followed by 3 or 4 digits under the
following brands: Borrelli, Bonta di Puglia, Cento, Corrado's, Dal
Raccolto, Flora, Roland and Vantia.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this
problem. The potential for contamination was noted after routine
testing found that the product had a higher than required pH. In
response to these findings, the firm has amended its process to
assure new product meets pH requirements.

[This is the 4th recall of olives this month (March 2007) regarding
botulism risk. Many food-product recalls that are botulism-related,
as this one is, involve inadequate preparation conditions that would
predispose to the production of the bacterial neurotoxin, not
necessarily the finding of the toxin in the food.
Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food. - Mod.LL]
