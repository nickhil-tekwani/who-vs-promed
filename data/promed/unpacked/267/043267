Considered by most agronomists to be by far the biggest threat to UK cereal crops, septoria has come into even sharper focus as it has developed reduced sensitivity to key fungicides, affecting their performance in the field. Septoria risk factors [include] mild winters, wet conditions in spring, susceptible wheat varieties, early sowing, and high rainfall.

The declining effectiveness of fungicides is placing more emphasis on an integrated approach. Early-sown crops are infected quickly, drilling date is particularly important with susceptible varieties and in a high-pressure year. Plant breeders are making good progress with introducing genetic resistance to septoria, with resistant varieties having an impact on both disease level and yield. There are now 2 [wheat] varieties with a [high resistance] rating, although they are still likely to need spraying.

Septoria fungicides [are] limited to 3 main groups -- azole, SDHI [succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor] and multisite. 2 of these have already lost or will be losing key products [that] will be banned. Azoles have seen the biggest decline in performance, with their eradicant control dropping by over 60% since they were introduced. Shifts in sensitivity to the SDHIs have also been seen, but in most situations they are still giving good control. Multisites, which have been in use for many years, remain unaffected and have a low risk of resistance. However, only [one] multisite may be available to growers in the future. Strobilurins are ineffective against septoria, due to widespread resistance. SDHI/azole mixes give the highest level of septoria control. All fungicide programmes on wheat must adhere to the guidelines on resistance management.

[Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_, and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley, oats, occasionally rye, and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 percent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy (where it would affect the ears most), removal of inoculum sources and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED post 20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide.

Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging, for example, in the UK and other parts of Europe (ProMED post 20160516.4225677), as well as Australia and New Zealand (ProMED posts 20161031.4598540 and 20140417.2410219). With high disease levels recently reported in the UK on winter wheat cultivars currently considered to be resistant to the pathogens (ProMED post 20190218.6322156), host resistance break down may also be a possibility.

Integrated disease management, including varying crops or crop cultivars in time and space, as well as rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides, as mentioned above, is vital to extend the useful life of host resistances and agrochemical compounds. SDHI (succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) fungicides are not new, but have previously had limited use so that resistance remained limited to a few pathogens and crops. A "2nd generation" of SDHIs is currently being used to combat fungal diseases that have developed resistance to other groups of fungicides. Azole (demethylase inhibitor, DMI, also called sterol biosynthesis inhibitors) fungicides are the largest class of fungicides and were introduced in the 1970s and new products continue to be introduced. Strobilurins are strongly antifungal agents produced by fungi. Being derived from natural products, they are considered environmentally safe but, like several other fungicide classes, they have single-site activity and therefore pathogen resistance is of major concern worldwide.
