Epidemiological update: measles in the region of the Americas
-------------------------------------------------------------
Several factors have contributed to the outbreaks of measles and diphtheria in the region of the Americas, including lack of compliance of vaccination coverage. Moreover, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the demand for vaccination services, followed by the impact on the vaccination coverages and the postponement of vaccination campaigns.

The following is a summary of the epidemiological situation of measles in 2020, as of epidemiological week (EW) 53.

In 2020, between EW 1 and EW 53, 9 countries in the region of the Americas have reported a total of 8726 confirmed cases of measles, including 11 deaths: Argentina (61 cases including 1 death), Bolivia (2 cases), Brazil (8448 cases including 10 deaths), Canada (1 case), Chile (2 cases), Colombia (1 case), Mexico (196 cases), the USA (13 cases), and Uruguay (2 cases). In 2020, a total of 97% of the cases were reported in Brazil, and currently only Brazil is reporting active outbreaks of measles. This event constitutes a hazard for other countries and territories in the region of the Americas.

The following is the epidemiological situation for measles for Brazil and USA where new confirmed cases of measles have been reported since the prior PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Measles published on 16 Nov [2020].

In Brazil, between EW 1 and EW 53 of 2020, a total of 16 836 suspected cases have been reported, of which 8448 (50%) were confirmed, including 10 deaths, 7975 were discarded, and 413 remain under investigation. During the same period, a total of 21 federal units (including Federal District) reported cases of measles, and the federal units still reporting ongoing outbreaks are Para, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo [and] Amapa.

In 2020, between EW 1 and EW 11 of 2020, there have been an average of 1039 cases per epidemiological week. Since EW 11, there has been a progressive decline in the number of reported suspected cases that coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the prioritization of public health actions in that context. During the last 6 weeks of 2020 (EW 48 to EW 53), there have been an average of 30 cases per epidemiological week (Figure 2 [see 2nd source URL]).

Among the 8448 confirmed cases, 4892 (58%) were unvaccinated and 1744 (21%) were vaccinated. For 2106 cases (21%), no information regarding vaccination status was available.

In 2020, the federal units with the highest cumulative incidence rates of confirmed measles cases in Brazil are Para (94 cases per 100 000 population), Amapa (34/100 000). Maranhao (32/100 000), and Rio de Janeiro (10/100 000), and the 4 federal units with ongoing outbreaks in 2020 are Para with 5385 confirmed cases including 8 deaths, Rio de Janeiro with 1348 confirmed cases including 1 death, Sao Paulo with 867 confirmed cases including 1 death, and Amapa with 191 confirmed cases.

Between EW 26 of 2019 and EW 53 of 2020, the main genotype identified in the federal units with active outbreaks has been D8, lineage MVs/Gir Somnath.IND/42.16/. The [genotypes] MVi/Hulu Langat.MYS/26.11/, MVi/Delhi.IND/01.14/06, and MVs/Istanbul.TUR/28.18/ were also identified in less proportion. Among the confirmed cases reported in 2020, only the genotype D8, lineage MVs/Gir Somnath.IND/42.16/ was identified.

The following is a summary of the epidemiological situation of federal units with ongoing outbreaks:

In Para State, between EW 1 and EW 53 of 2020, a total of 8318 suspected cases of measles were reported, of which 5385 were confirmed (including 8 deaths), 2927 were discarded, and 6 remain under investigation. The highest incidence rates by age group are among those under 1 year of age (738 cases per 100 000 population), followed by 15-19 year olds (180/100 000) and 20-29 year olds (145/100 000). Among the confirmed cases, 3739 (70%) were unvaccinated and 673 (12%) were vaccinated (information regarding the number of doses per person was unavailable). For 966 cases (18%), no information regarding vaccination status was available. The most recent confirmed case had rash onset on 11 Dec 2020 and was reported in Bagre municipality.

In Rio de Janeiro State, between EW 1 and EW 53 of 2020, a total of 2830 suspected cases of measles were reported, of which 1348 were confirmed (including 1 death), 1431 were discarded, and 51 remain under investigation. The highest incidence rates by age group are among those under 1 year of age (130 cases per 100 000 population), followed by 15-19 year olds (24/100 000) and 1-4 year olds (20/100 000). Among the confirmed cases, 496 (37%) were unvaccinated and 513 (38%) were vaccinated (information regarding the number of doses per person was unavailable). For 339 cases (25%), no information regarding vaccination status was available. The most recent confirmed case had rash onset on 10 Nov 2020 and was reported in Rio de Janeiro municipality.

[Although this report specifically pertains to measles in the Americas, for a global perspective see: ProMED. Measles update (27): global surge 20201126.7972745, which reports on a publication by the World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that between 2016 and 2020, cases shot up to 869 770. This is the most reported cases since 1996 and a staggering increase of around 556%.

In recent months the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated vaccination efforts. According to the UN, "more than 94 million people were at risk of missing measles vaccines in 26 countries that have paused their vaccination campaigns, including many countries with ongoing outbreaks."

The report continues, "Measles is entirely preventable, but success requires 95% of children to be vaccinated on time with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccines (MCV1 and MCV2). MCV1 coverage has been stagnant globally for more than a decade at between 84 and 85%, while MCV2 coverage has been steadily increasing but is still only at 71%.

"Natasha Crowcroft, senior technical advisor on measles and rubella at the WHO, said that the good news was that measles vaccinations had saved more than 25.5 million lives globally since 2000. But the low vaccine coverage meant the number of unprotected children was growing every year."

Also: "Weak health systems and the inability to reach children were the main problem globally, and vaccine hesitancy was an additional problem in some countries, [Crowcroft] said." (https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/11/1077482).

Support to improve the health infrastructure is badly needed in many countries. While the countries with the worst measles outbreaks (Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC], Madagascar, Central African Republic [CAR], Georgia, Kazakhstan, North Macedonia, Samoa, Tonga, and Ukraine) are not in the Americas, which this post addresses, many countries need support to address diseases (e.g., measles, malaria, TB) neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important that suspended vaccination campaigns be reinitiated. - Mod.LK
