Outbreak of trichinellosis in swine
-----------------------------------
A team of teachers and researchers from the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine Department of Parasitic Diseases, at the Universidad Nacional
del Nordeste (Unne -- National University of the Northeast) confirmed
the 1st outbreak of trichinellosis in pigs in the province
[Corrientes]. The results of the studies will be presented on Fri 21
Oct 2011.

Doctors Oscar Racioppi and Jose Alvarez of the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine at Unne and state agency professionals confirmed the outbreak
of trichinellosis in the city [Corrientes, capital of the province].
The Corrientes Ministry of Production asked them to carry out studies
following a report from the provincial Ministry of Health of a case of
human trichinellosis in the city of Corrientes.

Cases of trichinellosis in pigs had been suspected from the way these
animals are raised, being fed from the main city landfill. An
operation, unprecedented in the province, was then carried out jointly
by the Ministry of Production and the National Food Safety and Quality
Service (SENASA; Servicio National de Sanidad Agraria).

The diagnosis was confirmed by the digestion technique, the only
method recognized and approved by SENASA for these cases.

The operation was divided into 4 stages and the positive result was
obtained during the 1st. In that stage, 186 of 750 pigs destined for
slaughter were culled. The affected producers were compensated by the
MPTyT [Ministerio de Producci√≥n, Trabajo y Turismo; Ministry of
Production, Labor and Tourism]. The culled animals were from different
categories, ages, provenance, and owners.

Researchers obtained diaphragm samples from 115 animals after the cull
and all the carcasses were buried in a pit in accordance with
regulations. The samples were processed as suspected cases and divided
into 11 groups of 10 samples of 10 grams each, and one group of 5
samples of 20 grams each. Results were positive for 2 animals: one
with 7.85 larvae/g and the other with 5.95 larvae/g.

These data allowed the confirmation of the outbreak after the 1st
diagnosis by digestion in Corrientes of trichinellosis in pigs.

The results of this work will be presented to the scientific and
academic communities during the 6th meeting of the Faculty of
Veterinary Sciences Extension, on 21 Oct 2011.

Professionals from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine Department of
Parasitic Diseases, Unne, issued a warning due to the numerous
questionable and clandestine pig holdings that exist in the provinces
of Chaco and Corrientes. Animals slaughtered in these premises
circumvent the control techniques of the National Food Safety and
Quality Service (SENASA) required for the meat to be suitable for
consumption.

Scientists say it is proven that increasing poverty brings with it
outbreaks of trichinellosis. This is because the pig is an animal that
is mistakenly easily raised and fed in landfills. Hence, the equation
professionals say never fails: "dump + pig + rat = trichinellosis in
humans".

Characteristics of trichinellosis
---------------------------------
Trichinellosis is an endemic disease in Argentina and in 2010 there
were 600 reported cases, of which 90 per cent were in the provinces of
Buenos Aires, Cordoba, and Santa Fe

It is a foodborne disease and in Argentina the main source of
infection is pork of dubious origin, undercooked or raw (dry sausages,
bondiola, salami).

It is a zoonosis, that is, a disease transmitted from animals to
humans, caused by the parasite _Trichinella spiralis_. Humans and
domestic and wild animals can be infected and become carriers of the
parasite.

The infection can also be acquired through consumption of pork from
pigs slaughtered without the corresponding veterinary control. Inside
the body _Trichinella_ tear the muscle fibers, resulting in severe
muscle pain.

The disease in pigs is linked to the environment they inhabit and the
food they receive. They become infected after eating meat scraps with
trichinellosis from other pigs, rodents, wild pigs, and other
carnivores. Symptoms in pigs are not obvious, so a pig in apparently
good condition may be infected.

During the 1st week following the ingestion of contaminated food, the
person who contracted trichinellosis experiences loss of appetite,
vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Trichinellosis also produces
swelling of the eyelids, temperature spikes, and a state of malaise
similar to the flu.

[The study clearly demonstrates infections with _Trichinella_ spp. in
domestic pigs. The study points to the problem with outdoor feeding
and deliberately circumvention of the veterinary rules of meat
inspection before the products are sold for human consumption.
