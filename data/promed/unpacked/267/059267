Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease caused by infection with
_Histoplasma capsulatum_. Histoplasmosis, which can be acquired from
soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings, occurs worldwide and is
one of the most common pulmonary and systemic mycoses in the USA (1).
However, among international travelers returning from areas in which
histoplasmosis is endemic, histoplasmosis is rare, accounting for
less than 0.5 percent of all diseases diagnosed in this group (1,2).

During February-March 2008, the Pennsylvania and Virginia departments
of health investigated a cluster of respiratory illness among 3
mission groups that had traveled separately to El Salvador to
renovate a church. This report summarizes the results of the
investigation. Of 33 travelers in the 3 mission groups for whom
information was available, 20 (61 percent) met the case definition
for histoplasmosis.

Persons who reported sweeping and cleaning outdoors (relative risk
(RR) = 2.1, 95 percent confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-3.6), digging
(RR = 2.6, CI = 1.1-6.1), or working in a bird or bat roosting area
(RR = 1.8, CI = 1.3-2.4) had a greater risk for illness. The
findings emphasize the need for travelers and persons involved in
construction activities to use personal protective equipment and
decrease dust-generation when working in areas where histoplasmosis
is endemic. Clinicians should consider histoplasmosis as a possible
cause of acute respiratory or influenza-like illness in travelers
returning from areas in which histoplasmosis is endemic.

On 13 Feb 2008, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH)
notified the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) of a cluster of 9
persons with respiratory illness. The 9 persons were among 11 members
of a Pennsylvania-based mission group who had been renovating a
church in Nueva San Salvador, El Salvador, during 20-27 Jan 2008. 2
other mission groups, from Virginia (16 members) and from
Pennsylvania (8 members), had traveled separately to assist with
renovations of the same church during 3-10 Jan 2008 and 2-10 Feb
2008, respectively. After arrival, mission members immediately began
renovation activities at the church. Renovation projects varied among
the mission groups and included cleaning of indoor and outdoor
renovation sites, electrical and plumbing installation, construction
of additional rooms, roof replacement, and septic tank excavation.
Mission members remained in El Salvador for the entire trip, but also
visited local markets and churches and took a 1 day trip to either a
beach or lake.

The initial report from PADOH indicated that all 9 persons from the
initial cluster, upon returning from El Salvador, had presented to
their health-care providers with respiratory symptoms. One of these
persons was diagnosed with suspected histoplasmosis based on physical
exam and a chest radiograph. To search for additional cases of
illness among the mission groups, PADOH and VDH contacted the trip
organizers and leaders.

A case of histoplasmosis was defined as 1) a laboratory-confirmed _H.
capsulatum_ infection or 2) self-reported fever and 2 additional
symptoms (i.e., headache, cough, chest pain, or difficulty breathing)
beginning at least 24 hours after arrival in El Salvador, in any
mission group member who traveled to El Salvador during 3 Jan - 10
Feb 2008. Laboratory-confirmation was defined as either a urine or
serum _Histoplasma_ antigen enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test result
of greater than 0.6 ng/mL.

All participants from each mission group were administered a standard
questionnaire through their church pastors or through telephone
interviews. Information collected included demographics, illness,
underlying health conditions, protective measures used, and potential
exposures. Medical records of hospitalized patients also were
reviewed, and a retrospective cohort study of the mission members was
conducted.

Statistical differences between proportions were assessed using
chi-square and Fisher's exact tests of significance, when
appropriate. Mean ages were compared using a t-test. Relative risk
and 95 percent confidence interval estimates were calculated using
Poisson regression analysis with robust variance.

Information was collected from 33 (94 percent) of the 35 mission
group participants. 20 persons (12 males and 8 females) met the case
definition for histoplasmosis, for an overall attack rate of 61
percent. The 20 cases included histoplasmosis in 5 (36 percent) of 14
persons from the Virginia mission group, 9 (82 percent) of 11 persons
from the 1st Pennsylvania mission group, and 6 (75 percent) of 8
persons from the 2nd Pennsylvania mission group (Figure [for figure
and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). 7 (35 percent) of the 20 ill
persons met the case definition through laboratory-confirmed
histoplasmosis based on urine specimens tested by EIA. The other 13
(65 percent) ill persons met the case definition through the symptom
criteria, but 8 of these 13 persons had urine specimens that tested
negative by EIA. No participants had paired serologic antibody test
results available. Median time from symptom onset to specimen
collection date was 6 days (range: 1-28 days).

Incubation periods could not be calculated because exact dates of
exposure were not available; however, the median number of days
between arriving in El Salvador and onset of symptoms was 12 (range:
3-25 days). Primary symptoms reported among the 20 ill persons
meeting the case definition included fatigue (100 percent), fever or
chills (95 percent), and headache (95 percent) (Table 1). 19 (95
percent) of the 20 ill persons visited a health-care provider, and 6
(30 percent) required hospitalization for their illness; all
subsequently recovered. Because the clinical manifestation of
histoplasmosis partly depends on the underlying health and immune
status of the host, mission members were asked about their underlying
medical conditions. 3 ill persons reported a history of cancer, none
reported a history of chronic lung disease, and none were current smokers.

Differences in age (p=0.13), sex (p=0.44), and membership in mission
group (p=0.06) were not statistically significant. Digging (RR =
2.6), sweeping or cleaning outdoors (RR = 2.1), and septic tank
excavation (RR = 1.7) were associated with increased risk for illness
(Table 2). For those persons who reported 2 or 3 high-risk exposures,
defined as digging, sweeping indoors, or sweeping outdoors, the
relative risk for illness was elevated (RR = 2.6), compared with
those who reported no such high-risk exposures. In addition, those
persons who worked in an area where bird or bat excrement was
observed or where birds or bats were roosting had a higher attack
rate than those who did not work in such areas. Sample size was not
sufficient to stratify the analysis by mission group. None of the
participants reported wearing a mask as personal protective equipment
while working at the church site.

Editorial Note:
---------------
_H. capsulatum_, the fungal causative agent of histoplasmosis, is
endemic in the midwestern and central USA, Mexico, Central and South
America, parts of eastern and southern Europe, parts of Africa,
eastern Asia, and Australia (1). The fungus grows in the soil and its
growth is thought to be enhanced by bird and bat excrement.

Disruption of soil that contains bird or bat excrement is the primary
means of aerosolization of and exposure to spores. Several reports
have documented occupationally acquired outbreaks specifically
associated with construction or renovation activities (4,5). However,
persons not directly involved in the soil-disruption process,
including travelers in the area, also are at increased risk because
airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet (6). A histoplasmosis
outbreak involving approximately 250 college students visiting a
resort hotel in Mexico was associated with ongoing construction at
the hotel (6).

This is the 1st report of an outbreak of histoplasmosis among
volunteer workers performing construction activities abroad. Evidence
gathered during this investigation is consistent with previous
research and revealed that performing outdoor activities,
particularly those that cause soil disruption and spore
aerosolization, increased the risk for acquiring histoplasmosis.
Specifically, the 2 activities with the highest relative risk for
illness were digging and sweeping outdoors.

Histoplasmosis infections typically are asymptomatic or cause mild
symptoms from which persons recover without antifungal or other
treatment; persons with more severe forms of the infection (i.e.,
acute pulmonary, chronic pulmonary, and progressive disseminated
histoplasmosis) are recommended for treatment with antifungal agents,
such as amphotericin B (7). In this outbreak, the high overall attack
rate among an otherwise healthy cohort, along with illness severe
enough to require health-care services (including hospitalization),
suggests substantial exposure to fungal spores during the renovation
activities. In addition, working in an environment harboring bird or
bat excrement likely increased the risk for acquiring histoplasmosis.

Ultimately, the cause of this outbreak might be that the volunteers
were not aware of the risk for histoplasmosis and therefore took no
precautions, such as using personal protective equipment or taking
care to decrease dust generation when working in this area of endemic
disease. Although persons living or working in areas of endemic
histoplasmosis might have previous health education and training
about the risk and prevention of this disease, volunteers who travel
to and work in these areas are likely to have limited, if any,
training on disease risk and prevention.

Multiple laboratory tests, including culture, histopathology,
serology, and EIA antigen tests, can be used to diagnose
histoplasmosis. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests depend
on factors that include the patient's clinical syndrome, type and
timing of specimen collection, fungal burden, and the host's immune
status (8). In general, testing of convalescent serum samples offers
the highest sensitivity for subacute and chronic pulmonary disease,
and antigen testing (i.e., a quantitative, 2nd-generation EIA),
appears to be one of the most sensitive tests for acute pulmonary
histoplasmosis (8). However, the EIA antigen test is less sensitive
in milder infections when the fungal burden is lower (8,9). In this
outbreak, 5 of 7 patients with a positive urine EIA test required
hospitalization.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations.
1st, information about exposures and illness were ascertained via
self-report, which might be associated with recall bias and
subsequent exposure and disease misclassification. 2nd,
misclassification of disease status is possible, given the negative
antigen test results and given that infection with other respiratory
pathogens (e.g., influenza virus) could not be ruled out for all ill
persons. Finally, the majority of diagnostic specimens were tested by
Histoplasma EIA only. Because EIA test sensitivity increases with
increasing illness severity (8,9), specimens collected from persons
with less severe disease might have tested falsely negative.

Persons in areas of endemic histoplasmosis who perform certain jobs
or activities, such as construction and farming, are at risk for
acquiring histoplasmosis (10). Travel clinics and organizers of group
travel to areas of endemic histoplasmosis should be informed about
the risk for histoplasmosis among travelers with potential exposure
to _H. capsulatum_. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of
histoplasmosis when evaluating a patient who has acute febrile
respiratory illness and has traveled to an area in which
histoplasmosis is endemic.

Clinicians also should inquire about the patient's activities in the
area of endemic disease. If histoplasmosis is suspected, consultation
with laboratory experts is recommended to ensure the proper
collection and referral of blood and urine specimens. Depending on
the patient's clinical presentation, antigen testing for
_Histoplasma_, convalescent serologic testing to detect antibodies,
or culture might be performed to diagnose histoplasmosis. Travelers
to areas of endemic histoplasmosis who visit caves or areas with high
concentrations of bird or bat excrement, or who perform
dust-generating activities, should consider using personal protective
equipment (e.g., respirators) and dust-suppression strategies (e.g.,
keeping surfaces wet) to reduce their potential exposure to _H. capsulatum_.

[This outbreak illustrates the necessity of knowing what diseases are
endemic in areas visited by international travelers. It is possible
that the lower attack rate in 1 of the 3 groups may have to do with a
wetter day when the possibility of aerosolization of the infectious
spores of histoplasmosis would be lower.

Recall that histoplasmosis is a dimorphic fungus that, like
coccidiodomycoses and blastomycosis among several others, exists in a
mold form in the soil and, when infecting humans, a yeast form in
tissue. Because of this, person-to-person transmission of these
infections is quite unusual.
