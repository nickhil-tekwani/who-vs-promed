Dengue cases in Negros Occidental increased by 100% in August from recorded
cases in July, health officials here said. The acting provincial health
officer, said his office recorded 716 cases in August with seven reported
deaths. In July, he said dengue cases in Negros were only 357 with 12
deaths. The capital city of Bacolod has the highest number of dengue cases
in Negros Occidental with 125 in July and 421 in August with two reported
deaths for each month. At least 633 dengue cases were recorded in Bacolod
since the start of the year. The total number of dengue cases in the
province reached 1,499 with 20 deaths since the start of the year.
The government spokesperson is quoted as saying he was surprised that
dengue cases increased in August because he had expected the number to
decrease. He said they would have to intensify the provincial drive
against dengue and solicit community participation to stop the spread of
the disease.
Dengue fever cases also continue to be admitted to different hospitals in
Tacloban City. At the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center in Tacloban,
about 50 children afflicted with dengue fever were confined at the
pediatrics ward yesterday. Other hospitals have several dengue patients,
mostly children.
