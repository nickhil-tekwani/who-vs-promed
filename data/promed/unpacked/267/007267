Dallas Animal Services has reported an increase in distemper cases among raccoons, particularly in the western part of the city.

Distemper is a deadly virus that shows signs similar to rabies. Although it cannot spread to humans and cats, the illness can spread to dogs through the environment and the air.

According to animal services, the increase in cases among raccoons have been seen in the 75208 and 75211 zip codes.

Animal services says unvaccinated dogs are at the most risk for catching the virus, and there is no cure. Anyone looking to vaccinate their dog for distemper can visit their veterinarian.

In order to avoid this risk of exposure, animal services recommends residents not attract raccoons to their yards by making sure trash bags and cans are sealed tightly and removing any dog or cat food and water bowls from outside.

Signs of distemper include lethargy, disorientation, vomiting, seizures, erratic behavior, and possible aggression.

[The contents of this article are somewhat misleading. The article says animals can catch the virus from the air. There must be viral particles in the air, and generally it requires relatively close contact.

"Canine distemper is a highly contagious, whole body, viral disease of dogs. It is characterized by fever, loss of white blood cells, nasal discharge, digestive signs, and inflammation of the lungs and brain. The disease is seen worldwide in Canidae (dogs, foxes, wolves), Mustelidae (including ferrets, mink, and skunks), and several other species of wild animals.

"Most cases of canine distemper develop after an animal breathes in the virus from droplets of moisture exhaled by an infected animal (aerosol route). Some infected dogs may spread the infectious virus for several months after outward signs of the disease have passed.

"A short fever usually occurs 3 to 6 days after infection. During this stage of the disease, blood tests might show low white blood cell counts. These signs may go unnoticed or be accompanied by loss of appetite. The fever subsides for several days before a 2nd fever occurs. The 2nd fever lasts less than 1 week and may be accompanied by a discharge from the nose and eyes, lethargy, and loss of appetite. Gastrointestinal and respiratory signs may follow and are usually complicated by bacterial infections. Overgrowth of the skin of the footpads ("hardpad" disease) and the nose may be seen. Signs of central nervous system involvement may be seen with these signs, after these signs pass, or without any additional signs. Neurologic signs often include: 1) localized involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles, such as in the leg or face; 2) slight or complete paralysis, often most noticeable in the hind limbs as failure of muscle coordination, followed by weakness and paralysis in all 4 legs; and 3) convulsions (seizures) with drooling and chewing movements of the jaw ("chewing-gum fits"). Additional neurologic signs include "circling" (walking in a circle instead of a straight line), a head tilt, and nystagmus (uncontrolled, rapid eye movements).

"Seizures become more frequent and severe as the disease progresses. The dog may fall on its side and paddle its legs. Involuntary urination and defecation often occur. Infection may be mild with few or no signs, or it may lead to severe disease showing most of the signs above. The course of the disease may be as short as 10 days, but the onset of neurologic signs may be delayed for several weeks or months.

"Inflammation of the brain in long term distemper (called "old dog encephalitis") is often marked by lack of coordination, compulsive movements (such as head pressing or continual pacing), and exaggerated muscle movements. These signs may be seen in adult dogs with or without a history of signs related to canine distemper. The development of neurologic signs is often progressive. Dogs with this form of the disease do not spread it to other dogs.

"Your veterinarian will consider distemper infection any time a puppy is feverish and has signs of widespread infection. While the typical case is not difficult to diagnose, the characteristic signs sometimes fail to appear until late in the disease. The infected dog may have other viral and bacterial infections that can complicate the picture Thus, blood work and other tests may be required to confirm the diagnosis.

"Treatment is designed to limit bacterial invasion, support fluid balance, and control nervous system problems. Antibiotics, fluids, supplemental feedings, medication to reduce fever, pain medications, and anticonvulsants are used as appropriate for the individual dog. No single treatment is specific or uniformly successful. Dogs may recover completely from the infection, but prompt, aggressive care is essential. Even with intensive care, some dogs do not make a satisfactory recovery. Unfortunately, treatment for the neurologic problems of distemper is usually not successful. If the neurologic signs are severe or continue to worsen, it may be appropriate to have the dog euthanized. Dogs with some of the long term, progressive forms of neurologic distemper have responded to immune system treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids.

"Vaccination is the most widely used and best available prevention for canine distemper. Puppies should be vaccinated when they are 6 weeks old and then at 3- to 4-week intervals until they are 16 weeks old. Your veterinarian will recommend an appropriate vaccination schedule for your pet taking into consideration the health of the animal, the frequency of the disease in your area, and other risk factors."

If your pet has not been vaccinated, it is recommended you see your veterinarian as quickly as possible to protect your pet. - Mod.TG
