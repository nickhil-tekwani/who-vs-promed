A new outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) has been confirmed in
Wales. This is the first outbreak in Wales for a month. Speaking on 21
Jun 2001, the new UK Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA), Margaret Beckett, stated that 4.5 million animals (almost 9
percent of the UK livestock population of 55 million) had been
destroyed in the past 4 months in a bid to control FMD.
France

new outbreaks. There had been 2 outbreaks in France.
Netherlands

The Dutch minister of Agriculture announced 25 Jun 2001 that the
Netherlands has regained official FMD-free status. The first
Netherlands outbreak was detected on a goat farm on 15 Mar 2001 in
Oene. The virus came from a batch of calves from Ireland that had
contacted sheep from England during a rest stop in France. There have
26 cases of FMD, the last on 22 Apr 2001.
100 000 animals (later destroyed) were vaccinated to control FMD
spread. Altogether more than 150 000 animals were killed. There were
many protests by farmers and consumers in favor of vaccination rather
than destruction. The outbreaks have led to debate about farming
including proposals for 25-30% fewer farm animals, less intensive
farming systems, abolition of cattle markets, ban on transportation
exceeding 8 hours, & better recording of sheep and their movements.
