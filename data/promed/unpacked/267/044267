An 11-year-old boy who died this week has been confirmed as
Indonesia's 50th human bird flu fatality. The boy died on Mon [18 Sep
2006] and test results from 2 laboratories confirmed he was infected
with the H5N1 virus, [according to] Nadirin, a doctor at the National
Avian Influenza Information Centre. Tests from 2 laboratories are
required for the World Health Organisation to count the fatality in its toll.
Nadirin said that the latest death brought the number of confirmed
deaths to 50, the highest reported anywhere in the world.
The boy, identified only by the initial A., came from Karanggentong
in densely-populated East Java and had come into contact with sick
poultry, the usual method of transmission of the virus, the doctor
said on Fri 22 Sep 2006. He had developed a fever, cough and
breathing difficulties 2 days before he died, the doctor added.
Indonesia's death toll from bird flu has been steadily rising as the
virus has marched across the archipelago nation, spreading to 29 of
its 33 provinces. While the virus does not spread easily among
people, the chance of a mutation that would allow it to do so is
heightened as more humans catch it from infected birds.

An 11-year-old Indonesian boy has died of bird flu, the Health
Ministry said today, taking the country's death toll from the disease
to 50. The boy died on Monday at a hospital in Tulungagung in East
Java province, said Runizar Ruesin, the head of the Health Ministry's
Bird Flu Information Centre. Tests by 2 local laboratories confirmed
he had bird flu, he said. "He had contact with dead chickens.
Chickens have died in his house," Mr Ruesin said. The ministry would
send officials to the area where the boy lived to investigate, he said.
Indonesia has the highest bird flu death toll of any nation. Not
including the latest death, the H5N1 avian flu virus has killed 144
people worldwide, the World Health Organisation says. The H5N1 virus
mainly affects birds but experts fear it could mutate into a strain
capable of killing millions of people in a global pandemic.
Indonesia has been criticised for not doing enough to combat the
disease, endemic in birds in most of the giant archipelago's
provinces. The United Nations bird flu coordinator, David Nabarro,
said last week that Indonesia had made progress in its fight against
the virus. But he expressed disappointment at the slow flow of funds
pledged by international donors to Indonesia for the effort.

This additional death of a patient in East Java raises the number of
confirmed human cases in Indonesia to 66 and the death toll to 50
(75.8 percent mortality). The global total of confirmed human cases
of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection now becomes 248 and the
global death toll 145 (58.5 percent mortality). - Mod.CP]
