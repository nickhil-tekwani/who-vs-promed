Seroepidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in Saudi Arabia (1993) and Australia (2014) and characterisation of assay specificity
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
The pseudoparticle virus neutralisation test (ppNT) and a conventional microneutralisation (MN) assay are specific for detecting antibodies to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) when used in seroepidemiological studies in animals. Genetically diverse MERS-CoV appear antigenically similar in MN tests. We confirm that MERS-CoV was circulating in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia in 1993. Preliminary data suggest that feral Australian dromedaries may be free of MERS-CoV but larger confirmatory studies are needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Serological evidence of MERS-CoV in dromedaries has been previously reported in archived sera dating back over past decades. Our data with serological assays that have been demonstrated to be free of cross-reaction with BCoV [bovine coronavirus] and other coronaviruses reconfirms that MERS-CoV was circulating in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia as early as 1993.

Although adult dromedaries in the Arabian peninsula and in North and East Africa (such as in Egypt, Nigeria, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Kenya) have very high seroprevalence to MERS-CoV (higher than 90 per cent), we found that the sera from adult dromedary camels in Australia were uniformly seronegative. Given the small number of sera tested in this study [see comment], a larger seroepidemiological study would be needed to confirm that Australia is indeed MERS-CoV free.

On the other hand, the BCoV-like virus so common in the Middle East is also prevalent in Australia. Dromedaries were imported into Australia between 1840 and 1907 to serve as means of transport but are now largely found as feral animals. The dromedary population in Australia is now estimated to be around 450 000.

We conclude that the MERS-CoV ppNT and MN tests reported here do not detect cross-reactive antibodies to other animal coronaviruses including the BCoV-like virus that is common in dromedaries. Thus these 2 serological assays can be used with confidence in seroepidemiological studies to identify animal species that may serve as reservoirs or vectors of MERS-CoV. We also confirm that MERS-CoV or a very closely related virus has been circulating in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia for at least 2 decades.

[The number of tested sera from Australia was 25, collected during 2014 from adult (older than 2 years) dromedary camels; 17 were obtained from feral camels from central Australia gathered and transported to an abattoir in Caboolture, Queensland, while the other 8 sera originated from a camel farm in Coominya, Queensland. As indicated by the authors, larger confirmatory studies are needed.

This paper, briefly discussed in ProMED-mail posting 20140607.2525113 (item 2), includes the following comment which deserves to be considered for endorsement and application:

"Munster et al [see reference below] showed that heat treatment (30 minutes at 63 deg C/145.4 deg F) of MERS-CoV-containing camel milk reduced levels of infectious virus below detection level. Boiling milk before consumption could be an easy, achievable local measure to prevent transmission and to preserve consumption of camel milk."
