Ban on measles vaccination lifted
---------------------------------
The study commissioned by the Minister of Health on the cause of the deaths
of 7 our of 37 infants who had received measles vaccinations in the
district of Mascara concluded that the deaths were due to "a non-respect of
rigorous procedures on preparation" of vaccines to be administered.
An epidemiological study was conducted by a team of specialists. The
doctors who studied the incident concluded that it was "an isolated case of
programmatic error". There was an error in reconstitution of the vaccine
with use of a solvent [as a diluent other than that supplied by the
Algerian Pasteur Institute (IPA).
The first investigations showed in effect that the lyophilized vaccine was
reconstituted at the time of vaccination, and due to an error "related to
service management" was [reconstituted with an inappropriate liquid, which
was not sterile water and which -- once administered to the infants --
acted as a mortal poison. The exact nature of the product, its composition
and the conditions behind its utilization will be announced publicly once
the epidemiological and toxicological investigations in Algeria and outside
the country are completed.
The Minister of Health confirmed that the deceased infants were vaccinated
from the same vial of vaccine (standard 10-dose vial) from lot NR T-6496,
which in came from a total amount of 334 900 doses (33 490 vials of
10-doses each). This lot, imported by the Algerian Pasteur Institute (IPA)
was produced by a large European Laboratory. The lot is valid for use
through December 2002 and had undergone all rigorous controls (for
potency). The lot in question has been distributed and in use nationwide
since 11 August 2001 without any problems identified before this episode.
In response to the deaths, the Ministry of health had a temporary ban on
vaccinations throughout the country. Once the cause of deaths was clearly
determined today, the temporary ban against vaccinations was lifted.

[As speculated in the earlier posting, it appears that the etiology of the
event was the use of incorrect diluent for the reconstitution of the
lyophilized vaccine. It appears that this involved only one vial of
vaccine. Training for vaccination programs includes procedures for
reconstitution of lyophilized vaccines, including the importance of keeping
the vaccine vials and the appropriate diluents stored in close proximity,
and in refrigerators and freezers that are to be used exclusively for
vaccines to avoid inadvertent mixing up of products and vials.
Of interest, Mod. LJDS from Pro-MED-PORT came up with a news article
discussing the deaths of 6 infants as a result of having been vaccinated
with insulin instead of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine in
a health post in rural Pernambuco Brazil. the news article was published on
22 May 1997 in "O Estado de Sao Paulo". Fortunately such errors with
serious consequences are rare. This current event serves as a sober
reminder on the importance of careful training and supply maintenance for
vaccination programs. We await further news on the results of the analyses.
