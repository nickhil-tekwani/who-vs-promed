Visceral leishmaniasis in northern Ethiopia
-----------------------------------------------
A rare and deadly parasitic disease has killed 159 people since late
2004 during an outbreak in northern Ethiopia, an international aid
agency said Tuesday.

A doctor from Medecins sans Frontieres said the majority of deaths
from kala azar, which is transmitted by an infected female sand fly,
have been among children under the age of 12. "We are still
diagnosing new cases," said Ioanna Pertsinibou. "If not treated the
sick will die in a few months."

Kala azar, also called visceral leishmaniasis, is almost always fatal
if left untreated. People who survive the disease are often left with
severe scarring.

The outbreak is in the town of Bura, 650 kilometres north of Addis
Ababa, an area previously unaffected by the disease.

"We need to establish the real extent of the disease," Pertsinibou
said. "We need to establish how the outbreak occurred here. Doctors
started providing treatment in May [2004], once the 1st positive
diagnosis of the disease was made. Since then 9 people have died and
hundreds have been treated. The 1st suspected deaths occurred late in
2004."

At the peak of the epidemic, 2-3 people were dying every day,
community leaders told the agency, also known as Doctors Without
Borders. Around 500 000 new cases appear every year in the world, but
according to the World Health Organization, there has been a sharp
increase in the disease in the last decade. Around 90 percent of the
cases occur in Bangladesh, India, Brazil, Nepal and Sudan.

The parasite attacks the immune system of the infected person,
causing high fever, swelling of the spleen, and serious weight loss.
Treatment involves a 30-day course of injections, but medical help
has been complicated because many of the patients are extremely
malnourished, Pertsinibou added.

[Leishmaniasis is prevalent in Ethiopia. The rate of leishmanin
positivity in 10 villages in Upper Awash, northeastern Ethiopia
ranged from 16 to 65 percent, with the overall prevalence of 33
percent (Ali A. Ethiop Med J. 1997;35:225-33); the figure was 5
percent in the Ethiopian Rift Valley province (Berhe N et al. Ethiop
Med J. 1998;36:113-22). Leishmania is transmitted by sandflies;
various animals -- especially rodents -- act as reservoirs. - Mod.EP]
