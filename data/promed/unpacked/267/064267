[ProMED-mail would like to thank Emre Kekec for alerting us to this report. This is the 1st report of a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV in Turkey. According to a sub-optimal machine translation of a Turkish language media article, this individual travelled from Saudi Arabia to Turkey on 6 Oct 2014 and was ill at the time of travel. Death occurred on 11 Oct 2014. Travel to Turkey from Saudi Arabia was by plane and plane passengers and crew are presently being contacted (http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiye/HaberDetay/Turkiye-de-MERS-virusunden-olum-.htm?ArticleID=249290).

According to the most recent ECDC risk assessment document on MERS-CoV, as of 14 Oct 2014 there have been a total of 896 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 357 deaths reported by 22 countries around the world (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/mers-cov-severe-respiratory-disease-risk-assessment-16-october-2014.pdf). This tally does not include the 2 cases including 1 death reported by Saudi Arabia since 14 Oct 2014, nor does it include this current fatal case reported in Turkey. Of note is that since 1 Sep 2014, all reported cases of MERS-CoV infection were either reported by Saudi Arabia or reported by another country but had a history of travel to or from Saudi Arabia during the incubation period, suggesting that exposure to the MERS-CoV most likely occurred in Saudi Arabia.

More information about this case, including demographics, risk factors for exposure to the MERS-CoV while in Saudi Arabia, and where the individual had travelled within Saudi Arabia, would be greatly appreciated.
