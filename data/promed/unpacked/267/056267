A total of 450 pupils and staff members at a primary school in Amsterdam-Noord will be vaccinated on Thu 3 Nov 2016, after 4 children at the school were diagnosed with hepatitis A, NOS [news] reports. It seems that one of the children contracted the virus during the holidays. The contagious infectious disease then spread through the Buikslotermeer School in Amsterdam-Noord. Parents of pupils were informed about the situation on [Tue 1 Nov 2016].

The virus spreads through the feces of people. It is therefore believed that at the school the virus spread via poor hand washing after defecation.

[There are undoubtedly many more cases of hepatitis A at the school since most of the cases in children are either anicteric (without jaundice) or totally without symptoms. Universal immunization for hepatitis A would keep this from occurring. - Mod.LL
