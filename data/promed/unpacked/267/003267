The state says a Montcalm County resident has died from eastern equine encephalitis [EEE]. Officials didn't release additional details about the death on Friday [2 Oct 2020].

"Our sympathies to the family and friends of this Michigan resident," said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in a news release. "EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the United States, which is why we made the decision to conduct aerial treatment last month [September 2020]. We continue to urge Michiganders to take precautions against mosquitoes."

The Montcalm County resident was the 2nd human case of EEE in Michigan. The 1st human case was JW of Hastings, who has since been released from Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital.

EEE is a mosquito-borne illness that, while rare, can often prove fatal when its symptoms become serious. It's nearly always deadly for horses, but there is a vaccine for horses and not one for people.

The state has confirmed 36 EEE cases in animals across 15 counties this year [2020].

On Friday [2 Oct 2020], officials confirmed EEE in a horse from Baraga County in the Upper Peninsula. It was the 1st case of EEE in the UP this year [2020] and the 1st-ever case in Baraga County.

Health officials urge everyone to take action to protect themselves from the virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses like West Nile virus.

You should wear mosquito repellent with DEET, wear long sleeves and pants outdoors, and avoid being outdoors around dusk and at night. You should also make sure your window screens are in good repair to keep the pests out of your home.

[EEE virus has been very active this summer (2020) in Michigan, including in Montcalm county. There have been cases in 4 horses in that county (see Eastern equine encephalitis - North America (17): USA (MI, NC, MN) horse) and now a human case.

EEE can cause fatal infections in horses and people. Horses and people are considered "dead-end hosts," meaning they are unable to transmit the disease to other horses or people. In horses, EEE is fatal in more than 90% of cases. Even though people cannot contract the disease from horses, cases in horses are a clear indication that infected mosquitoes are in the area and can infect humans. There is a vaccine available for horses but not for people.
