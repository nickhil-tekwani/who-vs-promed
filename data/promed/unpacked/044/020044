A total of 13 British tourists were sealed off in isolation in an
Italian hospital after being diagnosed with a "virulent" strain of
_Salmonella_. Police were also investigating whether the same
infection led to the death of a 71-year-old man, from Evesham,
Worcestershire on Monday [23 Jun 2008].

"We have sealed off the patients because they have been diagnosed
with a severe strain of salmonella," said Dr Lucio Dalfini, the
director of health at Gavardo Hospital. "No one has been allowed in
or out. They are all relatively elderly and we are worried in case an
infection spreads."

Thirty British tourists complained of feeling ill following dinner on
Saturday [21 Jun 2008] at their hotel in Lake Garda, the 4-star Grand
Hotel Gardone. Dr Dalfini said the hospitalized tourists would
probably be discharged in 2 to 3 days and that none is in critical
condition.

[Salmonellosis is not a particularly infectious infection from person
to person because of the relatively large dose of bacilli needed to
establish infection as compared to shigellosis or infection due to
_E. coli_ O157:H7. Given this, it is unclear why the strict isolation
conditions were put into effect in this situation. Some serotypes of
_S. enterica_ may cause a higher percentage of infected individuals
to be hospitalized and the particular serotype here is not yet
available but the "virulent" organism is more likely to be one of
"normal" virulence in older individuals who tend to have more severe
disease. More information about the identity of the strain and other
potentially exposed individuals would be appreciated. - Mod.LL]
