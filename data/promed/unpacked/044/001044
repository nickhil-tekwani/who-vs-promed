[The diagnosis of glanders, a zoonotic disease, in Bahrain was
reported by ProMED-mail on 28 Apr 2010. It is encouraging to see this
significant event eventually officially notified to the OIE. There
are several discrepancies between the notification and the
media-derived information dated 17 Apr 2010, in particular the
information about mortality of 2 horses, allegedly triggering the
epidemiological and laboratory investigation, as well as the relevant
timetable (see 20100417.1241).

Glanders is a reportable disease in Kuwait not reportable in Syria.
In both countries, the year of its last occurrence is unknown. Both
countries have already duly submitted their annual reports for 2009
to the OIE, from which the said information is derived. - Mod.AS]
