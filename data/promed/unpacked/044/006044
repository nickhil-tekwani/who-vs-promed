A soldier who passed away in Kolkata on 25 May [2018] was not infected by Nipah virus, the Army's Eastern Command has said citing test reports.

The soldier was a native of Kerala, where more than 10 people have succumbed to the Nipah virus, and resumed duty at Fort William of the Eastern Command on 13 May [2018] after a month-long visit to his home state.

He was admitted at the Command Hospital with fever on 20 May 2018 and passed away on 25 May 2018.

"On 29 May [2018] the soldier's body fluids were sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, which is the only agency in the country to certify whether it was a case of Nipah virus or not. We have received the test report, and it came to know that he was not suffering from Nipah," Eastern Command spokesperson Wing Commander SS Birdi said. "The report came negative and categorically mentioned that it was not a case of Nipah virus infection."

Meanwhile, the West Bengal government has set up an isolation ward for people being admitted with the mystery fever at the Infectious Disease Hospital in Beliaghata in Kolkata.

All officials at the Integrated Disease Surveillance Progamme (IDSP) of the state health department have been asked to be alert. All hospitals across the state have been asked to report any case of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) on daily basis.

NiV can be transmitted by infected pigs/fruit bats through their saliva secretions, urine or faeces. It causes respiratory infection leading to fever, body ache, stiff neck, nausea, breathlessness and severe cough.

[With the soldier testing negative for Nipah virus infection, there now have been no cases outside of the state of Kerala in this outbreak. Although it is indeed unfortunate that this young soldier died, at least there was no risk of nosocomial transmission in the West Bengal military hospital where he was ill and died.

At a time when there have been reports of the deaths of 18 people due to Nipah virus in Kerala and fake WhatsApp messages over spreading of the virus in different parts of Assam, a youth from Assam's Sivasagar district died of suspected Nipah virus in Kerala on Saturday [2 Jun 2018].

The 37-year-old youth from Gaurisagar in Sivasagar district has been identified as MS.

As per reports, MS had been undergoing treatment in a hospital at Kannur in Kerala as he had been suffering from severe fever and headache since 29 May 2018. Some of his colleagues, who also hail from Assam, admitted Manoj to the hospital, but he lost his battle for life on Sat 2 Jun 2018. He was a worker in one Starboard company in Kerala.

The wife of MS was informed by the deceased's colleagues about the incident over the telephone on 2 Jun 2018 at around 8:30 am.

According to Rinu Gogoi Saikia, her husband went to Kerala from Assam's Lakhimpur district to work in the company just 15 days back.

Before going to Kerala, MS, who was residing in his relatives' house at Dihingia village in Dhemaji's Gogamukh [Kerala], was working as a driver for few years at Gogamukh.

Since 1998 to 2015, more than 600 cases of Nipah virus human infections have been reported. Subsequent outbreaks in India and Bangladesh have occurred with high fatality rates.

The 1st identification of Nipah virus as a cause of an outbreak of encephalitis [in South Asia] was reported in 2001 in Meherpur district of Bangladesh. Since then, outbreaks of Nipah virus encephalitis have been reported almost every year in select districts in the neighbouring country.

[If the 18-death case count is correct, this death, if confirmed as a Nipah virus infection, would bring the count to 19. Not surprisingly, there have been reports of fake accounts of Nipah virus infection cases circulating via social media. That underscores the need for a designated state or national health authority to issue official statements regularly, probably on a daily basis at this time, to prevent the spread of rumors in the public at large. - Mod.TY
