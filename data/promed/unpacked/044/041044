----------------------------------------------------------------------
There have been a number of reported outbreaks of listeriosis in the UK that relate to food ingested on healthcare premises. The sources implicated include hospital sandwiches and salads; it should be noted that these may be brought into the hospital after preparation elsewhere (1).

I also note a report of an outbreak at a Norwegian Hospital that implicated Camembert cheese; this outbreak was associated with a short incubation period (2).

[ProMED-mail thanks Graham Clive for this background information. The Norwegian nosocomial outbreak was previously reported by ProMED-mail (Listeriosis, nosocomial - Norway: (Oslo) 20071024.3452). ProMED-mail also reported a nosocomial outbreak attributed to contaminated sandwiches prepared by an outside caterer, which occurred in the UK in March 2007 (Listeriosis, sandwiches - UK (England): alert, recall 20070326.1049) that is similar to that reported in reference 1 above. - Mod.ML
