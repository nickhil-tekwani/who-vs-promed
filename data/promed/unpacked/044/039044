Schmallenberg virus: further UK testing results
-----------------------------------------------
We have finished testing the latest samples received as a result of heightened vigilance for this new disease. [As of the week ending 25 Jan 2012], Schmallenberg virus has now been identified in 11 submissions across the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, and East Sussex [England].

These counties are in the area already identified as potentially at risk from infected midges being blown across the Channel from affected areas in Europe. We, therefore, suspect this to be the most likely cause of transmission.

As surveillance continues and the lambing season progress we would expect further cases.

For background information [and the updated table of results], please see http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla/2012/01/12/schmallenberg-virus/

[2] Russia: concerns, import restrictions
Date: Tue 31 Jan 2012

On the outcome of negotiations of Rosselkhoznadzor relating to the massive outbreak of a new animal disease caused by Schmallenberg virus [SBV]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[For the names and responsibilities of participants from Russia, EU, and the affected EU countries, please go to the source URL above].

Genetic analysis showed that SBV belongs to the Bunyaviridae family, genus _Orthobunyavirus_ and is related to Akabane virus, an exotic virus, previously detected in ruminants in remote regions of the world. Presumably, the virus is carried by blood-sucking insects and is vertically transmitted from mother to offspring during its prenatal development. The present outbreak has swept the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, and the UK.

Human infection with SBV, as evaluated by the Dutch National Institute for Health and the Environment and by the European Centre for Prevention and Disease Control, cannot be ruled out, although it seems unlikely. The experts now point to the enormous material losses associated with the spread of the disease [in animals].

According to virologists, despite the fact that SBV has an undoubted resemblance to other orthobunyaviruses, it has pronounced individual features. In this regard, many aspects of the initial outbreak, its distribution, and transfer of the virus remain unclear. The analysis is hampered by the fact that now we seem to face the consequences of infection that occurred months ago, in the summer or early fall of last year [2011]. The researchers emphasize that our knowledge of the biology of a new pathogenic virus is fragmentary and based on extrapolation of the known properties of structurally related viruses.

Despite the seriousness of the outbreak and the lack of clarity on many issues concerning its biology and epizootic risk, no measures to limit the movement of animals from affected regions across the EU have been undertaken; this is a cause for very serious concern for Rosselkhoznadzor.

Rosselkhoznadzor offered the assistance of Russian virologists in conducting joint research on the biology of the new virus and the establishment of effective measures for its diagnosis. Attention was drawn to the fact that only rapid exchange of information can allow Rosselkhoznadzor to avoid the introduction of excessive measures to ensure the biological security of Russia. At the present time, as emphasized by Eugene Nepoklonov, [deputy director of] Rosselkhoznadzor, it is considered reasonable and necessary to introduce temporary restrictions on the import of live cattle and small ruminants, as well as genetic material -- semen and embryos, from the European countries affected by SBV.

[3] EFSA statement
Date: Tue 31 Jan 2012
Source: EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) news release [edited]
http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120131.htm


EFSA requested to support EU with work on Schmallenberg virus
-------------------------------------------------------------
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has an important animal health and welfare remit and it is in this context, that the European Commission has requested urgent scientific and technical assistance for possible risks resulting from the "Schmallenberg" virus [SBV].

SBV that affects mainly sheep but also cattle and goats can result in birth defects. Named after the German town where it was first identified, the SBV, which belongs to a vector-transmitted group of viruses, was found in Europe in the 2nd half of 2011, and to date has infected animals in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

EFSA has extensive knowledge in the area of vector-borne diseases -- transmitted for instance by insects -- and although there are many uncertainties associated with this new virus, the Authority will provide in the short-term, the European Commission and Member States with likely scenarios on how the virus could manifest itself in animals in the coming months.

EFSA will also work together with Member States to ensure that the epidemiological data that exist, and those the Member States will produce and the Authority will subsequently collect, can be used to maximum effect through the provision of guidance. Periodical reports will be shared on the status and analysis of the data collected.

Once the data have been collected, EFSA will provide an overall assessment of the impact of SBV infection on animal health, animal production, and animal welfare together with a state-of-the-art review on what is known about the virus.

There is currently no evidence that the Schmallenberg virus could cause illness in humans. In December 2011 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) carried out a preliminary assessment on the possible animal to human transmission risks of the new virus, which concluded that "it is unlikely that this virus can cause disease in humans, but it cannot be completely excluded at this stage." In light of these findings, EFSA is liaising closely with ECDC and will address areas of concern for human health, should these arise.

[4] France: update
Date: Tue 31 Jan 2012

http://agriculture.gouv.fr/maladies-animales


Schmallenberg virus has been identified in sheep in 6 departments of the North of France (departments No 52 [Haute Marne], 54 [Meurthe-et-Moselle], 57 [Moselle], 62 [Pas de Calais], 76 [Seine Maritime], and 80 [Somme]).

The presence of SBV has been confirmed in lambs on 16 new farms in northern France, as of 30 Jan 2012. In total, 29 sheep farms have been affected, mainly in the following 10 departments in the north of France: No 02 (Ainse), 14 (Calvados), 52 (Haute-Marne), 54 (Meurthe-et-Moselle), 55 (Meuse), 57 (Moselle), 60 (Oise), 62 (Pas-de-Calais), 76 (Seine-Maritime), and 80 (Somme).

Current information on SBV, last updated 31 Jan 2012
----------------------------------------------------
In Germany, animals from 186 holdings have, so far, tested positive for SBV. The cases occurred in 7 cattle holdings, 172 sheep holdings, and 7 goat holdings. Affected federal states are North Rhine-Westphalia (5 cattle, 104 sheep, 3 goat holdings), Lower Saxony (1 cattle, 35 sheep, 2 goat holdings), Hesse (12 sheep, 1 goat holdings), Rhineland-Palatinate (1 bison, 2 sheep holdings), Baden-Wuerttemberg (1 goat holding), Brandenburg (3 sheep holdings), and Thuringia (1 sheep holding) [see map at http://www.fli.bund.de/fileadmin/dam_uploads/tierseuchen/Schmallenberg_Virus/Karten/Map_Schmallenberg_20120131.jpg].

[Akabane disease, which closely resembles SBV, has been regarded as a disease of ruminant embryos; the virus may kill the embryo (resulting, during early pregnancy, in its unnoticed resorption or, if the infection occurs during later stages, in abortion). In case the embryo survives, grosso modo its systems, which are in their most active developmental stages during the viraemia, are the ones liable to be affected. These are primarily the CNS system in early pregnancy and the muscle/skeleton in later stages (leading to arthrogryposis and other skeletal system malformations). The changes first become apparent during or following birth.

The 1st scientific paper on SBV has now become available as an "Ahead of Print/In Press Dispatch":
B Hoffmann, M Scheuch, D Hoeper, R Jungblut, et al: Novel _Orthobunyavirus_ in Cattle, Europe, 2011. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012 March; 18(3).

Abstract
"In 2011, an unidentified disease in cattle was reported in Germany and the Netherlands. Clinical signs included fever, decreased milk production, and diarrhea. Metagenomic analysis identified a novel orthobunyavirus, which subsequently was isolated from blood of affected animals. Surveillance was initiated to test malformed newborn animals in the affected region."

The paper, including a dendrogram and the results of 3 experimentally infected calves, is available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1905_article.htm. - Mod.AS]
