- Brazil (mosquitoes, Bahia state). 13 Jul 2012. A new production plant, inaugurated today [13 Jul 2012] in Juazeiro (BA), will increase 8 times the national production of the transgenic mosquito, the _Aedes aegypti_ dengue virus vector, to reduce the wild population. The male mosquitoes are modified to transmit lethal genes to its progeny. The _Ae._ mosquitoes die in the larval phase, reducing their population. Up to now, 500 000 _Ae. aegypti_ were produced weekly and released in Juaziero neighborhoods by researchers of Moscamed (a social organization linked to the federal and Bahia governments) and the USP [University of Sao Paulo]. According to the scientists, this is the largest effort in the world with transgenic _Ae. aegypti_, which have been tested in the Cayman Islands and in Malaysia. The idea now is to increase national production by 4 million per week and release them in Jacobina, a city of 79 000 inhabitants, possibly in September 2012, before the multiplication of these insects when the rains come.

[Interestingly, Hadyn Parry, Oxitec's chief executive, said that the company had been approached by officials in Florida after dengue fever was reported in the Keys in 2009 and 2010. "The decision to go ahead is entirely a local Florida decision, it's not up to us," he said. However, the plan is coming up against growing local opposition to a plan to release the insects into the Florida Keys. There are local concerns such as whether the gene introduced into the insect could itself mutate or whether the reduction of the _A. aegypti_ mosquito could have adverse connotations for the local ecosystem. Parry dismissed those fears. Only male mosquitoes would be released, he said, which do not bite and do not carry dengue fever [virus].
