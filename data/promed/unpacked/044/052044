----------------------------------------------------------------------
I note that the Moderators advise that the case of H5N1 in a raptor in
Bulgaria is further evidence of the important role of migratory
species in the spread of infection. This is not fact. It is more
likely this bird died as a result of scavenging an infected carcass,
perhaps an infected chicken.

There is very little evidence of wild migratory bird sources for
epidemics or cases like this and I would advise readers to visit the
AIWEB <http://www.aiweb.info/> from the AI task force to get
up-to-date information and informed scientific opinion on this subject.

[Actually, prior to the posting of the AI (21) report there was a very
active moderator discussion on this very point, and this is reflected
in what was eventually posted. Richard's comments are fair. I suspect
it is time that this issue was reopened on ProMED. The Bulgarian and
Romanian coasts may be an ideal site to clarify this area of
disagreement. - Mod.MHJ]

[Since there are no reports of H5N1 in poultry in Bulgaria (which I
realise does not necessarily mean it is not there), and the buzzard
had presumably just got back home from its winter range in Africa, it
could well have eaten a sick chicken in, say, Egypt, spent the
incubation period migrating north, got sick, and died on arrival in
Bulgaria. But then how would it spread from there? Only another
buzzard or scavenger species would be likely to eat a dead buzzard,
unless it happened to drop dead in a chicken run (when it might be
pecked), so it would be a dead end. - Mod.JW]

[Buzzards, or any avian with flying ability (thus excluding ostriches,
chickens, turkeys...) -- do not have to drop dead and be consumed by
others in order to spread H5N1, if they are infected. They can play
their potential epidemiological role by dropping their (infected)
droppings while flying above (susceptible) poultry premises. And they
can repeat this stunt above additional premises along their route.

Other birds -- e.g. Mute swans -- can be similarly effective. Just to
cite a paper authored by investigators of the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Germany: "Because of viral shedding for
several days without showing severe clinical symptoms, adult mute
swans could play a key role in the spread of HPAI virus (H5N1), a
conclusion that contradicts those of other investigators" (Ref. 1).
Mute swans were suspected in several outbreaks, such as the 2005/2006
event in the Danube delta (Romania) and the Crimean peninsula (Ukraine).

During the January 2010 H5N1 outbreak in Ein-Shemer, Israel, a similar
scenario, namely droppings of wild birds, was suggested following the
detailed epidemiological investigation; see post 20100203.0364.
