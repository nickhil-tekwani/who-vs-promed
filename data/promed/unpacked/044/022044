The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), on Friday [2 Sep 2016], confirmed 5 cases of Lassa Fever in Bauchi, Gombe, Plateau and Rivers States from 24 Aug - 2 Sep 2016.

Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, Chief Executive Officer, NCDC, in a statement in Lagos, said 2 cases were reported from Plateau and 1 each from Rivers, Bauchi and Gombe. Ihekweazu said in the statement that the case reported from Gombe died on 22 Aug 2016, while other cases are still alive.

He said that public health response commenced immediately in all the affected states under the leadership of the respective state's Ministries of Health. According to him, resources were immediately mobilized from NCDC and its partner, the Nigerian Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (NFELTP), to support the investigation and management of cases in the affected states.

"We commend the early detection and reporting of the most recent cases, as it significantly improves the likelihood of survival for the cases and also reduces the risk of further transmission. "We also urge states to report cases immediately for Lassa fever, while improving on the timeliness of their reporting generally. As a result of increasing number of cases, the NCDC is issuing an advisory to all states reminding them of the steps they have to take to prepare and respond to cases of Lassa fever and other haemorragic fevers, as well as the resources that they can access for this," he said.

The chief executive officer said that the NCDC remained committed to supporting the state governments to prevent the spread of Lassa fever in Nigeria.

[Good surveillance and rapid diagnosis is important to prevent spread in health care facilities and to provide timely, appropriate treatment such as ribavirin, which has been shown to be beneficial in Lassa fever, in conjunction with supportive therapy such as fluids.

The circumstances under which the reported cases acquired the Lassa fever virus infection are not mentioned. Lassa virus is endemic in rodents in Nigeria and cases can occur at any time. The infection can be contracted from an infected patient or from exposure to food materials contaminated by infected rodents.

Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Appropriate use of personal protective equipment is essential to prevent virus transmission to health care workers in hospitals and clinics.

Lassa virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans.
