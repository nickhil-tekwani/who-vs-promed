A fox bit a 4 year old girl, outside a house in the area of Stone Mountain Road in Bedford County, [Virginia]. The family called 911. "We went to the hospital, she had to get injections in all her bite wounds." On Thursday [5 May 2022] the Virginia Department of Health called them to say they found out the fox had rabies.

Rabies infections aren't very common in the surrounding areas, according to Officer Brandon Schoonover, who works in the animal control unit at Roanoke County Police. "The positive cases are few and far between. I can't say it never happens but they are usually in the single digits."

But it's always important to call it in if you come in contact with a wild animal. "If you believe you were exposed you need to seek medical attention immediately and the same with domesticated animals."

The [girl] is doing just fine now. Virginia Department of Health's press release (https://www.vdh.virginia.gov)

"Everyone should take commonsense measures to protect themselves and their domestic animals from rabies. Pet owners should keep their pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations. Virginia law requires all dogs and cats 4 months of age and older to be vaccinated for rabies by a licensed veterinarian, and vaccinations are kept current. It is important to avoid contact with wild or stray animals, and parents should be sure that their children are taught to not touch, pet, or otherwise handle unknown animals.

"Additional steps which can be taken to prevent rabies in people and pets include:
- Do not feed stray animals. Avoid wild animals, especially raccoons, bats, foxes, and skunks. Feed your pets indoors and do not let them wander.
- Teach children to avoid contact with wild animals and pets they are not familiar with.
- Do not handle sick, injured, or dead animals. Contact a licensed wildlife rehabber if you have concerns about sick or injured wildlife.
- Keep wild animals out of homes by capping chimneys with screens and blocking openings in attics, cellars, and porches. Ensure trash cans have tight-fitting lids.
- Do not try to trap or handle stray and wild animals. If a bat is found indoors and may have had contact with someone, do not release it. Call your local animal control officer or health department to determine if the animal should be picked up and tested for rabies.

If you are bitten by a wild or stray animal do not panic. Wash the wound(s) thoroughly with warm soapy water and contact animal control, your doctor, or the health department for further recommendation."

[2] Oklahoma (Logan County): horse

The Oklahoma State Veterinarian Office has confirmed that a quarter horse gelding on private property in Logan County, Oklahoma, tested positive for rabies. The unvaccinated rodeo horse began showing severe neurologic signs on [27 Apr 2022 and was euthanized. 3 other horses pastured with the gelding are not showing signs of disease but have been placed under an official 6-month quarantine. The Equine Disease Communication Center released this information on 9 May 2022.

Rabies in horses
----------------
Rabies -- a zoonotic disease that can be spread from animals to humans -- is caused by a lyssavirus affecting the neurologic system and salivary glands. Horses are exposed most commonly through the bite of another rabid animal.

In horses, clinical signs of rabies are variable and can take up to 12 weeks to appear after the initial infection. Although affected horses are sometimes asymptomatic, an infected horse can show behavioral changes such as drowsiness, depression, fear, or aggression. Once clinical signs appear, there are no treatment options.

Rabies can only be diagnosed postmortem by submitting the horse's head to a local public health laboratory to identify the rabies virus using a test called fluorescence antibody. Thus, ruling out all other potential diseases 1st is very important in these cases to avoid potentially unnecessary euthanasia.

Because rabies threatens both horses and the humans who handle them, the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends rabies as a core vaccine every US horse should receive. The AAEP's vaccination guidelines recommend adult horses receive an initial single dose, then a booster vaccination annually; foals born to vaccinated mares should receive a 1st vaccine dose no earlier than 6 months of age and a 2nd dose 4 to 6 weeks later followed by annual vaccination; and foals of unvaccinated mares should receive a 1st vaccine dose at 3 or 4months of age and should be revaccinated annually.

Authorities in Atlantic County [New Jersey] say a stray cat has tested positive for rabies and 2 people who were caring for the animal may have been exposed to the virus. The cat, found in the 700 block of Wesley Avenue in Pleasantville, is the 7th confirmed case of rabies in the county this year [2022].

Officials say: "The cat was found with a wound of unknown origin and cared for by the Pleasantville residents. When the cat began displaying neurological signs, the residents took the cat to a veterinarian for medical care. The cat then tested positive for rabies on 9 May 2022. An investigation by the Division of Public Health found potential rabies exposure among the 2 residents and have advised them to contact their healthcare provider regarding post-exposure rabies treatment."

The county's other rabies cases this year [2022] have involved a fox from Hamilton Township, 3 skunks found in Egg Harbor Township, and 2 skunks from Northfield. This is the first case involving a cat.

Public health officials remind residents of the importance of vaccinating their pets to protect both the animals and the humans with whom they have contact. The Atlantic County Animal Shelter holds free rabies vaccination clinics each month for dogs and cats by appointment. The next clinic is scheduled for Sunday, 5 Jun 2022, from 9 am to noon. Dogs must be on leashes and cats must be in carriers.

If you see wildlife behaving strangely, especially nocturnal animals like skunks and raccoons found during daylight hours, do not approach the animal. Instead, contact the Atlantic County Division of Public Health.

Health department officials are urging residents to be alert and aware of the signs of rabies after a domestic cat tested positive for rabies this week. Officials say the cat was sent to the New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center for testing on Friday [13 May 2022], and results were reported to be positive the same day.

Known best for their work on bat rabies, the staff at the Rabies Laboratory at the Wadsworth Center works to prevent the spread of rabies throughout the state. Authorities say that, to the best of their knowledge, only one person was exposed to the cat. That person has received treatment.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in North America rabies is most commonly found in bats, skunks, raccoons, foxes, and mongoose. It is also found in cats, cattle, and dogs. CDC says rabid bats have been found in every state except for Hawaii. Rabid mongoose have been found in Puerto Rico.

Rabies is easily transmitted from animals to other animals, including human beings. Human cases are rare in the United States, but deadly if not caught in time.

[5] North Carolina (Brunswick County): fox, human exposure
Date: Mon 16 May 2022

Officials at Brunswick County Health Services reported a local fox connected to an individual attack has tested positive for rabies. The individual is receiving all necessary rabies vaccinations following the incident, according to a county press release. "The fox was captured and put down," the county reported. Thereafter, it was sent off for testing.

Anyone scratched or bitten by a rabid animal should immediately seek medical assistance, the health department advises. Fatalities associated with rabies occur when failing to do so. Public health and animal protective services through the sheriff's office are investigating and advise the public to follow safety tips and remain proactive to keep themselves and their pets protected from rabid animals.

For humans bitten or scratched:
- Clean the wound well with soap and running water for 15 minutes and contact your doctor. The doctor will determine if a series of rabies vaccinations will be needed.
- Note the location and a description of the animal to provide to animal control.
- Do not try to catch any wild animal that has bitten or scratched you. Call animal control immediately to capture the animal for rabies testing.
- If the animal is someone's pet, get the owner's name and address and provide them to the animal control officer. Any mammal can transmit rabies. The animal which bit you, depending on the species and circumstances, must be evaluated or tested for rabies. [It is important to know if the animal was a wild or feral animal, as was this fox, instead of a frightened pet belonging to a neighbor who may have the necessary rabies vaccination tags/certificate on the pet. - Mod.TG]

For protection of pets:
- Vaccinate your pets against rabies and keep the vaccinations current. North Carolina rabies law requires all owned dogs, cats, and ferrets must be vaccinated against rabies by 4 months of age.
- Supervise pets outdoors, and keep all pets on a leash.
- Do not feed pets outdoors. Pet food attracts wildlife.
- Do not feed wildlife, feral cats, or feral dogs.
- Secure garbage cans with wildlife-proof lids. [Securing a garbage can is important but can be difficult. Raccoons and bears seem to be able to get into many wildlife-proof garbage cans. Some areas have trash bins which have demonstrated some success at keeping raccoons/bears out. - Mod.TG]
- Leave young wildlife alone. If you find a juvenile animal appearing to need help, it is best to leave it alone and call a wildlife professional.

Any mammal can get rabies. There are cats, foxes, and horses in this report.

If your child is bitten by an unvaccinated domestic or a wild animal, it can be terrifying, especially if the animal is rabid.

Please vaccinate your pets, regardless of the size. Horses, cattle, goats, sheep needs protection against rabies which in turn, protects you. Any one working with larger animals, such as horses or cows, knows it can be easy to be hurt by these animals especially when they are frightened. Large animals with rabies can actually be vicious and have killed or very nearly killed their human care givers. Yes, any large animal can hurt us and can even kill us, through any accident, but rabid large animals have attacked with viciousness. Some reports are harrowing to read. A few have lived to talk about their experience. So please vaccinate your animals, more than just dogs, cats, and ferrets.

Be aware of your surroundings. People have encountered wild animals in such mundane places as the parking lot of a grocery store, a shopping mall, or walking out of their houses. Rabies does not respect city limit signs or upscale neighborhoods.

Vaccinate your animals and keep alert for wild animals or those acting strangely. - Mod.TG]
