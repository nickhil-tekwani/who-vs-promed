Yemen is already suffering from a devastating civil war and widespread hunger. Now, circumstances caused by the conflict have also paved the way for diphtheria to thrive. The airborne disease kills one of every 10 patients even with medical treatment, and most victims in Yemen receive too little, too late. And although diphtheria has been eradicated in many parts of the world through vaccination, the public health crisis caused by Yemen's war has let this infection flourish there for the 1st time since 1989.

It has been nearly 30 years since Yemen's last diphtheria outbreak. The 1st case in this latest crisis came in August 2017. Since then, the disease has spread to every corner of the country, as the war has made it difficult to inoculate children and also moved large fleeing populations closer together, where the airborne disease can rapidly spread through coughing and sneezing; 2600 cases have been counted, but doctors suspect there are countless others that have been misdiagnosed, often as tonsillitis.

Doctors here [in Aden] have treated 70 patients; 12 of them died.

Across Yemen, the health care system has collapsed, and there are severe shortages of vaccines, medicines, equipment, and staff to use. Said Dr Alnoor Aboularishi, "During the war, many, many, many health centers stopped work. There is no vaccination. And also there is a migration of the population from one town to another to avoid the war."

Because the Al-Sadaqa Hospital here in the southern port city of Aden has received the largest number of diphtheria cases over the past year [2017-2018], doctors have created training materials that are now being used to teach other doctors all around the country how to handle diphtheria cases.

Even with treatment, diphtheria kills one of every 10 patients. Untreated, the death rate is one of every 2.
