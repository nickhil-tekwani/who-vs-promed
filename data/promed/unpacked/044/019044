CSIRO: Mild virus protecting Aussie rabbits
--------------------------------------------
A mild strain of rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD) [rabbit hemorrhagic
disease virus may have given Australian rabbits immunity against the
deadly form of the disease. Analysis of stored rabbit blood for antibodies
has shown that Australian rabbits were exposed to a non-deadly virus prior
to the escape of the rabbit calicivirus from Wardang Island in 1995.
CSIRO's Dr Harvey Westbury says that this RCD relative may be acting as a
natural vaccine in parts of temperate Australia. "We believe the related
virus is effectively protecting some rabbits against the usually deadly
RCD. Refinement of existing scientific tests in the past 2 years has meant
that we were able to go back and check stored rabbit blood samples for
antibodies to RCD," says Dr Westbury.
"We looked at samples taken prior to the escape of the virus and its
introduction into Australia, and found that about 50% of 392 rabbits tested
had antibodies that reacted against the coat protein of RCD," he says. "In
a separate study, we collected blood from rabbits captured from a RCD-free
area in central Victoria, after RCD had spread across Australia. All these
rabbits had antibodies against RCD or an RCD-like virus. We found that
nearly half of these rabbits were able to survive a dose of RCD that would
normally have been fatal," Dr Westbury says.
Studies by CSIRO Wildlife and Ecology with the Victorian Institute of
Animal Sciences and the SA [South Australia -Mod. PC Animal and Plant
Control Commission also show that in the field many rabbits have antibodies
to an RCD-like virus. These antibodies can be distinguished from the
typical RCD antibodies normally found if a rabbit recovers from an RCD
infection. The antibodies are found more commonly and in higher
concentrations in rabbits in cooler, wetter areas than in hot, dry areas,
which is perhaps why RCD controlled rabbit numbers in the inland yet was
less effective in temperate areas.
"Our results also confirmed that rabbits with high levels of antibodies to
the RCD-like virus have a good chance of surviving RCD," explains Dr Brian
Cooke of CSIRO Wildlife and Ecology. "There had been no reports of an
RCD-like illness in Australia prior to RCD's release, therefore the virus
that triggered the antibodies must have been a non-disease-causing but
related virus." Further studies are required to confirm whether the
presence of an RCD-like virus is a contributing factor to help account for
the reduced effectiveness of RCD in holding down rabbit populations in
temperate areas as compared with warmer and drier parts of Australia. This
would require development of tests that easily distinguish virulent RCD
from the non-deadly form of calicivirus. Information on the RCD-like virus
is important to people working on rabbit control across Australia. State
rabbit control groups are considering the implications of the work to look
at ways of making RCD more effective in temperate regions.
