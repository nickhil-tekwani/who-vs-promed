[Phytoplasmas are unwalled, uncultivated prokaryotes in the class
_Mollicutes_. Potato stolbur phytoplasma infects at least 45 species in the
_Solanaceae_, particularly potato, tomato, pepper, eggplant, and several
species outside of the family. It is present in several European countries
and may occur in other parts of the world. The disease is transmitted by
grafting and by leafhopper vectors. Disease incidence in potato can be
high, leading to significant crop loss, but the disease tends not to
persist in stocks. A useful reference is the following:
