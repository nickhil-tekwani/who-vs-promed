Occurrence of the Root-Knot Nematodes _Meloidogyne incognita_ and _M.
hapla_ in Slovenia.

The root-knot nematode _Meloidogyne incognita_ (Kofoid & White)
Chitwood is one of the most harmful species within the genus
_Meloidogyne_. It has been detected regularly in greenhouses
throughout Europe, while in the field it is restricted to the
southern parts of Europe (4).
_Meloidogyne incognita_ is able to parasitize more than 700 plant
species and varieties, including the majority of our economically
important crops (1). It has been recorded in most parts of the world,
including the former Yugoslavia; however, there are no data on its
presence in Slovenia.
In late summer of 2002, large galls were observed on roots of pepper,
_Capsicum annuum_ L., grown in a greenhouse located in Portoroz near
the Adriatic Coast of Slovenia. Different root-knot nematode stages,
i.e., males, females, and second-stage juveniles, were isolated and
morphologically identified as _M. incognita_ (2). Additional isozyme
gel electrophoresis confirmed this (3).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of _M. incognita_ from Slovenia.
In addition, _Meloidogyne hapla_ Chitwood was found for the first
time in a field in Slovenia. Previously, it had been detected on
different host plants, all restricted to greenhouses. In October
2002, _M. hapla_ was isolated and identified from relatively small
galls of sweet pepper, _C. annuum_ L., grown in a field near
Ljubljana, located in central Slovenia. Additional resampling of the
soil confirmed the presence of _M. hapla_ in this field.

[_Meloidogyne hapla_ [Mh] and _M. incognita_ [Mi] are 2 of about 70
species in the genus _Meloidogyne_. They cause extensive damage to
roots by their feeding activity, exacting a heavy toll on producers.
Mh (northern root knot nematode) occurs in temperate regions and at
higher elevations in warmer regions worldwide and has an extensive
host range that includes many vegetables. Mi occurs primarily in the
tropics and warmer regions. Its hosts include vegetables, cereals,
sugarcane, and potatoes. Both nematodes are involved with other
pathogens in disease complexes. Disease management for Mi involves
use of nematicides and host-plant resistance. Mh management requires
clean planting material, crop rotations seeded to non-host crops such
as grasses and cereals, and use of resistant cultivars.
