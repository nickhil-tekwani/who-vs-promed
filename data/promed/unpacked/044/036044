Smallpox Eradication: Temporary Retention of Variola Virus Stocks
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In May 1999 the World Health Assembly by resolution WHA52.10 authorized
temporary retention up to, but not later than, 2002 of the existing stocks
of _Variola virus_ at the current locations, for the purpose of further
international research. The Assembly requested the Director-General to
appoint a new group of experts to establish what research, if any, must be
carried out in order to obtain consensus on the timing for the destruction
of the existing variola virus stocks. In accordance with this resolution, a
new group of experts was appointed; this WHO Advisory Committee on Variola
Virus Research is composed of 16 members from all WHO regions. At its first
meeting (Geneva, 6-9 Dec 1999), attended also by 10 advisers from
fundamental applied research and regulatory agencies, the Committee agreed
that a scientific subcommittee be established for the purpose of overseeing
future research on variola virus, with members of this subcommittee to be
drawn from the Advisory Committee on Variola Virus Research.
Meeting of the WHO Advisory Committee on Variola Virus Research (Geneva,
15-16 Feb 2001)
The main aims of the meeting were: (1) to review progress on the agreed
programmes of research on variola viruses; (2) to determine whether this
progress was sufficient to accommodate the planned destruction date in
2002; (3) to identify any significant gaps in the present research
programme; and (4) to advise, as appropriate, on other possible directions
of research.
The Committee concluded that considerable progress had been made in several
areas of research on variola virus: state of strain collections and
viability of viral isolates, phylogenetic analysis, detection and
differentiation of orthopoxvirus DNA, nucleotide sequence analysis of
variola virus DNA, serological detection of variola virus, antiviral agents
and animal models of smallpox.
State of Strain Collections and Viability of Viral Isolates
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hold 451 viral isolates
derived from several different national collections. Most are isolates of
variola virus, and a database has been created to link them with available
diagnostic and epidemiological data. Of 49 strains selected on the basis of
geography, year of isolation, and low passage history that have been
further analysed, 45 were shown to be viable. These isolates came from Asia
(21), Africa (16), Europe (5), South America (2), and North America (1).
Many showed uniform plaque morphology and grew to high titre in tissue
culture. Of the 45 viable isolates, 37 came from in vitro cultured material
and the remainder from scab (non-passaged) samples.
The samples currently held at the Russian Centre, VECTOR, began to be
collected in Moscow in the mid-1950s. The collection was augmented with
isolates obtained by the then WHO collaborating centre on smallpox in
Moscow during the diagnostic studies that supported the smallpox
eradication programme. The present collection includes primary material
(scabs), frozen liquid cultures, and lyophilized samples. Not all samples
have been tested for viability; 5 primary scab isolates, 4 of 9 frozen
cultures, and all 6 lyophilized strains have demonstrable viability.
Cooperation between staff at the 2 collaborating centres has begun, in
order to ensure that any future work on viral characterization, including
the transfer of reagents, is adequately coordinated.
The Committee concluded that additional work may be needed to assess the
viability of the stocks held in VECTOR, and that further molecular
characterization of additional strains may be valuable in helping to
identify strains from which further DNA sequences could be determined.
Phylogenetic Analysis with DNA Amplification Technologies
Several techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
facilitate the characterization and phylogenetic analysis of variola virus
isolates were described. These included restriction fragment length
polymorphism of PCR products amplified with a variety of primers, and
multiplex PCR analysis. As a general rule, primers complementary to
sequences in the central conserved genomic region were used for the
comparison of all orthopoxviruses whereas those complementary to sequences
located towards the genomic termini were used to provide species- and
strain-specific data. The Committee concluded that significant progress had
been made in applying PCR technology to the investigation of phylogenetic
relationships between the orthopoxviruses, particularly variola viruses.
Detection and Differentiation of Orthopoxvirus DNA
Several methods using DNA amplification technologies were described for the
detection and subsequent diagnosis of orthopoxvirus infections. A major
objective of this work is the real-time identification of smallpox viruses.
The basic procedures used are similar to those already described for
phylogenetic analysis of different variola virus isolates. The detection
and differentiation of orthopoxvirus strains and individual strains of
variola virus generally involve the generation of PCR-amplified products
from both conserved and variable regions of the genome. Different groups
have developed different platforms for the process of detecting amplified
DNA products.
The Committee noted the enormous progress in this area. Although a major
limitation to these procedures was the methods used to obtain the initial
DNA samples, some reliable and rapid procedures with commercially available
reagents are becoming available. The Committee also noted that the
specificity of the procedures completely depended on the sequences of the
primers used for amplification. The detection of nucleotide sequences in
cowpox virus that were previously considered to be specific to variola
virus emphasized the point that the use of a single locus for PCR
amplification is insufficient to provide unambiguous identification.
Members of the Committee questioned the need for rapid analytical
procedures that were sufficiently sensitive to differentiate between
variola subspecies, when the clinical management of infected individuals
would be the same. It was recognized that the ability to detect the
presence or absence of any orthopoxvirus in real time would be needed in
emergency public health situations.
Nucleotide Sequence Analysis of Variola Virus DNA
The Committee was informed that the nucleotide sequences of 3 complete
variola virus genomes were now available. Substantial parts of the genomes
of 3 other variola virus strains (Congo 70, Somalia 77 and India 7124) had
also been determined. The full sequence of camelpox virus, the closest
known relative of variola virus, was described. Many sequence data are also
available for individual genes of various other orthopoxviruses.
The data obtained so far have confirmed the suspected evolutionary
relationships between orthopoxviruses and have facilitated the further
classification of different variola isolates into subspecies. At least 6
complete variola virus genome sequences should be available by the end of
2002. It may also be possible to obtain sequence information from scab
material that has not been passaged in vitro. The Committee concluded that
very good progress had been made in analysing the sequences of smallpox
virus genomes.
Serological Detection of Variola Virus
Work using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against vaccinia virus
proteins in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect orthopoxviruses
was described. With these reagents, such tests can detect various
orthopoxviruses, including camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox, vaccinia, and
variola viruses. The relative sensitivity for detecting the different
viruses varied, and strain differentiation was not possible with this
method. Work is in progress to determine whether tests using these reagents
can differentiate live variola major and minor strains.
The Committee concluded that much useful work was being done in this area
and that it would be important for any generated monoclonal antibodies to
be thoroughly characterized with respect to the variola proteins against
which they react.
Antiviral Agents
Cidofovir inhibits a wide variety of DNA viruses including orthopoxviruses.
Its mechanism of action is through selective inhibition of the viral DNA
polymerase. In vitro tests for antiviral activity show that cidofovir
inhibits both vaccinia and 35 different isolates of variola virus. Each
isolate had similar sensitivity to the drug, and induction of resistance
mutations does not appear to be a problem. Other orthopoxviruses could
therefore be developed as surrogate models for antiviral drug testing after
variola virus stocks have been destroyed. The Committee noted that
considerable progress had been made.
Animal Models of Smallpox
Most work has been done on the aerosol infection of cynomolgus monkeys with
the Yamada and Lee strains of variola virus. Clinical signs appear in
infected animals by 6 days after infection. Clinical disease is apparent
and the animals seroconvert but there is no mortality. The Committee
concluded that this model was not suitable for assessing the efficacy of
new vaccines or drugs. Further work is expected with different strains of
variola virus and different primate species, including a possible
collaborative project with scientists at VECTOR using baboons as the animal
model.
The Committee concluded that progress was satisfactory but that the rate
was slow. It noted the proposed work on the infection of baboons but
indicated that additional work may be required to identify and characterize
further surrogate models in comparison to those of variola virus infection,
so that a validated system for drug and vaccine assessments can be
established.
