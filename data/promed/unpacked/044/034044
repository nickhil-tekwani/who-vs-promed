Key points
----------
Current week (2): 10-16 Jan 2022/ Cumulative 2022 weeks 1-2 / Cumulative 2021 weeks 1-2
- Suspected cases: 48 / 465 / 226
- Confirmed cases: 29 / 96 / 23
- Probable cases: 0 / 0 / 0
- Deaths: 6 / 11 / 4
- Case fatality rate (CFR [%]): 12.5 / 11.5 / 17.4
- Number of states affected: 8 / 11 / 5
- Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 16 / 27 / 12

Highlights
----------
- In week 2, the number of new confirmed cases is the same as reported in week 1, 2022 with 48 cases. These were reported from Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Benue, Kogi, Oyo, Taraba, and Ebonyi states (Table 3)
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 2, 2022, 11 deaths have been reported with a CFR of 11.5%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2021 (17.4%)
- In total for 2022, 11 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 27 LGAs (Figures 2 and 3)
- Of all confirmed cases, 74% are from Edo (31%), Bauchi (22%), and Ondo (21%) states.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-40 years (range: 3 to 72 y, median: 30 y). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.8 (Figure 4)
- The number of suspected cases is higher than that reported for the same period in 2021
- 3 new health care workers affected from Edo state in reporting week 2
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels

Response activities
-------------------
- Conducted 2021 Lassa fever high-burden states preparedness/response engagement meeting.
- Lassa fever alert letters sent to states.
- The National Emergency Operations Centre alert mode activated 2021 for effective multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of Lassa fever response.
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states.
- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- Confirmed cases are treated at identified treatment centres across the states.
- Dissemination of reviewed case management and safe burial practices guidelines.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.
- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment.
- Deployment of National Rapid Respond Teams to 3 states to support Lassa fever response.

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 29 new confirmed and 48 new suspected cases in week 2 (10-16 Jan 2022), indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing and may be increasing. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred in week 7 last year (2021). There were 6 deaths among the confirmed cases for week 2 2022. Unfortunately, there are 3 newly infected health care workers during the current week (week 2).

The report above confirms that so far this year (2022), Edo, Ondo, and Bauchi states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected increased to 11 and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case is 27.

Nigeria is now likely leaving the period of relatively lower case numbers. Case numbers are increasing and likely to increase further in the coming weeks. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (Jan-Mar) over the past 5 years and is the case again for the year 2022 but at a lower level.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn from previous reports that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta. One hopes that this is why there are fewer cases this year (2022).

One hopes that the ongoing public information campaign will help the local population to avoid the entry of these reservoir rodents into their houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY
