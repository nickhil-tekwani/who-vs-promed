Anthrax Shots Made Australian Troops Sick - Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Australian troops headed for Iraq in 2003 received compulsory anthrax shots
but were not told that troops sent earlier to Afghanistan had suffered
severe side effects from the vaccine, an Australian daily said on Saturday.
The Australian newspaper said defense documents received under freedom of
information laws showed that the defense force had had problems with the
vaccine back in November 2001. "The entire anthrax vaccination program for
the military deployment to Afghanistan was secretly suspended," said the
newspaper.
It said the program was halted for 2 months after 75 percent of the 1500
Afghan deployment in 2002, including elite special forces who were to
engage in fierce fighting with the Taliban, fell ill. The newspaper said a
defense doctor's briefing note to the then chief of the Australian Defense
Force, Admiral Chris Barrie, said "(defense) has reported a very high rate
of adverse events being suffered by personnel."
The note went on to say that the side effects from the anthrax shots "could
be operationally significant if the units concerned received their
vaccinations after being deployed." [Reported] side effects included
"swelling and pain severe enough for (troops) not to be able to use the
affected arm, and flu-like illness severe enough for some personnel to
require sick leave for 24-48 hours."
"All units involved in this vaccination campaign have been told to cease
use of the...anthrax vaccine until further notice," said the internal
defense document quoted by the newspaper.
A spokeswoman for Australian Defense Minister Robert Hill told Reuters all
troops deployed to Iraq had been informed of the full extent of the anthrax
side effects.
At the time of the troop deployment to Iraq, Hill said the vaccination
shots, which were compulsory for the 2000 military personnel sent, were
safe and had anthrax shots himself to show he had confidence in the safety
of the vaccinations. Around 40 Australians troops sent to the Middle East
refused to have the shots and were sent home. Many were not told of the
anthrax shots until they were sailing to the Gulf.
At the time Britain allowed its troops go to the Gulf without the anthrax
shots as long as they signed a legal waiver.
The United States led Australian and British forces into Iraq in 2003,
accusing Iraq of developing weapons of mass destruction including
biological agents such as anthrax.

Comment:
Several recent news reports from Australia succeed in raising alarms about
anthrax vaccine again, while offering little in the way of information.
Readers would infer that 38 percent or 75 percent of anthrax-vaccinated
people (depending on the news article) suffered side effects, but which
side effects had which rates and of what duration? The numbers offered in
the articles are not specific enough to be useful in evaluating the
Australian safety experience. The authors seem to have mixed descriptions
of unusual swelling cases with statistics about common events.
The American anthrax vaccine has been given to about 1.1 million people
since 1998; the British anthrax vaccine somewhat fewer. These anthrax
vaccines are known commodities. An adverse event seen in 1/3 or 3/4 of
recipients would be patently obvious among a million people. American
troops and clinicians have indeed seen reactions occurring in 1/3 of
vaccinees: redness, tenderness, swelling, headache, malaise; in short, the
adverse events seen after any vaccination. In the American experience,
large-magnitude swelling occurs in 1 -or 2 percent of recipients. The
National Academy of Sciences (America's premier civilian scientific
advisory group) reviewed the safety of anthrax vaccine, considering over a
dozen safety studies of various scientific designs and hearing personally
from people who believe they had been harmed by anthrax vaccine. The NAS
conclusion: Anthrax vaccine has a side-effect profile like that of other
vaccines given to adults. Table 4-1 in that report provides a convenient
review of adverse events for other adult vaccines.
<http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10310.html>
A typhoid vaccine widely used internationally notes in the package insert
that 98 percent of recipients report side effects. How can regulators allow
such a vaccine to be marketed? Set the logical parameters to count anybody
who has any symptom after vaccination, and you will count most of the
recipients. Shots hurt.
My understanding of the Australian Government's actions was that it
developed its anthrax-vaccination policies based on tactical situations,
with no need to modify its policies due to adverse-event considerations.
Obviously, the Australian Government would want to speak for itself on the
matter. A July 2003 statement from them appears at
<http://www.defence.gov.au/dpe/dhs/infocentre/anthrax/i-anthrax.htm>.
Because the recent Australian experience involves the British-made vaccine,
the British manufacturer should have an opportunity to speak as well.
The antidotes for sensationalism are facts, details that are missing from
these recent headlines:
- report what fraction of vaccine recipients reported which symptoms;
- set an objective definition for serious (e.g., swelling > 12 cm) and
report the fraction for whom that applies; and
- name any events that happen more often among vaccinated people than
unvaccinated people.
In short, let's bring the scientific method to bear on questions of vaccine
safety.
Naturally, good scientists and clinicians need to keep eyes and ears open
to unexpected findings. The Australians have probably identified the
pattern of injection-site reactions and malaise that other users of anthrax
vaccine are already familiar with. The troops deserve to have this
assumption confirmed. We all need more information than what is provided in
these short news articles before concluding that something new is afoot.

[I have known John for a number of years and have found him to be objective
and reliable in his comments and views. To date we have been unable to get
the Australian military viewpoint, report, or comments on these events,
only that of Australian journalists. It would be appreciated if we could
have their (fuller) account of what happened. Personally I have found the
discomfort from the US BioPort anthrax vaccine to be trivial on any scale
-- ditto my students -- and a dream compared to typhoid, plague, or the old
egg-adapted rabies vaccines, but I was born in a different age. I have no
experience of the British vaccine. Unfortunately, news is what the media
says it is, and one should always remember that the primary purpose of
newspapers and TV is not objectivity, but selling advertising for
groceries. - Mod.MHJ]
