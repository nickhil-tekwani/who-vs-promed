DIPHTHERIA - PARAGUAY (CENTRAL)

In Paraguay 3 weeks ago an outbreak of Diphtheria began. Through today [15
May 2002] 10 cases have been identified (the most recent was identified 11
May 2002). The majority of the cases were between 5 and 10 years of
age. The outbreak is occurring in a rural city, Jose Augusto Saldivar,
located 35 km from Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay [in the Central
Department]. None of the cases had received three doses of vaccine (DPT).
All cases presented as a respiratory infection with membranous pharyngitis
or obstructive laryngotracheitis. Three of the cases died (case fatality
rate of 30 percent).
Vaccination histories of the patients were provided [to Dr. Sosa] by Dr.
Gualberto Pi√±anez, Chief of Department of Epidemiology of the Health
Secretary of Paraguay, since only 3 of the cases were hospitalized in our
institution. Of the 10 patients, 6 had never received any doses of DPT, 3
had received only 1 dose of DPT and in the remaining case, the mother said
that the child had received 3 doses but there was no documentation of this.

[Thanks to Dr. Arbo for sending in this first hand report on the current
outbreak.
According to GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network)
<http://www.GideonOnline.com> routine immunization (DTP) in Paraguay is
administered at ages 2, 4, 6 and 18 months; and 4 years.
Year / Vaccine coverage (percent) / Cases reported
1980 / 17 / 14
1990 / 79 / 10
1991 / 79 / 4
1992 / 85 / 6
1993 / 79 / 6
1994 / 84 / 1
1995 / 79 / 1
1996 / 80 / 0
1997 / 82 / 0
1998 / 84 / 0
1999 / 77 / 0
2000 / 80 / 0
Since 1980 there have been major increases in vaccination coverages with
decreases in the numbers of cases reported, so that during the period 1996
through 2000, no cases were reported. The occurrence of 10 cases in the
preceding 3 weeks, none of whom have a history of adequate vaccination,
serves as a reminder of the vulnerability of the population to diphtheria
if not vaccinated.
In reviewing the prior ProMED-mail postings on diphtheria, the majority of
cases and outbreaks covered have been associated with the Russian
Federation, either with reports of outbreaks from the Russian Federation,
or imported cases from the Russian Federation. This outbreak in Paraguay
is one of the first outbreaks reported in Latin America in recent years.
The WHO Vaccines and Immunizations website has an excellent background
review of diphtheria at:
<http://www.who.int/vaccines-diseases/diseases/diphtheria_dis.shtml>. In
the discussion on the epidemiology of the disease, it states: "In the face
of rising immunization levels in all countries throughout the world what
was once a cyclical epidemic disease is now charcterized by sporadic cases
and intermittent outbreaks of low intensity. This shift occurred in the
1940s and 1950s in most industrialized countries as use of Diphteria,
Tetanus/Pertussis (DTP) vaccine increased... Developing countries,
however, are much less prone to faucial (throat) diphtheria outbreaks, and
their shift has been less dramatic.
But recent large epidemics of diphtheria in several eastern European
countries have again drawn attention to this forgotten disease. Reports
from developing countries suggest different epidemiological patterns of the
disease occur in populations with different immunization histories. In the
NIS [Newly Independent States], the outbreaks had high-case fatality rates
and a large proportion of patients with complications."
Follow-up information on this outbreak would be appreciated, including age
distribution of the cases and control efforts implemented. - Mod.MPP]
