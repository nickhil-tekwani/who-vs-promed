FMD: the OIE accepts the challenge
----------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is present in 2/3 of the OIE Member
Countries and in these countries this disease causes serious economic
losses. Nonetheless, 54 countries have met the requirements to be
officially recognised by the OIE as FMD-free countries without
vaccination, and one country is officially recognised as FMD-free
with vaccination. In addition, FMD-free zones have been officially
recognised in 7 other countries, without vaccination in 5 cases and
with vaccination in the other 2.
The increasing number of FMD outbreaks in Western Europe, South
America, and Asia has led many Member Countries to increase
significantly the scale of the resources used to combat the disease,
notably when it occurs in naive animal populations. Animal health
professionals throughout the world and many other stakeholders and
consumers have expressed concern at the technical and political
difficulty and cost of maintaining the status of FMD-free country or
zone, in a world where FMD is still endemic in many regions and where
the globalisation of trade in animals and animal products multiplies
the risk of spread of the disease.
The OIE has continued its active support the Veterinary Services of
its Member Countries in their efforts to eradicate or control FMD,
assimilating the lessons learned from the recent crisis. A recent
example is the amendments adopted during the 70th General Session to
the chapter on FMD in the International Animal Health Code (the
Code). The most important of these are:
1. Introduction of the concept of FMD virus infection, aimed at
increasing the transparency of FMD notification to the OIE and
ensuring greater sanitary security of international trade;
2. Recognition of new diagnostic tests capable of differentiating
between infected and vaccinated animals, notably when vaccination is
used during an emergency in order to prevent the spread of the
disease in a country or a zone;
3. Reduction from 12 to 6 months for the minimum waiting period
before a country that vaccinated animals during an outbreak without
subsequently applying stamping out may submit a request to the OIE
for the restoration of its FMD infection-free status.
These changes to the Code chapter on FMD offer the Veterinary
Services a wider choice of strategies applicable at the national
level to combat the disease, while at the same time allowing them to
adopt alternatives to stamping out without vaccination that are less
penalising than in the past regarding the ability to resume
international trade.
The OIE has begun to prepare guidelines on harmonised methods of FMD
surveillance to assist Member Countries in their eradication or
control programmes. These guidelines, in conjunction with the changes
to the Code chapter on FMD, should help Member Countries eradicate
FMD more rapidly and ultimately enable more countries to fulfill the
necessary conditions to apply for official recognition of the status
of FMD free country/zone. These new guidelines will be presented to
the OIE International Committee in May 2003.
The OIE will continue to give priority to the development of even
more effective FMD control and surveillance strategies in its Member
Countries, especially those where the disease is endemic. At the same
time, it will encourage the setting up of more effective regional
programmes for epidemiological surveillance and monitoring of FMD and
well adapted diagnostic laboratories.
Lastly, the OIE will strive to promote international solidarity in
the field of FMD control in the poorest countries by seeking to
convince the decision-makers and international financial agencies to
mobilise additional resources as quickly as possible.

[The timely statement by Dr Vallat, Director General of the Office
International des Epizooties (World Organisation of Animal Health),
relates to the welcome rethinking of FMD control measures within the
veterinary communities in the 158 member-countries. Some of those
ideas have been recently expressed in the UK and EU inquiries into
the FMD issue, especially the Inquiry on Infectious Diseases in
Livestock by the Royal Society. - Mod.AS].
