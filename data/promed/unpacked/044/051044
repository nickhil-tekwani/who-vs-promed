Re: ProMED-mail Influenza pandemic (H1N1) (11): WHO statement to CE
20100126.0289
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The editor's (Mod.CP) comments at the end of the WHO statement
wrongly refer to the Members of the European Parliament, which is the
European Union institution. ["This statement is a response to severe
and sustained criticism by some European parliamentarians of what
they considered to be the premature designation of the influenza
(H1N1) 2009 virus outbreak as a pandemic, and the consequent profits
accrued by the pharmaceutical industry. - Mod.CP"]

The wording "European parliamentarians" should be replaced by
"Members of Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe".

The WHO statement was given during the hearing entitled "The handling
of the H1N1 pandemic: more transparency needed?" which was organised
by the Parliamentary Assembly's Committee on Social, Health and
Family Affairs of the Council of Europe (PACE) on 26 Jan 2010. This
hearing was the consequence of a motion for recommendation entitled
"Faked Pandemics -- a threat for health" signed by some Members of
PACE. Members of the European Parliament should not be confused with
Members of PACE.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) consists
of a number of individual representatives from each member State,
with a President elected each year from among them for a maximum
period of 3 sessions. Members of PACE are appointed in a manner,
which is left to be decided by each member state, as long as they are
elected within their national or federal Parliament, or appointed
from amongst the members of that parliament. The balance of political
parties within each national delegation must ensure a fair
representation of the political parties or groups in their national
parliaments.
