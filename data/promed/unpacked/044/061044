Australia: viral gastroenteritis affects Orange City region (NSW)
----------------------------------------------
A combination of gastroenteritis and flu-like symptoms have struck
several Orange residents causing them to seek medical attention.
Orange City General Practitioner Dr. Leonora Anderson said a
combination of poor hygiene and virus droplets had accounted for a
wide range of age groups being affected in the past 6 to 8 weeks. The
gastroenteritis virus has affected more than 400 people in the region
but has not reached epidemic proportions in Orange City. Dr. Ken
Hazelton said that he had not seen a rise in the number of patients
complaining of viral gastroenteritis. "I know Cowra and Gilgandra
have been badly affected, but Orange seems to have missed out," Dr.
Hazelton said.
Mid-Western Area Health infectious disease surveillance officer Gail
Osborne said this year [2004] was particularly bad. "We have recorded
more than 400 cases of norovirus infection across the Mid-Western
Area Health region, and these are only cases where people have had
testing done, there would be many more in the community," she said.
The virus is spread by coming into contact with an infected person,
and the symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and
headache. "The best way to avoid the virus is to continuously wash
hands, especially when preparing or eating food, and, after you have
used the toilet."
Institutions, such as nursing homes and childcare centers, are most
at risk. Trish Merchant, manager of Wontama Hostel, said the
residents were badly affected by the virus. "It was a particularly
virulent strain of norovirus this year [2004], but we confined the
residents to their rooms, focused on hygiene, and were able to
contain it fairly well." Snug as a Rug Childcare Center director
Olivia Picker said the center had a lot of children affected. "A lot
of our kids have been affected with vomiting, diarrhea and a high
fever."

USA: Norovirus outbreak at Blue Lake Regional Park in Oregon
-----------------------------------------------
The swimming area at Blue Lake Regional Park will remain closed
through at least Sunday [25 Jul 2004], health officials said Tuesday
[20 Jul 2004], denying hundreds of swimmers a cooling dip as
temperatures soar into the 90s. The popular swimming beach was closed
Fri 23 Jul 2004 after 2 groups of swimmers reported bouts of diarrhea
and vomiting to Multnomah County health officials. By Sun 25 Jul
2004, more than 100 people, who had been swimming in the lake,
reported similar symptoms.
Tests on stool samples provided by victims revealed the presence of
noroviruses, said Dr. Gary Oxman, Multnomah County's health officer.
(Noroviruses include Norwalk virus and Norwalk-type viruses, which
gained notoriety for sickening cruise ship passengers).
Oxman said that human feces in the water, which is then ingested by
swimmers, is how most waterborne outbreaks occur. According to the
national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noroviruses can
cause stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting that can last as long as
60 hours, after a 12-hour to 2-day incubation period.
Oxman said only a handful of people called health officials on Tues
20 Jul 2004 to say they got sick after swimming in the lake. The
outbreak has not diminished demand for picnic space at the park,
officials said. Boating, and other park activities, are not affected.
2 sporting events, planned for Sat 24 and Sun 25 Jul 2004, will drop
the swimming component.
The park, and its 64-acre lake, north of Fairview off Northeast 223rd
Avenue, attracts about 1400 people on warm summer weekends. Health
and park officials said they will meet again Monday [26 Jul 2004] and
will probably decide then when to reopen the lake to swimmers.

USA: Laguna area affected by viral gastroenteritis for 2nd time
-----------------------------------------------
A 2nd widespread illness has hit Laguna Elementary School in 2004,
but school district officials say it appears unrelated to [an enteric
virus infection] that swept the school in May 2004. Late last month
[June 2004], school officials received reports that as many as 20
Girl Scouts, who attended a summer camp, reported nausea and fever.
Scottsdale Unified School District officials are working with the
Maricopa County Department of Public Health to determine a cause. "It
appears to be a bad coincidence," district spokesman Tom Herrmann
said. He added that the school building is "absolutely safe," and
school will begin as planned on 11 Aug 2004.
Doug Hauth, public information officer for the county Department of
Public Health, said the county took samples and forwarded them to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. They are
awaiting results.
"We have no idea what we're looking at this time," he said. "We've
only had one official report of illness. We do know there were
others." The Scottsdale school, near 104th Street and Shea Boulevard,
was plagued, in May 2004, by a highly contagious enteric virus. At
its height, more than 200 pupils, 25 percent of the student body,
were out of school. Symptoms lasted a few days and included nausea,
diarrhea, and vomiting. That virus was [identified as a norovirus], a
group of viruses that cause gastroenteritis. The infection is spread
by food or drink contaminated with the virus, touching surfaces, or
having contact with someone who is infected.
In the latest incident, Herrmann said a girl reported similar
symptoms, except this time she had a fever. She has since recovered.
Herrmann said staff cleaned and sanitized the school after the May
outbreak, and the buildings have been cleaned again. He said other
groups meeting at the school over the summer have not reported any
illnesses.
