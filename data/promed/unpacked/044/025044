African horse sickness scare
----------------------------
4 horses have died near here, and local horse owners and veterinarians fear
further deaths following 2 cases of African horse sickness (AHS) in
Plettenberg Bay.
Chintsa Horses owner Georgie Dickerson, who lost one horse on Friday [25
Mar 2005] because of the sickness, claimed not enough was being done to
curb the disease. Dickerson has 36 horses.
"This is a family business and we have both young and old horses here. If I
lose any more of the horses it could become quite disastrous. This is our
main source of income," she said.
Horse lover Debbie Venter of Komga lost 3 horses last week. "All 3 of my
horses had been vaccinated but still I lost them. We have to check on the
horses every morning and again every night," she said. She said owners
should refrain from moving horses around as this could spread the sickness
further. "It could spread fast and as soon as it hits the racing industry
it will be chaos. It could also become chaotic if it spreads to the rural
parts of the Transkei," added Venter.
2 horses taking part in a polo tournament died from the contagious virus in
Plettenberg Bay 2 weeks ago and all the horses that took part have been
confined to the area until it is declared disease-free.
Dickerson said she had lost 3 animals to the disease 4 years ago. "I am
very disappointed at the research that has been done into this sickness. We
are told that the vaccine covers 7 types of strains but there are actually
17 types. I think more needs to be done," she said yesterday. [See
commentary re number of internationally known AHSV serotypes].
State veterinarians here confirmed the threat yesterday but were reluctant
to expand on the matter. "We have taken blood samples, which have been sent
to laboratories to run tests but we have not yet received the results,"
said one local veterinarian. "We are really worried about this but cannot
really point out the areas exactly where this is prevalent at this stage."
State and private veterinarians as well as horse owners agree that the
incidence of the disease so far has not been as bad as 4 years ago, and
they hoped the onset of colder weather would inhibit it from spreading
further. "This is a seasonal disease which is always prevalent between
January and March. So it does look like we may after all bring it under
control," said a state veterinarian.
Worried Stutterheim horse owner Greg Miles also hoped that the worst would
abate as the colder weather approaches. "It looks like the worst could be
over because we are now fast approaching winter. This sickness is really
rife when you get all those heavy rains," he said.
Department of Agriculture spokesperson Mthobeli Mxotwa last night said the
department was monitoring the situation closely.
"As far as we know there are no horses in the Eastern Cape which have been
affected by the sickness. We are still waiting for the results from the
laboratories and until the results reveal otherwise, we have no reason to
be concerned," he said.

[African horse sickness (AHS) is an infectious but noncontagious viral
disease affecting all species of equidae caused by an orbivirus of the
family Reoviridae and characterised by alterations in respiratory and
circulatory functions. AHS is transmitted by at least 2 species of
Culicoides. 9 different serotypes have been described. All serotypes of AHS
occur in eastern and southern Africa.

Data on the African Horse Sickness (AHS) serotype involved in the current
cases will be appreciated. AHS does not affect humans. - Mod.AS]
