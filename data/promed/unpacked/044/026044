ST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS - USA (FLORIDA) (02)

A few clarifications on [the previous] posting and the current
situation in Florida:
The Florida Department of Health issued a press release 5 Oct
1999 informing the public that health advisories were issued on the
same day for St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) in Charlotte, Collier,
DeSoto, Glades, Hendry, Lee and Sarasota counties.
The advisories follow the year's first human case of SLE in Florida,
reported in Sarasota County. The Florida Department of
Health has sent specimens from this case to CDC Ft. Collins for
testing for West Nile virus.
This human case comes at the same time we experienced
increased SLE virus activity in sentinel chickens. This activity is
also being seen in southwest Florida. Overall, SLE activity in
sentinel chickens has been very sporadic and low but these
regional increases will be monitored weekly.
Advisories are being used to encourage people to take basic
precautions to help limit their exposure to mosquitoes and prevent
encephalitis in these specific counties.
The claim of a newspaper of a death of a Bonita Springs man in
March 1999 from SLE cannot be substantiated. Specimens from a
man with suspected SLE who died in March 1999 in Bonita Springs
were negative for SLE at the state laboratory at that time.

[We are greatful for the clarifications. I suppose some of us will not
rest easily until we know that human infections being diagnosed in
the eastern U.S. as St. Louis encephalitis and birds with antibody
identified as being anti-St. Louis encephalitis virus do not represent
infections with West Nile virus. Not much of a chance of that, of
course, but still it is worrisome. - Mod.CHC]
