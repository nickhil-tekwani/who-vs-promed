Georgia researchers share rust trial results
-----------------------------------------------
A few findings from this year's [2005] Asian soybean rust [ASR]
research in Georgia may be of particular interest to soybean growers
in the U.S. The fungal disease was widespread in Georgia in 2005.
The 1st ASR was found in late April 2005 on volunteer soybean plants
in Seminole County. In mid-July 2005, ASR became a widespread
epidemic in southwest Georgia and continued to spread across the
state. By the end of the season, ASR had been found in counties
bordering Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, and Tennessee.
University of Georgia researchers said their experience showed
chlorothalonil was much less effective at controlling ASR than were
other fungicides labeled for use against the disease. "Unfortunately,
we do not have sufficient data to say which fungicides were the best;
however we did see benefits from triazoles, strobilurins, and
triazole-strobilurin mixes," as reported in the December 2005 issue
of the University of Georgia Extension Soybean Newsletter.
There was a significant yield increase in some trials in which
fungicides were used. In Attapulgus, 2 applications of Folicur (4 fl
oz/A) increased yield by 19 bu/A. In an on-farm trial in Appling
County, 2 applications of Headline increased the grower's yield by 16
bu/A over the untreated check.
One of the most dramatic lessons from their fungicide trials was that
fungicide-treated rows of soybeans were not affected by untreated,
completely defoliated, rows next to them.
Growers who treat their crops need not worry about the effect of
neighboring fields that did not receive fungicides, the researchers
said. They estimated that as much as 70 percent of the soybean
acreage in the state was sprayed with a fungicide at least once to
combat ASR. From field trials in Decatur, Tift, and Appling Counties,
it appears the R1 (bloom) growth stage was an appropriate time to
begin a fungicide program if there was indication from sentinel plots
that ASR could be in the area. According to the researchers, delays
in initiating fungicide applications led to reduced yields in several
field trials.
