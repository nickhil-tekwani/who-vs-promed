Kansai airport begins vaccinating workers after measles outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------
Kansai International Airport [Osaka] began vaccinating its workers against measles Thursday [8 Sep 2016] following an outbreak that has so far infected 39 people, mostly younger airport employees who were never vaccinated against the disease. The move comes just over 3 weeks after the 1st case was confirmed on 17 Aug 2016, when a female employee in her 20s who handles international flights was diagnosed. Over the following weeks, the outbreak spread, mainly among Kansai airport workers. As of Thursday [8 Sep 2016], 33 workers had been confirmed as having caught the measles, along with 2 medical staff who treated them; 31 had recovered, airport officials said. But with 4 passengers also infected, and another 10 people in Osaka Prefecture suspected as having caught the disease, concerns of a major outbreak in the region remain.

Osaka Gov. Ichiro Matsui criticized Kansai airport for its failure to act faster. "There were insufficient, unprofessional aspects to the airport's response. In the event of an outbreak in places where large numbers of people pass through, I want authorities to avoid a panic by providing information and working to ensure the disease doesn't spread," Matsui told reporters in Osaka Wednesday [7 Sep 2016]. The governor said many younger Kansai airport employees were never vaccinated against measles and advised those who were to get a booster dose. A prefectural investigation of Kansai airport's personnel showed nearly 900 employees under the age of 30 have either never had measles or never been vaccinated.

About 15 000 people work at the airport. Airport officials said that 300 employees, mostly in their 20s and 30s, would be vaccinated Thursday and Friday [8 and 9 Sep 2016], and that the remaining 600 or so would be vaccinated when more vaccine was secured. Notices in Japanese warned customers of the outbreak and urged them to seek medical treatment if they display any symptoms that began to appear in the airport. Some local governments in the vicinity have also taken precautionary steps.

In Sakai, which lies between Kansai airport and Osaka city, officials are urging young children especially to get vaccinated, as are officials in Izumisano, which lies just across the bay from the island where Kansai airport is located. Last month's outbreak occurred at one of the busiest times of the year for the airport. During the peak Obon [Festival of Souls, a Buddhist celebration] season from 10-21 Aug, an average 60 000 passengers flew in and out of the airport each day. The incubation period for measles is 10 to 12 days. Kansai airport is offering English-language updates on its website. Travelers can go to http://jtim.es/6pNc3040zwe for the latest information.

In 2015, Kansai International Airport had 169 304 aircraft movements, of which 119 373 were international, and 49 931 were domestic. The total number of passengers was 24 054 171, of which 17 270 087 were international, and 6 784 084 were domestic.

[ProMED thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for submitting this report on Japan's response to a measles outbreak. Vaccination with measles, mumps, rubella vaccine is critical to control of measles. It is a highly contagious viral infection of the respiratory system, spread by direct contact or airborne means, such as when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Crowded airports facilitate viral transmission.
