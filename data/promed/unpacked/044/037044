1st record of Culicoides imicola in the Basque Country
--------------------------------------------------------
This short communication provides evidence of recent northwards
expansion of the distribution of _C imicola_.

Between October and November 2007, a new BTV outbreak occurred in the
Basque Country, Gipuzkoa province, Oiartzualdea valley (northern
Spain), resulting in a total of 63 affected sheep farms, 92 sheep
with potential clinical signs of disease and 41 confirmed BTV
mortalities. Serotype BTV-1 was confirmed by the Spanish Animal
Diseases Reference Laboratory at Algete in Madrid.

From the last week of November 2007, CDC traps were used for a total
of 10 trap weeks on 3 affected and one unaffected farms (see map: fig
1 at the above URL). To characterise the Culicoides species and sex
composition, and their relative abundance, a total of 6 CDC traps per
farm (3 traps indoors and 3 outdoors, separated from each other by 25
m [82 feet], and hanging about 2.5 m [8.2 feet] above the ground)
were used continuously, independent of the light levels, by using
220-12V transformers connected to the general power network of the
farms.

Each Tuesday, jars were collected and all specimens of the genus
Culicoides were subsequently separated and preserved in 70 percent
ethanol in the laboratory. All Culicoides species were initially
sorted on their wing pattern under a Leica MZ95 stereomicroscope.
However, given their minute size (usually no longer than 3 mm), for
more accurate diagnosis it was necessary to dissect many of the
specimens and make microscopic slide preparations of their body
parts. All the specimens were certified, using the keys of
identification of Delecolle (1985), Gil Collado and Sahuquillo
Herraiz (1985), and Rawlings (1996). [For the references, see the
original paper]

This trapping effort from November 2007 and January 2008 yielded a
total of 43 051 Culicoides specimens. 6 specimens of _Culicoides
imicola_ were detected in both of the localities most affected by the
outbreak of BTV-1. The most abundant species was _Culicoides
obsoletus-scoticus_ (96.2 percent) followed by _Culicoides lupicaris_
(3 percent), _Culicoides pulicaris_ (0.3 percent), _Culicoides
punctatus_ (0.2 percent), _Culicoides chiopterus_ (0.1 percent),
_Culicoides dewulfi_ (0.08 percent), _Culicoides newsteadi_ (0.06
percent), _C imicola_ (0.014 percent), _Culicoides festivipennis_
(0.014 percent), _Culicoides kibunensis_ (0.002 percent), _Culicoides
comosioculatus_ (0.002 percent) and _Culicoides stigma_ (0.002
percent).

The identification of _C lupicaris_, _C comosioculatus_ and _C
stigma_ represent the 1st time these species have been recorded from
the Iberian Peninsula.

All the females of _C imicola_ that were collected were heavily
gravid. The first specimen was captured in Zabaltxo inside the farm
on 27 Nov 2007. 2 more specimens were captured in the same location
and niche on 4 Dec and 11 Dec 2007, and an additional female was
collected outdoors on 4 Dec 2007. On 11 Dec 2008, 2 other females of
_C imicola_ were collected inside Oiantzabal farm, located 4 km [2.5
miles] southeast of Zabaltxo. These specimens could have arrived in
the Gipuzkoa province due to incorrectly fumigated animal transports
from infested areas of Spain where _C imicola_ is native, or as a
result of strong winds and/or natural expansion by general climate
warming.

In conclusion, the presence of _C imicola_ in the Basque Country,
alongside abundant potential BTV vectors that have been implicated
during northern European outbreaks of BTV serotype 8, such as _C
obsoletus_, _C scoticus_, _C dewulfi_, _C chiopterus_ and _C
pulicaris_, is an important finding that needs to be relayed to
regional, national and international animal health authorities.

Further work is required to determine whether _C imicola_ populations
will become established in northern Spain, to discern whether other
native Culicoides species are also associated with the virus after
this last disease outbreak, and to assess the level of risk by
setting up a region-wide surveillance programme and developing
integrated control strategies for all potential vectors of BTV.

[Trapping was carried out during the last week of November 2007,
throughout December 2007 and January 2008. It started 3-4 weeks after
the described 3 BTV-1 outbreaks, at the end of the so-called vector
season. No information on virus isolation/identification trials in
the trapped arthropods are included; possibly the (late in season)
timing of the trappings excluded infection in the vectors, anyway.

The mentioned identification of _C. dewulfi_ and _C.chiopterus_ among
the trapped culicoids is interesting: both have been found to be
potential vectors of BTV-8 (see postings 20061024.3042,
20080321.1077).

Noteworthy, on 17 Jan 2008 Spain notified the diagnosis of BTV-8 in
cattle in northern Spain, namely in Solares, Cantabria province,
which had started 9 days earlier; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6689>.

Subscribers are referred to Spain's presentations to EU's SCFCAH
(STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE FOOD CHAIN AND ANIMAL HEALTH, Section
Animal Health and Welfare) meetings of 5-6 Feb 2008 and 4-5 Mar 2008.
The presented maps show that the Guipuzkoa province -- where the
above entomological observations have been undertaken -- are declared
as restriction zones for both BTV-1 and BTV-8. Look for "Bluetongue
in Spain" at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations_en.htm#18062008>.

As concluded by the authors of the above paper, entomological
findings, indicating the presence of various vector species, such as
_C.imicola_, are important and need to be relayed to regional,
national and international animal health authorities. We fully agree;
earliest possible dissemination of such information deserves to be
encouraged.

The next meeting of SCFCAH is due in Brussels on Mon 30 Jun 2008.
Though bluetongue has not been included in the agenda, it may be
assumed that data on significant developments, in case available,
will be reported. This relates in particular to the appearance of 1st
new BTV-8 disease cases in Europe, which may be anticipated as
temperatures rise (or have already been suspected?!). - Mod.AS]
