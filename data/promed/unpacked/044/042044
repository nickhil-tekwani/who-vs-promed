For the 1st time in 4 years, foot and mouth disease has been reported in
the Amurskaya region.
The veterinary department of the Ministry of agriculture Thu [15 Apr 2004]
reported foot and mouth virus type "O" in a cow in one of the experimental
farms in the Amurskaya region. This farm is located 60 kilometers from the
Chinese border.
To prevent the spread of the outbreak, 50 young animals with signs of
disease were destroyed and the farm was quarantined. Presently there has
been no spread beyond the focus of the primary outbreak. According to the
Interfax news agency, there has been no distribution of meat from the
affected farm, which was considered experimental; thus, there is no chance
that the disease could spread to people.
Additionally, humans rarely contract foot and mouth disease, and when they
do, it rarely has a lethal outcome. The last case of foot and mouth
disease in the Russian Federation was registered in 2000 in an experimental
farm in the Primorskaya region. It was contained at the focus of outbreak.
Foot and mouth disease has a viral etiology and usually affects
Artiodactyla [an order of mammals comprised of ungulates with an even
number of toes, including ruminants, pigs, deer, and antelopes].

[FMD in humans is extremely rare and generally not regarded to be a public
health hazard. For example, during the well-monitored major FMD outbreak in
the UK, Feb-Sep 2001, which involved more than 2000 infected premises, not
a single human infection was confirmed although several suspected cases
were investigated. The extensive efforts to control and eradicate FMD
outbreaks are prescribed to protect susceptible animals, namely cattle,
sheep, goats & pigs. - Mod. AS]
