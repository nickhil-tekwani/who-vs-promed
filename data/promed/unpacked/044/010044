["African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs, whose mortality rate can reach 100%. It is not a danger to human health, but it has devastating effects on pig populations and the farming economy. There is currently no effective vaccine against ASF. The virus is highly resistant in the environment, meaning that it can survive on clothes, boots, wheels, and other materials. It can also survive in various pork products, such as ham, sausages or bacon. Therefore, human behaviours can play an important role in spreading this pig disease across borders if adequate measures are not taken." (Source: WOAH, African swine fever at https://www.woah.org/en/disease/african-swine-fever/#ui-id-1)

The latest WOAH report on the current situation of ASF, from 27 May to 9 Jun 2022, is available at https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2022/06/asf-report14.pdf. - Mod.CRD
