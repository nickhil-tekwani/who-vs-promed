Pulse Australia has urged Wimmera [region, Victoria] chickpea growers to check their crops for ascochyta blight after the disease has been found on resistant varieties.

Ascochyta blight is a fungal disease which devastated the chickpea production for nearly a decade from the late-1990s.

Pulse Australia's Mary Raynes said, "All growers, advisors, and consultant need to regularly inspect chickpea crops, right up to plant maturity. This is especially important 10 to 14 days after rain, when new infections will be clearly evident. If you suspect the disease, consider applying a registered fungicide close to the next rain."

[Ascochyta blight (AB) of chickpea is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella rabiei_ (previously _Ascochyta rabiei_) and is considered the most important disease of chickpeas worldwide. The pathogen attacks all aerial portions of the plant and is specific to chickpeas. Disease development is favoured by cool, wet conditions. Symptoms may include spots and lesions on leaves, stems, and pods which may lead to partial wilting, or the whole shoot may break off and the plant will die. Infected seeds are shriveled, spotted, and discoloured.

The pathogen can survive on infected plant material for at least 2 years under dry conditions, but viability is lost rapidly in high humidity. It is seed borne at a high rate of 50-80 per cent. Seed transmission is the primary mode of spread both locally and worldwide. Disease management includes cultural methods, seed treatment, prophylactic fungicide applications, and use of varieties with improved resistance.

The emergence of a pathogen strain which has apparently broken host resistance in the currently used cultivars, as reported above, increases the risk of yield losses in the area.

Ascochyta blight (AB) of lentils is caused by the fungus _Didymella lentis_ (previously _Ascochyta lentis_). The 2 pathogens are now classified into different genera, but the same common name derived from their previous classification is still used for both diseases.
