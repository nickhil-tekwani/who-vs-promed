The number of food poisoning cases that resulted from consuming
chicken shawarma in Baqaa, Jordan, has risen to 237, Director General
of the Balqa Health Department Khalid Hiari said.
Hiari added that a total of 120 cases were still hospitalized with 65
cases in Al Hussein Hospital in Salt, 45 cases in Prince Hamzah
Hospital, 2 in Al Israa Hospital and 8 in the Islamic Hospital.
The government on Sun 12 Aug 2007 imposed a ban on sales of chicken
shawarma meals until stricter measures are enforced to prevent
reoccurrence of food poisoning cases.
Salmonella-contaminated shawarma dishes were the cause of the cases
reported in Baqaa since last Fri 10 Aug 2007.

Nearly 200 people were treated for food poisoning in Jordan, after
eating salmonella-tainted chicken sandwiches from a fast food
restaurant in a Palestinian camp, officials said Sun 12 Aug 2007.
Minister of public sector development Mohammed Zuneibat told the
state-run Petra news agency that the government had opened an
investigation after 176 people were stricken from eating chicken
shawarma sandwiches Sat 11 Aug 2007.
"The chicken used to make the shawarma sandwich was not cooked
properly, and contained salmonella," Zuneibat said.
The restaurant in the Baqaa camp just north of Amman, Zuneibat said,
had passed inspections on 4 separate occasions in July 2007.
In 2006, hundreds of Jordanians were treated for food poisoning after
eating shawarma sandwiches, prompting the authorities to crack down
on fast food restaurants.

[Shawarma is thinly sliced cuts of meat, like chicken, beef, goat,
lamb, and sometimes turkey, rolled into a large piece of flatbread or
pita that has been steamed or heated. Inside the pita, foods like
hummus, tahini, pickles, and vegetables are added.
