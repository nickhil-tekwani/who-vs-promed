The detection in 2015 in Cambodia [see also ProMED-mail post 20180607.5844264] of the potentially harvest-devastating _Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus_ (SLCMV) raised alarm. By 2016, the disease had spread, showing its potential to become a major threat. The virus's spread over a single growing season was documented at CIAT [as] the 1st systematic baseline evaluation of SLCMV in Southeast Asia. Since that time the disease was reported in Viet Nam and Thailand, suggesting that SLCMV has taken hold in Southeast Asia.

"Documenting the outbreak at an early stage is critical for understanding the dynamics of the epidemic and pre-empting or responding effectively to future ones," said Erik Delaquis, CIAT. "[Our] studies provide the picture of the incidence of SLCMV one year after its discovery in Southeast Asia, and describe the network of planting material exchange likely to further spread the virus," he said.

The potential impact of a widespread SLCMV outbreak is currently unknown, partly because the variety of cassava grown in Southeast Asia differs from those grown elsewhere. But related types of cassava mosaic diseases in Africa and India have shown the potential to wipe out the plants. As a new disease in the region, many producers are not yet familiar with its symptoms. Development of resistant varieties of cassava will likely be needed to control SLCMV. Improved planting material use and distribution practices also help control the spread.

-------------------------------------------------------
Cassava mosaic disease, one of the 10 most economically important crop viral diseases in the world, was 1st reported in Southeast Asia from a single plantation in Cambodia in 2015. To determine the presence and incidence of _Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus_ (SLCMV) one year after 1st detection, a total of 6480 samples from 419 fields were systematically collected from cassava production areas across Cambodia (3840 samples; 240 fields) and Viet Nam (2640 samples; 179 fields) in the 2016 cropping season.

Using PCR-based diagnostics, we identified 49 SLCMV-infected plants from 9 fields, representing 2% of the total number of fields sampled. Infected fields were geographically restricted to 2 provinces of Eastern Cambodia, while no infection was detected from any of the other sampled sites in either country. Symptom expression patterns in infected plants suggested that SLCMV may have been transmitted both through infected planting materials and by _Bemisia tabaci_, the known whitefly vector of SLCMV.

In addition, 14% of virus infected plants did not express typical symptoms of cassava mosaic disease on their leaves, highlighting that molecular-based validation is needed to confirm the presence of SLCMV in the field. None of the owners of the SLCMV-infected fields indicated acquired planting materials from the plantation where SLCMV was 1st reported.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has triggered food emergencies in the past by destroying cassava crops throughout whole regions. It is caused by a number of species and strains in the large genus _Begomovirus_ which seem to be associated with it in different areas (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20160623.4304471). Co-infections as well as genetic recombination between strains have also been reported, and recombinant strains can be particularly virulent.

CMD symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion and stunting of plants, leading to severe reduction of tuber yields. The CMD viruses are spread by whitefly vectors and with infected plant material (including seed tubers). At least one of the viruses (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an unrelated alternative host (soybean) suggesting that these viruses may have a wider host reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Disease management for begomoviruses usually relies on use of resistant crop cultivars, control of their vectors and control of pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants.

Because most traditional cassava cultivars are susceptible to CMD, varieties resistant to different viral strains are being developed for local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some areas, but in others, the new varieties are being wiped out by cassava brown streak (CBS) disease (caused by viruses in the genus _Ipomovirus_ which are transmitted like CMD). A new CBS viral strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742). Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in affected regions (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643).
