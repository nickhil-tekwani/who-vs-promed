[1] Washington (Snohomish County): backyard flock

A backyard flock of birds in Snohomish County is the latest to test positive for the highly contagious avian influenza, also known as bird flu, the Washington State Department of Agriculture announced Friday [27 May 2022].

The detection was confirmed Friday [27 May 2022], bringing the total number of counties where the flu has been found to 9 (Clallam, Okanogan, King, Pacific, Pierce, Snohomish, Spokane, Thurston, Whatcom).

WSDA continues to urge flock owners to protect their healthy flocks, particularly by keeping them away from wild waterfowl.

"In all backyard detections, we've seen significant exposure to wild waterfowl," said Washington State Veterinarian Dr. Amber Itle.

According to WSDA, flock owners can take steps to avoid introducing diseases to their flocks, such as practicing good biosecurity, washing boots or shoes before entering and when leaving a chicken coop, and sanitizing equipment used around poultry.

[2] Wisconsin (Bayfield County): backyard flock

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) has identified a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a backyard flock in Bayfield County.

Birds at the site were depopulated to prevent spread of the virus.

In Wisconsin, 22 flocks in 14 counties have been confirmed with HPAI.

Flock owners are encouraged to continue practicing strong biosecurity measures to protect birds from the virus and, if possible, keep domestic birds indoors away from wild birds.

DATCP reminds Wisconsin poultry owners to register their premises. State law requires that all livestock owners register where their animals are kept, and registration helps animal health officials communicate with flock owners during disease outbreaks.

[3] Georgia (Toombs County): mixed flock

A devastating virus spread by wildlife has ravaged a large south Georgia backyard farm, but state agriculture officials say they are hopeful the outbreak has been contained to one farm.

A Toombs County farmer alerted the state Department of Agriculture over the Memorial Day weekend when he noticed birds in his varied flock becoming ill and dying. At least 350 animals have been culled so far to stop the spread, with crews still searching for a few stray chickens as of Thursday [2 Jun 2022].

Georgia State Veterinarian Dr. Janemarie Hennebelle described the farm as having a "menagerie of birds" including chickens, turkeys, ducks, and peafowl.

Since the poultry were not being raised for commercial purposes, the farm was not required to be inspected. But state agriculture officials said it is unclear whether an inspection would have even picked up on the fast-spreading highly pathogenic avian influenza sooner.

"We really want to commend this flock owner, because they noticed they had sick birds and they had some birds dying, and they called immediately," Hennebelle said. "And that is really the backbone of what we need folks to be doing for any animal disease, not just highly pathogenic avian influenza. But it's the old adage: if you see something, say something. So cliche, but so true."

Neighboring commercial poultry operations were also tested, and those results have so far come back negative. Testing will continue weekly until restrictions are lifted. And even in times where there is no avian flu scare, all commercial chicken is routinely tested and then checked again before going to market.

The avian flu has wiped out millions of birds in other states, particularly hard-hit Iowa, but it has mostly spared Georgia where poultry is big business.

Before the holiday weekend, the highly pathogenic avian influenza had only been found in 11 wild birds here in Georgia this year [2022]. In the spring, the virus was confirmed in 3 bald eagles found dead along the coast.

But state ag officials have been on heightened alert for the possibility of non-wildlife cases for several months. They suspended exhibitions, swaps, and other gatherings in February [2022] to cut down on the movement of poultry as a preventative measure, and the Toombs County outbreak means those events likely won't be coming back anytime soon.

The Toombs County outbreak was also surprising because it happened as summertime heats up, creating unfavorable conditions for the virus to thrive.

"There's no relaxation here," said Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black. "There is no such thing as a day off when it comes to biosecurity, and likewise, there would not be such a day off for this department and being prepared to respond should there be another event."

Poultry producers are urged to keep their birds sheltered and separated from the outside world by wearing dedicated boots to keep from unwittingly walking the virus into the bird spaces.

"It's very important to control visitors to chicken coops or chicken farms since the virus is easily brought in with human feet into the bird places," said Dr. Louis Zavala, executive director of the Georgia Poultry Laboratory.

Zavala said signs of avian flu include decreased water and food consumption or a drop in egg production, or even depression. The birds tend to be stricken quickly with illness and die.

"If anyone's ever been in a chicken house, you know it's generally a pretty loud place, but one of the more horrifying things is to go into a chicken house and it is quiet," Black said.

How to report avian flu
Poultry producers, whether commercial or backyard farmers, can report suspected highly pathogenic avian influenza cases to the state Department of Agriculture. Reports can also be made online: Avian influenza hotline, Georgia Poultry Laboratory Network (http://www.gapoultrylab.org).

The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) that has dominated the agriculture community for months is perhaps, maybe, possibly, beginning to abate. We hold our collective breaths to see the end of this outbreak.

It is not time to relax our guard, but rather to be steadfastly alert, as was the Georgia individual. Keep biosecurity at a strict level, remembering that "flu flies," and treads can track it back. Keep up the security. Although the disease may be showing a slowing, it is important we stay hypervigilant for the protection of the birds and other animals. - Mod.TG

While none of these media reports specifically mentioned H5N1, other reports do and one clearly states HPAI refers to the H5N1 virus.
