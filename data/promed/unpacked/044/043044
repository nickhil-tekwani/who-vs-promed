Listeria grayi is not recognized as a pathogen of horses or of
any other domestic animal to my knowledge. We have never recovered
it from any cases seen in this state's diagnostic lab
system. The species of Listeria (primarily monocytogenes) that
are pathogens of livestock are generally thought of as infecting
animals from an environmental source, not direct transmission
from animal to animal.
The reference texts I checked also did not indicate that
L. grayi was recognized as a pathogen of humans. Was this
isolate hemolytic (as most recognized pathogens are) or
non-hemolytic? Also L. grayi is mannitol positive, whereas
the common pathogens (L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii)
are mannitol negative. I hope this information is of some help.

It would be fascinating to know how many blood cultures were positive
and what system was used for detection. How was the organism
identified at the microbiological level? Some of the biochemical
reactions are potentially similar to L. monocytogenes particularly if
a commercial identification strip is used.
