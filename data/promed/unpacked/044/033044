[The number of yellow fever (YF) cases and states reporting those cases continue to increase. The previous report stated that as of [Tue 7 Nov 2017], the case count reached 179 suspected with 38 confirmed, with 3 states reporting confirmed cases and 7 states reporting suspected cases. The above report indicates that as of [Tue 21 Nov 2017] the number of suspected cases has grown to 276, with 66 of 133 blood samples positive from 4 states for YF. The earlier report stated that vaccination campaigns were planned. Vaccination is urgent to prevent rapid spread. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control previously indicated that it deployed a national rapid response team to conduct extensive outbreak investigations and surveillance for acute jaundice syndrome in the country. The above report does not indicate what that team has found. If this is an _Aedes aegypti_ transmitted YF outbreak, that is worrisome because the outbreak could easily get out-of-hand if an aggressive vaccination effort is not initiated.
