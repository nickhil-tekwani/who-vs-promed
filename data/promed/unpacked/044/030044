Agricultural agency seeking honey tainted with antibiotic
-------------------------
The state's Agriculture Department will be hitting the honey today,
checking for a restricted antibiotic. Their search could stretch beyond the
basic jars to any product with a sprinkling of honey.
Agriculture inspectors will initially go into stores looking for honey
imported from China or Thailand to make sure it has been tested for the
antibiotic, and to tell sellers to get it tested if it has not been. A
sample has been found containing the banned drug in a Baton Rouge,
Louisiana store.
In the coming weeks, all products containing honey sold in Louisiana will
need either proof that they didn't come from China or Thailand or a clean
bill of health for the antibiotic chloramphenicol, state Agriculture
Commissioner Bob Odom said. If they don't have it, they can't be sold. That
could affect the sale of products such as granola bars, cereal, and snack
crackers flavored with honey, he said. "When we look at everything that's a
possibility, it's just mind-boggling," Odom said.
The antibiotic is the same one that Odom has had his agents checking for in
Chinese crawfish and shrimp this spring, citing consumer safety fears, and
honey regulations are about the same as the crawfish and shrimp rules. A
New Orleans doctor, however, questions whether the trace amounts of the
antibiotic in question pose any real threat to consumers.
Spurred by a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration bulletin, Odom has
issued an emergency regulation requiring that all honey imported from China
and Thailand be sampled and tested for chloramphenicol before it can be
sold. That includes honey from producers that mix domestic and imported
honey. Odom's testers have already found a honey sample in Baton Rouge that
tested positive for chloramphenicol, one of 8 jars sampled, and that
prompted the emergency regulation.
They tracked it back to the producer that packaged it, and found the 2
55-gallon drums of Thailand honey they tested contained chloramphenicol.
The name of the store where the tainted honey sample was found was not
released.
The FDA recently issued a bulletin calling on its district offices to
consider sampling honey -- primarily from China, but also from Argentina,
India, Mexico, Thailand and Vietnam.
The FDA has prohibited chloramphenicol use in producing food in the USA,
because of concerns about the potential for serious blood disorders in
humans. The bulletin notes that the incidence of bad reactions to the
antibiotic is low, even in the rare cases where it is used as medication
for humans. The amounts of the antibiotic found in food have been in levels
far lower than would be used in medication, but no minimum dosage level for
adverse reactions has been set.
The FDA has set a zero-tolerance policy for foods containing
chloramphenicol, which effectively translates into a maximum level of 1
part per billion.
Chloramphenicol is used in some countries to control disease in shrimp,
crawfish, and bees. The state Agriculture Lab has found concentrations in
shrimp and crawfish ranging up to 20 parts per billion. The Agriculture
Department this spring held about 2 million pounds of crawfish and shrimp
off the market for testing, but has released all but 300 000 pounds for sale.
Odom said he does not want to stop the sale of honey or honey products in
the state, but he has to be able to use that threat to make sure companies
using Chinese or Thai honey comply with testing rules. The highest
concentration the lab found in the 3 honey samples was 5.46 parts per billion.
New Orleans Dr. Brobson Lutz saw the initial regulation dealing with
chloramphenicol in shrimp and crawfish as a good idea, but not for the
reasons Odom has cited. Trying to zero in on such minute amounts of
chloramphenicol and claim a health risk is not an accurate stance to take,
and hurts Odom's credibility in trying to restrict the products, Lutz said.
Lutz said that chloramphenicol has been shown to have an adverse effect on
1 in 20 000 humans taking it at full prescription strength. He said
concentrations in the parts-per-billion range represent no threat to
humans. Lutz said pushing other countries to stop using chloramphenicol in
animal feed is important to stop the unintentional development of diseases
resistant to antibiotics. That's the real danger, not humans getting blood
diseases from trace amounts of chloramphenicol, Lutz said.

[Chloramphenicol was a commonly used antibacterial agent in the 1950s and,
like other antimicrobials in use today, was not uncommonly used in
situations where no specific antibiotic is required (such as in a viral
respiratory infection). Bone marrow toxicity was recognized to be
associated with chloramphenicol in 2 ways: (1) a dose-dependent reversible
marrow depression that disappears when the drug is stopped and (2) an
idiosyncratic reaction that causes irreversible marrow failure (albeit
quite rarely) that it is not dose-dependent and may occur at quite low drug
levels. It is the latter form that is of concern in this scenario. In my
mind, since chloramphenicol is rarely used currently in the US, the
development of resistance to it is basically moot. It should be noted that
cases of the idiosyncratic reaction have been described following the use
of chloramphenicol eye drops. It is interesting to speculate how the drug
came to contaminate the honey. - Mod.LL]
[In January 2002, chloramphenicol was detected in animal feed in Europe
(see ProMED-mail postings listed below). This contamination was traced to
fish/seafood products coming from the far east. There is a commentary from
the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture on the "Draft Report for the Residue
control in Live Animals and Animal Products
by EC Inspection Mission to China" at
<http://www.agri.gov.cn/english/e02.htm>. In this it mentions that
chloromycetin was discontinued from the Chinese Veterinary Pharmarcopoeia
in 2000. An investigation into the contamination of the shrimp revealed
"The prawn peeling workers had not worn protective gloves in the past,
causing an itchy symptoms on their hands, so some of the workers used
chloromycetin (chloramphenicol) to treat their hands in order to avoid the
itching, and as a result, the prawns were polluted." While testing of
apiaries was mentioned, there was no discussion on contamination of the honey.
In February 2002, the UK Food Standards Agency identified streptomycin and
later chloramphenicol in honey from China.
<http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk/enforcement/alerts/chinhoneyfhw>. This
was also covered in a BBC article on 19 February 2002
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_1829000/1829926.stm>.
In April 2002, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) issued a series
of alerts on chloramphenicol contaminated food products. The list of
potentially contaminated products can be found at:
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/recarapp/2002/honprode.shtml>
(the first alert issued was on 18 April 2002 and can be found
at:
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/recarapp/2002/20020418e.shtml>,
additional alerts and foods were added to the list including an alert on 27
April 2002 identifying honey as the contaminated product
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/recarapp/2002/20020427be.shtml>.
By May 2002, the EU and Canada had banned honey imports from China due to
the chloramphenicol contamination (it had been identified in Germany).
To date, this is the first alert we have come across with respect to the
chloramphenicol contamination of honey imported in the USA. There is an
FDA bulletin <http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fpshrimp.html> released on 14
Jun 2002 discussing increased testing for chloramphenicol contamination of
shrimp from China, but one related to testing of honey for chloramphenicol
contamination could not be found. - Mod.MPP]
