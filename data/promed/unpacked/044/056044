Another child has succumbed to the deadly rabies virus at Rusape General Hospital after being attacked by a rabid dog at her parents' home in St Theresa, Makoni West [Manicaland Province]. Sources at Rusape General Hospital confirmed the death of CM (2) on Wednesday [7 May 2014] as the rabies-related deaths continue to rise in the district.

The minor was attacked by a rabid dog about a month ago [April 2014] and her condition deteriorated on Sunday [4 May 2014] when her parents rushed her to St Theresa Hospital where she was transferred to the district referral hospital. Apart from being infected with the deadly virus, CM sustained injuries which were treated at St Theresa. Her parents were advised to take her to Rusape General Hospital for rabies vaccines, but did not do so after failing to raise money for the doses. The rabies vaccine costs [USD] 35 per dose.

The rabid dog which attacked [the child] is said to be alive and prowling the area, raising rabies scare and serious concerns over the safety of children, who are particularly at higher risk because of their proximity to pets.

"She died this morning. She was exhibiting some schizophrenic behaviour prior to her death. The condition could not be reversed as the rabies had taken long before being treated and was already manifesting," said a source at the hospital. A relative [of the child] who refused to be named blamed St Theresa medical staff for the death of the child. "When she was bitten by the dog, her parents took her to the local hospital where the nurses just treated the wound and told the parents to look for [USD] 80 to take her to the veterinary department for tests to determine whether or not the dog had rabies.

"This scared off her poor parents who opted to stay with her home, yet the correct procedure was to refer the minor to Rusape General Hospital for rabies treatment. They must have assigned an ambulance to transfer her to Rusape because rabies can only be treated within 24 hours," said the source.

The incident came barely a month after 6 pupils from Chigudu Primary School (Chiendambuya) were bitten by rabid dogs prowling the area. The worst attacked victim was a Grade Zero pupil. The victim was admitted at Rusape General Hospital for several days and had his face stitched. Poor implementation of licensing and vaccination of pets are the main reasons for the menace, which need to be addressed immediately. In situations where the owner refuses, the community contacts local law enforcement officials amid consensus that one need not make choices between human life and animal rights when it comes to stray dogs.

Makoni District Medical Officer, Dr Alfred Kumbirai, confirmed the incident and said all victims were treated and discharged. Dr Kumbirai could not take further questions, saying he was on leave. He referred The Manica Post to hospital medical superintendent Dr Tembo, who was not readily available for comment. The Makoni District Veterinary Officer Dr Edwin Kupahwana is on record encouraging the community to eliminate all suspected rabid dogs as they were a danger to the community, especially children.

Rabid animals lose their fear of humans and wander into human dwellings.

[Sometimes we get too used to the numbers and fail to see the human tragedy embedded in them. If treatment with immunoglobulin and vaccine had been initiated soon after this child was attacked, she would be alive and thriving. With family poverty and a weak infrastructure she was condemned to die and in pain from the moment she was bitten.

Rabies is a countrywide problem in Zimbabwe and has been so for some years. There are no hard numbers latterly; OIE merely reported "+" for human cases and deaths from 2009 to 2012; 2008 and 2013 were blank. Gideon listed the following numbers of animals reported with rabies: 2008 (209), 2009 (213), 2010 (234), 2011 (184), 2012 (160), and 2013 (blank); see: http://web.gideononline.com/web/epidemiology/index.php?disease=11950&view=Distribution&country=G305&type=drugs.
