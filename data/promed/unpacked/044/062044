Outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections
-----------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agbeni infections.

On 5 Nov 2018, ConAgra Brands recalled 4 varieties of Duncan Hines cake mix after health officials in Oregon identified _S._ Agbeni in a box of Duncan Hines Classic White Cake Mix. CDC reviewed the PulseNet database and identified 5 infections with the same strain of _S._ Agbeni reported from 3 states. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. Whole genome sequencing (DNA fingerprinting) performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria from ill people in this outbreak showed that the bacteria are closely related genetically. This means that the ill people are more likely to share a common source of infection. Illnesses started on dates from 13 Jun 2018 to 17 Sep 2018. Ill people range in age from 26 to 72 years, with a median age of 30. 60 percent are female. No hospitalizations or deaths have been reported.

State / Ill people
Maryland / 2
Ohio / 2
Wisconsin / 1
------------------
Total 5

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. 2 ill people reported eating cake in the week before their illness began and one reported eating raw cake mix, but brand information was not available. CDC is working with state health departments and FDA to determine if these ill people ate cake or raw cake mix produced by Duncan Hines.

Antibiotic resistance testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System laboratory is currently underway.

Advice to consumers and retailers
---------------------------------
- Do not bake with or eat recalled Duncan Hines cake mix, or eat cake prepared with recalled mix. Throw the mix away or return it to the store for a refund. Recalled products include 15.25 oz. boxes of Duncan Hines cake mix in Classic White, Classic Yellow Cake, Classic Butter Golden Cake, and Confetti Cake flavors, with various "best if used by" dates ranging from 7 to 13 Mar 2019.
- Check the FDA website [https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm625144.htm] for information to identify recalled mixes: a list of "best if used by" dates for each flavor of recalled mix, and product photos.
- Contact a healthcare provider if you think you got sick from eating recalled cake mix.
- Retailers should not sell or serve recalled Duncan Hines cake mixes.

In general, CDC advises against eating any raw dough or batter, whether homemade or from a mix. Raw batter can contain germs that could make you sick.
