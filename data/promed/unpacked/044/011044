Swine pathogens in wild boar in Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis [district]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
An emaciated and obviously very sick wild boar piglet was detected by
gamekeepers shortly after Christmas [2008] in a meadow in Rosrath. The
Rheinisch-Bergische district's veterinary office, which was immediately
contacted, brought the carcass to the veterinary investigation center in
Krefeld. Classical swine fever [CSF] was suspected and subsequently the
sample was forwarded to the central Friedrich-Loeffler Institute on the
island of Riems, where a number of laboratory tests took place. CSF was
eventually confirmed, final results received by the District Veterinary
Office of Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis.

CSF is a fatal viral disease of pigs; the disease is not pathogenic for humans.

The previous CSF outbreaks in wild boars had been recorded in the districts
of Euskirchen and Ahrweiler. This case will lead to a vaccination campaign
of wild boar in the region (by an oral vaccine). The region is very close
to Cologne and is not a pig farming/breeding area, so "damage limitation"
should be possible.

Domestic pigs are susceptible to infection, and holders have been updated
and advised to prevent possible contacts with wild boars. In view of the
increased popularity of mini pigs, kept as pets, their owners -- even in
urban areas -- have been alerted as well. All suspicions should be
immediately reported, the given phone number of the veterinary office in
charge is 02202/13-2815.

Movements of domestic pigs are liable to precautionary restrictions.
Hunters have also been updated, and requested to dispatch samples from
hunted wild boars to the laboratory.

[The following additional information was received from the communicator:
"In the at-risk region of approximately 250 square km [96.5 sq mi] on the
right bank of the river Rhine, there are 24 farms with about 500 pigs,
which are affected by the restrictions, including a larger operation with
about 418 animals.

"In a letter from the Veterinary authorities in Siegburg, hunters from
Troisdorf, Lohmar, and Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been informed the about
the outbreak of CSF and about the applied measures. Prescribed hygiene
measures have to be followed very strictly when hunting because of the
highly infectious pathogen. All parts of carcasses of wild boar are to be
collected and the intestines have to be destroyed.

"The district of Euskirchen across the river Rhine to the left of the
Rhein-Sieg-Kreis has been affected by CSF since 2002. Since then, similar
precautionary measures have been applied for hunters in Rheinbach and
Meckenheim. In the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis, swine fever was last confirmed in 2005.

"According to the paper "Koelnische Rundschau," the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut NRL (National Reference Laboratory) has
confirmed that the current virus is of a type not previously seen in
Germany (see [in German]
<http://www.rundschau-online.de/html/artikel/1231175783116.shtml>)."

We are grateful to Sabine for the additional information above. A German
notification to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) is anticipated.

The Rheinisch-Bergische district (meaning "between the Rhine and the
mountains") is a 438 sq km (169 sq mi) district situated on the eastern
(right) side of the Rhine River, in the south west of the German state of
North Rhine-Westphalia; see maps at
