Yellow fever hits Congo deportees
---------------------------------
Yellow fever (YF) is sweeping through the thousands of Congolese
expelled from Angola, a local official says. At least 10 people have
already died, says the mayor of Lutembo in south-west Democratic
Republic of Congo. The town's hospital, which is chronically short of
medicines, is struggling to cope.

More than 20 000 Congolese diamond miners have been expelled from
Angola in recent weeks. The United Nations is trying to reach the
remote region by helicopter.

Previous mass expulsions in the area were halted by an agreement
between the 2 countries, but with Angola preparing for elections later
this year [2008], correspondents say the authorities are keen to rid
the area of foreigners.

Last year, the 2 countries resolved their border dispute. They have
both experienced years of war, which correspondents say has led to
confusion over their common boundary. The area is rich in oil and diamonds.

[This area is a significant distance from the border with Angola.
While it is also far from Boende, DRC, one cannot help but wonder if
the earlier case of suspected Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Boende might
not be YF -- see ProMED ref. below. - Mod.MPP

Or vice versa -- whether these cases of suspected YF (no lab
confirmation is reported) might be Ebola or Marburg hemorrhagic fever.
- Mod.JW.

Boende is also a significant distance from Lutembo, but should the
Boende case turn out to be YF, not Ebola, it might signal wide-spread
transmission of YF virus in the tropical forests of the DRC.

Unfortunately, neither the numbers of cases over time, dates over
which the YF outbreak among the miners occurred, nor the dates of
their expulsion from Angola are given. It is not possible to determine
if the outbreak began in Angola or if the infections were acquired in
Lutembo, DRC. It is not clear if there are sufficient YF virus vector
populations in Lutembo to sustain an ongoing YF outbreak, nor if an
active vaccination campaign is going on. Additional information about
this outbreak would be appreciated.
