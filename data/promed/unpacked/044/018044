2000/007 Tospoviruses in Argentina [edited
-------------------------------------------
Reports of damage caused by tospoviruses to vegetable crops in Argentina
were sporadically reported in the past. But since 1994, severe outbreaks
have been observed every year in the provinces of Mendoza and Buenos Aires.
The main affected crops are tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_), lettuce
(_Lactuca sativa_) and capsicum (_Capsicum annuum_). During 1994-95, 100%
losses in tomato and lettuce have been reported in several fields. In
capsicum, mean
loss in production was 40% in Buenos Aires Province. Fields were sampled
for tospoviruses from 1994 to 1996 in the provinces of Mendoza and Buenos
Aires. A total of 543 samples of tomato, lettuce and capsicum showing
symptoms were collected and tested by DAS-ELISA. In addition, symptomatic
ornamentals, other vegetable crops (e.g. celery, potato, spinach) and weeds
were tested. Three tospoviruses were shown to be present in Argentina:
groundnut ringspot tospovirus (in 222 samples - 40.8 %), tomato spotted
wilt tospovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest, in 194 samples - 32.7 %) and
tomato chlorotic spot tospovirus (in 50
samples - 14.7 %). These three viruses were also found in vegetable and
ornamentals crops, and in weeds. Mixed infections were not found during
this particular survey, but were observed in later studies. Tomato spotted
wilt tospovirus prevailed in the Buenos Aires Province on tomato, lettuce
and protected capsicum. Groundnut ringspot tospovirus prevailed in the
province of Mendoza on tomato and lettuce. During this survey, impatiens
necrotic
spot tospovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was not detected. Further studies
are required, especially in other provinces of Argentina.

[There are at least 12 distinct tospovirus species in the Bunyaviridae;
three of them occur in Argentina and six are found in Brazil. The
interaction between tospoviruses, cropping systems and environment in South
America may provide some interesting clues on the evolution of new
tospoviruses. -Mod. DH
