I'm sure your subscribers will be aware of a large outbreak of _Salmonella
agona_ infections in the UK a couple of years ago. The source was traced
to kosher snacks prepared in Israel. The observation that the cases were
principally jewish children provided the clue for focussing on an unusual
dietary source.
Is there any similar risk factor in the US outbreak?

[My guess is no similar distinguishing factor was involved. Agona is an
unusual enough serotype that it was noticed and I assume the follow up case
control study simply identified the cereal. But what do I know? I only
moderate the messages we receive. We would very much like to a detailed
description of the outbreak from someone involved. - Mod.PC
[The ProMED-mail reference on Salmonella reports from the UK cited above
makes reference to isolation of this serotype from cottonseed meal. - Mod.ES
