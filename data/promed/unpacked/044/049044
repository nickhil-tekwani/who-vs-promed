At least 15 people have died of [suspected] hepatitis C in a Rajanpur
village over the past month while around 500 more are suffering from
the disease, the residents say. Talking to The Express Tribune, Basti
Jakaani villagers complained that there were no public health
facilities for treatment and diagnosis of hepatitis C in the area.

They alleged that facilities at the Rajanpur district headquarters
(DHQ) hospital were only available through references from influential
people. They said most of them had had to go to private laboratories
for hepatitis C tests, where they were tested positive for the
disease. They said they could not afford the treatment and most of
them returned to the village after getting their test reports. They
said people from nearby villages had refused to come to their village
fearing that they too might get infected by the disease.

Residents said there was no sanitation system in the village and the
only source of drinking water was underground water. They said the
water was contaminated and demanded that the government install a
filtration plant in the village. The casualties from the disease have
included twins born to a woman who has been diagnosed with hepatitis
C. She said she and her babies had tested positive for the disease
over a month ago. She said she could not afford treatment. A
70-year-old woman said she had lost her husband and 2 grandsons to the
disease. District Officer (Health) Dr Musa Kalim expressed ignorance
of a hepatitis C epidemic in the area. He said he would look into the
matter and take action to address the grievances of the Basti Jakaani
villagers.

The District Officer, however, rejected the suggestion that anybody
was declined treatment at the Rajanpur DHQ hospital. He said they had
a hepatitis C unit at the hospital where diagnostic facilities were
available. He said those diagnosed with the disease were given
hepatitis C kits [?] and vaccines [no such vaccine exists - Mod.CP]
and only those in critical condition were admitted at the hospital.

Basti Jakaani [village] was among the Rajanpur villages affected by
the floods in 2010.

[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection
with hepatitis C virus (HCV). It can range in severity from a mild
illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. HCV is
usually spread when blood from a person infected with HCV enters the
body of someone who is not infected. The outbreak in Rajanpur
District, Punjab province of Pakistan, is unlikely to be a result of
HCV infection as poor sanitation and faecal contamination of drinking
water are suggested to be responsible. Hepatitis as a result of
hepatitis A or E virus infection is a more likely explanation, if
indeed the disease is hepatitis.

There are conflicting statements about the availability of diagnostic
tests for hepatitis C. The Rajanpur District Health Officer denies
knowledge of an outbreak of hepatitis C in the district. The diagnosis
of HCV infection was obtained by villagers from unidentified private
laboratories and no treatment was provided. The diagnosis is
questionable in view of the high mortality observed and absence of
information on the diagnostic tests employed. Clarification of the
disease situation in Basti Jakaani village is awaited.
