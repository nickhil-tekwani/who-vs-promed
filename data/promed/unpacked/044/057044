Interesting combination, reading the two postings in ProMED-DIGEST v97.n051
about Brazil's campaign for the eradication of dengue (a temporary measure at
best, judging from history) and Tim Stephenson's definition of an epidemic.
Do I detect a dry wit or two, or have I got it wrong?
Did a senior public officer have to contract the disease before Brazil
decided to attempt the eradication of dengue by eradicating its vector?
Greater minds than mine are convinced that localized eradication of a mobile,
adaptable, highly succesful organism such as _Aedes aegypti_ is a waste of
time. If you can't eliminate this mosquito from the neighbouring
territories, you will run the risk of re-introduction - need we be reminded
that this has already occurred once before in this region of the world. In
fact, that may not even be sufficient as _aegypti_ is still quite capable of
inter-continental spread, whether by introduction of eggs and larvae in used
tyre casings traded between countries, or by the direct importation of adults
in sea-going vessels or aircraft.
Having said all that, something obviously has to be done about Brazil's
dengue epidemic and "source-reduction" (the eradication of _Aedes aegypti_
larval habitats) as espoused by CDC's Dr Duane Gubler (1989) and WHO's Dr
Norman Gratz (1991) amongst others, appears to be the only long-term answer
to keeping _aegypti_ at bay. In the short term, adulticide applications by
ULV may be required, even though ULV applications are notoriously inefficient
for reducing mosquito populations where a large proportion of the mosquitoes
rest inside houses.

Hope this rehash of established comment is of some use.

[Doesn't seem to me that any single method of reducing dengue vectors will
ever be successful. "Top down" or "bottom up" might both be useful, if
education is thrown into the formula. Governmental regulations and
neighborhood volunteers, source reduction, innovative vaccines, and other,
more novel means, will be required. We cannot wait for Ministers of Health
of all countries to get dengue before something is done on a global scale.
Perhaps campaigns to vaccinate everyone in at-risk areas against yellow fever
might provide sufficient immunity to the (very) heterologous dengue viruses
and reduce dengue viremias, thereby reducing the likelihood of transmission
of dengue viruses. I recall President Johnson (Lyndon, not Andrew) promising
"guns and butter" during the Vietnam War. One of the first things to go was
the Aedes Aegypti Eradication Program, after which the US began reexporting
these mosquitoes to areas of Latin America which had been free of them for
some years. Control of dengue will require the concerted effort of
innovative people in all countries at risk. The bottom line is that what has
been tried has not worked or, more likely, what has been suggested has not
been tried.
