[The last livestock outbreak in Slovakia involved 3 cattle in a
single outbreak in 1995. Since then it has been very quiet. Cattle
vaccination petered out around 2000.

In the old Czechoslovak Republic there was a single case in 1988; the
Czechs have not reported any outbreaks since independence in 1993 and
have long not reported any vaccination activity. However, there was a
Slovak human case in 2003, the cause of which was not clear.

This OIE report is classically brief to the point of being all but
uninformative. If any of our members in Slovakia can enlighten us as
to the possible source of this outbreak it would be appreciated. That
7 animals were afflicted is just a simple reflection of this disease
being lost to veterinary memory, awareness, and immediate suspicion
with unexpected deaths. This happens in both branches of medicine,
human and veterinary.

If I were in charge of this outbreak, I would make sure that the
other 113 animals were vaccinated immediately, and that this would be
repeated annually for the next 3 years. A simple and inexpensive
insurance against a resurgence. And to check the neighbouring herds
to make sure that they had not had any unreported deaths in the past
week or so. Farmers like to lean on their fences watching the goings
on next door but silent about events in their own pastures. - Mod.MHJ]
