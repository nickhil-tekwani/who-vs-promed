The Ebola situation is not out of control, the Assistant Director-General for Health Security in the World Health Organization, Keiji Fukuda said.

Dr. Fukuda, who visited the epidemic areas Kailahun and Kenema [in Sierra Leone], said: "I do believe, however, that the situation is urgent and serious. I believe that the right steps have been implemented. It's a matter of more persistence and more work to get a turnaround."

He described Ebola as "a subregional issue, and working with counterparts is very important."

[2] Nigeria (Lagos): prevention

Following the alarming increase in the number of cases and deaths occasioned by the outbreak of Ebola virus disease [EVD] in some of the neighboring West African countries like Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the Lagos state government has stressed the need for members of the public to observe and maintain a high standard of personal and environmental hygiene at all times as part of the precautionary measures to prevent the outbreak of the disease in the state.

These measures, which include washing hands often with soap and water, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and ensuring that objects used by the sick are decontaminated and properly disposed of are necessary in order to reduce the risk of infection, the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris has said.

The Commissioner, who disclosed this in a statement over the weekend, also advised health workers to be on the alert; wear personal protective equipment, observe universal basic precautions when attending to suspected or confirmed cases, and report the same to their Local Government Area or Ministry of Health immediately.

Idris explained that EVD is caused by a virus of which the natural reservoir is not completely known, stressing that fruit bats have been considered to be the natural host of the virus. "EVD is caused by an ebolavirus, and outbreaks occur primarily in villages of Central and West Africa. The virus can be spread through close contact with the blood, body fluids, organs and tissues of infected animals and direct contact with blood, organs or body secretions of an infected person. The transmission of the virus by other animals like monkeys and chimpanzees cannot be ruled out."

Idris noted that those at the highest risk of the disease include health workers and families or friends of an infected person who could be infected in the course of feeding, holding and caring for them. He stressed that Ebola virus disease should be suspected in persons who develop bleeding from the body openings like the mouth, nose, rectum and ear; a close contact of person who is infected; or a health worker who had treated either suspected or confirmed infected persons. The Health Commissioner noted that presently, there is no specific treatment for EVD, stressing that infected persons will need to be admitted into the hospital for specialized care and treated in isolation.

"The Government of Lagos State in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health is putting measures in place to prevent its entry and spread in the country. These measures include sensitization of health workers, active searches for cases of the disease and continuous sensitization of the public," he said.

Health experts have stepped up efforts against the deadly Ebola virus arriving in Scotland with the Commonwealth Games, amid a worsening outbreak in one of the competitor countries.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Health Protection Scotland have instituted "daily monitoring" of the disease as it spreads through west Africa and established links with international medical colleagues in case infection arrives.

Sierra Leone is expected to send 28 athletes and 8 officials to Glasgow this month [July 2014]. The country is in the grip of Africa's biggest outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD), which kills up to 90 percent of those infected and which has no known cure or vaccine.

Recently, around 340 people have been infected in Sierra Leone, and 142 have died. Fatalities have risen 4-fold in the last month.

Last month [June 2014], Health Protection Scotland said it would be monitoring Twitter for people reporting similar symptoms during the Games, which run from 23 Jul to 3 Aug 2014, principally to identify outbreaks of flu, the norovirus vomiting bug, and food poisoning. But NHS staff have also been warned to look out for viral haemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola.

The Brownlee Centre for Infectious and Communicable Diseases at Glasgow's Gartnavel Hospital has been identified as the receiver facility for any suspected Ebola cases.

Ebola is one of 4 rare viral haemorrhagic fevers which can spread person-to-person through direct contact with blood, bodily fluids or contaminated needles.

It can take up to 3 weeks from infection to the onset of symptoms, which include diarrhoea, vomiting and internal and external bleeding.

Games organisers Glasgow 2014, Health Protection Scotland and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said delegates from Sierra Leone would not be treated any differently from other athletes.

In a joint statement, they said: "Based on current advice from the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, we estimate that the risk of a visitor coming from Sierra Leone to Scotland with EVD remains very low. Nevertheless, we are monitoring the situation on a daily basis."

The gaps in Sierra Leone's health system reflect need for support so that such diseases do not wreak havoc in the future.

The role of the international community in current crises in the Central African Republic and northern Nigeria may be mired in confusion, but it can do something about the Ebola virus disease [EVD] epidemic in west Africa. The outbreak of the virus, which started in Guinea and has spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone, is the deadliest in recorded history, with Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring the situation out of control. There are more than [800] cases across 60 sites since the 1st ones were confirmed in March [2014]; that's almost 50 known cases per week and a 20 percent increase in cases since 23 Jun 2014. [More than] 500 people have died from the disease, which has spread across international borders.

Ebola has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent [30-60 percent in the current epidemic]; once you have it, your chances of survival may be just one in 10. There is no vaccine and no cure; the only way to stop the virus is to prevent it or treat the symptoms if diagnosed early enough. It is primarily spread by contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person and in some cases by contact with dead animals (primarily monkeys and bats) which are infected.

But here is where the international community can help. The health systems in west African countries are weak: 3 countries ranked 174 (Liberia), 177 (Sierra Leone) and 178 (Guinea) out of 186 countries for human development, according to the UN development programme. So, one of the world's most deadly viruses is plaguing 3 of the countries least equipped to cope with it.

In Sierra Leone, I have been involved in a 2-year research programme to prevent malnutrition. This has involved spending time at some of the government-run peripheral health units (PHUs) in northern Sierra Leone, on the border with Guinea. The PHUs are the frontline of healthcare, assuming, of course, you can reach one of the 1228 clinics across the country (one community we visited is a 6-km walk from the nearest PHU). When access to state health services is limited, locals often turn to traditional healers, who sometimes misdiagnose EVD and treat it as a curse.

The PHUs are critical in providing immunisations, malaria treatment, delivering babies, providing free medical care to pregnant and lactating mothers and children under 5, but they are not without serious problems. Staff often lack good, quality training, partly because they tend to learn through cascade models, where one person might train 10 others, who in turn train 10 more, and so on, operating like a system of Chinese whispers with all the potential miscommunication this can involve.

There is a high turnover of PHU staff owing to poor working conditions: for example, nurses earn just USD 55 (GBP 32) per month, roughly USD 1.80 per day, meaning that new, untrained staff are commonly found at the frontline of Sierra Leone's healthcare system. A lack of quality training means staff are not always equipped to deliver appropriate healthcare messages or treatment. In fact, such professionals make up a large number of those who have died in the Ebola outbreak, having failed to take precautions in dealing with infected patients. The PHUs often face shortages of equipment and medicine.

To bring the virus under control, countries need more help from external partners. In the immediate term, emergency humanitarian support is needed to treat those infected and prevent further cases; MSF says it has reached its limit and that a massive deployment of resources is required. If donors and individuals want to support aid that shows tangible results in relatively short timeframes, supporting the response to the Ebola virus seems a good option that could save potentially thousands of lives.

In the longer term, support must focus on building the capacities of national health and sanitation systems to respond to emergencies and prevent such unnecessary loss of life. Ebola is not the 1st disease to wreak havoc in this region. Less than 2 years ago, Guinea and Sierra Leone faced a cholera outbreak that killed 392 people.

Prevention might be better than cure, but it is also much harder to build capacity to do this. This is because preventative capacity is not only about technical knowledge, but about how well the different parts of health and sanitation systems work together and interact with local dynamics, such as preference for traditional healers or stigma, for example. Building this capacity to prevent future health emergencies is a long-term endeavour that becomes more critical with each epidemic in the region.

[The prevention activities of countries that may be at risk from the importation of EVD cases are commendable.

What makes this EVD epidemic different from previous ones in Africa is the combination of traditional burial practices involving washing the body, belief in an occult cause of the disease, and distrust of foreign health personnel and the prevention messages being spread by the government. Injection of more expatriate personnel is really not going to solve those problems, unless a country runs out of nationals able to work in the isolation hospitals.

It is noteworthy that not a single expatriate professional who arrived to work in the 3 countries since the epidemic was declared in March 2014 has died from EVD, and some of them have helped in several previous EVD outbreaks.

However, large quantities of personal protective equipment (PPE) are needed immediately to protect those national health workers and border guards brave enough to wear it and continue working, and disposable gloves are needed for mourners who want to continue the traditional burial rituals. - Mod.JW
