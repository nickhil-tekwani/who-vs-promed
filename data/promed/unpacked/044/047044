SORGHUM ERGOT (02)

In mid-1995, the sugary disease of sorghum due to _Claviceps
africana_ was found in commercial forage and hybrid seed production
fields in Brazil (Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Goias). The disease
rapidly reached all the central and southern parts of the country.
This was the first report of _C. africana_ in the Americas. Ergot
fungi causing sugary disease (it now seems that _C. africana_ is
considered as distinct from _C. sorghi_) were previously only
reported from Africa and Asia. The rapid dissemination of sugary
disease in Brazil is of major concern to other counties of the
region. The disease affects individual florets in a panicle,
causing poor development of grain or preventing development.
Symptoms are characterized by the presence of sticky, pinkish to
brownish liquid drops, which exude from infected ovaries. A
saprophytic fungus may then overgrow the honeydew and convert it
into a sticky black mat. The sugary disease can cause severe
losses especially in seed production fields, and particularly if
pollination of male-sterile lines is delayed due to lack of viable
pollen. Sclerotia of the sugary disease fungus have not been
reported to be toxic to humans or animals unlike the European ergot
pathogen _C. purpurea_.
