Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar: _Sus scrofa_ (Suidae) / - / 1 / - / - / -

The domestic population remains free of AujeszkyÂ´s disease. All domestic pigs kept outdoors in Finland are protected from contact with wild boars by double-fencing.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Finnish Food Authority (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result

["Aujeszky's disease results from infection by suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV-1), which is also known informally as Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) or pseudorabies virus. This virus is a member of the genus _Varicellovirus_ and family Herpesviridae (subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae). Viral variants that emerged in China in 2011 have significant genetic differences from other SuHV-1 strains that circulate worldwide. Diverse SuHV-1 strains are maintained in wild boar and feral swine. These viruses may differ from those circulating among domesticated suids in the same region. At least some of the SuHV-1 strains found in wild suids in the United States and Europe appear to be relatively attenuated for pigs, though not necessarily for other species.

Members of the family Suidae are the natural hosts for SuHV-1. Animals known to maintain this virus include domesticated pigs (_Sus scrofa domesticus_), wild boar (various subspecies of _Sus scrofa_) and feral pigs, which may be either domesticated pigs or crosses between these animals and wild boar. Nearly all other mammals are also thought to be susceptible to infection, but as dead-end hosts.

Clinical signs do not occur in humans. Seroconversion has been reported, but there is no evidence that the virus replicates significantly or is shed from people.

SuHV-1 is known to occur in parts of Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. This virus is absent from a few countries (e.g., Australia, Greenland), and it has been eradicated from domesticated swine in other countries, including many European nations, the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Japan. However, the virus is still present in the U.S., Europe and Japan." Source: http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/aujeszkys_disease.pdf. - Mod.CRD
