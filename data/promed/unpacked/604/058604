After a year without any outbreaks of bovine anthrax in the Surveillance Area for Rural Anthrax in the Province of Buenos Aires -- a first after 40 years of surveillance, 1977-2017 -- today [1 Mar 2018] we must announce an outbreak in the municipality of Paraje Muñoz, Laprida county, in said province. A herd of 90 Aberdeen Angus cattle was affected with 10 sudden deaths with extravasation of blood from natural openings (mouth, anus, vagina). The estancia veterinarian submitted a metatarsal for diagnosis and _Bacillus anthracis_ was cultured from it. The culture was sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, florfenicol, and ciprofloxacine, and resistant to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. No persons involved were infected, and the carcasses were covered by tarpaulins, following the standard procedure of "Tarpado Controlado" as laid down by SENASA [National Food Safety and Quality Service] regulations and intervention, and the provincial livestock directions. In spite of the present regulations of compulsory livestock vaccination this herd has not been vaccinated.

It happens and we saw the same in the Dakotas (USA) in spite of a lot of advice by the state extension veterinarian. The good news is that this exceptional outbreak can be used as an example of what happens when you don't vaccinate your cattle. 10 animals died! And one can name names too. And rural gossip will do the rest. This herd and its neighbours, just in case, will have to be vaccinated. Ramón tells me that they have been subjected to a severe drought with elevated temperatures. This would have reduced the innate resistance of the cattle allowing a smaller dose to be infective. But with dry weather the fly density will be low. Dry weather restricts the grazing to the areas with some residual soil moisture and some vegetation. Ecologically such areas have the ability to collect anthrax spores.

The 'Tarpado controlado' technique involves thickly covering the carcass in lime and overall a thick plastic tarpaulin, weighted around its edges to stop foxes gaining entry, which they like doing. After 9 months the tarpaulin is removed, and the hide and bones taken for incineration elsewhere. - MOD.MHJ
