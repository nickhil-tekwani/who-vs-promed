A severe viral outbreak in New Jersey has left 6 children dead and sickened 12 others, the state Health Department said [Tue 23 Oct 2018].

The illness was traced to the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Passaic County. The center for "medically fragile children" serves as a nursing home, a rehab center and a pediatric center with short and long term care.

Roughly 18 cases of adenovirus - a typically mild viral infection - have been confirmed at the treatment facility. The strain afflicting the children is usually associated with acute respiratory illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"Unfortunately, the particular strain of adenovirus [type 7] in this outbreak is affecting medically fragile children with severely compromised immune systems," the department said. "The combination of a worse strain of adenovirus together with a fragile population has led to a more severe outbreak."

Adenovirus is usually pretty mild, but it can pose a threat to people with immune system issues. The health department says the strain seems to be associated with communal living facilities. "It can cause pretty much like a common cold type of illness in the majority of the population," said Dr. Waleed Javaid, of Mt. Sinai Hospital. He added that if someone's immune system is compromised a minor cold can turn into something much worse.

The Health Department didn't release the ages of the victims or address the severity of the illness in the other dozen cases.

"In these kids, the virus just can go rampant because the immune system is not working properly," said CBS News medical correspondent Dr. John LaPook. "So you can get severe pneumonia, you can need a breathing tube, you can get hepatitis -that's inflammation of the liver - you could have meningitis -inflammation of the brain - and infections in other parts of the body."

The 6 deaths happened this month [October 2018], according to Health Department spokeswoman Donna Leusner.

An investigative team was at the center [Tue 16 Oct 2018] and [Sun 20 Oct 2018] and found "minor handwashing deficiencies," the Health Department said.

The union representing at least 70 registered nurses at the center also said there had been staffing shortages that may have led to poor infection control practices.

Last year [2017], inspectors cited the center for poor infection control as well.

Adenoviruses are typically spread through close personal contact, coughing, sneezing, and touching a surface with adenovirus on it before touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.

The center was instructed by the Health Department not to admit any new patients while there is an "ongoing outbreak investigation" underway at the facility in Haskell.

New Jersey health officials are continuing to investigate the severe viral outbreak at a New Jersey pediatric center. And while many questions remain, here is what we do know so far about the deadly virus that has killed at least 6 children, as well as [about] the facility where it all occurred.

How many kids have died from the virus outbreak? How many are ill?

The New Jersey Department of Health is investigating 18 cases of adenovirus among pediatric residents at the Wanaque Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing in Haskell, Passaic County, which officials said included "very ill children," some of whom were on ventilators and had trachea tubes. A total of 6 of these cases have resulted in fatalities.

What is adenovirus?

Adenovirus illnesses can mimic symptoms of the flu and common cold. But this group of viruses is something else entirely. Adenoviruses often attack the respiratory tract and tend to affect infants and children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Illnesses from the virus are usually mild and people typically recover in a matter of days. But because symptoms can appear so similar to the flu and common cold, it can be tricky to diagnose.
Though less common, in some cases, infections from adenovirus can be potentially life-threatening, particularly those with weakened immune systems.

What kind of facility is the Wanaque Center? Why were children there?

The Wanaque Center is a 227-bed, for-profit facility that serves as an adult nursing home and rehabilitation center for short- and long-term care, and also works with "medically fragile" children. A state health department spokeswoman said they included "very ill children, who are on ventilators and have trachea tubes," who have compromised immune systems and have been at the facility for years.

How does the virus usually spread?

Adenovirus outbreaks often occur when there are many people in close quarters, like at a medical facility. According to the CDC, adenoviruses are usually spread from an infected person to others through:
- Close personal contact (touching or shaking hands).
- Coughing and sneezing.
- Touching an object or surface with adenoviruses on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands.

Statement on adenovirus at Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, Department of Health, State of New Jersey
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health today [Tue 23 Oct 2018] is confirming 18 cases of adenovirus among pediatric residents at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell. Of these 18 cases, there have unfortunately been 6 deaths of pediatric residents.

The facility has been instructed not to admit any new patients until the outbreak ends and they are in full compliance.

A Department team is at the facility today and an inspection team was also there [Sun 21 Oct 2018]. The team on [Sun 21 Oct 2018] found minor handwashing deficiencies and the Health Department is continuing to work closely with the facility on infection control issues.

This is an ongoing outbreak investigation. Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that often cause mild illness, particularly in young children.

Unfortunately, the particular strain of adenovirus [type 7] in this outbreak is affecting medically fragile children with severely compromised immune systems. The strain has been particularly associated with disease in communal living arrangements and can be more severe.

Statement from Governor Phil Murphy on Adenovirus Outbreak at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I am heartbroken by the news that several children have lost their lives in an adenovirus outbreak at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, and pray for the full recovery of the other children impacted. I have been briefed by Dr. Elnahal, who has assured me that the Department of Health has recommended vital measures to enhance protections against the further spread of infection and will continue its active on-site surveillance. I am confident that the steps being taken by state and local officials will minimize the impact to all those who remain at the facility, including patients and employees."

The Latest on a fatal viral outbreak in New Jersey (all times local):
---------------------------------------------------------------------
5:40 PM
Health officials say the 1st symptoms associated with the deadly viral outbreak at nursing facility in northern New Jersey showed up on [Wed 26 Sep 2018], 2 weeks before the state was notified of an outbreak.

State health officials were notified [Tue 9 Oct 2018] of the adenovirus infections at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation.

But state health commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal told a news conference [Wed 24 Oct 2018] that it's always difficult to know exactly when an actual outbreak begins.

A total of 7 patients, mostly children, have died this month [October 2018] as a result of being infected with the virus; 11 others are recovering.

The health commissioner says that all the infections occurred in the facility's respiratory, or ventilator unit.

Some pediatric patients at the rehab center have been there most or all of their lives.

4:50 PM
The head of a New Jersey nurses union says staff nurses at a rehab center where a viral outbreak has killed 7 patients complained about staffing shortages, which they say might lead to poor infection control.

Deborah White is president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union. She says in a statement that the 70 nurses represented by the union are working to contain the spread of the adenovirus at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation "under difficult circumstances". She notes what the nurses say are dangerous staffing shortages.

At least 18 pediatric patients at the facility were infected with the adenovirus that as of [Wed 24 Oct 2018] evening had killed 7 people, including many children and at least one young adult.

The facility's 2016 inspection noted a shortage of clinical nursing assistants that ranged from about 6 to 12% of the needed coverage during several days of monitoring in March [2016]. Later inspections did not note the problem.

1:40 PM
New Jersey's health commissioner says it's unlikely a viral outbreak at a pediatric rehabilitation center that left 7 "medically fragile" people dead will pose a wider threat.

Dr. Shereef Elnahal said in an interview with the Associated Press on [Wed 24 Oct 2018] that he doesn't "see a major outbreak risk in the community". He says that's because the adenovirus that infected at least 18 pediatric patients at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, in Haskell, commonly results in only mild illnesses among people with healthy immune systems.

The health department says most of those who died were under 18 [years-old]. At least one is a young adult. Health officials had been describing all those infected as children, which is the way the health facility describes its pediatric patients even though it says some are as old as 22 [years].

Federal inspectors over the past few years found isolated violations of rules governing infection control.

9:30 AM
Another child has died following a severe viral outbreak at a New Jersey rehabilitation center for "medically fragile children," bringing the death toll to 7.

There have been 18 cases overall of adenovirus at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell, about 30 mi (approx. 50 km) northwest of New York, the state Health Department said. The 227-bed, for-profit facility cares for children and elderly residents.

The agency had said [Tue 23 Oct 2018] that 6 children had died this month [October 2018]. But the center said it learned [Tue 23 Oct 2018] night that another child had died.

The strain afflicting the children is usually associated with acute respiratory illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which on its website instructs health workers to report unusual clusters to state or local health departments.

The Health Department hasn't released the names or the ages of the victims.

[Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) commonly cause infections in children, including epidemic pharyngoconjunctival fever. In adults, HAdVs, particularly types 4 and 7, have caused respiratory infections with considerable morbidity in closed populations, such as in military recruit camps. For some adenovirus serotypes, the clinical spectrum of disease associated with infection varies depending on the site of infection; for example, infection with adenovirus 7 acquired by inhalation is associated with severe lower respiratory tract disease, whereas oral transmission of the virus typically causes no or mild disease [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/bathing/recreadischap6.pdf].

The above reports are indicating a health care facility outbreak due to Adenovirus type 7 [HAdV7] in immunocompromised children with severe disease and fatal outcomes [https://www.jwatch.org/na46465/2018/04/06/severe-adenovirus-type-7-respiratory-infection].

HAdV7 transmission generally occurs through respiratory droplets and close contact, which can lead to rapid and widespread infection. Large community and regional outbreaks of acute respiratory disease with an increased incidence of severe and fatal outcomes caused by HAdV7 have been described in Europe and Asia [1-2]. Nosocomial control of HAdV7 transmission is another challenge faced by health care centers. Thus, control of HAdV7 spread is crucial. However, it is difficult to differentiate pneumonia caused by HAdVs from other types of viral pneumonia, and detection and typing of HAdVs are not routinely performed in hospitals.

There are no approved antiviral treatment options for HAdV infections, and a vaccine against HAdV-7 and HAdV-4 is available only to military personnel. Early efforts to develop a vaccine by growing the virus in monkey tissue culture led to contamination with simian papovavirus (SV-40) and production of a HAdV-SV-40 hybrid virus, fortunately without apparent human pathobiology. Clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of HAdV infection in communal populations and report such outbreaks to local and national public health authorities.
