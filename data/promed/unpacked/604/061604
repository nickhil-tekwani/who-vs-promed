The permanent secretary for the Ministry of Health, Dr Salanieta
Saketa says anyone with a fever and rash or anyone who thinks they may
have rubella should visit their nearest health centre and avoid all
contact with pregnant women. She confirmed there were a total of 28
confirmed cases of rubella, of which 26 were males from the greater
Suva area, and added that the ages of these victims ranged between 18
to 32 years.

Rubella is an infectious viral illness of humans whose infections in
children and adults are mostly mild, but an infection in women during
the early stages of pregnancy can cause serious birth defects or
miscarriage.

The infection is spread by coming into close contact with people who
have rubella, particularly if they are coughing or sneezing, and
symptoms include a mild fever, rash, runny nose, sore throat and often
swollen lymph nodes. Aching joints are also common says Dr Saketa.

"If a pregnant woman has a rash and fever or thinks she may have
rubella, she should inform her clinic doctor as soon as possible. It
is important to let the staff at the clinic know immediately so they
can keep you away from other pregnant women."

In Fiji, women born after 1964 were immunised against rubella at 11
years of age, but from 2004 onwards, all children were immunised
against rubella when they were one-year old and again with a combined
measles-rubella vaccine when they reached class one. Dr Saketa says
the primary goal of the immunisation program is to prevent congenital
rubella syndrome, as rubella infection in pregnant women during the
1st 3 months of pregnancy can result in the baby being born with birth
defects or congenital rubella syndrome. "These birth defects include
heart defects, deafness, brain damage, and eye problems including
cataracts," Dr Saketa added.

[Since 2 Aug 2011, the number of confirmed cases of rubella (German
measles) in Fiji has more than doubled from 11 to 28. Two of the
original 11 cases were female, whereas all of the newly confirmed 17
cases are male. The ages of the 2 female cases has not been revealed.

Rubella infection is a comparatively mild infection in children and
adults and has been a vaccine-preventable disease for many years. Its
significance is that it may cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
If a woman is infected with rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has
a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This may
cause the death of the fetus, or alternatively CRS. CRS causes many
birth defects. Deafness is the most common outcome, but CRS can also
cause defects in the eyes, heart and brain. Information on rubella and
CRS and global statistics on rubella vaccine uptake (up to 2009) can
be accessed at the WHO website
(http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/rubella/en/index.html).
