1st Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by _Leveillula taurica_ on Tomato
and Pepper in Bolivia. J. C. Correll, M. I. Villarroel, and P. J.
McLeod, Department of Plant Pathology and Entomology, University of
Arkansas, Fayetteville; and M. I. Cazon, and C. Rivadeneria,
Universidad Autonoma "Gabriel Rene Moreno" Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Plant
Dis. 89:776, 2005; published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0776A.
Accepted for publication 2 Apr 2005.

Chlorotic and necrotic lesions typical of powdery mildew caused by
_L. taurica_ were observed in several tomato (_Lycopersicon
esculentum_) and pepper (_Capsicum annuum_) fields in Santa Cruz
State, Bolivia near the town of Mairana during September 2004. The
tomato cultivars affected were Santa Clara, Superman, and Cool 45.

Symptoms included bright yellow chlorotic lesions or brown necrotic
lesions on different-age leaves. Examination of samples collected
from several fields revealed sporulation of _L. taurica_ on abaxial
leaf surfaces. The fungus had branched conidiophores, a tapered or
pyriform apical conidium, with other conidia being more cylindrical
(1,2). Conidial size was approximately 60 x 18 micrometers. Only the
_Oidiopsis_ stage was observed.

Disease severity was high and caused a significant amount of leaf
necrosis and partial defoliation on tomato. Only sporadic lesions
were observed on pepper cv. YoloWonder and no significant foliar
damage was observed.

The growing region receives approximately 75 mm of rainfall annually,
with most of the rainfall occurring between October and April. Thus,
powdery mildew was observed near the end of the normal 5-month dry
season. It is likely that the disease has been in the region for some
time based on observations from field personnel.

Although reported from several other South American countries, to our
knowledge, this is the 1st report of this disease in Bolivia.

[Usually _Oidiopsis taurica_ Salmon (Syn._ Oidiopsis sicula_ Scalia)
is found in its imperfect form, _Oidiopsis taurica_ [Ot]. It was
identified as the causal agent of a powdery mildew disease occurring
on distinct Allium species in Brazil. This disease was initially
observed in plastic house and field-grown garlic (_Allium sativum_)
and leek (_A. porrum_) accessions in Brasilia (Federal District) and
in field-grown and greenhouse onion (_A. cepa_) cultivars in Belem do
Sao Francisco (Pernambuco State) and Brasilia, respectively. Typical
Ot symptoms consisted of chlorotic areas on the leaf surface
corresponding to a fungal colony. These lesions turn to a brownish
color with the progress of the disease. Fungal morphology was similar
to that described for Ot. Endophytic mycelium emerging through
estomata, light pale conidia were dimorphic (lanceolate primary
conidia and somewhat cylindrical secondary conidia), fibrosin bodies
were absent, conidia formed predominantly single (not!
in chains), and appressoria were non-lobed. Its sexual stage,
_Leveillula taurica_ (Lev.) Arnaud, was not observed. Inoculations
were performed with the Ot isolates from distinct _Allium_ hosts.
These isolates were also pathogenic to sweet pepper and tomato,
indicating an apparent absence of host specialization. One bunching
onion (_A. fistulosum_) accession was not infected by Ot, suggesting
that this species might carry useful resistance alleles to this
pathogen. This is the 1st formal report of a powdery mildew disease
on species of the genus _Allium_ in Brazil. Ot might become important
on these vegetable crops, especially in hot and dry areas such as
those in the Central and Northeast regions of Brazil.

Genetic resistance is not well documented, but susceptible tomato
cultivars are available. Since Ot also infects other hosts (e.g.,
eggplant and tobacco, weed hosts such as nightshade), scouting of
these hosts can be helpful to identify potential sources of inoculum.
Chemical control is targeted at eradication of existing infections
and protection of healthy tissues. Once disease is detected, the 1st
sprays should be aimed at eradication. These are usually followed by
sprays for protection. Eradicant sprays should be applied as soon as
symptoms are first observed since early control is critical. Monitor
and rotate the types of compounds used to avoid development of
fungicide resistance in the powdery mildew population. Among the
compounds registered for use are azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil,
bicarbonates, cupric hydroxide, sulfur, and paraffinic
(horticultural) oils.
