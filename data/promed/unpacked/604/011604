A suspected, imported case of Lassa fever has been reported from the United
Kingdom. A 50-year-old British national working in Daru, Sierra Leone
became ill with fever on 21 February and was airlifted to Freetown. He
remained unwell, and on 5 March was evacuated to the UK by air ambulance.
He was admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, London, and then
transferred to Coppetts Wood Hospital, where he is being managed in high
security isolation facilities.
Lassa fever is suspected on the basis of clinical findings and preliminary
test results. Tests for other known viral haemorrhagic fevers have so far
proved negative. Confirmatory tests for Lassa fever are in progress at the
Enteric and Respiratory Virus Laboratory, Central Public Health Laboratory,
London, and the results are expected within 24 hours. More than 90
potential contacts of this patient have been identified, both in Sierra
Leone and the UK. All have been contacted and are being monitored.

[(1) Another report, this one via George Robertson and Martha Cosgriff,
indicated the patient had been working for the Department for International
Development in a remote rural area, helping former soldiers return to
civilian life after the country's civil war. Apparently, the patient is
being treated with an anti-viral drug. Attending physicians said he had
improved at first but on Sunday his lungs began to fail and he was placed
on a ventilator.
The report also said, among other things: Lassa fever is a viral
haemorrhagic fever is spread by rats but can also be transmitted by direct
contact with bodily fluids. There have been 12 cases of Lassa fever
imported to Europe and North America since 1970, with none resulting in
further infection of other medical staff or patients. The disease carries a
death rate of 15-20% among those taken to hospital. William Weir, a
consultant in infectious and tropical disease, who is treating the man,
said: "He is critically ill. I spoke to his wife yesterday and she is
understandably upset. In situations like this we have to be completely
truthful with relatives and tell them exactly what the patient's future
contains."
The hospital said there was no danger of the virus spreading to the public
but doctors, nurses, porters and ambulance staff were being interviewed
about their contact with the patient and some would be kept under
surveillance for signs of the disease so treatment could be started
immediately if they became ill.
A spokeswoman for the Royal Free NHS Trust, which runs Coppetts Wood, said:
"His status [as a carrier of an infectious tropical disease] was not clear
when he came in." Patients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases were in
"minimal" danger of being infected, she said, because the patient had been
kept in an isolation room. "This unit regularly deals with very sick
patients, and so the hygiene and infection control regimens are very
strict. The likelihood of anyone at the hospital being exposed to the
infection is minimal."
Lassa fever's incubation period is between three and 21 days and typical
symptoms are soaring temperature (up to 41C or 106F) headache, lethargy and
muscular pains. There is also often a rash caused by bleeding into the skin
and mucous membranes. In the latest case, the man developed a nose bleed
which, with the results of blood tests, caused doctors to suspect Lassa fever.

The diagnosis of Lassa fever has now been confirmed:

The patient 's condition is reported to have improved slightly, but he
remains seriously ill. Monitoring of close contacts is continuing, and will
be carried out through the potential incubation period of the illness.
(3) Dan Shapiro and I had the same thought, that a single case of Lassa
fever, in a resident of a major industrialized country receives more media
hype than many cases of Marburg in developing countries. - Mod. CHC]
