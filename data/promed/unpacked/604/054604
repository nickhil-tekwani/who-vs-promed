[1] USA: embargo delays Cuban Ebola doctors pay

Cuba had to cover food and lodging expenses for dozens of its doctors fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone after the US embargo delayed payments from the World Health Organization (WHO), Luis Di Fabio, the WHO representative for Cuba, told The Associated Press news agency on Fri 12 Dec 2014.

It had to request special licenses from the US Treasury Department to transfer money to the doctors in Africa. The licenses were eventually granted, and the Cuban government-employed doctors only recently received payments dating as far back as October [2014], he said.

Di Fabio said there were relatively minor delays in opening accounts for the doctors in Guinea and Liberia, but those have been resolved.

[We have read about non-payment of salaries for local health workers in the 3 countries, but it is unexpected to hear that some international aid workers have not been paid for months. Cuban doctors get the equivalent of USD 70 per month back home, but were to receive USD 250 per month for food and accommodation in West Africa.

The Cuban doctors in Guinea have not yet been deployed because they do not speak French, and only 2 interpreters are available for their in-country training; see ProMED post Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (49): Cuba, liability, Emory case notes, susp. 20141210.3025601. - Mod.JW]

[2] USA: Better safe suits (Personal Protective Equipment)

For health-care workers taking care of Ebola patients in West Africa, one of the biggest logistical problems has been the "moon suits" they must wear to protect against being infected by the deadly virus. The suits are hot. Taking them off is a meticulous, multistep process that can leave no room for error. Now, a protective suit designed by a team from Johns Hopkins has been chosen as one of the winners in a global competition for solutions to increase the protection and comfort of front-line workers battling Ebola. The competition was launched in early October [2014] by the U.S. Agency for International Development [UDAID], the lead agency coordinating the U.S. government Ebola response.

The suit is easier to take off, and has a small battery-powered source to cool the user by blowing air into the hood, said Youseph Yazdi, executive director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Bioengineering Innovation & Design. If major manufacturers sign on, Yazdi and U.S. officials hope a version of the new protective suit could be on the ground within a few months.

The goal of the competition was to come up with solutions that could get into the field as quickly as possible without costing a lot of money. So the team used the same lightweight material that major manufacturers are currently using. But they redesigned it so the hood and the rest of the suit are attached. And they re-positioned a zipper from the front to the back of the suit. They reconfigured the zipper with pull tabs that allow the wearer to unzip easily, so the suit essentially peels away. As a result, "when you want to remove the garment, the zipper opens, so the doffing process goes from 20 steps down to 5 or 6 and goes from minutes and minutes down to a few seconds," he said. "You don't need a buddy to help you. You don't have to touch the hood or grab around your face. It's quick and a lot safer," said Yazdi. The prototype also uses a large clear visor in the hood, making it easier for front-line workers to see [and for patients to see there is a person in there - Mod.JW].

To keep workers cool, the prototype uses a battery pack on the belt, about the size of a runner's fanny pack. It blows dry, filtered air into the hood. It doesn't have to be cool air, Yazdi said (that would have cost more and been more complicated). But just having dry air helps sweat evaporate from the skin, which helps cooling. The battery can be recharged with a cellphone charger... - more

[3] USAID: contest seeks novel tools for the fight against Ebola

The well-prepared Ebola fighter in West Africa may soon have some new options: protective gear that zips off like a wet suit, ice-cold underwear to make life inside the sweltering suits more bearable, or lotions that go on like bug spray and kill or repel the lethal virus.

Those ideas are among the contenders to win the Ebola "Grand Challenges" contest announced in October [2014] by the United States Agency for International Development, or among those being considered by the agency without having formally entered the contest... Wendy Taylor, director of USAID's Center for Accelerating Innovation and Impact... said the agency would spend about USD 1.7 million testing the most promising possibilities.

A higher-tech alternative is Qore athletic gear, which includes compression sleeves and shorts that press cooling packs to the forearm and groin, where arteries run close to the surface. Testing is needed, Ms. Taylor said, to see whether the vest is comfortable enough and the sleeves cooling enough. Doctors and nurses working in midday tropical heat are often near collapse after 45 minutes. Prolonging that period would let them see more patients.

Some clothing, including various brands of cooling undergarments, are repurposed off-the-shelf products. The heavy-duty SteeleVest, for example, is used by the military, some industrial workers, and, according to the company's website, vacationers and fishermen. Technologically, it is simple: a fabric vest with pockets into which gel packs fresh out of the freezer are inserted.
