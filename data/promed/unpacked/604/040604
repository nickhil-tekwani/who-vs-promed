Germany confirms 1st bird flu case this year
--------------------------------------------
German authorities said on Friday [10 Oct 2008] that the lethal
strain of bird flu has been confirmed on a farm in the east of the
country. Germany's eastern state government of Saxony said the H5N1
bird flu strain had been confirmed in a duck at a poultry farm near Dresden.

"Tests have confirmed that this involves the highly contagious
version of the H5N1 virus epidemic," said Ralph Schreiber, spokesman
for Saxony's social welfare ministry.

The flu strain was detected during a routine examination at the farm,
which held some 1400 birds. All birds at the farm have been
slaughtered as a precaution, the state said.

A 3-km (2-mile) radius quarantine zone has been established around
the farm and a 10-km [6.2-mile] radius observation zone also was
established in which all poultry must be locked up in buildings.

Bird flu was last detected in farm birds in Germany in December 2007.
A spokeswoman for Germany's federal Agriculture Ministry stressed
state authorities were responsible for combating bird flu. Officials
were currently assessing the risk level. Relevant international
organisations including the European Union plus neighbouring
countries had been informed of the case, she said.

The virus has infected 387 people worldwide in 15 countries, killing
245 of them, according to the World Health Organization's 10 Aug 2008
tally. Indonesia has the highest toll of any nation. Although bird
flu remains an animal disease, experts fear that the virus might
mutate into a form easily passed from human to human.
