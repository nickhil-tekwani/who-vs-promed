[1] UK (South Wales) summer festivals

Public health officials have reported an outbreak of measles in Carmarthenshire with 9 cases so far confirmed this month [September 2016].

All of the cases have been linked to summer festivals, prompting a warning to parents and young adults about the importance of getting the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] jab.

Public Health Wales say 6 of the cases are thought to be directly linked to patients who contracted the virus while at the Green Gathering environmental festival in Chepstow last month [August 2016].

The outbreak follows cases reported in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire and Powys.

Dr Brendan Mason, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control for Public Health Wales, said: "After not seeing cases of measles in Wales for some time, we're concerned that we now have an outbreak, which includes seeing the disease being passed on beyond household settings.

"It is important that those that have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine get vaccinated so that they are protected from this preventable disease. People who are not vaccinated not only risk catching measles themselves, but could also pass it to babies too young to have received MMR and who are at risk of serious complications.

"Measles is very contagious and can easily be passed between strangers in the community. It is possible that a very small number of recent cases may have contracted the infection in the public waiting area at Glangwili Hospital A&E. This has led to warnings that anyone who suspects they have measles should phone their GP for advice before attending hospital.

"Anyone who has a rash that could be measles is urged not to attend any public place where unvaccinated people could be present, but to seek advice from their GP or NHS [National Health Service] Direct Wales."

Health bosses say crowds of people provide the perfect environment for infectious diseases like measles to circulate, but 2 doses of the safe and effective MMR vaccine can offer protection.

Hywel Dda University Health Board's Director of Public Health, Teresa Owen, added: "We want to assure the public that we are being vigilant and taking all appropriate infection control measures in respect of this outbreak.

"We urge our community and staff to also be vigilant and to ensure they and their family members are up-to-date on MMR vaccinations and are aware of the symptoms to look out for."

Romania registered 675 measles cases in the 1st 8 months of this year [2016], which have led to 2 infant deaths. Moreover, a 3rd death possibly determined by the virus needs to be confirmed, the Ministry of Health announced on Wed 21 Sep 2016.

"Compared to 2015, the increase is more than alarming. Last year [2015], there were only 7 confirmed cases of measles, and none of them resulted in death," the Ministry of Health representatives said in a Facebook post.

"The Ministry of Health condemns in the strongest terms the irresponsible campaigns against children vaccination. The results (of these campaigns) translates into a dramatic increase in measles cases in one year," the same post says.

The anti-vaccination campaign has drawn a lot of supporters among Romanian parents in recent years. Those who oppose vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella claim that the vaccine causes autism.

Some of the best-known anti-vaccination advocates are religious groups and local celebrity Olivia Steer, who also advocates against using mammography for breast cancer detection. Olivia Steer, a former TV presenter and promoter of raw veganism, is married to local TV star Andi Moisescu.

[Vaccination is the most effective protection against measles. According to WHO:
- Measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available.
- In 2014, there were 114 900 measles deaths globally, about 314 deaths every day or 13 deaths every hour.
- Measles vaccination resulted in a 79 per cent drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2014 worldwide.
- In 2014, about 85 per cent of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their 1st birthday through routine health services, up from 73 per cent in 2000.
- During 2000-2014, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 17.1 million deaths, making measles vaccine one of the best buys in public health.
