[1] Dengue vaccine
Date: Mon 28 Apr 2014

Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi, announced that the 1st of 2 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies with its dengue vaccine candidate has achieved its primary clinical endpoint.

The efficacy study showed a significant reduction of 56 per cent of dengue disease cases. Initial safety data are consistent with the good safety profile observed in previous studies. Full analysis of the data will be undertaken in the coming weeks and reviewed by external experts prior to disclosure at an upcoming international scientific congress and publication in a peer-reviewed journal later this year [2014].

Dengue is a threat to nearly half the world's population and is a pressing public health priority in many countries in Asia and Latin America where epidemics occur. The annual incidence rate of 4.7 per cent observed in the control group demonstrates the very high burden of disease in Asia.

"This achievement is the result of more than 20 years of work in the field of dengue, collaborating with investigators, volunteers, authorities, scientific experts and international organizations," said Olivier Charmeil, president and CEO of Sanofi Pasteur. "Developing a dengue vaccine for the benefit of children and their parents is at the heart of our mission. Our goal is to make dengue the next vaccine-preventable disease and to support the WHO's ambition to reduce dengue mortality by 50 per cent and morbidity by 25 per cent by 2020."

"This is the 1st time ever a dengue vaccine successfully completed a Phase 3 efficacy study," said Dr. Capeding, principal investigator, Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, the Philippines. "These significant clinical results, associated with the good safety profile of the vaccine, bring real hope to more than 100 million people affected each year by dengue, a disease without any specific treatment today."

The results of this 1st, large-scale efficacy study will be further complemented by results in Q3 2014 from a 2nd, large-scale study currently conducted in Latin America, including more than 20 000 volunteers from Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Puerto Rico.

[The progress in Phase 3 vaccine trials is very good news. Several groups have been working on development of a safe, effective dengue tetravalent vaccine. This is a daunting task because of the necessity to have a good response to all 4 types of dengue virus. One hopes that the 2nd large-scale test mentioned above is also effective. The ultimate challenge for the vaccine manufacturers will be production of a vaccine that people of limited financial resources living in developing countries can afford. - Mod.TY]
