Bihar CM [Chief Minister] Nitish Kumar on Saturday [16 May 2020] asked state government officials to take all necessary steps to save children from deadly disease acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) or Japanese encephalitis (JE).

So far, altogether 48 cases of AES and 5 deaths due to the disease have been reported this year [2020] in the state. Last year [2019], altogether 1089 cases and 236 deaths due to AES were reported from different districts in the state.

[A 16 May 2020 report indicates that an 8-year-old girl died of AES, bringing the total deaths in Bihar state to 6 (https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/may/16/bihars-aes-death-toll-reaches-six-after-death-of-minor-girl-in-muzaffarpur-district-2144107.html).

The case count in Bihar state has increased from 14 cases on 28 Apr 2020, to 21 cases on 9 May 2020, to 48 cases today (16 May 2020). Although Japanese encephalitis is mentioned in the report above, there is no indication of whether any of the 48 cases mentioned above were tested for Japanese encephalitis virus infection. AES is a common ailment in children in northeastern India, especially in Bihar state.

As mentioned in previous ProMED-mail posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The report above does not indicate whether any of the etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES cases occur is just beginning, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 6-7 months. - Mod.TY
