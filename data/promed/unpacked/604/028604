Mass deaths in Sinoe, Over 135 dead
-----------------------------------
The outbreak of a disease has reportedly claimed the lives of some
135 persons at the Butaw Oil Palm Corporation (BOPC) in Sinoe County.
The mysterious disease kills barely 3 hours after attacking people,
sources told the Daily Observer.
A memorandum issued by the police component of the UN Mission in
Liberia (UNMIL) in Greenville, Sinoe County, said the death of
the 135 persons, who were mostly illicit miners, has triggered the
movement of hundreds of people from the BOPC mining site. Hundreds of
people have been rushing to the port city of Greenville and other
parts of Sinoe, where there are reports of [a large discovery] of
diamonds.
After receiving the information regarding the rising death toll, the
IPS (international police service) team in Sinoe coordinated with the
UNMIL commander of the Ethiopian Battalion 3 and Sinoe County and
county officials on the situation. They sent a joint security team
comprising the immigration, national security and police to ascertain
the veracity of the report.
According to the memorandum, the team met about 5000 people camping
at the junction of the road to BOPC and Rivercess on the way to
Shanpy Town, Sanquin District.
At that junction, Sanquin District Superintendent Christian Wleh
reportedly told the IPS Team that the people had started fleeing the
BOPC mining area since 2 Aug 2005 to escape the attack by the
mysterious disease. McDonald Tarpeh, the District Superintendent,
confirmed the information about the outbreak of the disease, the IPS
release said.
It quoted some 10 000 people who were traveling along the way to
Shanpy Town with their belongings as saying they were running away
because of the outbreak of the strange disease. They feared that
medical personnel could not easily contain the disease.
In Shanpy Town itself, where some 5 000 people were camping, a
businessman, Mark Mziatho, who supplies foodstuffs to the miners,
also confirmed the death of 100 people. He said he personally saw
them at the Jungle Base Camp. 15 persons were at New York Camp, while
another 15 were found at New Camp. One was found at Canocree Camp and
4 more lay dying along the road, the release noted. A man who
claimed to be a nurse alleged that he personally buried about 30 dead
bodies.
The tragedy began when the 1st death reportedly occurred at Jungle
Camp. 2 days after, the disease spread to all parts of the camp. Many
blame the disease on contaminated water.
Meanwhile, a team of medical doctors and other health practitioners
headed by Dr. Benson Barh has left for the area in apparent efforts
to fight the disease.

[ProMED would appreciate more information regarding this, the 2nd outbreak of
undiagnosed fatal disease associated with African diamond mines posted in the
last week. The 1st, in Maniema province in the Congo Democratic Republic,
[about 1500 miles away from Liberia], appears to have a low (about 2 percent)
case fatality rate (CFR) and began with respiratory symptoms. No CFR
information is available for this cluster.
No specific clinical information regarding the Liberian outbreak is available
except for an apparently very short period of time between onset of illness
and death. If this is correct, meningococcemia should be considered
strongly. In the postings regarding human _Streptococcus suis_ infections in
China, some cases had a fulminant course, but it is not likely that over 100
people could die so quickly from that disease. Earlier in 2005, an outbreak of
pneumonic plague in a neighboring province in Congo DR was posted and should
be considered as well [see refs. below].
More information should be forthcoming to sort out the etiology of
both of these outbreaks. - Mod.LL]
[One might also consider the involvement of a toxin. - Mod.JW]
