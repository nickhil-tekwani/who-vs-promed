99/180 Further studies on two new tospoviruses in Brazil - Addition of
zucchini lethal chlorosis tospovirus to the EPPO Alert List
In Brazil, the diversity of tospovirus species is increasing. Tomato
spotted wilt tospovirus was initially reported in the 1940s, but during the
last decades three more species were found: tomato chlorotic spot,
groundnut ring spot and iris yellow spot tospoviruses. More recently, two
more were reported one on chrysanthemum and another on courgette. In 1994,
growers in Atibaia county, Sao Paulo State, observed unusual symptoms on
chrysanthemum. The virus was later designated as chrysanthemum stem
necrosis tospovirus (EPPO Alert List). It also occurs in the Netherlands
and recently it has been found on tomato crops in Minas Gerais, Brazil (see
EPPO RS 96/082, 96/198, 98/130 and 99/094). Another tospovirus initially
designated as BR-09 and later as zucchini lethal chlorosis tospovirus (see
EPPO RS 96/198) was observed in experimental fields of courgette
(_Cucurbita pepo_ cv. Caserta) in Sao Paulo State, in 1991. Infected
courgettes showed symptoms of stunting and high yield losses of marketable
fruits. Plants infected before flowering usually died within a few days.
Plant infected after flowering showed similar symptoms, do not die but do
not yield marketable fruits. Currently, large areas are affected by this
virus which has spread from Sao Paulo State into central areas of Brazil
(unspecified). A natural infection has been detected in a commercial field
of cucumbers (_Cucumis sativus_ cv. Hokushin) in the Federal District.
Affected plants showed yellowing, mottling and vein banding on the leaves.
Further studies have been carried out in Brazil on these two viruses.
Biological and molecular studies showed that they are two new distinct
tospoviruses. In transmission experiments, _Frankliniella occidentalis_ and
_F. schultzei_ transmitted chrysanthemum stem necrosis tospovirus, but not
_Thrips tabaci_. Preliminary studies showed that _F. schultzei_ is a highly
efficient vector. All attempts to transmit zucchini lethal chlorosis
tospovirus with these three thrips species failed. Recently a new thrips
species, _Frankliniella zucchini_, has been described and identified as a
vector of zucchini lethal chlorosis tospovirus in Brazil.
Addition of new virus to EPPO Alert List: Zucchini lethal chlorosis
tospovirus (a new tospovirus of courgette and cucumber)
Why: Zucchini lethal chlorosis tospovirus came to our attention because it
was recently reported as causing a new and severe disease of courgette in
Brazil, which can also affect cucumber.
Where: Brazil (Sao Paulo State, Federal District). It is reported to occur
in central areas of Brazil but without further details.
On which plants: Courgette (_Cucurbita pepo_), cucumber (_Cucumis
sativus_). More data is needed on the host range of this virus and in
particular on the possible susceptibility of other Cucurbitaceae.
Damage: Infected courgettes showed symptoms of stunting and high yield
losses of marketable fruits. Plants infected before flowering usually died
within a few days. Plant infected after flowering showed similar symptoms,
do not die but do not yield marketable fruits. Affected cucumbers showed
yellowing, mottling and vein banding on the leaves (mortality is apparently
not reported on this host).
Transmission: A new thrips species, _Frankliniella zucchini_, has been
described and identified as a vector. The virus is not transmitted by
_Frankliniella occidentalis_, _F. schultzei_ and _Thrips tabaci_. Pathway:
Infected courgette or cucumber plants from Brazil (vegetables?).
Possible risks: Courgettes and cucumbers are important crops in the EPPO
region. Symptoms are severe on courgettes, as plant mortality and high
yield reduction is observed. However, more data is needed on the host range
and epidemiology of the disease. So far, the vector _Frankliniella
zucchini_ has never been reported in the EPPO region.

[With the addition of chrysanthemum stem necrosis virus (CSNV) and zucchini
lethal chlorosis virus (ZLCV) to the four other tospoviruses extant in the
country, Brazil harbors the broadest spectrum of tospoviruses reported to
date. CSNV and ZLCV are provisional names, awaiting action by the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. -Mod.DH]
