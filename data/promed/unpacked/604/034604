Pigeon fever found in horses in parts of state
------------------------
An unusual outbreak of pigeon fever in horses has occurred in parts of
Wyoming. Pigeon fever causes a painful swelling in the horse's pectoral
muscles that resembles a puffed-out pigeon breast.

Ken Mills of the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab said pigeon fever is known to
run through cycles with years between outbreaks of the bacterial disease,
but it is not common in Wyoming. "It is ongoing in Colorado and is not the
first time it's been seen. They have it in southern California year-round.
But it is unusual to see a case in Wyoming," Gillette veterinarian Marshall
Kohr said. Kohr said it is unknown how the disease is spread.

In Laramie County, 112 new cases of the disease are being treated on top of
55 cases discovered along the Front Range areas. Smaller outcroppings have
been confirmed in Albany, Goshen and Uinta counties. Symptoms besides
swelling include lameness, fever, lethargy, and weight loss.

"It is not a disease that causes death nor is it a debilitating thing. It's
not that big," Kohr said.

Treatment for the sores and abscesses along the chests and midlines of the
horses includes swabbing the lanced abscesses with antibiotics and using
anti-inflammatory drugs and pain relievers.

[Pigeon Fever is a disease caused by _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_
and is seen worldwide. It is usually associated with very deep abscesses and
multiple sores along the chest and midline.

Dryland distemper is another name for this disease, and clinical signs can
include lameness, fever, lethargy, and weight loss. The disease can occur
in any age, sex, or breed of horse, but most cases occur in animals less
than 5 years old.

The disease may take weeks or months for abscesses to develop fully after
the horse is infected. This means horses can be transported to a region
where the disease is unknown, develop active abscesses or sores, and not be
diagnosed properly, if at all. Abscesses usually form deep in muscles, such
as the pectorals. This causes swelling that looks like a puffed-out pigeon
breast, giving the name pigeon fever to the disease.

Outbreaks can occur when herd immunity wanes or naive horses are exposed,
and outbreaks occur more in some years than others. There may be some
seasonality to the disease, as more appears in the autumn of the year.

The causative bacteria live in the soil and can enter the horse's body
through wounds or broken skin, and through mucous membranes. It can be
transmitted by various flies, including house flies and probably horn flies.

The disease occurs in 3 forms: external abscesses, internal abscesses, or
limb infection known as ulcerative lymphangitis. The external abscess form
is the most common; the use of antibiotics is controversial as it might
actually prolong the infection; timing is important.

It is recommended that contaminated stalls, paddocks, and utensils be
thoroughly cleaned and disinfected where possible. Because flies can carry
the bacteria, pest control can serve as a deterrent to spread or
continuation of the disease.

The usual treatment recommendations include: 1) lancing the abscess; 2) use
of an appropriate antibiotic; 3) use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents. Prognosis for recovery is good. Recurrences are known. - Mod.TG]
