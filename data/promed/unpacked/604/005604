Epidemiological comments
As part of existing avian influenza response plans, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in conjunction with the Indiana State Board of Animal Health, are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and enhanced surveillance and testing in the Indiana HPAI H7N8 control area. Enhanced surveillance in the control area for the HPAI H7N8 Indiana event identified low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N8 in 8 turkey flocks. The partial sequences of the LPAI and HPAI H7N8 viruses are nearly identical except for the HA gene insertion, which imparts high pathogenicity to the HPAI virus. While the detection of AI in these additional flocks was of low pathogenicity, and the turkeys in these flocks were clinically healthy, this virus has a potential to mutate to HPAI, and, therefore, appropriate sanitary measures are being implemented to mitigate the risk. State officials have quarantined the affected premises and implemented movement controls. Depopulation of birds on the premises is under way.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; stamping out; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: disinfection/disinfestations; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste.

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 16 Jan 2016 / Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds / virus sequencing / 16 Jan 2016 / Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds / virus isolation / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is working hard to contain any further spread of the virus. According to the latest press release on the USDA-APHIS web site (updated 17 Jan 2016) http://tinyurl.com/jnpqdfs: "APHIS continues to work closely with the Indiana State Board of Animal Health and the affected poultry industry on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the additional affected premises, and depopulation of birds has already begun. Depopulation prevents the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system." - Mod.CRD
