There has been another outbreak of legionnaire's disease at European hospital
Georges-Pompidou. Between 29 Jun 2001 and 9 Jul 2001, 3 new cases of the
disease were diagnosed at the hospital, 2 of which have proved fatal.
After the epidemic which spread between November 2000 and January 2001, the
new outbreak has brought the total number of cases in the hospital to 12,
including 6 fatalities. In March [2001 it was thought that the danger was
over
after a series of changes were made to the hot water system. The hospital
will not be closed, but a number of new measures will be put in place to
combat the problem.
