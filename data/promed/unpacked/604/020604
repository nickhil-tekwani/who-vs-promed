Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2

Outbreak 1 (NAM/01/AIW): Halifax Island, Lüderitz, Lüderitz, Karas
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Feb 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Jackass Penguin: _Spheniscus demersus_ (Spheniscidae) / 7000 / 223 / 217 / 6 / 0
Affected population: a population of about 7000 African penguins at a breeding site of the Halifax Island. It is a small rocky island about 100m (330ft) from the mainland, near Lüderitz.

Outbreak 2: Lüderitz Marine Research Quarantine Centre, Lüderitz, Lüderitz, Karas
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Feb 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Jackass Penguin: _Spheniscus demersus_ (Spheniscidae) / 2 / 2 / 0 / 2 / 0
Affected population: 2 African penguins, collected from Halifax Island, showed neurological signs that were highly suspected to be of highly pathogenic avian influenza.

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Jackass Penguin: _Spheniscus demersus_ (Spheniscidae) / 7002 / 225 / 217 / 8 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Jackass Penguin: _Spheniscus demersus_ (Spheniscidae) / 3.21 / 3.10 / 96.44 / 3.21
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive; source of infection might be migratory wild birds.
Epidemiological comments: African penguins (_Jackass penguins_) at a conservation site (breeding site) on the Halifax Island, which is a small rocky island about 100 m (330 ft) from the mainland, near Lüderitz, showed signs suspected to be of highly pathogenic avian influenza. These were neurological signs (head tilting, twitching, incoordination), corneal opacity and lethargic/comatose behavior. The disease is currently limited to African penguins only; no other wild birds are affected at the Halifax Island.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; selective killing and disposal; disinfection; vaccination prohibited;, no treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratory (National laboratory) / Jackass Penguin / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 7 Feb 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[HPAI H5N8 virus appeared in Great Britain in December 2016, and then it spread to many regions of the old world, including some African countries. The presence of and deaths from avian influenza in African penguins (_Spheniscus demersus_) is of great concern because the species is endangered. African population is estimated at just 16 000 breeding pairs in South Africa and only 5000 pairs in southern Namibia. The 11st confirmed African penguin AI case was a bird found in January 2018.
