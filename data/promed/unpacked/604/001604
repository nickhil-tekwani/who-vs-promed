Last week, the 3rd pig farm was registered in Poland, where African swine fever [ASF] broke out this year [2020]. It concerns a farm with 70 pigs in the Wlodawa district in eastern Poland.

The company is located at a distance of 550m [approx. 601 yards] from the border with Belarus, Agro messaging abroad reports. Those pigs are of the rare Mangalica breed, which were kept in a barn with a free range.

All pigs present were bred on this farm, there was no purchase. Previous outbreaks were reported in large commercial farms in western Poland in mid-March [2020] and early April [2020], respectively. This time, the disease occurred in a completely different region of the country, as well as on a farm where pigs were kept on a very different scale.

Until [25 May 2020], 489 wild boars infected with African swine fever were found in Lubelskie County, where this 3rd outbreak is found. This makes it the 3rd most contaminated area in Poland.

[Wlodawa county is included in Poland's south-eastern province Lublin (Lubelskie). It shares its eastern border with Belarus and Ukraine; map at https://tinyurl.com/yc6kdnrr.

The vast majority of ASF outbreaks in Poland affected wild boar. Starting in 2015 on the eastern borders it spread westwards reaching the Warsaw area. Another cluster started in 2019 in western Poland, approaching, but, fortunately - so far - not crossing the German border.
