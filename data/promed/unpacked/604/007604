The Ministry of Health reported that the epidemic of dengue continues with
the number of cases nationwide climbing to 20,346 of which 3,999 [20% are
hemorrhagic. More than 2,830 (14%) of the cases have been reported in
fewer than 15 days.
Deaths have risen to 35 with 8 in the state of Carabobo; 5 in the Federal
District; 3 in each of the states of Anzoategui, Miranda and Monagas; 2
each in Aragua, Barinas and Falcon; and 1 each in the states of Bolivar,
Cojedes, Merida, Portuguesa, Tachira, Yaracuy and Zulia.
The Epidemiology Bulletin for the week of 9 to 15 November reported the
distribution of states with the highest incidence of cases as follows:
Federal District 1,931; Anzoategu 1,371; Aragua 2,767; Barinas 1,882;
Carabobo 2,071Lara 2,747Merida; 1,161; Monagas 1,456; and Zulia 1,120.
States with few cases include Delta Amacuro 1 and Nueva Esparta, 29.
Although it has been difficult to find out just what the Ministry of Health
is proposing to do to control the epidemic, it is known that there is a
plan for house-to-house visits to eliminate any potential mosquito breeding
areas.
Iris Villalobos de Chacon, Chief of Epidemiology of the State of Aragua and
a member of the Commission to Combat Dengue, observed that the illness is
affecting the [affluent, owing to the fact that the mosquito [_Aedes
aegyptu_ prefers to breed in clean, clear waters. She urged that
preventative measures be taken with regard to swimming pools, fountains,
condensation trays of air conditioners and refrigerators, as well as flower
vases.
Around the homes of those less affluent, she noted that the most common
breeding grounds include water catch basins, discarded tires, and junked
containers.

[There was another paragraph but I chose to not include it above but,
rather, to comment on it. That paragraph indicated that Villalobos de
Chacon had also warned that in areas where rodents occur, one should rule
out hemorrhagic fever and that the scientific community should be aware
that "hantavirus" could arrive in Venezuela "because the mechanism of
transmission is similar to that of hemorrhagic fever or Guanarito fever."
1. The dengue epidemic is growing more serious by the day but it looks as
though the insecticide spraying is becoming more focused than had been
reported previously.
2. There is no place where rodents do not occur.
3. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF; caused by dengue viruses, members of the
family _Flaviviridae_) and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (caused by
Guanarito virus, a member of the family _Arenaviridae_) are both
hemorrhagic diseases but there is no biological relationship between these
viruses. I trust this member of the Commission to Combat Dengue meant that
physicians should be aware of the possibility that a non-dengue hemorrhagic
disease they see could be confused with DHF.
4. The mechanism of transmission of "hantavirus" (sic) may be similar to
that of the mechanism of transmission of Guanarito virus (rodent to human)
but it is not at all like the mechanism of transmission of dengue viruses
(mosquito to human). In addition New World hantaviruses cause respiratory
distresses, not hemorrhagic diseases.
So, hemorrhagic, hemorrhagic, hemorrhagic, but not at all the same, or even
similar, etiologies. - Mod.CHC
