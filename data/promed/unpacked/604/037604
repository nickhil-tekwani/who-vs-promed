The Director of Health of the Federal District, Jose Leon Uzcategui,
disclosed that to last Friday, 1,905 cases of dengue have been reported in
the capital [Caracas. The number of cases is [2.5 times greater than the
751 cases reported last year for the same period.
An effort to eradicate the disease within a month is being coordinated
among the various directors of health of the area. Spraying will take
place only in those areas (such as the west of the capital) where the
numbers of mosquitoes have risen. A massive spraying program will not be
initiated since the insecticide does not kill larvae and can aggravate
cases of asthma and allergy in the population. Moreover, the sprayed
insecticide will not reach the interiors of dwellings where the insect is
reproducing. It is hoped that preventative measures will be taken by the
population to control the disease.
Francisco Araoz, Director of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health,
indicated that it is very probable that during last week, the number of
cases of dengue has increased nationwide. He promised to present tomorrow
morning a summary of the confirmed cases since the heads of the various
states have just begun to put together their reports. At this time,
nationwide there have been 18,700 cases and 34 deaths reported. [The
number of classic vs. hemorrhagic cases was not noted in the figures
released thus far. - DMC

[If insecticide spraying is, at this point, intended only to reduce
mosquito populations in general and not to reduce populations of vector
species, i.e., _Aedes aegypti_, this is a p.r. effort, not a control
effort. Eradication "within a month" (or a year) is unlikely. - Mod.CHC
