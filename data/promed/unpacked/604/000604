CDC finds mounting evidence of risk to coffee workers
-----------------------------------------------------
It's been known for years that diacetyl destroys lungs. So why is it still harming coffee workers and allowed in e-cigarettes? Nearly a dozen more workers at a Texas coffee roasting plant are thought to have lung disease tied to dangerous chemicals -- tripling the number initially diagnosed. And half of them are suspected of having an irreversible and sometimes fatal illness called bronchiolitis obliterans.

Doctors and scientists say 2 chemicals: diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione -- which are formed when coffee is roasted and are released in higher concentrations when it is ground -- are the likely culprits. Researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] examined 69 workers in the Tyler facility where 5 former workers had been diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans in 2011 and 2012. They found an additional 11 cases of apparent disease among workers who roasted, ground, and sometimes flavored coffee beans.

The findings bolster mounting evidence that diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione pose an emerging health concern for commercial coffee roasters and grinders. "Our study of the current coffee processing workforce strengthens the previous sentinel case reports by epidemiologically establishing unexpected respiratory morbidity in a new industry..." the researchers wrote in a report published [on Mon 2 Nov 2015] in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine. The report is based on information the researchers collected from the current workers in 2012 following the 1st diagnosed cases, which were spotted by a private doctor.

An investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in February [2015] examined the initial 5 cases of serious lung disease in the Texas coffee roasters and grinders and exposed the government's failure to regulate the chemicals. In June [2015], the Journal Sentinel uncovered potentially dangerous levels of the naturally occurring chemicals at 2 coffee roasting facilities in Wisconsin.

CDC in September [2015] posted a warning to coffee processing workers and employers informing them of the potential hazards. Last month [October 2015], the Journal Sentinel reported that it had found the same lung-destroying chemicals in locally made e-liquids for vaping.

Aside from being formed naturally in coffee, diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione are a byproduct of fermentation and are found in butter, wine, beer, and other foods and drinks. The chemicals are also produced synthetically and have been used over the years to give a buttery flavor to various kinds of foods from popcorn, candy, and ice cream to chips, cheeses, and baked goods -- as well as coffee and e-cigarettes. While deemed safe to ingest in trace amounts, the compounds have been found to be toxic when inhaled.

Studies show they destroy the lungs' tiniest airways, leading to scar tissue buildup that blocks airflow. Diacetyl is most commonly known for its links to clusters of injuries and deaths among microwave popcorn workers in the early 2000s.

"We used to know butter flavor was an issue," said CDC spokeswoman Christina Spring. "Now we're learning the naturally occurring (type) is also a concern we should be on the lookout for...This will help us to continue to make better recommendations on how to protect these workers."

High exposure levels
--------------------
Researchers found workers at the Distant Lands plant in Tyler, Texas, were exposed to extremely high levels of the chemicals when they opened hoppers holding unflavored ground coffee before being packaged. Levels measured at the hatch of the hopper showed concentrations of 14 300 parts per billion (ppb) of diacetyl and 18 400 parts per billion (ppb) of 2,3-pentanedione in a 15-minute air sample.

Experts with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC's research arm, have proposed that workers not exceed 25 ppb of diacetyl and 31 ppb of 2,3-pentanedione in a 15-minute duration. The proposal is in draft form and has not been finalized.

Despite more than a dozen animal and epidemiological studies of workers showing the dangers of the chemicals since the early 2000s, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), tasked with overseeing the safety of the nation's workforce, has failed to regulate worker exposure to the chemicals. The agency is in the process of overhauling the system it uses to regulate chemical exposures.

Meanwhile, NIOSH experts say there are precautions that employers and workers can take to protect themselves from exposure and potentially progressing illness. Medical surveillance, respirators, local exhaust at work stations, enclosing some of the processes, and improving ventilation are among suggestions. Testing the air in the breathing zones and workspace can give employers insight into the problem areas.

NIOSH is gathering information from several other coffee processing plants around the country including Just Coffee Cooperative in Madison and plans to release results in coming weeks and months.

"This report highlights the need for more research," Spring said. "This is a risk we may not have been aware of 20 years ago, but we are aware of it now and we're looking at how to make it safer."

For coffee lovers, this is especially sad, to learn that someone could have been so severely injured during the preparation of a substance so many enjoy. Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare and life-threatening form of non-reversible obstructive lung disease where the bronchioles (the small airway branches) are compressed and narrowed by scar tissue and/or fibrosis with or without inflammation.

Bronchiolitis means inflammation of the bronchioles and obliterans refers to the inflammation or fibrosis of the bronchioles partially or completely obliterating the airways. Bronchiolitis obliterans has always been thought to be irreversible and progressive, but recently new research a using inhaled cyclosporine has been shown promise to increase certain lung function, while allowing patients to decrease their systemic steroid doses.

What is more alarming is that when the issue of these chemicals was raised over a decade ago with the popcorn industry, other industries, such as the coffee industry, were not looked at then. The e-cigarette business is a relatively new and burgeoning industry, which is as yet relatively unregulated, and the public health impact of "vaping" is not yet fully understood http://www.cdc.gov/cdcgrandrounds/archives/2015/october2015.htm.

Diacetyl has several synonyms, including biacetyl; 2,3-butanedione; 2,3-butadione; 2,3-diketobutane; dimethyldiketone; dimethylglyoxal; and glyoxal. According to OSHA, potential symptoms are listed as: eye, mucous membrane, respiratory system, skin irritation; persistent cough, phlegm production, wheezing, dyspnea (shortness of breath); unusual fatigue; episodes of mild fever or generalized aches; severe skin rashes. Irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, and there is suspected cumulative lung damage such as bronchiolitis obliterans.

No IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health concentration) has been established. Diacetyl is known to react with the amino acid arginine in proteins (Riordan, 1979) and inhibits enzymes that are important for protecting cells from oxidative damage, such as superoxide dismutase (Borders et al, 1985) and glutathione reductase (Boggaram and Mannervik, 1982).

There are many issues surrounding the industries with these chemicals that are not clear. Certainly, if the workers are exposed to concentrations of various chemicals respiratory and eye protection should be provided.

The MSDS (material safety data sheet or now, as they prefer, SDS or safety data sheets) for diacetyl indicates that respiratory and eye protection should be provided. So if the coffee industry is aware of these chemicals why is protection not being provided to the workers? The coffee industry and the e-cigarettes or e-vapers should be aware of this as there were coffee cases reported in 2011, and cases in e-vapers in 2014.

One could argue that diacetyl is a byproduct and not a product intentionally brought into the processing plants. Likewise, diacetyl can be the product of some fermentation. It is responsible for the butterscotch flavoring or buttery flavorings in some alcoholic drinks. As a product for consumption, it is classified by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) as "generally recognized as safe". That GRAS designation may be for ingestion not inhalation.

Bronchiolitis obliterans, a morphologic descriptor and clinicopathologic syndrome, is the irreversible blocking of the small airways (bronchioles) by granulation tissue and inflammation. The inflammation tissue is not specific in histological terms. The granulation that blocks the terminal bronchioles can also be seen in interstitial pneumonia, infectious pneumonia, aspirations, and other processes that result from a scarring in the lungs. The symptoms are cough, dyspnea, and fever. It results in obstructive lung disease. This disease may be associated with a number of toxics and some conditions such as smoking and/or cocaine use. Other conditions may be cancers, or some immune deficiency syndrome.

There may be other underlying medical conditions that were not presented here. Portions of this comment were extracted from OSHA
