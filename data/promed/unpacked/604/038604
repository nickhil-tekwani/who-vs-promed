_Strep. suis_ is an uncommon but not unheard of zoonotic infection, with the
highest risk probably in abattoir workers in Southeast Asia. Apparently
humans are infected by pigs. While the problem is most severe in Hong Kong,
it is also in Canada, France, and elsewhere where there are pig industries.

underdiagnosed disease in Hong Kong. Med J Aust 1983 Apr 30;1(9):414-6, 417.
ABSTRACT:
_Streptococcus suis_ has been identified as the most common cause of
meningitis in adults in Hong Kong. The disease is characterized by
occupational exposure to pigs or pork. It occurs in summer, and is
associated with early, severe, sensory deafness, arthritis, uveitis, and
loss of balance. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid may show an elevated
white cell count with a predominance of either polymorphs or lymphocytes.
Misinterpretation of the microbiological findings by inexperienced staff
members may lead to a failure to correctly diagnose this disease. This is
the first report of a series of cases of _Strept. suis_ meningitis outside
western Europe. Health authorities are urged to be aware of this disease in
pork-consuming countries.
