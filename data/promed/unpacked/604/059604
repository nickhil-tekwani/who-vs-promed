[Since 2005 there were 6 previous outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease
including 3 in 2007, 2 in 2010, and one this year (2011).

All were type O except for the one resolved in July 2010 in Kokchetav,
which was not typed. Kokchetav is located in the center of the country
and renotified its absence of disease to the OIE recently. The
outbreak in Ural'sk in the far west of the country was reported on 27
May 2011 and a premise in the same region associated with that
outbreak was reported on 23 Jun 2011. The final report declaring the
outbreak to be over was dated 28 Jul 2011, less than a month ago. The
current outbreak is located in the most far eastern part of the
country and so far only involves one premises. However, the reason
behind these sporadic, apparently isolated, geographically disparate
but persistent outbreaks should be investigated and understood before
a full epidemiologic assessment of the status of the country or
regions within can be made appropriately.
