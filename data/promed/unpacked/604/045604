Psittacosis Outbreak among Workers at Chicken Slaughter Plants, Virginia and Georgia, USA, 2018
---------------
Psittacosis results from inhalation of aerosolized droppings or respiratory secretions of birds infected with _Chlamydia psittaci_. During 2008-2017, a total of 60 cases of psittacosis, a nationally notifiable disease in the United States, were reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss).

The most common source of psittacosis in the USA is believed to be pet psittacine birds (e.g., parrots, cockatoos). The most recent large poultry-associated outbreaks in the USA were reported 3 decades ago and were linked to turkeys (1,2). _C. psittaci_ prevalence in poultry in the USA is unknown, although it has been recently identified in turkeys in the USA (3) and turkeys and chickens overseas (4,5). Poultry can be infected but show no overt signs of illness (6).

During 31 Aug 2018 - 4 Sep 2018, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) received reports of 10 persons, all workers at the same chicken slaughter plant, hospitalized with fever, headache, cough, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Lower respiratory tract specimens (2 bronchoalveolar lavage and 1 sputum) from 3 hospitalized workers were positive for _C. psittaci_ by real-time PCR targeting the _C. psittaci_ locus tag CPSIT_RS01985 (7), performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA, USA). The Virginia plant suspended operations on 8 Sep 2018.

On 12 Sep 2018, the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) was notified that 3 employees of a Georgia chicken slaughter plant owned by the same company were hospitalized with pneumonia. _C. psittaci_ was detected in sputum samples from all 3 patients. The Georgia plant suspended operations on 15 Sep 2018.

After plant closures, VDH and GDPH staff inspected the respective plants, which both slaughter only chickens, and collected environmental samples to test for _C. psittaci_. Staff collected samples from areas where workers were close to or directly handled live chickens or carcasses. Environmental samples were tested for chlamydial species by using real-time PCR, followed by high-resolution melt analysis (8), at the University of Georgia Infectious Disease Laboratory (Athens, GA, USA).

The company held employee meetings in each state and invited VDH and GDPH representatives to provide outbreak information and conduct active case finding. VDH and GDPH initiated investigations of cases and potential risk factors. A case was defined as illness in a worker employed during 1 Aug 2018 - 7 Sep 2018, at the Virginia plant, or during 13 Aug 2018 - 28 Sep 2018, at the Georgia plant, who had either physician-diagnosed pneumonia, or fever or chills with 2 or more symptoms of headache, cough, or muscle aches. A confirmed case required PCR detection of _C. psittaci_ in a clinical specimen.

At the Virginia plant, 50 cases (including 5 confirmed) were identified; 30 cases (including 8 confirmed) were identified at the Georgia plant. PCR cycle threshold values for the 13 confirmed cases ranged from 26 to 37. Using sequencing of the outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene, we identified genotype D of _C. psittaci_ in patient specimens; this genotype is most often found in poultry (4,5). Cases occurred during 3 Aug - 8 Sep 2018 in Virginia and 17 Aug - 22 Oct 2018 in Georgia.

We provide detailed characteristics for all patients (ill workers) (Table). A total of 58% of patients were men (age range 19-58 years). Bird evisceration was the most common job duty or title (reported by 53% of ill workers), consistent with previous psittacosis outbreaks (1,2,9,10). 29 workers were hospitalized (3 in intensive care) and had stays from 1 to 37 days. No deaths were reported.

_C. psittaci_ was not detected in any of the environmental samples from the Virginia (n = 62) and Georgia (n = 46) plants. After extensive cleaning with sanitizers, including quaternary ammonia, chlorine solutions, and chlorine dioxide foam (all registered by the US Environmental Protection Agency as effective against _C. psittaci_), the Virginia and Georgia plants reopened on 18 and 19 Sep 2018, respectively. Georgia cases that occurred after the plant reopened were attributed to longer incubation periods. The incubation period for psittacosis is typically 1-4 weeks (6), but illness onset over 30 days after exposure was reported in the 2 most recent poultry-associated outbreaks in the United States (1,2).

At the request of the US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted a health hazard evaluation of the Virginia plant on 19-20 Sep 2018. Recommendations to the plant included repositioning cooling fans, ensuring evisceration tools were working properly, and changes to other work practices to reduce bacterial contamination and aerosolization. A health hazard evaluation was not requested at the Georgia plant, but company management reported implementing or evaluating options to implement all applicable recommendations at the plants.

Clinicians evaluating poultry slaughter plant workers with febrile respiratory illness should consider psittacosis as a possible diagnosis. In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, clinicians should contact state health authorities to discuss whether _C. psittaci_ testing should be requested through CDC, which has the only laboratory in the USA in which PCR testing for human specimens is currently available.

[Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated, can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians. - Mod.LL
