Cholera has hit Anambra claiming the lives of 8 persons, while 25 others had been admitted in various hospitals in the state, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Joe Akabuike, has said. Akabuike, who disclosed this in a chat with newsmen yesterday, 26 Jan 2015, in his office while receiving over 25 cartons of drugs donated by Superior Pharmacy, Lagos, said that 4 communities in Anambra West Local Council were affected, adding that the quick intervention of the ministry and its team of medical officers have stabilised the situation.

He said: "The people living in the area have been adequately sensitized on how to beat the epidemic, which he said is mostly waterborne. So far, 25 people, mostly children that were infected, are in stable condition and had been moved out into safety areas.

"It is a water-borne disease and mostly affects areas where their source of drinking water is contaminated. The best advice at this time is for families to ensure that their source of drinking water is okay, and when it is not, they should endeavor to boil it before drinking.

While receiving the drugs worth over N 4 million [USD 20 800] donated by the CEO, Superior Pharmaceutical Company, Lagos for the treatment of infected persons, Akabuike said such gestures would help the state to contain the challenges of the cholera outbreak in the state.

The Human Resources Manager of the organisation, Miss Ruth Harrison, said the company decided to complement the efforts of the governor of the state, Chief Willie Obiano, who is containing the cholera epidemic in the state, and further, the proprietor of the company is from Anambra State.

The death toll in the cholera outbreak in Bayelsa State increased to 23 on Tue 27 Jan 2015, as the epidemic claimed 2 more lives in Otuan, Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of the state. Eight persons were killed by the epidemic at the weekend in Osiama and Ekede in Sagbama Local Government Area of the state.

The epidemic began between Christmas Eve 2014 and early January 2015, when it ravaged Igbomotoru II, also in Southern Ijaw area, killing 13 persons. Governor Seriake Dickson hails from Sagbama area, while the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Konbowei Benson, is an indigene of Southern Ijaw.

It was gathered that the increasing number of victims was causing anxiety in rural communities, most of which do not have any functional health facility and potable water.

The state Commissioner for Health, Ayebatonye Owei, was said to have led some medical personnel to the communities to distribute relevant drugs at the weekend. Owei expressed dismay over the outbreak of the disease in the areas. He, however, gave assurances that he would mobilize health officers to the localities to ensure that the epidemic does not spread further.

Meanwhile, a report by international newswire, Bloomberg, said the lack of potable water killed more people in Nigeria last year [2014] than the dreaded sect, Boko Haram, which has held the nation's northeast by the jugular since 2009.
