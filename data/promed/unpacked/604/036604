The Valencian Farmers Association (AVA-Asaja) estimates a 15 per cent decrease in the rice harvest and losses of around 5.6 million Euros [about USD 6.3 million] due to blast disease, compared to previous years. In some badly affected areas and very susceptible varieties, over 50 per cent yield loss is expected.

The rice sector faces a very difficult [2015] season because the combination of high temperatures and high humidity have favoured the development of the fungus to an unusual extent. The accumulation of rice debris in fields has also contributed to the increase in blast incidence.

Additional fungicide treatments authorised by the Ministry of Agriculture have not been able to curb the disease. AVA-Asaja is calling for a review of current management procedures and an investigation on the possible emergence of fungicide resistant blast strains.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_, previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

A previous severe outbreak was reported from Valencia in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100906.3194).
