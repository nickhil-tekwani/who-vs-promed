A total of 44 535 cases of malaria and 41 dead were reported on January and February [2014] in the Angolan province of Cabinda, said today [14 Mar 2014] the chief of the regional department of Public Health, Maria Carlota Tati.

From that number, 14 592 were children under 5 years, 10 397 between 5 and 14, and 16 543 adults living in that area, 400 km [249 mi] North from Luanda, she said the press.

Tati made reference to the need for technicians to improve in diagnosis and know the symptoms not to confuse fever with malaria, taking into account cases of high temperature due to dengue, which symptoms are similar to malaria.

She also talked about preventive measures like the use of mosquito nets and to eliminate stagnant water in containers, tires and cans.

Angola reduced the number of malaria cases from 3 million to 2 million, which is an achievement, recently said the Secretary of State for health, Carlos Alberto Masseca.

According to data from the Health Ministry, about 20 000 people every year died due to malaria in this country, but currently the number is lower at 5000, which shows the efforts to eradicate the disease.

Biological products made in Cuba have shown efficiency in the elimination of the mosquito _Anopheles_, which carries the virus [malaria is caused by a protozoan parasite, not a virus. - Mod.EP] of malaria.

The participation of Cuban collaborators in the campaign to eradicate the disease through fumigation and other preventive actions has also helped in the efforts.

[Malaria is endemic in Angola including Cabinda province, which is separated from the rest of Angola by a narrow strip of territory belonging to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The reported mortality (World Malaria Report 2013 http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/profile_ago_en.pdf?ua=1) has slowly declined since 2003 and the last reported figure is approximately 25 per 100 000 population. The bed net coverage is below 20 percent, and an alternative strategy to the increased use of larvicides, as suggested here, would be to increase the use of bed nets especially among children. - Mod.EP
