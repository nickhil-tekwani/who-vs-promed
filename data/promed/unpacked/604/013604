Tetramine, a banned neurotoxic rodenticide, caused the food poisoning that killed 2 children at a kindergarten in southwest China's Yunnan Province, local authorities said on Thursday (20 Mar 2014).

Investigators found the toxic substance in snacks brought to Jiajia Kindergarten by a student who shared the food with other children, said Zhao Minjian, an official in charge of media communication with the Qiubei County Government.

Specimen checks showed school meals were safe, said Zhao.

A total of 32 children showed symptoms of food poisoning on Wednesday afternoon [19 Mar 2014]. Of the 7 in critical condition, 2 girls, aged 4 and 5, died. 5 others are recovering. Most of the ill have been discharged from hospital.

Situated in Pinglong Village of Qiubei County, the private kindergarten with 79 students opened on 25 Feb 2013. Of the 4 teachers, 3 are certified.

A further investigation is under way.

The rodenticide was found in snacks brought to the school by a child who shared them with others. Wow! How many snacks did this child have to share with 30 other students? So clearly some of them are sick, in critical condition, such that at least 2 died; but why did 32 become ill? Was this a psychosomatic illness that caused all of these students to feel ill? Just how much of this substance was there?

Tetramine, also known as tetramethylene disulfotetramine (TETS), a banned neurotoxic rodenticide, has accounted for numerous intentional and unintentional poisonings in mainland China. Since the 1st known case of human illness caused by tetramine occurred in New York, in May 2002, TETS has caused more than 50 human poisonings in Western countries.

Tetramine, a rat poison that may sometimes be ingested by mistake, blocks GABA receptors and causes seizures. These seizures can persist for years after the initial poisoning, even when no seizures are present initially. Sodium valproate, which has the ability to increase the amount of GABA in the CNS, would be a reasonable choice for the treatment of epilepsy caused by tetramine poisoning.

Tetramine can cause multiple organ failure and death. The dose and the length of time from ingestion to treatment play a role in the outcome of the situation.
