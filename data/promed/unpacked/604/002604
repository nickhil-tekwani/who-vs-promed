[Yaroslavl is a city and the administrative center of Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, located 250 kilometers (160 miles) northeast of Moscow. The historic part of the city, World Heritage Site, is located at the confluence of the Volga and the Kotorosl Rivers. It is one of the Golden Ring cities, a group of historic cities northeast of Moscow that has played an important role in Russian history. Population is 613 088 (2002 census). The location of the city perhaps explains why the clinical samples have been referred to Moscow, rather than investigated local. A HealthMap is available at http://healthmap.org/r/38OJ. - Mod.CP]

The head of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), Boris Didi Herman Ngossaki, reported Tuesday [17 Dec 2013] in Brazzaville the resurgence of measles, with more than 900 cases detected this year [2013] in Congo Republic. Dr. Didi Ngossaki gave these statistics during the launch by the government of a national vaccination campaign against measles in order to fight this scourge which has resurfaced in the country.

"This endemic reemerged -- 1st in Pointe-Noire in 2010-2011 -- [and] has unfortunately spread to all other departments of the Congo and the new campaign is the only way to fight back against this scourge, he declared. The vaccination campaign for children aged 6 months to 5 years will provide supplementary vaccination, vitamin A, and mebendazole for deworming. Parents are being advised to have children of this age vaccinated at the nearest health centre to their home or in the nearest village's health facility.

Conducted jointly by the Ministry of Health and Population and development partners, including UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), the vaccination campaign will end on [21 Dec 2013].

The 1st measles case in Auckland since June 2012 has been confirmed, prompted a warning from health officials. The person contracted measles while in Sydney [Australia] earlier this month [December 2013] for the 2013 hip hop competition. The Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) says teams from elsewhere in New Zealand attended the event. ARPHS is following up with those who had contact with the infected person, alerting health professionals and emergency departments, and updating the Ministry of Health.

Measles symptoms start with a high fever, which develops about 10 days after exposure, followed by a runny nose, cough, red eyes and small white spots inside the mouth. A red blotchy rash on the neck and face appears 3 or 4 days later before spreading to the rest of the body. Medical Officer of Health Catherine Jackson says measles is extremely infectious and can cause serious complications. "Auckland's last major measles outbreak in 2011 demonstrates how quickly the disease can spread," Dr Jackson said. "One infected child resulted in nearly 500 cases and 80 hospital admissions." If anyone has measles symptoms or any concerns, they are urged to ring their GP or healthline on 0800 611 116. "If you need to see a doctor, it is important to call 1st to avoid spreading measles in the waiting room," Dr Jackson says.

NSW [New South Wales] Health has also issued a health alert after the World Supremacy Battleground hip hop competition in Sydney [New South Wales, Australia]. The 1st case came to NSW Health's attention on [27 Dec 2013], with a competitor from Adelaide [South Australia] coming down with measles, followed by the New Zealand case and a Sydney resident. NSW Health communicable diseases director Dr Vicky Sheppeard believes there may be other cases in the community now or secondary cases could be developing.
