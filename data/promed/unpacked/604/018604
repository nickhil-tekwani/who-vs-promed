Ebola-like virus hits Kamwenge
----------------
Two suspected cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, a virus similar to
Ebola, have been reported in western Uganda, according to the
Ministry of health.
"The Ministry of Health would like to inform the general public that
2 suspected cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported,
of whom one has died," a press release by the director general of
health services, Dr. Sam Zaramba, said.
"Both cases were mine workers in Kitaka mine, located in Kakasi
Forest Reserve in Kamwenge district."
Kamwenge is about 250km west of Kampala with a population of 295 000,
according to the 2002 census.
"The 1st test was positive. We are waiting for the results of the
confirmatory test, which we shall have at 9:00 AM tomorrow," Dr.
Zaramba told The New Vision last night.
"But it is most probably the Marburg virus. We thought we should send
out this information early enough."
Marburg, like Ebola, is a severe and highly fatal disease. It is
characterised by sudden bleeding and high fever, resulting into death
within a few days.
Transmission is through close contact with blood and other body
fluids from patients with clinical signs of the illness. It can also
be transmitted following exposure to contaminated items, such as
bedding and clothing of patients.
The virus is named after Marburg, a city in Germany where the first
outbreak occurred in 1967 among laboratory workers who had been doing
research on monkeys which were imported from Uganda in order to
prepare a polio vaccine.
"The Ministry of Health has set up a national task force that is
tracing all potential contacts of the above cases for further
investigations and tests," the statement added.
It advised people to report any suspicious cases to the nearest heath
unit. The ministry asked the public not to panic "as no new cases
have been reported in the last 2 weeks".
What is Marburg hemorrhagic fever?
Marburg hemorrhagic fever is a rare, severe type of hemorrhagic
(internal bleeding) fever, which affects both humans and monkeys.
Caused by a genetically unique animal-borne RNA virus of the
'filovirus' family, its recognition led to the creation of this virus
family. The 4 species of Ebola virus are the only other known members
of the filovirus family.
Where have cases occurred?
Marburg virus was first recognized in 1967, when outbreaks of
hemorrhagic fever occurred simultaneously in laboratories in Marburg
and Frankfurt (Germany) and in Belgrade (Yugoslavia). A total of 37
people became ill. They included laboratory workers as well as
several medical personnel and family members who had cared for them.
The 1st people infected had been exposed to African green monkeys. In
Marburg, the monkeys had been imported for research and to prepare a
polio vaccine.
Recorded cases have appeared in only a few locations. While the 1967
outbreak occurred in Europe, the disease agent had arrived with
imported monkeys from Uganda. No other case was recorded until 1975,
when a traveler most likely exposed in Zimbabwe became ill in
Johannesburg, South Africa -- and passed the virus to his traveling
companion and a nurse. 1980 saw 2 other cases: one in Western Kenya
not far from the Ugandan source of the monkeys implicated in the 1967 outbreak.
This patient's attending physician in Nairobi became the 2nd case.
Another infection was recognized in 1987 when a young man who had
traveled extensively in Kenya became ill and later died. In 1998, an
outbreak occurred in Durba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Cases were linked to individuals working in a gold mine. After the
outbreak subsided, there were still some sporadic cases that occurred
in the region.
Where does the Marburg virus originate from?
Marburg virus is indigenous to Africa. While the geographic area to
which it is native is unknown, this area appears to include at least
parts of Uganda and Western Kenya, and perhaps Zimbabwe. As with
Ebola, the actual animal host for Marburg virus also remains a
mystery. Both of the men infected in 1980 in western Kenya had
traveled extensively, including making a visit to a cave in that
region. The cave was investigated by placing sentinels animals inside
to see if they would become infected, and by taking samples from
numerous animals and arthropods trapped during the investigation. The
investigation yielded no virus and the sentinel animals remained healthy.
How do humans get it?
Just how the animal host first transmits Marburg virus to humans is
unknown. However, humans who become ill with Marburg hemorrhagic
fever may spread the virus to other people. This may happen in
several ways. Persons who have handled infected monkeys and have come
in direct contact with their fluids or cell cultures, have become
infected. Spread of the virus between humans has occurred in a
setting of close contact, often in a hospital. Droplets of body
fluids, or direct contact with persons, equipment, or other objects
contaminated with infectious blood or tissues are all highly suspect
as sources of disease.
What are the symptoms?
After an incubation period of 5 to 10 days, the onset of the disease
is sudden and is marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia.
Around the 5th day, a rash most prominent on the chest, back or
stomach may occur. Nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea then may appear. Symptoms become
increasingly severe and may include jaundice, inflammation of the
pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, and
multi-organ dysfunction. Because many of the signs and symptoms of
Marburg hemorrhagic fever are similar to those of other infectious
diseases, such as malaria or typhoid fever, diagnosis of the disease
can be difficult, especially if only a single case is involved.
How is it treated
A specific treatment is unknown. However, supportive hospital therapy
should be utilised. This includes balancing the patient's fluids and
electrolytes, maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure,
replacing lost blood and clotting factors and treating them for any
complicating infections. Sometimes treatment also has used
transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma and other preparations to replace
the blood proteins important in clotting.
Who is at risk?
People who have close contact with a human or non-human primate
infected with the virus are at risk. Such persons include laboratory
or quarantine facility workers who handle non-human primates that
have been associated with the disease. In addition, hospital staff
and family members who care for patients with the disease are at risk
if they do not use proper techniques to prevent direct physical
contact with the patient. Precautions should include wearing of
protective gowns, gloves and masks; placing the infected individual
in strict isolation; and sterilization or proper disposal of needles,
equipment and patient excretions.
How to prevent it from spreading?
Increasing awareness among health-care providers of clinical symptoms
in patients that suggest Marburg fever is critical. Better awareness
can help lead to taking precautions against the spread of virus
infection to family members or health-care providers.
Improving the use of diagnostic tools is another priority. With
modern means of transportation that give access even to remote areas,
it is possible to obtain rapid testing of samples in disease control
centers equipped with Biosafety Level 4 laboratories in order to
confirm or rule out Marburg virus infection.

[Marburg virus is one of the viruses responsible for viral
hemorrhagic fevers seen in Africa. The above newswire gives an
excellent description of the virus, clinical manifestations and the
history of Marburg cases and outbreaks since its 1st identification
with the outbreak in Germany in 1967. There is an excellent table
presenting the history of Marburg outbreaks on the CDC website with
links to references published on each of the outbreaks, available
at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/marburg/marburgtable.htm>.
Year (s) / Country / Apparent Susp Origin / Reported No. human cases
/ Reported No. (percent) deaths among cases / Situation.
1967 / Germany & Yugoslavia / Uganda / 32 / 7 (21) / Simultaneous
outbreaks occurred in laboratory workers handling African green
monkeys imported from Uganda [1 -- link to list of references].
1975 / Johannesburg, South Africa / Zimbabwe / 3 / 1 (33) / A man
with a recent travel history to Zimbabwe was admitted to hospital in
South Africa. Infection spread from the man to his traveling
companion and a nurse at the hospital. The man died, but both women
were given vigorous supportive treatment and eventually recovered [2
-- link to list of references].
1980 / Kenya / Kenya / 2 / 1 (50) / Recent travel history included a
visit to Kitum Cave in Kenya's Mount Elgon National Park. Despite
specialized care in Nairobi, the male patient died. A doctor who
attempted resuscitation developed symptoms 9 days later but recovered
[3 -- link to references on outbreak].
1987 / Kenya / Kenya / 1 / 1 (100) / A 15-year-old Danish boy was
hospitalized with a 3-day history of headache, malaise, fever, and
vomiting. Nine days prior to symptom onset, he had visited Kitum Cave
in Mount Elgon National Park. Despite aggressive supportive therapy,
the patient died on the 11th day of illness. No further cases were
detected [4 - link to list of references].
1998-2000 /Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) / Durba, DRC / 154 /
128 (83) / Most cases occurred in young male workers at a gold mine
in Durba, in the north-eastern part of the country, which proved to
be the epicentre of the outbreak. Cases were subsequently detected in
the neighboring village of Watsa [5].
2004-2005 / Angola / Uige Province, Angola / 252 / 227 (90) /
Outbreak believed to have begun in Uige Province in October 2004.
Most cases detected in other provinces have been linked directly to
the outbreak in Uige [6 -- link to list of references].
It is curious that the suspected cases are mine workers, as the
outbreak(s) in the DRC during 1998-2000 occurred predominantly among
workers in a gold mine in Durba - in a province in the DRC near the
border with Uganda, and not that far from Kamwenge where the current
suspected cases occurred. Exposure to bat droppings is postulated to
be a route of infection for filovirus (the isolated Ebola case
related to spelunking in Kenya, and the outbreak in miners in the
Democratic Republic of Congo). The fruit bat has been speculated to
be the asymptomatic reservoir of filoviruses -- both Ebola virus and
Marburg virus. Leroy et al (see ref 1 below) found evidence of
asymptomatic Ebola virus infection in 3 species of fruit bats. In
another study, Swaenopol et al documented experimental infection of
fruit and insectivorous bats with Ebola virus supported replication
and circulation of high titers of virus without necessarily becoming ill.
Of additional note is that in 2000, there was an outbreak of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever Uganda involving 428 cases with 170 deaths (case
fatality rate 43 percent). The outbreak was 1st identified in Gulu
district (396 cases with 158 deaths), but cases were also reported
from Masindi and Mbarara districts (32 cases with 23 deaths) (see
Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Uganda (08) 20010203.0229). Hence, both
Marburg and Ebola viruses are possibilities in Uganda.
More information on these cases from knowledgeable sources would be
appreciated.
