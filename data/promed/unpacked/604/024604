Anthrax is spreading in Koraput district of Odisha, with 2 victims already identified in Medamgandhi village of Patangi block.

The condition of the 2 patients -- SK aged 34 years and SG aged 54 years -- remains critical. "SK has been moved to the district headquarters hospital of Koraput after his condition worsened," said a member of his family.

This bacterial lethal disease affects both humans and domesticated animals and is classified as an acute disease given its potential for spreading rapidly in a short time. ADMO Arun Kumar Padhi made a visit to the village with his medical team to create an awareness program to contain the disease. "We are keeping a close vigil on the disease," Padhi told OST.

As usual, we lack a description of the veterinary service response to this outbreak. The 2 men were probably exposed while butchering a bovine case of anthrax. The sooner that they can initiate a statewide animal control programme, the better. - Mod.MHJ
