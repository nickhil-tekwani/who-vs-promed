Moderator note:
[The poxviruses of animals are classified in 2 sub-families:
- the _Entomopoxvirinae_ which includes 3 genera of poxviruses infecting
invertebrates, and
- the _Chordopoxvirinae_ which comprising 8 genera of viruses infecting
vertebrate hosts. One of these 8 genera is the genus _Parapoxvirus_ which
includes the virus species _Squirrel parapoxvirus_, the virus currently
threatening the red squirrel population of the UK.
A correspondent, Scott Hafner, has provided the following information
expanding on the diversity of parapoxviruses affecting vertebrate hosts.
Viruses in the genus _Parapoxvirus_ exhibit DNA cross-hybridization and
serological cross-reactivity, although they exhibit greater diversity than the
poxviruses of other genera. Further information can be obtained in the 8th
Report of the International Communicatee on Taxonomy of Viruses (published in
2005 by Academic Press under the title "Virus Taxonomy". - Mod.CP]
Text begins:
-----------
The parapoxviruses of animals include: Bovine papular stomatitis virus,
Pseudocowpox virus, Orf virus (sheep and goats) or Contagious ecthyma virus
(cattle), Parapoxvirus of red deer [in New Zealand], and Squirrel parapoxvirus,
The following tentative species are also included in the parapoxvirus genus:
Sealpox virus, Chamois contagious ecthyma virus, Auzdyk disease virus [camels
& sheep?], and Camel contagious ecthyma virus.
There have also been several reports of unclassified parapoxviruses in a wide
range of species (including reindeer).
In addition to orf virus, the bovine parapoxviruses (bovine papular stomatitis
and pseudocowpox) and sealpox virus are well-documented to be zoonotic. Some
of the other animal parapoxviruses are also likely zoonotic.
