Four more hepatitis C cases in Maryland found related to infected worker
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The former lab technician accused of exposing hundreds of people to Hepatitis C is now believed to have more victims here in Baltimore. Federal prosecutors believe the suspect infected dozens of people. All of these new patients were believed to have come in contact with the suspect while being treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

Former traveling medical technician David Kwiatkowski is accused of infecting dozens of patients in several states with the deadly hepatitis C virus. Federal prosecutors say Kwiatkowski, who has the disease, used syringes to inject himself and then later used those syringes on patients.

"I have my ups and downs. Some of it is mentally, thinking about why this guy would have done this to me or anyone else," said a patient [LN] who crossed paths with Kwiatkowski in 2008, while at the VA Hospital in Baltimore. "How does a contract worker come in and not be tested? They could have very well gone out on the street corner and asked someone to give me a needle that was tainted," [LN] said.

Now the Maryland Department of Health says 4 more people have turned up positive, this time from Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Kwaitkowski worked as a temporary employee from July 2009 until January 2010. In a statement, Johns Hopkins Hospital said, "In contracting with staffing agencies, Johns Hopkins insists that such agencies follow a rigorous vetting process prior to assigning any agency personnel to Johns Hopkins, a process which includes health and drug screenings."

In Maryland alone, Kwiatkowski worked at 4 hospitals and over time may have exposed 1700 people to hepatitis C. He's facing 98 years in prison, but [LN] wants more. "Give him the death penalty because that's what we all have," he said. Hepatitis C virus infection attacks the liver and is especially dangerous for people like [LN], who have underlying health conditions.

Kwiatkowski worked in 7 states. So far infections have popped up in Maryland, New Hampshire, and Kansas. [And recently another case in Pennsylvania - see below].

New Hampshire: 5 more people diagnosed with hepatitis C related to travelling medical technician. Total 44 cases in 4 states
-------------------------------------------------------
Five more people have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis C virus that a former traveling hospital worker is accused of spreading through tainted needles, bringing the total to 44 in 4 states. David Kwiatkowski, whom prosecutors have called a "serial infector", is charged with stealing painkillers from New Hampshire's Exeter Hospital and replacing them with saline-filled syringes tainted with his own blood. He pleaded not guilty earlier this month [December 2012] to 14 federal drug charges and has been in jail since his arrest in July [2012].

A total of 32 New Hampshire patients have tested positive for the same strain of the liver-destroying disease [hepatitis C] that Kwiatkowski carries, and a dozen other cases have emerged in some of the 18 hospitals in 7 states where he previously worked.

Maryland health officials announced 4 new cases on Friday [21 Dec 2012], all involving patients at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Kwiatkowski worked from July 2009 to January 2010 [see item [1] above}. The previously reported cases include one from the Baltimore VA Medical Center and 6 from Hays Medical Center in Kansas. Another case has been confirmed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center [UPMC] in Pennsylvania, a hospital spokeswoman told The Associated Press this week.

Over the years, Kwiatkowski was fired twice over allegations of drug use and theft, including from UPMC, where he was just a few weeks into his temporary stint when a co-worker accused him of swiping a fentanyl syringe from an operating room and sticking it down his pants. Citing a lack of evidence, hospital authorities didn't call police, and neither the hospital nor the medical staffing agency that placed him in the job informed the national accreditation organization for radiological technicians.

In Maryland, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said on Friday [21 Dec 2012] that no drug diversion allegations involving Kwiatkowski were reported to the agency during his time there, but the 5 linked cases adds to the concern that such activity took place. The department expects to release a report early next year [2013] on potential vulnerabilities and steps to prevent future outbreaks. Kwiatkowski had been sent to Johns Hopkins by a staffing agency that assured the hospital it had followed a vigorous vetting process, hospital spokeswoman Kim Hoppe said. "This includes a criminal background check, credentials and licensure verification, health and drug screening, and 2 references," she said. "In this case, none of the information that Medical Solutions provided about this health care worker suggested a history of drug diversion or any other criminal activity."

[The number of patients diagnosed with hepatitis C virus infection has increased from 31 to 44 among the estimated more than 1700 patents exposed to infection by the activities of this "travelling" technician, now in detention. Alarming administrative lapses in hospital administration and medical staffing agencies continue to be revealed.

Further information on the progress of the official investigation into these unfortunate events is awaited with interest and with some alarm by those exposed to hepatitis C virus infection by this route during hospital treatment. - Mod.CP
