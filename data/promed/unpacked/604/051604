Outbreak of legionellosis in Stavanger, Norway
----------------------------------------------
The first ever outbreak of legionellosis reported in Norway has been
detected in the city of Stavanger, which is on the west coast and has a
population of 100 000. As of 29 Aug 2001, 14 cases had been reported, with
the first case on 26 Jul 2001. All cases have had a clinical presentation
compatible with legionellosis. A total of 13 cases have been confirmed by
legionella antigen test in urine [and/or? Mod.SH] by culture of respiratory
secretions (11 men and 3 women, aged 20-94 years). One confirmed and one
suspected case have died.
Nine of the patients are residents of Stavanger but live far apart. The
others have visited Stavanger since mid-July. The local health authorities
are investigating the outbreak in collaboration with Statens institutt for
folkehelse (National Institute of Public Health, NIPH) in Oslo.
Stavanger is the land base for the offshore oil industry in Norway and also
receives large numbers of tourists in the summer. NIPH would like to
receive immediate reports of cases who have visited Stavanger this summer.

[I searched both the GIDEON and PubMed databases, and this does indeed
appear to be the first reported outbreak of legionellosis for Norway. Prior
cases reported have acquired infections while Norwegians were travelling
abroad. - Mod.ES]
