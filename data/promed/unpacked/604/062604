Just by way of background, I'm receiving reports lately that the
present Argentine economic crisis has hit the rural and ranching
sectors especially hard, and cattle herd caretaking is among the
casualties.

Rising fuel prices were apparently the trigger of the crisis. Since
the gauchos mostly traded their horses for motor vehicles long ago,
and since following herds burns fuel, vigilance against disease,
predation, rustling, etc. is down. Since cattle are not worth enough
at market to pay for their transport under present conditions, there is
less concern about losses than there was 6 months or a year ago.

I last heard about cases of herd neglect in Argentina probably 6-7
years ago, maybe longer. It isn't something the Argentine humane
community mentions often, so when it is mentioned, I tend to notice.

Not everything that Clifton says is correct, but he has a fairly
accurate view of the crisis the farmers are going through at this time
in Argentina.

Regarding the cattle operations, farmers are still monitoring herd
health, but they are culling females. As a result, they are estimating
that there will be a shortage of females (in the millions) for
breeding later this year [2008]. A relocation of cattle operations in
the coastal area (Entre Rios, Chaco, Corrientes) has been observed,
although the province of Buenos Aires is the leader in cattle
ranching, with 22 million head of cattle. [The 3 provinces mentioned
are not coastal. Perhaps what was meant was "to" the coastal area from
those provinces? - Mod.MJ/JW]

[I apologize for the delay in posting this, but I needed to have a
reliable translation of Ramon's reply.

The implications of the governmental financial pressures on Argentine
farmers are going to have wide implications, and we certainly haven't
seen the end of them yet, maybe not even all the beginnings.

When the ranchers go to buy replacement heifers in the spring, and
there is a lack of them, this will put the price up, and some will cut
corners to get their numbers. This could well result in cattle
smuggling, imports with questionable health papers, and the appearance
of diseases that had been under firm control or eradicated.

I well remember, after the 1967-68 FMD epidemic in the UK, that MAFF
[the former UK ministry of agriculture] advised farmers to take care
when buying replacements, but in Cheshire, a not insignificant number
of them still went out and bought "bargain" animals that were from
brucellar reactor [diseased] herds, with the usual expensive results.
I doubt whether Argentine ranchers are any different.

Our thanks to Merritt and Ramon for their comments. - Mod MHJ]
