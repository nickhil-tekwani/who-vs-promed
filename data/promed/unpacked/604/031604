Corpus Christi health officials have found a 2nd mosquito test pool with Saint Louis encephalitis [virus] in the city. Pools were also found in Robstown and Kingsville.

Late Thursday [27 Aug 2020], city officials said a mosquito pool collected in the 1200 block of Main Drive contained Saint Louis Encephalitis, or SLE [virus], according to a news release.

The 1st mosquito pool with SLE was found earlier this month [August 2020] in the 400 block of Bartlett Street. The newest pool was found 7 miles away, the release states.

There are no reported human cases of SLE in Nueces County, the release states.

An SLE positive mosquito pool was found in the San Pedro neighborhood in Robstown, city officials said on the city's Facebook page. The city and Nueces County Public Works will spray for mosquitoes in the area nightly until no mosquitoes test positive, the post reads.

On 26 Aug [2020], 2 trapped mosquitoes tested positive for SLE [virus] in Kingsville. The pools were trapped in an alley on the corner of E. Cesar Avenue and Hall Street, according to a news release. Another was found in a drainage ditch on North 5th Street and West Santa Gertrudis Avenue. Crews will also work to spray for mosquitoes in those areas.

There are no reported human infections of SLE in the Kleberg County, the release states.

SLE is a viral disease spread to people by a bite from an infected mosquito. Most people will show no illness.

Symptoms of SLE can include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness, the release states. "Severe neuro-invasive disease (often involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) occurs more commonly in older adults," the release reads. The release recommends residents consult their doctor if they begin to feel ill after being bitten by a mosquito.

[SLE virus is found very sporadically in Texas. The last ProMED-mail posting of human cases was in 2010 (see St. Louis encephalitis - USA (03): (TX) conf. 20101103.3975), and those occurred in Nueces County also. From 1990 to 2010, 74 people in Texas tested positive for St. Louis encephalitis virus infection, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Unlike West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis comes in spurts, and most years, there are no cases of the mosquito-borne disease found in humans, according to state records. The last Texas death from the virus was in 1995.

The virus also is found in the southeastern USA with occasional incursions into the midwestern states and in the western states of California and Arizona. The USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that less than 1% of St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) infections are clinically apparent, and the vast majority of infections remain undiagnosed (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/technical/symptoms.html).

Wild birds are the SLE virus reservoir hosts, and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are the vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the above report. - Mod.TY
