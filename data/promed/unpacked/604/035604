In Azerbaijan, the number of areas in which Schmallenberg virus [SBV] has been found in cattle reached 26, in 9 regions. This has been told to Salam News by the Head of the State Veterinary Service, Sial Rustamov.

According to her, since yesterday [21 Aug 2013] when the virus was found in 17 districts, the number has now risen to 26.

"This virus is spreading rapidly. Initially, it was detected in the areas of Aran-Imishli, Neftchala, Salyan, Sabirabad, Kurdamir, Beylagan and others, but now its presence has been revealed in animals in Ismayilli, Gabala, Agsu, Astara, Khojavend and Gobustan. Overall, around 22-25 percent of the cattle in 26 areas are infected with this transmissible virus."

[The initial detection of SBV, a teratogenic orthobunyavirus in ruminants, as a novel entity led the 1st infected countries (2011, 2012) to report it to the OIE as an "emerging disease". The definition of such a disease, according to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, is "a new infection or infestation resulting from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic agent, a known infection or infestation spreading to a new geographic area or population, or a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the 1st time and which has a significant impact on animal or public health". In May 2012, the said 9 countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, UK, Luxembourg, Spain, Italy and Switzerland) discontinued their reporting of SBV to the OIE, declaring that they did not regard the virus, which got widely disseminated within their respective territories, as "emerging" anymore, and since SBV is not listed by the OIE among its reportable diseases. Since then, the virus has been reported from at least 14 additional countries, but no immediate notifications about that have been submitted to the OIE. Some of these counties included information in their annual reports. The additional countries are: Czech Republic, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Serbia and Kazakhstan. Romania's situation is, at present, unclear; initially it was suspected to be infected (based upon serological evidence in cattle), but the serological results are to be rechecked.

It will be interesting to obtain information on the laboratory evidence for the claimed SBV infection in Azerbaijan as well as about possible clinical observations there. In February 2012, the Azerbaijani News source ABC.AZ wrote:
"Azerbaijan, which is importing actively breeding stock from countries hit by the new virus [SBV], has neither imposed any restrictions nor announced toughening of border veterinary control. As a result, one cannot rule out that Schmallenberg has been already on the territory of Azerbaijan. (http://abc.az/eng/news/61905.html)

Azerbaijan's cattle population is 2 681 866 (OIE's 2012 data).

SBV has also been suspected in Turkey, based upon serology (see ProMED-mail post 20130510.1704469); a request for additional information or confirmation from another laboratory is pending.

The possible presence of SBV in South Africa has been put to discussion in a recent paper:
Leask, R., Botha, A.M. & Bath, G.F., 2013, 'Schmallenberg virus -- Is it present in South Africa?', Journal of the South African Veterinary Association 84(1), Art. #535, 4 pages. http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/jsava.v84i1.535.

The international status of SBV, probably including its reporting requirements and certification for international trade in animals and their products, is expected to be addressed by an OIE experts forum in September 2013. - Mod.AS

First detection of Schmallenberg virus in elk (Alces alces) indicating infection of wildlife in Bia owie a National Park in Poland
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Schmallenberg virus (SBV) RNA was detected in the serum of an elk (_Alces alces_) calf captured on the outskirts of Bialowieza National Park (BNP) in December 2012, and shortly afterwards the calf died of acute bronchopneumonia. Serum samples from 169 animals, including bison, red and fallow deer, originating from 8 locations situated in 4 Polish Provinces, were tested for the presence of SBV-specific antibodies between 2011 and 2013. Although no antibodies were found in samples collected up to July 2012, positive samples subsequently appeared between November 2012 and January 2013 in all of the sampled regions. The introduction of SBV infection to the European bison (_Bison bonasus_) population of BNP between July and November 2012 was also confirmed.

[The paper's data are:
Larska, M., Krzysiak, M., Smreczak, M., Polak, M.P., Zmudzinski, J.F., First detection of Schmallenberg virus in elk (_Alces alces_) indicating infection of wildlife in Bialowieza National Park in Poland, The Veterinary Journal (2013), doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.08.013.

The following concluding remarks in the original text may be of interest to subscribers (references omitted):

"These results may indicate a 'reverse-direction' to the SBV epizootic from that
described in Western Europe (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/doc/360e.pdf) and suggest movement and trade in domestic animals may be underestimated in terms of their role in SBV transmission. The high SBV infection rate in bison may reflect a particular species susceptibility: bison are more closely related genetically to domestic ruminants than are cervid species.

"Furthermore, the high density and favoured location of the bison population in the BNP may have resulted in their more frequent contact with _Culicoides_ spp. The overall increase in the proportion of SBV-affected wild ruminants to 50 percent and 43 percent in November and December 2012, respectively, may be also connected to the peak of midge activity in the autumn months.

"Infection of a single bison was reported by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Clinical consequences of virus transmission might be expected in the offspring of bison and red deer between approximately May and September 2013 as the emergence of the virus coincided with the period of greatest susceptibility to SBV infection, namely, early pregnancy prior to fetal immunocompetence".

The paper highlights a significant additional aspect of the SBV issue, namely its potential impact upon (protected) wildlife. - Mod.AS
