[1] Panicle blight, rice - Louisiana, Texas

Panicle blight is affecting Louisiana rice as farmers in the southern
end of the state are gearing up for harvest, according to Johnny
Saichuk, Louisiana State University (LSU). He said that conditions
have been ideal for the disease with hot nighttime temperatures when
the rice plants were flowering.

He said the problem is not isolated to Louisiana. "Rice in Texas is
getting nailed."

Saichuk said the best prevention for panicle blight is to plant early
so the plants are in the flowering stage before the hottest days of
summer. The disease effects differ among varieties. 'Jupiter' appears
to have resistance, while CL111 is susceptible.

Saichuk estimated Louisiana has 550 000 acres [222 580 ha] of rice
this year [2010], roughly 80 000 acres [32 375 ha] more than 2009. He
said the crop was planted late, and farmers were late to flood their
fields.

[2] Phytophthora blight, pumpkin - Illinois

A wet [2010] spring has experts worried about blight that could have
an effect on the Illinois pumpkin crop. Because 95 percent of the
nation's processing pumpkins are raised in central and southern
Illinois, the possibility of blight in this area is a big concern,
said Mohammad Babadoost, University of Illinois.

"Some of the fields have heavy blight due to the wet conditions
earlier in the growing season," he said. "Right now we're scouting
and monitoring to see how we can save the crop. The blight is a nasty
pathogen. I've seen it destroy entire fields," he said. "When the
pumpkin industry experiences loss, it affects our state's economy."

The same pathogen nearly destroyed the state's pumpkin industry in
1999, said Babadoost. "Management of this disease requires intensive
work. To prevent this disease, we recommend crop rotation, followed
by seed treatment and routine scouting, especially of low areas in
fields." Fungicides can also can be applied if there is no standing
water in the fields. The pathogen may be present in run-off [water
from infested fields].

[[Panicle blight, rice
---------------------
_Burkholderia glumae_ (previously _Pseudomonas glumae_) causes
bacterial panicle blight of rice as well as bacterial wilts in a
number of other field crops. It has been known in Japan since 1955
and has recently also been reported in other rice-producing countries
around the world. For example, in the late 1990's it caused
devastating yield losses in Bengal, India, and several outbreaks have
resulted in severe crop losses in the southern USA. It is considered
an emerging disease in Colombia (ProMED-mail post 20090921.3315).

Symptoms may include sheath, seedling and grain rots, as well as
abortion of florets resulting in greatly reduced grain filling and
the potential for yield losses as high as 40 percent. Disease
development is favoured by warm temperatures. Despite its economic
importance, virulence mechanisms of _B. glumae_ are poorly
understood. The pathogen is carried on the seed and is often present
in commercial rice seed. No complete resistance has been identified
anywhere in the world, but cultivars with reduced sensitivity are
available (such as 'Jupiter' mentioned in item 1) and resistance
breeding programmes are in progress.

Phytophthora blight, pumpkin
----------------------------
Several different species of fungus-like organisms in the genus
_Phytophthora_ cause root, crown, and fruit rots of cucurbit and
solanaceous vegetable crops, but _P. capsici_ is the most common
species affecting pumpkin. The disease is favoured by free moisture
and infections typically appear first in low areas where the soil
remains wet for longer. It can affect pumpkin plants of all ages and
may also lead to damping-off of seedlings. Symptoms of rotting and
tissue collapse may appear on fruit, vines and foliage, and the
disease can lead to total crop loss.

The pathogen is soil borne and is spread by water, infected plant
material, and mechanical means. As described in item 2, disease
management requires an integrated approach including crop rotation of
several years with non-host species, cultural methods to reduce soil
moisture, phytosanitation to prevent spread to new fields, as well as
fungicide treatments of seeds and crops.

Around 40 host species are known for _P. capsici_ strains, and this
pathogen also causes, for example, quick wilt of pepper (_Piper
nigrum_, see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below).
