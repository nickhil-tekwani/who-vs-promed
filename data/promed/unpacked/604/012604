[Red sea bream iridoviral disease (RSIVD) is caused by infection with red sea bream iridovirus.

RSIVD is a significant cause of mortality in farmed red sea bream (_Pagrus major_) and more than 30 other species of cultured marine fish belonging mainly to the orders Perciformes and Pleuronectiformes. The 1st outbreak of RSIVD was recorded in cultured red sea bream in Shikoku Island, Japan in 1990. Since then, the disease has caused mass mortalities in cultured fish populations in the western part of Japan, mainly among juvenile red sea bream. Affected fish become lethargic, exhibit severe anaemia, petechiae of the gills, and enlargement of the spleen.

The disease is characterised by the appearance of enlarged cells stained deeply with Giemsa solution in the histopathological observations of the spleen, heart, kidney, intestine and gill of infected fish.

Recently, it has been proved that the disease is caused not only by RSIV, but also by infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV). The disease is found not only in Japan but also widely in East and South-East Asian countries.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2017, Chapter 2.3.8 "Red sea bream iridoviral disease," http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_rsbid.htm
