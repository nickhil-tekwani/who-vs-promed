One more patient suffering from fever died in the Kadarsha ni Naal area of the Walled City [Surat, Gujarat state] on Wednesday [9 Oct 2013]. A total of 4 deaths in the last 2 days resulting from a mysterious illness have led to a scare in the area with the locals suspecting outbreak of leptospirosis. However, health department officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) maintain that deaths are not due to leptospirosis or dengue fever. A total of 3 samples have been [sent] to National Institute of Virology (NIV) at Pune to ascertain the cause of deaths.

A 22-year-old man died in the area on Wednesday after 4 days of acute fever, cough and having thrown up blood in Maskati Hospital. A social worker in the area said, "People are scared, and if the deaths don't stop they might flee the place." Dr KI Khatri, health officer of central zone of SMC said, "The cause of death is shown as acute viral hemorrhagic fever by the hospital authorities. All the deceased have shown the same signs of high fever, cough, cold, and have vomited blood."

"Once the sample reports come from NIV, we would be able to treat the people better," said Dr Hemant Desai, chief medical officer of SMC. At present there are 7 patients from the area undergoing treatment in different hospitals. The locals claim that the number is 15. The SMC is carrying out a door-to-door survey and people showing symptoms of fever are being given treatment. Officials claim that the people are suffering from some kind of viral infection. They suspect that it might have spread to many people in the area that was badly affected during the recent floods. The health department has undertaken a massive sanitation operation in the area.

[Insufficient information is provided in this report to suggest a possible aetiology. It is not clear even that the condition is infectious. There have been 4 deaths and no more than 15 people are receiving treatment. Until the results of investigations by the National Institute of Virology in Pune are released, it cannot be assumed that the illness is the result of virus infection. The most likely aetiology -- leptospirosis -- appears to have been excluded. Further information is awaited.
