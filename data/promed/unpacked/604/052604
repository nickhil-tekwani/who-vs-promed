The South Dakota Animal Industry Board reported Tuesday [27 Sep 2022] that several unvaccinated cattle in Meade County have died from anthrax. South Dakota State Veterinarian Dr. Beth Thompson said the infected cattle were part of a herd of 160 animals that had not received the anthrax vaccine.

The Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at South Dakota State University confirmed the disease from samples submitted over the weekend. This is the 1st appearance of anthrax infection this year [2022], Thompson said.

Thompson said anthrax is an economically devastating disease for the livestock industry because it can cause the rapid loss of many animals in a short time. Affected livestock are often found dead with no illness detected. Anthrax spores survive indefinitely in contaminated soil, and much of South Dakota has the potential of experiencing an outbreak, Thompson said.

Significant climate change, such as drought, floods and winds, can expose anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Alkaline soils, high humidity and high temperatures present conditions for anthrax spores to vegetate and become infectious to grazing livestock, she said.

Thompson said strict enforcement of quarantines and proper burning and burying of carcasses suspected to have died from anthrax is important to prevent further soil contamination with the bacterial spores.

"During the summer, producers should take time to check all cattle frequently and promptly investigate any unexpected deaths on pasture, whether in cows, bulls or calves," Thompson said. "With anthrax and many other diseases, treatments and preventive measures are available, and prompt action can help prevent excessive losses."

If a producer suspects anthrax, Thompson said the case should be reported immediately to local veterinarians or to the state veterinarian at 605-773-3321. Suspect carcasses should not be moved or disturbed until a diagnosis has been made.

Anthrax has been confirmed in South Dakota livestock for the 1st time this year [2022]. According to South Dakota State Veterinarian, Dr. Beth Thompson, several unvaccinated cattle died in Meade County. An SDSU [South Dakota State University] lab confirmed anthrax as the cause.

Thompson said the vaccine is highly effective. "One of the best things that a rancher can be doing is working with their veterinarian. There are vaccines out there that we highly recommend prior to livestock going out on pasture," Thompson said. Thompson said the state does not track how many livestock are vaccinated.

Anthrax can be an economically devastating disease for the livestock industry because it can kill many animals very quickly. Infected livestock are often found dead with no illness detected.

The bacterial anthrax spores survive indefinitely in contaminated soil, and much of South Dakota has the potential of experiencing an outbreak, according to Russ Daly, the state public health veterinarian with SDSU Extension.

"For people raising livestock out there, if they see any unexplained death, contact your veterinarian right away. The sooner you get that diagnosed, the sooner you can protect the other animals in the herd," Daly said. "This is not the same as the anthrax that we saw sent in the letters [after 9/11], but people still have to be careful around it."

Daly said temperatures and humidity make anthrax spores more infectious to grazing livestock.

[Meade County is in western South Dakota, near but not on the border with Montana and Wyoming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meade_County,_South_Dakota). For a better map, see https://maps.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/southdakota_90.jpg.

A report in 2005 lists outbreaks in Butte and Meade counties in 2002, but none of the ProMED reports for 2002 have an actual report. The 2005 report, listed below in the See Also section, states: "In 2002, 9 cases were reported and 53 cattle in Butte and Meade counties died." While the outbreak reporting from South Dakota is generally good, we cannot assume that it is 100%. And although our history indicates a gap of 20 years for Meade County, there may have been other outbreaks since.

Historically livestock anthrax is more common on the eastern border of South Dakota, not in the western half of the state. Over decades of hard work by the South Dakota veterinary office firmly encouraging annual vaccination, and especially in counties experiencing outbreaks, they have reduced anthrax to be truly sporadic. It is always the procrastinating owners delaying vaccination that publicly show that the risk persists.

While claims are made that anthrax spores are effectively immortal, the reality is otherwise. Spores at the soil surface will become apathogenic in about 5-7 years when they become phage negative. On the other hand, rain can stimulate spore germination among the turf grazing roots, causing multiplication and resporulation, giving them a few more years. And soil excavation can dig up spores in relation to a long buried carcass and spread them on the surface. While one will always be proven wrong, experience says that if you go 8 or so years without any outbreaks, it is effectively eradicated from that area. Obviously something happened here to initiate its reappearance.

As a long shot, it might be that we are witnessing the emergence of a latent infection in stock purchased from another ranch in that region that had been suffering outbreaks in recent years. For reference as to latent anthrax infections, see the article by Gainer et al (Gainer RS, Vergnaud G, Hugh-Jones ME. A review of arguments for the existence of latent infections of _Bacillus anthracis_, and research needed to understand their role in the outbreaks of anthrax.
