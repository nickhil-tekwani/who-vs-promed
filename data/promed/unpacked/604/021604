The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture is urging horse owners once again
to vaccinate their animals for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) after the
diseases was confirmed in an 8 year old Belgian mare that died last month
in Turtle Lake.
State acting veterinarian Dr Robert Ehlenfeldt says both the Wisconsin
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the National Veterinary Services
Laboratory showed positive test results of EEE from the horse, which had
been vaccinated 2 days earlier. Another horse on the same farm had died the
same week, but was not tested.
Ehlenfeldt says the mosquitoborne disease can also strike humans.
Infections in humans range from a mild illness with flu-like symptoms to
severe, and sometimes, fatal illness. There is no vaccination available for
humans, and no human cases have been reported in Wisconsin this year.
"Just like West Nile virus, EEE is preventable in horses with vaccination,"
said Ehlenfeldt said. "The vaccination is effective, and you ought to be
vaccinating your animals every year -- preferably in the spring before the
first mosquito hatch. Most of the EEE vaccine manufacturers also direct on
their labels that horses should be revaccinated in the event of an outbreak."
In 2001, Wisconsin lost 42 horses to the virus. At that time, most of the
cases were in north western counties.

immune response. In all probability the animal already had the disease when
vaccinated. ­ Mod.TG]
