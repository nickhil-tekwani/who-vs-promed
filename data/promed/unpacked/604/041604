No clue to mystery fever in Dakshina Kannada
-------------------------------------------------
The district health authorities have not yet been able to pinpoint the
cause of the mysterious viral fever which surfaced near Guthigaru here,
claiming one life and affecting as many as 27 people.
One doctor from a hospital in Mangalore said the probable cause was "viral
meningoencephalitis." As of now, the Guthigaru PHC personnel have taken 37
blood samples, of which 10 have been sent to the Viral Diagnostic Lab in
Shimoga to test for Kyasanur Forest disease; 9 to Victoria Hospital,
Bangalore, to test for Japanese encephalitis; and others to Wenlock
Hospital, Mangalore, to test for dengue.
He said tests at Mangalore had ruled out dengue, and the reports from
Bangalore and Shimoga were expected by Saturday, following which accurate
treatment could be started. The mysterious fever has affected 10 percent of
the population in Charmatha and Nadugalu areas of Guthigaru PHC sub-centre.
These are small hamlets, the combined population of which is about 486 (105
families). Dr Srirangappa, taluk [disrict] health officer, told The Times of
India they had received the first case about 2 weeks ago, though the 1st
incident was reported a month ago [mid-March 2004].
He said most of the cases were treated at private hospitals, as it was
perceived to be normal viral fever. "When the cases went up and patients
started having relapses, they were brought to Sullia Community Health
Centre," he said.
Giving details of symptoms, the doctor said patients have high fever,
followed by chills and rigours. The fever subsides after symptomatic
treatment, but relapses after a week, with severe headache followed by
vomiting, which if not treated on time, leads to complications.
Referring to the case [aged 48] from Charmatha, who died due to fever a few
days ago, Dr Srirangappa said he had not treated the patient. [The case] was
first taken to a private hospital and, after developing complications, was
shifted to Mangalore. Dr Srirangappa denied initial reports that it was
dengue, saying that a local laboratory had misdiagnosed the blood sample. The
2nd sample taken by health authorities tested negative for dengue.
Dr Srirangappa suspects that the fever may be transmitted by animals (like
the monkey disease also known as Kyasanur Forest disease), as most of the
affected lived in the vicinity of the forest. He has advised patients not
to panic if the fever recurs, but to get treatment. Incidentally, this area
was in the news during 2003 also due to dengue, [when] extensive fogging
operations were taken up and people were educated on combating the disease.
Fogging operations have [also] been taken up this time round.
The health officials have opened a treatment centre at Nadugallu school
with 2 doctors and additional staff to monitor the health of the population
in the 2 villages as well as surrounding areas.

[As mentioned in the newswire, possible explanations for this outbreak
include dengue fever and Kyasanur Forest disease. The latter (see
references below) was responsible for an outbreak in Dakshina Kannada
district in 2003, the location of outbreak described above. More
information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
