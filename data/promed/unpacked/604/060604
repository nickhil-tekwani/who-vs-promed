A comment on person-to-person transmission of Nipah virus
-----------------------------------------------
Extensive human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has been reported by
the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh
(ICCDRB) in conjunction with the Nipah outbreak that occurred in Faridpur,
Bangladesh during February-April 2004 [see ProMED-Mail post "Nipah virus -
Bangladesh (Faridpur) confirmed 20040420.1102"].
The ICCDRB online report states that "Preliminary epidemiologic evidence
clearly indicates that Nipah virus was primarily spread from
person-to-person during this outbreak," and that the Faridpur disease
cluster was associated with an acute respiratory distress syndrome not
previously documented as a feature of Nipah virus infection elsewhere.
Investigations by ICCDRB indicate that there may have been 33 cases of
direct human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus during the 2004 outbreak
in Faridpur, which resulted in 36 confirmed human cases of Nipah virus
infection and 27 known fatalities. Most cases of human-to-human
transmission reportedly occurred among relatives who had cared for
severely-ill family members, although 2 cases of evident human transmission
resulting from one-time exposures to infected patients are also reported
(Reference: ICCDRB. Person-to-person transmission of Nipah virus during an
outbreak in Faridpur District, 2004. Health and Science Bulletin 2(2) June 2004

ClassificationID=0>).
