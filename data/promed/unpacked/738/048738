Milk poisoning 'deliberate'?
----------------
A milk poisoning case that has killed 3 children, left others blind, and
affected 3000 in total may have been a deliberate act, a report said on
Wednesday.

Local media in northeastern Liaoning province have reported thousands of
children fell ill after drinking the locally manufactured soya milk
recommended by the local education commission on 19 Mar 2003.

More than 200 pupils and their parents on Monday arrived in Beijing to seek
better treatment.

A doctor quoted by the China Daily from the Beijing Children's Hospital
said it was "obviously" a case of food poisoning.

"I am afraid someone has intentionally put poison into the milk, as the
urinary albumin and phosphate indices are strangely higher than normal
figures," said the doctor, who was not named.

A representative from the Anshan Baorun Milk Co, said to be the milk's
manufacturer, was quoted by the paper as saying that a competitor was to blame.

"The health and epidemic prevention authorities have proven our products
are up to the national standard," said the representative, surnamed Han.

The Haicheng City Education Commission said the incident was still being
investigated.

According to local media reports, the children have experienced stomach
aches, headaches, dizziness, and twitching. The edges of many children's
eyes, noses, and mouths went black and blue.

Earlier this month, nearly 400 people fell ill, with 60 hospitalized, after
they ate bacteria-laden ham at a restaurant in central China's Henan province.

It follows an incident in September when 42 people died out of around 300
poisoned by breakfast snacks laced with rat poison in the Tangshan township
of the eastern city of Nanjing. A rival snackshop owner was later executed
for the crime.

[The information regarding clinical signs is somewhat vague. However, if
lips and mouths are turning blue, it may be an indication of a toxicant,
such as nitrate/nitrite, which turns the blood dark and renders it unable
to adequately carry oxygen. Clinical signs of nitrite poisoning may include
intense cyanosis, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, collapse, spasms of
abdominal pain, rapid heart beat, irregular breathing, coma, convulsions,
and death due to circulatory collapse. The estimated lethal dose is 1 to 2
grams. - Mod.TG]
