A 24-year-old man is admitted to intensive care for a possible case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. 3 months ago he had come to Bariloche [Río Negro province] to work.

According to information given to Bariloche Opina by the Director of the Zonal Hospital, Mercedes Iberó, the patient was admitted in the past few hours with all compatible symptoms of [a] hantavirus [infection].

Nevertheless, the results of the samples sent to the Malbrán Institute in Buenos Aires are still awaited to confirm the diagnosis.

The young man worked clearing weeds and apparently did not have the corresponding protective measures such as good quality face masks, and their replacement every 8 hours.

[Andes virus seems likely in this case. This virus is endemic in the Andean region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Weed cutting may have been the possible exposure to Andes virus with contact with the rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
