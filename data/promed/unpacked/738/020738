An outbreak of bird flu at a country estate in north Wales was
confirmed today [24 May 2007], but does not involve the deadly H5N1
strain of the virus. Christianne Glossop, Wales's chief vet, made the
announcement after tests were carried out at the unnamed farm in
Denbighshire. She said the strain is H7N2 low pathogenic avian
influenza [LPAI], which is different from the highly pathogenic
[HPAI] H5N1 strain currently circulating in Asia.
Speaking in Cardiff today [24 May 2007], Dr Glossop said the farm's
owners called in experts after 11 Rhode Island chickens died over the
past 2 weeks. "Wales and Great Britain contingency plans have been
activated and, in line with these, the farm has been placed under
restrictions," she said. "A 1 km (0.62 mi) restriction zone has been
placed around the affected premises, details of which will be posted
on [their] website this afternoon." Within the zone, birds and bird
products can't be moved. Bird gatherings may only take place under
licence. We are not yet asking bird keepers within the zone to bring
their birds indoors."
Earlier this year [2007], concerns over the possible spread of bird
flu led to around 159 000 healthy turkeys being slaughtered at a
Bernard Matthews plant in Holton, Suffolk. A report into the
incident, published by the Department for Environment, Food, and
Rural Affairs, failed to uncover any proven source of the virus
outbreak. However, experts at the Veterinary Laboratory Agency found
there was a 99.96 percent genetic similarity between the strain of
the virus found at the plant and that which infected geese in
southern Hungary last year [2006].
In October 2005, Dr Glossop confirmed that Wales had a detailed
contingency plan in place in case of an outbreak. "We know exactly
how we would manage everything, from the name of the operations
director all the way down to who does what and where, so we are ready
for an outbreak," she said.
"One of the difficulties here is that we can't protect ourselves from
wild birds flying into Britain, and so that avenue of protection is
not open to us." Since the outbreak in Suffolk, thousands of people
working with poultry in Britain have been offered winter flu
vaccinations in an attempt to avoid a pandemic taking hold. The GBP
500 000 (USD 992 600) initiative has identified 60 000 people working
with flocks on egg or chicken farms, as well as those who slaughter
birds or clean or handle dead birds in the meat production industry.

[2] H7N2 AI (North Wales), confirmed
Date: Thu 24 May 2007
Source: Welsh Assembly Government Press Release [edited]
<http://new.wales.gov.uk/news/presreleasearchive/1469510/?lang=en>
The Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales, Dr Christianne Glossop, has
confirmed a case of avian influenza in birds in North Wales. The
strain identified is H7N2 low pathogenic avian influenza. The strain
is different to the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain currently
circulating in Southeast Asia, and in Europe last year [2006]. GB
(Great Britain) and Wales contingency plans have been activated. In
line with this, the farm has been placed under restriction and a 1 km
(0.62 mi) restriction zone has been placed around the infected
premises. Within this zone, birds and bird products cannot be moved,
bird gatherings can only take place under licence from Animal Health,
we are advising poultry keepers to observe strict biosecurity measures.
The 30 remaining birds on the farm are being slaughtered today [24
May 2007], and the source of infection is being investigated.
[The government] would like to remind poultry keepers to report any
suspicious signs of a notifiable avian disease to their local Animal
Health Divisional Office [at the numbers below]. Members of the
National Poultry Register will receive updates by text.
Avian influenza is a disease of birds. It is very rare for humans to
become infected and even then, it is normally associated with close
contact with infected birds. The risk to the health of the general
public is very low.
Routine tests are being carried out on people who work on the farm
and anybody else who has been in close contact. The small number of
people who have potentially come into contact is very low. There are
no on-going risks to the public but if people have concerns NHS
[National Health Service] Direct is always available for general
health advice. The NHS Direct number is 0845 46 47. Further
information is available from

Notes
-----
All avian influenzas (H1 to H16) can be low pathogenic but only H5
and H7 have been shown to have the potential to become highly pathogenic.
The 1km (0.62 mi) zone restricts the movement of poultry, poultry
products and eggs, additional biosecurity measures must be taken, and
gatherings can only take place under licence from Animal Health.
Poultry keepers within the zone will not be asked to house their
birds, however good biosecurity measures are encouraged. The Food
Standards Agency advises that avian flu does not pose a food safety
risk for UK consumers. The risk of people getting avian influenza
from eating poultry meat and eggs is low.

[In April of 2006, an H7N3 low pathogenicity avian influenza, (LPAI)
was identified on 3 farms near Dereham, Norfolk in the UK, and also
appeared in the Netherlands. These events should not be confused with
the occurrence of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, which is highly
pathogenic and caused mortality, in turkeys in the UK last February
(2007) - see references below.
The occurrence of low pathogenicity avian influenza is a
well-recognized phenomenon in many countries. All H5 and H7 LPAIs
must be reported and birds culled because of the potential to evolve
highly pathogenic strains, should they continue to circulate in a
poultry population.
In this case, the farm seems to be a relatively small holding that
recently purchased Rhode Island chickens as additions to the flock.
The remaining birds are now being culled. The potential for spread of
this virus is not as great as if it were to have been the H5N1
strains that are currently being reported as circulating in Ghana,
Nigeria, Viet Nam, India, and Pakistan. - Mod.PC]
