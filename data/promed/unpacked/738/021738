Philippines: Increased Number of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Cases on Mindanao
--------------------------------------------------
The Cotabato Regional and Medical Center (CRMC) here has recorded 41
additional dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in late May 2003. Early [in
May], it recorded 344 cases. Health authorities in South-central
Mindanao blamed the rainy season for the increase in the number of
mosquito-related diseases. Of the 41 new cases, 21 came from remote
and low-lying villages here, and the rest from nearby towns in North
Cotabato, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur.
Despite the rise, however, CRMC Chief Dr. Ariadne Silongan said there
is no cause for panic. "We already expected the number of dengue
cases to increase this rainy season but we do manage it very well,"
said Silongan in an interview over Catholic-run dxMS. The Department
of Health (DOH) in the region has monitored some 400 cases of dengue.
Only 5 deaths have been reported so far.

Singapore: Doubling in Number of Dengue Fever Cases
---------------------------------------------------
The hot weather and a cyclical change in the dominant strain of
dengue here could explain why doctors are seeing a doubling in the
number of cases this year. With 50 to 100 cases being reported
weekly, figures for the first half of this year are twice as high as
the same period last year, said SARS Combat Team Chief Khaw Boon Wan
on Sun 25 May 2003.
The National Environment Agency (NEA) stated that: "During an El Nino
period like the one we are in now, the warmer temperatures favour the
[multiplication] of the virus in mosquitoes. This efficient
[multiplication] translates into increased transmission of dengue
virus, as is evident in the increase in cases, not only in Singapore
but in many parts of the world. The number of dengue fever cases from
January to April [in 2003] -- 1601 -- is close to the 1786 cases for
the same period in 1998, when the El Nino effect was at its worst."
El Nino is a weather phenomenon caused by a build-up of warm surface
water in the Pacific Ocean, which affects wind direction and results
in hotter weather. For example, the average temperature this month is
28.8 deg C instead of the usual 28.2 deg C, said the Meteorological
Services Division.
Another possible reason for the recent rise in the number of
infections could be a change in the dominant strain [serotype?] of
dengue virus, suggested tropical medicine and infectious diseases
expert Oon Chong Teik.
He explained that 4 different [serotypes] of dengue virus exist, one
of which [may] become dominant at a point in time, and infect a
majority of people. Patients who are infected by one particular
strain develop an immunity to it after they recover, but they are
still vulnerable to the other strains. Every one to 3 years, for
unknown reasons, another strain [serotype?] of the virus becomes
dominant, and the number of cases then tends to increase sharply
because many people are not immune to it, he said.
The situation this year has been complicated by SARS, because both
viral diseases share some common symptoms -- high fever, body aches,
and in some cases, rashes. Most of the doctors interviewed said that
if patients do not have respiratory problems such as breathlessness
or a cough, or any SARS contact or travel history, they are unlikely
to have SARS.
Controlling the spread of dengue fever involves stopping mosquitoes
from breeding. NEA said: "The key to mosquito control is to remove
all stagnant water to deny the mosquitoes places to breed in." NEA
has intensified checks for breeding grounds.

Singapore: A total of 456 Cases Reported during May
---------------------------------------------------
The total number of cases [in 2003] is now 1842, with 456 being
reported [in May] alone. The situation is not likely to improve
within the next month, as the recent hot and dry spell favours the
[multiplication] of the virus in mosquitoes.
The worst affected area is Minbu Road/Mandalay Road in the Balestier
area, which has had 34 cases so far. It is one of 11 areas that have
been identified as 'active dengue clusters' by the National
Environment Agency (NEA). These are areas where 2 or more dengue
cases have occurred within a 200-meter radius.
The sudden surge in cases started 2 weeks ago when temperatures
soared. 96 new cases were reported between 11 and 17 May 2003. There
were 56 the previous week. Between 18 and 24 May, 127 cases were
reported. So far this week, there have been 114. Though the recent
number of cases is 4 times higher than the weekly average of 33 seen
between January and May 2002, they are not a cause for alarm, said Mr
Wang Nan Chee, director-general of public health at the NEA. There
were about the same number during an outbreak in July 2003, when an
average of 129 cases a week were reported until the end of September.
Mr Wang said 99.7 per cent of the cases here have been mild ones.
Only 0.3 per cent of those contracting the disease have been
officially classified as having dengue haemorrhagic fever, which
causes internal bleeding. However, 2 people died of it in January
2003, compared to none in 2002 and 4 in 2001.
To combat the dengue-carrying _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the NEA will
carry out more inspections, visiting areas which are more prone to
mosquito breeding every [2 weeks] instead of once a month. For
example, landed properties in the East Coast and Serangoon Gardens
will be targeted.

Australia: First Locally-acquired Case of Dengue Reported in Townsville
-------------------------------------------------
Queensland Health is urging all Townsville and Magnetic Island
residents to take responsibility for reducing mosquito numbers after
the first locally acquired case of dengue fever, for the year, was
reported in Townsville yesterday.
Dengue fever has gripped the far northern city of Cairns in recent
months, where the disease has affected up to 400 people. However,
Townsville and Magnetic Island have remained dengue fever-free since
May 2002. Mr Piispanen, Director of Environmental Health with the
Tropical Public Health Unit, told Magnetic Times that the patient
(from the Townsville suburb of Vincent) has had no recent travel
history, so it was likely the disease had been acquired in the
Townsville area.
"The outbreak was probably initiated when an infected person brought
in the virus either from overseas or possibly the Cairns area.
Unfortunately, it appears that there were also dengue mosquitos
present in the Vincent area at the time. Having bitten this infected
person, these mosquitos were then able to carry the virus, triggering
a local outbreak." said Mr Piispanen. Mr Piispanen went on to say
that it was vitally important that all residents and businesses take
responsibility for reducing mosquito numbers by cleaning up breeding
sites. "Residents should empty and store in a dry place, or dispose
of any containers such as tires, toys, pot plant bases, flower vases,
tarps, or backyard rubbish in which mosquitoes can breed. Check your
roof gutters to make sure they are not blocked with leaves" said Mr
Piispanen.
The dengue fever mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_) prefers to breed in small
receptacles; it also tends to bite people during the day that are
indoors rather than outdoors. Wearing loose, long, light-coloured
clothing and insect repellant will help stop the spread of the
disease.

India: First Dengue Case in Ahmedabad for 5 Years; Health Alert
-------------------------------------------------
With the admission of an 11-year-old to a city hospital with dengue
fever on Mon 26 May 2003, this disease has resurfaced in the city
after 5 years. The child, a resident of Jamalpur, was brought to
Medi-Surge hospital last Monday. He was diagnosed to be suffering
from secondary dengue shock syndrome. Dr Shabbir Momin, a consulting
physician who is handling the case, said, "He is fine now, as his
body temperature is normal. The child was brought to me with symptoms
of dengue infection. His body temperature was below normal, he had
fever in the recent past, his haemoglobin count was high and platelet
count was low," he added.
This is the first confirmed case in the last 5 years, said Dr P K
Makwana, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) health officer.
However, with the monsoon round the corner, this case has made
Corporation officials pull up their socks and take action. AMC has
intensified its efforts to curb the [spread] of mosquitoes in the
city. AMC rushed a team of medical officials to Jamalpur to take
preventive measures like spraying [anti-larval] insecticides on
bodies of water. Besides, AMC officials also conducted a survey in
the area to determine whether any more persons showed signs of
dengue. So far no one has shown signs of having dengue.
Dengue is a viral infection [spread] by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_,
which bites [humans] during the day. The incubation period of the
virus in the body is usually 5 to 10 days, said Dr Makwana. Signs
exhibited by a dengue patient are very similar to those of a malaria
patient. In the primary stage of dengue infection, the patient runs
high fever, body pain is acute, and rashes show up on the patient's
body. But in the secondary stage, the infection is fatal and care
needs to be taken to provide treatment to the patient in the first 48
hours, said Dr Momin.
