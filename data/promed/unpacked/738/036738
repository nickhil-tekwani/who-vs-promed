Another _E. coli_ case has been confirmed in Dorset [England], taking the total number of victims to 11. Public Health England (PHE) confirmed that laboratory tests had revealed a further case of the very rare O55 strain. The cluster involves the O55 strain, which has not been seen in England since records began in 1994, and PHE has so far not been able to find any common link between the cases.

There have been 2 cases in July [2014], 1 in August [2014], 4 at the end of October [2014] and 4 in November [2014]. 3 of the latest victims are all children who attended the Blandford Children's Centre nursery in Black Lane, which has undergone 2 deep cleans and is currently closed pending test results.

The 3 people who fell ill in July and August 2014 are all from Bournemouth [England]. They had all eaten at the same restaurant in Bournemouth but environmental health officers inspected and found no problems there. PHE said it was continuing to investigate all cases to try and identify a common source.

Noeleen McFarland, Consultant in Health Protection at PHE Wessex, said: "We are working closely with colleagues in the North Dorset Environmental Health Department to identify possible sources of infection. It is an infection that can be passed easily from person to person and young children are particularly easily affected.

"Any infection with _E. coli_ can be very serious. We have interviewed all of those affected or their parents and their close contacts to look for possible causes in the days before they became ill. This information is being used in the ongoing investigation into these cases."

The PHE stressed it had already begun a thorough investigation of this latest case. It said there were no other probable cases outstanding at this time but it was possible further cases may come to light.

PHE confirmed earlier this week that 7 of the infected people had gone on to develop serious kidney problems.

[Based on the information in this post, it is apparent that the EHEC infection spread into the nursery school after a number of cases outside the facility. The length of time that the cluster has been simmering suggests a food reservoir that is stable such as something frozen or continuing to be contaminated as might occur with sprouts produced in a specific location. Since hemolytic uremic syndrome occurs in only 5-10 percent of cases, either there are more unrecognized cases or this strain (which may occur) is more prone to complications.

_E. coli_ O55:H7, interestingly, is thought to be a direct ancestor of _E. coli_ O157:H7 (Zhou Z, LI X, Liu B, et al: Derivation of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 from Its O55:H7 Precursor. PLoS One 2010, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008700). - Mod.LL
