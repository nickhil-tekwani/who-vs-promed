Texas: First Case of Human West Nile Virus Infection Suspected
--------------------------------------------------------------
A man hospitalized with encephalitis and muscle weakness on his right side
may be the first human case of West Nile virus infection in Texas, officials
with the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center said on Mon 22 Jul 2002.
Blood test results to help confirm the potentially fatal disease, which has
symptoms similar to other mosquito-borne illnesses, are expected today.
Doctors characterized the condition of the man, who is from Orange County,
as "guarded" but not life-threatening. "It's really premature (to diagnose
West Nile virus infection)," said Porfirio Villarreal, a spokesman with
Houston's Department of Health and Human Services. "You treat everything as
a suspect."
The city health department has been looking for West Nile virus infection in
humans since last year and has run blood tests on 536 people hospitalized
with meningitis or encephalitis of unknown cause. None of the tests has come
back positive. Dr. Daniel Musher, head of infectious disease at the VA,
strongly suspects West Nile virus infection in his patient for a number of
reasons. The man is from a part of the state where horses have been
diagnosed with the mosquito-borne disease. The _Culex_ mosquito, which is
active at night, can transmit the virus to birds, horses and occasionally
people. West Nile virus was first identified in Texas last month in 2 dead
blue jays found in west Harris County.
Musher said the patient, who was admitted with a low-grade fever, appears to
have some form of viral encephalitis. He is in his 50s; serious cases of
West Nile illness usually strike older adults. The patient, who lives near a
bayou, spends a great deal of time outdoors, Musher said. He often goes
without a shirt and doesn't use insect repellent. "With that background,
it's not as if he has occasional contact with a mosquito. It's like he's out
there asking for it," Musher said.
If today's results are positive, they will be sent to Atlanta for
confirmation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Less
than 1 percent of the mosquitoes in affected areas carry the virus, and less
than 1 percent of bites from infected mosquitoes cause serious illness, said
Doug McBride, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Health. Most cases are
mild, causing headaches and flu-like symptoms. There is no specific treatment
for the severely ill, just supportive therapy such as intravenous fluids.

[The clinical diagnosis of a specific etiology for viral encephalitis
is fraught with difficulty and the specificity of the finding of
muscle weakness in West Nile Virus encephalitis has been questioned.
Nonetheless, the circumstantial evidence in this case lends credence
to the clinical suspicions. PCR from spinal fluid could rapidly
confirm the diagnosis. We would welcome any first-hand information
regarding this case. - Mod.LM]
