A rabid raccoon reportedly bit 75-year-old CO in the leg, prompting her to fight back. She strangled the animal and then visited a hospital to receive rabies shots. If you bite, she'll fight back!

A Virginia septuagenarian strangled a rabid raccoon after it violently charged at her and bit her on the leg Saturday [7 Mar 2015] afternoon. The attack came as the woman was watching birds in an off-the-map section of [Lewis Ginter] botanical garden in Henrico [County].

"I tried to shake it off and realized how violent it was," CO, 75, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "As I moved backward away from it, I grabbed its neck, and I knew that I couldn't get away from it. If I ran, it would be faster than I would and would just tear me to pieces. So I threw it to the ground, and I strangled it with both hands." CO, a former Tai Chi instructor, swears she normally would never be so violent with an animal, but this killer critter brought out the beast in her.

"I am a terrific animal lover. It's the last thing in the world I would have ever wanted to do, but you know, self-preservation kicks in, and I guess a primitive part of my brain just went into operation, and that was it."

CO went to a hospital to start a series of rabies shots. She returned to the park the day after the raccoon rumble to finish her walk.

[Never fool with raccoons, healthy or rabid. And if you have a septuagenarian mother-in-law like this, remember to say, "No, ma'am."

The good news is that the raccoon was immediately available for necropsy. According to the TV report embedded in this news report, there were 7 animals diagnosed with rabies in Henrico County in 2014, and 2 were raccoons. And if Ontario was able to eradicate wildlife rabies, Virginia should begin planning to do so too. The benefits would be significant. - Mod.MHJ
