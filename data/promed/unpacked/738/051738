Deer disease no alarm for state agency
--------------------
9 positive cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer samples collected
since last July are not enough for the South Dakota Department of Game,
Fish and Parks (GFP) to formally increase efforts to monitor and control
the disease.
But it did result in an informal step-up. The department killed and tested
an additional 70 deer in Pennington and Fall River counties to zero in on
CWD hot spots. The results of those tests are not yet available.
The 9 positive tests came from a total of 1950 deer and elk samples. The
GFP action plan calls for monitoring the spread of CWD by testing brain
tissues of animals voluntarily submitted by hunters as long as the
infection rate is 1 percent or lower.
When the infection rate rises to 1 to 3 percent, the voluntary
submissions will be enhanced by GFP organized sampling, such as has been
done in Pennington and Fall River counties.
When the infection rate exceeds 3 percent, testing of all elk and deer
harvested by hunters will become mandatory, and GFP will attempt to kill
all the deer and elk in a designated infection zone in efforts to eradicate
the disease.
Based on the results of samples tested since July 2002, "the prevalence
rate we found still falls in that relatively low category that would
dictate continued surveillance on a voluntary basis. That's the extent of
it," says Doug Hansen, GFP Wildlife director. "Continued vigilance would
be the message of the day."
CWD was first observed in 1967 in captive deer herds in Colorado and
Wyoming. It was found in wild deer in Colorado in 1981. Since then, the
disease has been detected in wild deer in Nebraska, Wyoming, Wisconsin, New
Mexico, Saskatchewan, and South Dakota.
CWD first appeared in captive elk in South Dakota in 1997. It was first
found in free-ranging deer in this state in 2001, when a whitetail doe near
Orel tested positive. The disease appeared in a wild elk herd last year,
when a sick animal in a Wind Cave National Park herd was killed and tested.
CWD also has been found in captive deer and elk herds in Colorado,
Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Saskatchewan,
and Alberta.
Wind Cave National Park is the site of a 3-year study to determine the
movement patterns of deer herds in and around the park. After the CWD elk
was discovered, the focus of that study was expanded to determine the
incidence of CWD in park deer, according to Wind Cave spokesman Tom Farrell.
The study, which began this year, calls for 40 deer to be captured, fitted
with radio collars, and tonsil tissue collected and tested. A protein
associated with the disease is found in tonsils. 29 deer were captured in
February 2003. One tested positive for CWD and was euthanized. An
additional road-killed deer at the park also tested positive.
"We hope to test and radio collar the study's remaining 12 animals within
the next few weeks," says Dan Roddy, National Parks Service resource
management specialist.
Even in the most severely affected wild herds, the incidence of CWD has not
exceeded 10 percent, but in captive herds held in confined spaces it can be
widespread.
The disease is in a class of brain diseases called transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies. In affected animals, malformed proteins on brain cells
called prions appear to warp normally shaped proteins merely by touching
them. Brains in CWD animals eventually disintegrate and become pockmarked
by holes, like a sponge.
There is no known cure, and no incidence of animals recovering
spontaneously. Researchers at Washington State University, though, have
discovered a gene that provides 99 percent immunity against the sheep form
of CWD. Researchers are now looking for similar inherited immunity in deer
and elk.
The bovine form of CWD, mad cow disease, has been shown to cross species.
About a decade ago, people in Britain who ate beef from infected cattle
developed the human variant of the disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease. No
link has yet been established between eating deer and elk meat and human
infection, however.
In South Dakota, the 9 positive tests suggest CWD is confined to a few
counties. 3 mule deer and a whitetail deer in Fall River County tested
positive. 2 whitetails in Custer County were positive, as were 2 whitetails
in rural Pennington County and one road-killed buck within the city limits
of Rapid City.
"A word of caution is to make sure you keep things in perspective," Hansen
says. "When we first started investigating this disease, we found one or 2
positive tests alarming. Now we're up to a total of 9 in the recent sample.
But you look at those 9, and it is still less than one percent."
Hunting is still the most effective tool for manipulating the size of deer
herds, and GFP doesn't want to see its effectiveness diminished by concerns
about CWD, according to Hansen.
"Hopefully, we can keep hunters interested in hunting," he says. "From a
management perspective, that is what we have to be concerned about."
