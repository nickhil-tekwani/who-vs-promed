3 babies die after receiving "measles vaccine"
----------------------------------------------
3 infants died while 6 others fell sick yesterday, having been injected
with "measles vaccine" on Thursday at an EPI (Extended Programme of
Immunisation) centre at Sabilapur under Melandah upazila.
The dead, each aged about 10 months, were [from] Sabilapur village. Their
bodies were sent to Jamalpur General Hospital for autopsy.
ABM Aminullah Nuri, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) [upazila is a geographic
administrative unit analagous to a county, it is the next administrative
level below district in Bangladesh - Mod.MPP] of Melandah, confirmed the
death of 3 infants, adding that the cause of their deaths is yet to be
determined.
The UNO said the cause of death will be determined after autopsy. An expert
team is expected to arrive here today for further investigation, he added.
Meanwhile, 6 others became sick after taking the vaccines and are
undergoing treatment in different hospitals.
Melandah Health Complex sources said the vaccines were made by Serum
Institute of India Ltd. A case was filed with Melandah Police Station.

[More information on this event would be appreciated. As no information was
provided in this report on the clinical symptoms, one cannot begin to
speculate on the etiology of these sudden deaths and additional morbidity.
The absence of reports from other geographic locations suggests that if
this is related to "contamination" of the vaccine, it is probably a local
event rather than an event related to the manufacture of the vaccine. This
incident was reported in the press on 6 Sep 2003. I would hope that by now
there is official information on the findings of an investigation. - Mod.MPP]
