Eight boys resident in Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh have been admitted to a
hospital here with symptoms similar to bird flu, according to Kutulahamma,
the deputy speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly.
Kutulahamma, who had come here to visit the boys aged 10-12 years, told
reporters that they were suffering from high fever and were having symptoms
like epilepsy, arousing suspicion that it could be bird flu.
Bird flu [outbreaks in poultry - Mod.CP] have been reported in the Chittoor
region, and the Andhra Pradesh government was conducting tests and taking
preventive measures to contain the spread of the deadly disease, she said.
She said a medical team from Chittoor has come to Vellore to hold
discussions with the doctors at Christian Medical College about the fever.

Too little information has been provided to allow diagnosis of the illness
affecting the 8 boys. In general, human cases of H5N1 avian influenza have
not presented with neurological features. Previously, Chandipura virus
infection and Japanese encephalitis virus have been associated with
outbreaks of similar disease in Andhra Pradesh. Further information on the
progress of this investigation would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
