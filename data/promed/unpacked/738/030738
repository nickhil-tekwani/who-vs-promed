ASF appeared in the Republic of Kalmykia
----------------------------------------
Cases of African swine fever [ASF] have been found in the village Yashalta
on 13 Oct 2009. The veterinary services of the [Republic of] Kalmykia
announced quarantine measures.

Rospotrebnadzor informs that the cases were laboratory confirmed in the
Russian Veterinary Institute in the city Pokrov in Vladimir oblast. Traffic
control posts have been set around the village in connection with the
quarantine. IA "Novosti" reported a similar outbreak in Rostov oblast at
the end of the last month [Sep 2009; see 20091009.3494. - Mod.AS].

Rosselkhoznadzor: the region becomes an ASF risk zone
-----------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of ASF has been registered in Rostov oblast recently; the 2nd
this year. The infection could spread to Belgorod oblast as well, which is
now considered as a zone at risk. The regional Rosselkhoznadzor informs
that another ASF outbreak has been registered in Salskiy rayon of Rostov
oblast last spring [see 20090410.1376]. About 2100 swine were destroyed
that time. 4000 animals have been already destroyed in 3 rayons of Rostov
due to the current outbreak. The specialists consider that the human factor
plays a role in these outbreaks. The farm workers are often not well
informed or simply neglect prevention rules. There are about 2 million
swine in the farms of Belgorod oblast and all are at risk now. The
specialists of Rosselkhoznadzor perform inspections in the region together
with veterinary services and they have found numerous violations of
veterinary rules.

The managers of farms have received letters from Rosselkhoznadzor telling
about the necessity of preventive measures, like restrictions of animal
movements in and out. The traffic control posts are checking private
luggage so that to identify the carriers of goods that haven't been
veterinary inspected. The goods are being confiscated and destroyed.
Several incidents have already been registered and the carriers have been
fined. The specialists of Rosselkhoznadzor recommend the farm owners to buy
animals under close supervision of Belgorod state veterinary services and
use only tested forage [Probably this means animal feed from officially
approved sources; informants are invited to fill-in. - Mod.AS].

Batch of grain from Dagestan being tested for ASF virus in Nijegorodskaya
oblast
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 trucks with grain cargo from Dagestan were suspended in the border of
Nijegorodskaya oblast. According to the correspondent of IA Regnum Novosti
the state veterinary services suspected that the cargo could be
contaminated with ASF virus. The samples of grain were sent for testing.
The trucks will be released only after the results of testing arrive. This
sort of measure is part of prevention activities against the spread of ASF
and is connected with recent ASF outbreak in Rostov.

[It will be interesting to note to which laboratory the fodder sample(s)
was/were sent, which testing mode is being applied, and upon which criteria
the consignment may be declared "safe". If the consignment comes from a
location known or suspected to be infected, and if its exposure to infected
animals (for example, wild boars) cannot be excluded, will a negative
laboratory test result render the consignment the green light? - Mod.AS

Krematorsk declared at risk for ASF
-----------------------------------
The emergency anti-epidemic committee of the city [Krematorsk]
administration met on 13 Oct 2009 to discuss how to prevent the spread of
ASF virus into Krematorsk farms. The head of the regional veterinary
administration, Nelly Goncharuk, informed that ASF outbreaks have been
registered in South Russia.

In Rostov oblast, which borders with Donetsk oblast of Ukraine, about 5000
animals have been destroyed in farms and private yards. There is only one
swine farm in Krematorks with 650 animals, and 1500 swine are being held in
private yards. The committee developed several prevention measures.
Launching an information campaign among private swine owners is one of
them. The owners are advised to consult with a veterinarian immediately if
there are any concerns about the health of the animal. Any attempts to fix
the situation at their own are discouraged.

The members of the committee consider the risk of spread as being
realistic. The surveillance upon markets, cafes and shops, which trade
animal products, are intensified. The products without veterinary
certificate will not be allowed. The only "weak spots" are unregulated,
spontaneous street markets where the products of unknown origin are being
sold commonly without any control.

[5] ASF threat - Eastern Ukraine, Mariupol & Donetsk

Prevention of ASF is on place in Mariupol
-----------------------------------------
All swine farms in Mariupol and Donetsk oblast moved to "closed" regime of
work. The movements of unauthorized vehicles, persons and animals will be
forbidden. All the territory will be disinfected [an extremely ambitious,
probably unrealistic undertaking. - Mod.AS] and rat extermination will be
carried out.

All these activities are recommended by the oblast emergency committee,
which was called for ASF epizootic situation. The head veterinarian of
Mariupol Constantine Gorodetskiy informed that there are only 4 swine farms
with 540 animals within the city territory. All will be under thorough
veterinary control.

The government did not hurry to announce the Donetsk oblast as a buffer
zone against ASF, an announcement which has been considered because the
Donetsk oblast borders with Rostov, where ASF outbreaks have been
registered recently. Such a declared status would mean the extermination of
all swine population within 100 km from the border. Instead, the border
control measures have been intensified with combined forces of veterinary
services, border control and customs.

[The 3 Ukrainian provinces Kramatorsk, Mariupol and Donetzk are situated in
the east and south east, bordering Southern Russia. Clearly, the spread of
ASF in southern Russia in north-western direction is a serious threat to
neighbouring Ukraine and beyond.

In Russia itself, the disease has already been reported from 9 separate
main administrative regions, all included within the Southern Federal
District (map at
<http://www.russiasregions.com/southern_federal_district.html>. The
reportedly infected regions were (in chronological order) are Chechnya,
North Ossetia-Alania, Orenburg, Ingushetia, Stavropol, Krasnodar, Rostov,
Dagestan and now Kalmykia. The Rostob oblast borders Ukraine.

The following information, concerning the transmission and control of ASF,
is derived from the disease factsheets of the Center for Food Security and
Public Health (CFSPH), Iowa State University College of Veterinary
Medicine, USA, at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/african_swine_fever.pdf>.

1. Transmission
---------------
African swine fever can be transmitted by direct contact with infected
animals, indirect contact on fomites, and tick vectors. Transmission during
direct contact is usually by oronasal spread. Aerosol transmission is
thought to be unimportant, and only seems to occur over short distances
when pigs are in close contact. African swine fever virus can be found in
all tissues and body fluids, but particularly high levels are found in the
blood. Massive environmental contamination may result if blood is shed
during necropsies or pig fights, or if a pig develops bloody diarrhea. The
virus can also spread on fomites, including vehicles, feed, and equipment.
There is evidence that some pigs may become carriers.

African swine fever often spreads to new areas when pigs are fed uncooked
scraps that contain ASFV-infected pork. In one outbreak, pigs became
infected after being fed the intestines of guinea fowl that had eaten
infected ticks. The African swine fever virus is highly resistant to
environmental conditions. It can survive for a year and a half in blood
stored at 4 deg C (39 deg F), 11 days in feces at room temperature, and at
least a month in contaminated pig pens. The virus will also remain
infectious for 150 days in boned meat stored at 3.9 deg C (39 deg F), 140
days in salted dried hams, and several years in frozen carcasses.

African swine fever is also spread through the bite of infected
_Ornithodoros_ spp. soft ticks. In tick populations, transstadial,
transovarial, and sexual transmission occur. In Africa, ASFV is thought to
cycle between newborn warthogs and the soft ticks (_Ornithodoros moubata_)
that live in their burrows. Individual ticks can apparently remain infected
for life, and infected soft tick colonies can maintain this virus for
years. _Ornithodoros erraticus_ became infected with ASFV when the virus
was enzootic in Spain and Portugal, and additional Ornithodoros spp have
been infected in the laboratory.

Other bloodsucking insects, such as mosquitoes and biting flies, may also
be able to transmit the virus mechanically. Stable flies (_Stomoxys
calcitrans_) can carry high levels of the virus for 2 days. Under
experimental conditions, these flies could transmit ASFV 24 hours after
feeding on infected pigs.

2. Control
----------
To prevent introduction of the ASF virus [ASFV] into areas free of the
disease, all garbage fed to pigs should be cooked. Unprocessed meat must be
heated to at least 70 deg C (158 deg F) for 30 minutes to inactivate the
virus; 30 minutes at 60 deg C (140 deg F) is sufficient for serum and
bodily fluids. ASF is a highly contagious disease. Eradication is by
slaughter of infected and in-contact animals, and disposal of carcasses,
often by burying, rendering, or burning. Rapid diagnosis and the prevention
of disease spread to feral or wild pigs is very important. Strict
quarantines must be imposed. ASFV can survive for long periods on fomites
and in the environment, and sanitation and disinfection are important in
preventing further spread. Many common disinfectants are ineffective; care
should be taken to use a disinfectant specifically approved for African
swine fever. Sodium hypochlorite and some iodine and quaternary ammonium
compounds are effective.

Potential tick vectors should be controlled with acaricides. In outbreaks,
a detailed entomological investigation should be conducted to investigate
the possible role of local soft tick vectors and their potential for
becoming long term carriers. Although _Ornithodoros moubata_ is an
important long-term vector in Africa, and _Ornithodoros erraticus_ became
chronically infected in Spain and Portugal, Ornithodoros ticks never became
chronically infected during outbreaks in South America. In addition, biting
insects that may be able to transmit the virus mechanically should be
controlled. No treatment or vaccine exists for this disease, and an ASF
vaccine is unlikely to be developed soon.
