Very few severe allergic reactions tied to mRNA COVID vaccines
--------------------------------------------------------------
Acute allergic reactions occurred in 2.10% but anaphylaxis in only 0.025% of employees of 2 Boston hospitals who received their 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, according to a research letter published yesterday [8 Mar 20201] in JAMA [ref: Blumenthal KG, Robinson LB, Camargo CA Jr, et al. Acute allergic reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. JAMA. 2021 Mar 8. doi: 10.1001/jama.2021.3976. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33683290; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777417].

Scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital administered email, text, phone, and smartphone app survey links to 64 900 employees who received a dose of one of the 2 mRNA coronavirus vaccines from 16 Dec 2020-12 Feb 2021.

mRNA vaccines "teach" human cells to make a harmless part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to trigger an immune response to the virus. The authors noted that people with a history of life-threatening reactions, or anaphylaxis, to allergens such as those in a vaccine are often hesitant to receive vaccines, which may complicate efforts to end the pandemic.

A total of 25 929 employees (40%) received the Pfizer vaccine, while 38 971 (60%) received the Moderna vaccine. 81% returned at least one symptom survey, which were sent each day for 3 days after vaccination. Among all vaccinated employees, 1365 (2.10%) reported acute allergic reactions, defined on the survey as itching, rash, hives, swelling, and/or respiratory symptoms. More Moderna vaccinees (2.20%) reported symptoms than Pfizer vaccinees (1.95%).

Previous anaphylactic episodes
------------------------------
A review of medical records identified anaphylaxis in 16 workers (0.025%) (9 [0.023%] with the Moderna vaccine and 7 [0.027%] with the Pfizer vaccine). Mean age of vaccinees diagnosed as having anaphylaxis was 41 years, 94% were women, 63% had a history of allergy, and 31% had previously had anaphylaxis.

Mean time from vaccination to anaphylaxis onset was 17 minutes. One patient required intensive care, 56% received intramuscular epinephrine (to facilitate breathing), and all recovered without experiencing shock or requiring endotracheal intubation. 3 workers with a history of anaphylaxis didn't seek medical care. The mechanism of the anaphylaxis occurrences in the study is unknown.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously reported an incidence of anaphylaxis of 2.5 to 11.1 per million doses, most of them in people with a history of allergy, the authors noted. "The incidence rate of confirmed anaphylaxis in this study is larger than that reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on passive spontaneous reporting methods," they wrote. "However, the overall risk of anaphylaxis to an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine remains extremely low and largely comparable to other common health care exposures."

While most vaccinees with anaphylaxis had a history of allergy, the researchers noted that because about 5% of US adults have severe food allergies, and 1% have severe drug allergies, the employee group studied must have included nearly 4000 workers with histories of anaphylaxis who were vaccinated without related adverse events. "In this prospective cohort of health care employees, 98% did not have any symptoms of an allergic reaction after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine," the authors wrote.

[2] Risk differences between males and females
[A] Gender differences 1: vaccine

Women report worse side effects after a COVID-19 vaccine
--------------------------------------------------------
Men and women tend to respond differently to many kinds of vaccines. That's probably because of a mix of factors, including hormones, genes, and the dosing of the shots.

On the morning that [SK] received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, she felt fine. By afternoon, she noticed a sore arm and body aches, and by evening, it felt like the flu. "My teeth were chattering, but I was sweating -- like soaked, but frozen," said [SK], 44, a medical technician in State College, PA [Pennsylvania]. The next day, she went to work and surveyed her colleagues -- 8 men and 7 women -- about their vaccine experiences. 6 of the women had body aches, chills, and fatigue. The one woman who didn't have flu symptoms was up much of the night vomiting.

The 8 men gave drastically different reports. One had mild arm pain, a headache, and body aches. 2 described mild fatigue and a bit of achiness. One got a headache. And 4 had no symptoms at all. "I work with some very tough women," [SK] said. But "clearly, us women suffered a severity of the side effects." She felt better after 24 hours, and is thrilled she got the vaccine. "I wouldn't change a thing, because it sure beats the alternative," she said. "But I also didn't know what to expect."

The differences [SK] observed among her co-workers are playing out across the country. In a study published last month [February 2021], researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed safety data from the 1st 13.7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses given to Americans. Among the side effects reported to the agency, 79.1 per cent came from women, even though only 61.2 per cent of the vaccines had been administered to women.

Nearly all of the rare anaphylactic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines have occurred among women, too. CDC researchers reported that all 19 of the individuals who had experienced such a reaction to the Moderna vaccine have been female, and that women made up 44 of the 47 who have had anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine.

"I am not at all surprised," said Sabra Klein, a microbiologist and immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "This sex difference is completely consistent with past reports of other vaccines." In a 2013 study, scientists with CDC and other institutions found that 4 times as many women as men between the ages of 20 and 59 reported allergic reactions after receiving the 2009 pandemic flu vaccine, even though more men than women got those shots. Another study found that between 1990 and 2016, women accounted for 80 per cent of all adult anaphylactic reactions to vaccines.

In general, women "have more reactions to a variety of vaccines," said Julianne Gee, a medical officer in CDC's Immunization Safety Office. That includes influenza vaccines given to adults, as well as some given in infancy, such as the hepatitis B and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines. The news isn't all bad for women, though. Side effects are usually mild and short-lived. And these physical reactions are a sign that a vaccine is working -- that "you are mounting a very robust immune response, and you will likely be protected as a result", Dr Klein said.

But why do these sex differences happen? Part of the answer could be behavioral. It's possible that women are more likely than men to report side effects even when their symptoms are the same, said Rosemary Morgan, an international health researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. There's no vaccine-specific research to support this claim, but men are less likely than women to see doctors when they are sick, so they may also be less likely to report side effects, she said.

Still, there's no question that biology plays an important role. "The female immune response is distinct, in many ways, from the male immune response," said Eleanor Fish. Research has shown that, compared with their male counterparts, women and girls produce more -- sometimes twice as many -- infection-fighting antibodies in response to the vaccines for influenza, MMR, yellow fever, rabies, and hepatitis A and B. They often mount stronger responses from immune fighters called T cells, too, Ms Gee noted. These differences are often most robust among younger adults, which "suggests a biological effect, possibly associated with reproductive hormones", she said.

Sex hormones including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone can bind to the surface of immune cells and influence how they work. Exposure to estrogen causes immune cells to produce more antibodies in response to the flu vaccine, for example. And testosterone, Dr Klein said, "is kind of beautifully immunosuppressive". The flu vaccine tends to be less protective in men with lots of testosterone compared with men with less of the sex hormone. Among other things, testosterone suppresses the body's production of immune chemicals known as cytokines.

Genetic differences between men and women may also influence immunity. Many immune-related genes are on the X chromosome, of which women have 2 copies and men have only one. Historically, immunologists believed that only one X chromosome in women was turned on, and that the other was inactivated. But research now shows that 15 per cent of genes escape this inactivation and are more highly expressed in women.

These robust immune responses help to explain why 80 per cent of autoimmune diseases afflict women. "Women have greater immunity, whether it's to ourselves, whether it's to a vaccine antigen, whether it's to a virus," Dr Klein said.

The size of a vaccine dose may also be important. Studies have shown that women absorb and metabolize drugs differently than men do, often needing lower doses for the same effect. But until the 1990s, drug and vaccine clinical trials largely excluded women. "The drug dosages that are recommended are historically based on clinical trials that involve male participants," Dr Morgan said.

Clinical trials today do include women. But in the trials for the new COVID-19 vaccines, side effects were not sufficiently separated and analyzed by sex, Dr Klein said. And they did not test whether lower doses might be just as effective for women but cause fewer side effects. Until they do, Dr Klein said, healthcare providers should talk to women about vaccine side effects so they are not scared by them. "I think that there is value to preparing women that they may experience more adverse reactions," she said. "That is normal, and likely reflective of their immune system working."

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced on [9 Mar 2021] that 9 medical workers vaccinated against the new coronavirus were reported as [having] anaphylaxis with severe allergic symptoms. A total of 17 people have reported this symptom in Japan. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare will listen to the opinions of experts and investigate the causal relationship with inoculation.

According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 9 are women in their 20s and 50s. After receiving the inoculation on [8 Mar 2021], symptoms such as itching, suffocation, and nausea appeared mainly within 30 minutes. Symptoms improved in all of them after medication, but at least 5 people were hospitalized for follow-up. A woman in her 40s relapsed after being hospitalized and her symptoms subsided. According to a report from a medical institution, all 9 incidents were "related" to the vaccination.

A total of 107 558 people were vaccinated in Japan by [9 Mar 2021]. All 17 people reported [to have had] anaphylaxis are women, and Tomohiro Morio, a professor at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, who is the chairman of the expert group of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, announced that "evaluation is necessary including whether it corresponds to anaphylaxis".

["Aged females consistently report more adverse reactions than males in response to the seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines, the pneumococcal vaccines, the herpes zoster vaccine, and the tetanus and pertussis vaccines. While both males and females experience similar types of adverse reactions, the proportion of female vaccinees reporting local reactions, such as injection site pain, redness, and swelling, as well as systemic reactions, including joint or muscle pain, headache, back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, and hypersensitivity reactions is consistently greater than for males (Table 1). Whether differences in adverse reactions among aged males and females reflect a gender-based reporting bias or a sex difference in inflammation has not been resolved. Data on adverse reactions to vaccines are typically collected through the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which relies on passive reporting of adverse reactions. Thus females may be more likely to report adverse reactions to VAERS than males. Limited analyses of local erythema and induration, which are measures of inflammation, at the site of seasonal influenza vaccination illustrate that aged females have significantly larger (6 mm or more) injection site reactions to the vaccine than their male counterparts. Future studies must continue to develop methods for accurate assessment of the qualitative as well as the quantitative reactions to vaccines to better understand whether differences in adverse reactions to vaccines reflect a sex, gender, or both form of biases.

"The biological differences [between males and females], spanning hormones and genes to the microbiome and past exposures to infections, may differentially influence immune responses to vaccines in males and females. As a result of the biological differences between males and females, "precision vaccines" should be developed that consider how sex influences the outcome of vaccination."
(Excerpted from Fink AL, Klein SL. Sex and gender impact immune responses to vaccines among the elderly. Physiology (Bethesda). 2015; 30(6): 408-416. doi:10.1152/physiol.00035.2015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4630198/); see the full article for references and table.)

The mRNA COVID vaccines have similar propensity to cause adverse reactions in females, although both males and females are rarely affected seriously (see next section). But it is important that in evaluating vaccines sex be considered as a variable. - Mod.LK]

[C] Gender differences 2: respiratory inflammatory status
Date: Tue 9 Mar 2021

Women with SARS-CoV-2 infection are less likely to be admitted to the hospital than men, and instances when they are admitted, they present with lower mean parameters of respiratory and inflammatory burden driven by COVID-19, according to new research. In data presented at virtual sessions of the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) 2021 this week, a team of Johns Hopkins University investigators reported discernable differences in severe COVID-19 among men and women, and at varied ages. The findings could indicate the means by which clinicians may be able to monitor suspected SARS-CoV-2 and an individual's risk to severe disease progression.

As Eileen P Scully said in her presentation, early pandemic data suggested a bias in male mortality risk. Up until February 2021, males have comprised less than half (49%) of all SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses, but have comprised 57% of all deaths, based on data from 132 countries. Whether this is due fully or partially to factors including sex-differentiated care-seeking tendencies, health status, illness presentation, comorbidities, or treatment responses is still not understood at 12 months of the pandemic. "The mechanisms for this effect have not yet been defined, and may potentially offer therapeutic targets for intervention," Scully said.

Scully and colleagues assessed data from the Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) 5 hospital system for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and admission rates from March-October 2020. They used the JHM COVID-19 registry, JH-CROWN, to extract detailed patient-level data, which was analyzed for male-female differences through descriptive statistics. From the observed 213 175 tests, 57% were conducted in females; they reported a similar SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate (8.2%) as males (8.9%). However, males were more likely to become hospitalized after SARS-CoV-2 confirmation (33% vs 28%).

Among the 2608 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2, more males reported fever; females more frequently reported headaches, loss of smell, and vomiting (P < 0.05). Regarding respiratory metrics, females had more favorable profiles on average, with lower respiratory rates and greater SpO2:FiO2 ratios than men (P < 0.001). Females reported lower IL-6, ferritin, CRP, higher absolute lymphocyte count, and lower neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios at admission and peak lab values.

Comorbidity burden, per Charlson scores, were similar across genders, but specifically different: females had greater rates of obesity and asthma (P < 0.001). Heart disease (P=0.06), complicated hypertension (P < 0.01), chronic kidney disease, smoking, and alcohol use (P < 0.001) were all greater among males.

Medication prescribed to combat SARS-CoV-2 was similarly frequent among men and women, though tocilizumab was prescribed more frequently to men.

Overall, men had a greater incidence of severe disease and death outcomes across all observed age groups (36%) than women (36%; P < 0.001). The gender outcome difference was most significant among patients in the age 18-49 years group, where it was more than 2-fold for men (25% vs 11%; P < 0.001).

Despite greater rates of obesity and asthma among hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients, females were less frequently hospitalized due to the virus than men, and had less frequent severe outcomes, and presented with less severe respiratory and inflammatory parameters.

The findings highlight features of severe SARS-CoV-2 risk differences among men and women, and provide guidance closer to individualized risk reduction.

Despite an excess of obesity, females had a lower severity of respiratory parameters and lower inflammatory markers on presentation and had a lower frequency of severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sex and age interactions with severe disease highlight critical risk features unique to males and females.

"Taken together, these data suggest that sex differences in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent clinical presentations are the mediators of the differences we see in outcomes of males and females, and suggest that we should focus attention on the immune response after we encounter this virus."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"There is increasing evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) produces more severe symptoms and higher mortality among men than among women [1-5]. However, whether immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) differ between sexes, and whether such differences correlate with the sex difference in the disease course of COVID-19, is currently unknown. Here we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specifc antibody titres, plasma cytokines, and blood-cell phenotyping in patients with moderate COVID-19 who had not received immunomodulatory medications. Male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-18 along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. By contrast, female patients had more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients' age and was associated with worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. By contrast, higher levels of innate immune cytokines were associated with worse disease progression in female patients, but not in male patients. These findings provide a possible explanation for the observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide an important basis for the development of a sex-based approach to the treatment and care of male and female patients with COVID-19."

"Discussion
-----------
"Our results revealed key differences in immune responses during the disease course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in male and female patients. First, we found that the levels of several important pro-inflammatory innate immunity chemokines and cytokines such as IL-8, IL-18 (at baseline) and CCL5 (longitudinal analysis) were higher in male patients, which correlated with higher non-classical monocytes (at baseline). Second, we observed a more robust T cell response among female patients than male patients at baseline. In particular, activated CD8 T cells were significantly increased only in female patients but not in male patients compared with healthy volunteers. Analysis of their clinical trajectory showed that, although poor T cell responses were associated with future progression of disease in male patients, higher levels of innate immune cytokines were associated with worsening of COVID-19 disease in female patients. Notably, the T cell response was significantly and negatively correlated with patients' age in male, but not female, patients. These data indicate key differences in the baseline immune capabilities in male and female patients during the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest a potential immunological underpinning of the distinct mechanisms of disease progression between sexes. These analyses also provide a potential basis for taking sex-dependent approaches to prognosis, prevention, care, and therapy for patient with COVID-19."

[A] Weekly epidemiological update
Date: Tue 9 Mar 2021

Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [7 Mar 2021], 10 am CET

Global overview
---------------
Over 2.7 million new cases were reported last week, 2% more than in the previous week (Figure 1). The global case increase was driven by increases in the Eastern Mediterranean (10%), African Region (10%), and Europe (4%), while small declines were seen in the Americas (-2%), South East Asia (-2%), and Western Pacific regions (-6%). Globally, around half of countries are seeing declines while the other half are experiencing increasing numbers of new cases. Global new deaths continued the downward trend observed since early February 2021, declining a further 6% compared to last week. Death rates declined in all regions except in the Eastern Mediterranean, where new deaths reported rose by 9%. The Americas and Europe account for around 80% of new cases and new deaths reported globally.

The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the United States of America (427 233 new cases; 10% decrease), Brazil (413 597 new cases; 11% increase), France (143 622 new cases; 4% decrease), Italy (138 937 new cases; 24% increase), and India (114 068 new cases; 9% increase).

Special focus: Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System -- best practice for integrating influenza and COVID-19 sentinel surveillance
------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO estimates that seasonal influenza may result in 290 000-650 000 deaths each year due to respiratory diseases alone, with further deaths from other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, which can be influenza-related. SARS-CoV-2 is also a respiratory virus like influenza, but they are not the same virus. In 2020, there were around 1.8 million COVID-19 deaths. Influenza surveillance systems have been leveraged to support monitoring SARS-CoV-2 and have proven to be efficient, practical and sustainable. In this special focus, we look at how influenza surveillance systems work, how they are being used to provide effective support to monitor SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, and provide some country examples.

Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
-------------------------------------------------------
WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions and researchers, continues to monitor the public health events associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants and provides updates as new information becomes available. Further information on the background of the variants of concern (VOCs) is available from previously published editions of the Weekly Epidemiological Update [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports].

Here we provide an update on ongoing studies and the geographical distribution of select VOCs as reported by countries, territories and areas (hereafter countries) as of [9 Mar 2021].

Results of ongoing studies of VOCs are summarized in Table 2 below. While many countries worldwide are currently experiencing a decline in overall SARS-CoV-2 infections, likely as a result of the public health and social measures (PHSM) implemented, an increased number of reports of variants have been noted in a number of countries. As surveillance activities at local and national levels are strengthened, including systematic genomic sequencing to detect cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants, the number of countries reporting VOCs has continued to increase (Table 2, Figures 5, 6, and 7, Annex 2). This information should be interpreted with due consideration of limitations of ongoing surveillance, including but not limited to differences between countries in sequencing capacity and which samples are prioritized for sequencing. WHO continues to advocate for strengthening surveillance and sequencing capacity, and a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of variant transmission. New potential variants of interest (VOIs) or VOCs are currently under review and may be added to future updates.

Table [2]: Overview of emerging information on key variants of concern, as of [9 Mar 2021].

1. Variant VOC 202012/01
Since our last update on [2 Mar 2021], VOC 202012/01 has been detected in 5 additional countries. As of [9 Mar 2021], a total of 111 countries across all 6 WHO regions have reported cases of this variant (Figure 5).

Figure 5: Countries, territories, and areas reporting VOC 202012/01, as of [9 Mar 2021].

2. Variant 501Y.V2
Since the last update on [2 Mar 2021], 501Y.V2 has been reported from 3 additional countries -- totaling 58 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 6). In several areas within the African Region, variant 501Y.V2 has been reported to comprise a high proportion of sequenced samples. /35 Reductions in neutralizing antibody activity against 501Y.V2 following either natural infection or vaccination have been documented [4,24] and discussed in past editions of the Weekly Epidemiological Update. Findings from a recent study that analyzed convalescent plasma from 20 patients and sera from 22 participants of vaccine trials [Moderna SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (12 participants); Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (10 participants)] indicated that relative to the original SARS-CoV-2, there was a substantial decrease in the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma (9.4-fold) and sera from vaccinated participants (10.3 to 12.4-fold) against the 501Y.V2 variant. [18]

Figure 6: Countries, territories and areas reporting SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 as of [9 Mar 2021].

3. Variant P.1
Since our last update, variant P.1 has been reported in 3 additional countries. As of [9 Mar 2021], this variant is reported in 32 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 7).

Figure 7: Countries, territories, and areas reporting SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant as of [9 Mar 2021].

Brazil has experienced high incidence and mortality due to COVID-19, recording over 11 million cases and 260 000 deaths (as of [7 Mar 2021]); the 2nd highest globally (Figure 8). The burden of COVID-19 has been highly variable across the country, with Amazonas State and its capital Manaus, being the most affected. [6] There has been a sharp increase in cases and deaths reported in the month of January [2021], however, both the cases and deaths have slowly started to decline in these states (Figure 9), while remaining high or increasing in the country overall.

In a genomic survey conducted from [16 Mar 2020] to [13 Jan 2021] in 25 municipalities of Amazonas State, Brazil, several sequences were identified. [25] Variant P.1, which was 1st detected in early December 2020 in Manaus in Amazons state, displayed a rapid increase in prevalence through January 2021; accounting 24% (n=60) of sequences samples included in this study. In addition, to better understand the emergence of P.1 in the Amazonas State, a real-time PCR assay was performed to detect the deletion at orf1ab (NSP6: S106del, G107del, F108del) - a deletion found in all 3 VOCs (P.1, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351). Upon evaluating the SARS-CoV-2 positive samples between [1 Nov 2020] through [31 Jan 2021] but not sequenced, no sample was found positive for the NSP6 deletion before [16 Dec 2020], supporting low prevalence of VOC P.1 before mid-December 2020 in Amazonas. However, between mid-December 2020 and January 2021, positive samples with NSP6 deletion were very frequent. Collectively these studies highlight a sharp increase in prevalence of variant P.1 from 0% in November 2020 (n=0/88) to 73% during [1-15 Jan 2021] (n=119/162).

Based on preliminary investigations in Manaus, where this variant was initially identified, P.1 has shown to have increased transmissibility compared to previously circulating variants. It can evade 25% to 61% protective immunity provided by the previous infection, thereby making people susceptible to reinfection. [6] In addition, it is 1.1-1.8 times more likely to result in mortality. Researchers have cautioned that these are preliminary findings and the results are not generalizable to other settings. More studies and genome sequencing data are required to assess the transmissibility and severity of variant P.1. It is also important to conduct these studies outside of Manaus as there has been a sharp increase in hospitalizations during the 2nd wave which has resulted in collapsing of health systems in Manaus (Figure 9). Therefore, it is difficult to determine the cause of high mortality which could be either due to variant P.1 or collapsed health systems, or both.

WHO recommendations
-------------------
Public health and social measures [PHSM] remain critically important to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including newly reported variants. Evidence from multiple countries with extensive transmission of VOCs has indicated that the implementation of physical distancing and other PHSM, as well as infection prevention and control measures in health facilities, has been effective in reducing COVID-19 case incidence, which has led to a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among COVID-19 patients. Findings from new studies evaluating transmission, severity, and impact on medical countermeasures will continue to help inform PHSM and IPC measures employed by member states. National and local authorities are encouraged to continue strengthening existing PHSM, IPC [infection prevention and control] and disease control activities, including epidemiological surveillance, strategic testing, and systematic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 where feasible.

If potential VOIs or VOCs are detected, member states are requested to inform WHO through established WHO Country or Regional Office reporting channels, submit genome sequences to publicly available databases (such as GISAID), and perform field and laboratory investigations (where appropriate) to improve understanding of potential impacts.
