Namibia's environment ministry said [Wed 8 Feb 2017] that the desert lion found dead last month [January 2017] died of anthrax. Famously known as XPL 98, the 5-year old lion was found dead but with no signs of poisoning in the Ugab area in Kunene region about 300 km [186 mi] from Windhoek.

The death of the lion caused a stir worldwide prompting the environment ministry to investigate the cause of death. In a statement released [Wed 8 Feb 2017], the ministry said an autopsy done by conservation expert Philip Stander had revealed that the lion died of anthrax.

Although the statement said Stander had found what appeared to have been extensive bleeding inside the chest cavity, samples of soil collected at the scene of death tested positive for anthrax. "The samples tested positive for anthrax (_Bacillus anthracis_). Blood and tissue samples collected from the lion carcass were also submitted to Central Veterinary Laboratory for further analysis and also tested positive," the ministry said.

According to the statement, the ministry said the carcass was burnt to avoid further spread of the disease.

"We would also like to assure the public that measures were taken to ensure no further spread of anthrax from the carcass to other areas or other animals," the statement said.

[This lion would have acquired his infection from eating a moribund or dead infected animal. So there will have been previous cases, probably wildlife, in the area where XPL 98 was found. This is not unusual, unfortunately. It is more usual to see wildlife anthrax cases in relation to the Etosha National Park, Chobe National Park, and the Caprivi Strip in eastern Namibia.
