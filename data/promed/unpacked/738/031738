[In September of 2014 China reported a case of HPAI H5N1. From that time through August 2017, 25 outbreaks were notified. The event was resolved on 10 Oct 2017. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16342

"The Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 virus first emerged in China in 1996 and spread to Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa and grouped under different genetic clades. Currently the virus continued to be reported in Asia and Africa in both poultry and wild birds. The virus has become enzootic in Asia and Africa and continues to cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections.

As of May 2018, 860 human infections have been reported to WHO from 16 countries and territories. All cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. Countries affected should focus on strengthening biosecurity measures to prevent introduction of disease into flocks and avoid contact between wild birds and poultry."
