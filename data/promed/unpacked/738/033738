Pseudorabies confirmed in Wisconsin swine herd
-----------------------------------------------
A pseudorabies outbreak in a swine herd in Clark County, Wisconsin
was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories on
Wednesday [18 Apr 2007].
"It's odd the disease has been resurrected," Jennifer Lord-Kouraichi,
Clark County emergency management director, told the Associated
Press. There have been no outbreaks in commercial herds in the United
States since 2003, she said.
USDA has ordered that all swine herds within 5 miles of the outbreak
be tested and that the infected herd, about 300 animals, be destroyed
within 15 days.
Wisconsin has been classified as pseudorabies-free since 2000,
meaning producers could move swine without testing them, state
veterinarian Robert Ehlenfelt told AP.
Random pseudorabies screening is currently performed at
slaughterhouses, a process during which the infected herd was discovered.
Nine of the herd of 300 were infected with the virus. Most of the
remaining animals will go to slaughter, AP reported. Others too young
or otherwise not appropriate for food will be euthanized.

Though the actual farm has still not been publicly identified, a
Clark County swine herd does have a confirmed case of pseudorabies.
That's the word from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in
Ames, Iowa after samples were sent there late last week by the
Wisconsin Department of Agriculture.
All week long, state animal health officials were saying the disease
was likely on the farm. Pseudorabies is caused by a herpes virus.
Newborn pigs may suffer signs ranging from appetite loss to seizures,
and entire litters can die. Older hogs may show flu-like signs and
reproductive problems, including abortions or stillbirths. It
sometimes causes rabies-like symptoms, although it is not related to rabies.
"This doesn't change anything in our handling of this situation,"
said State Veterinarian Bob Ehlenfeldt. "Based on the fact that we
had positive tests from 3 hogs at slaughter and 6 from animals on the
farm, we went ahead on the presumption that we were dealing with pseudorabies."
Ehlenfeldt says the USDA gives states 15 days from confirmation to
destroy infected herds and test all swine herds within 5 miles of the
infected herd in order to retain their pseudorabies-free status. Most
of the animals will be allowed to go to slaughter for use as food,
because the meat is safe to eat. Animals that are too young or
otherwise not suitable for food use will be euthanized humanely.
The Clark County herd consists of about 300 pigs.
As announced earlier, a public meeting is scheduled at 7:00 p.m. on
Thursday [19 Apr 2007] at Greenwood High School to give local
residents information about pseudorabies and the Clark County outbreak.
Although pseudorabies was 1st detected in the United States nearly
200 years ago, it only began causing significant swine losses in the
early 1960s. Wisconsin's infection rate peaked in 1989 with 60
infected herds, and the last case in Wisconsin was reported in 1998.
