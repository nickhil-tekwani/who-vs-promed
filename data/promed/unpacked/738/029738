Malaysia: 9 Confirmed Cases and One Death in Penang
------------------------------------------------------
There have been 9 confirmed dengue fever cases including one death in Bukit
Mertajam, said state Health, Welfare and Caring Society Committee chairman
Datuk Dr K. Rajapathy. He said 5 cases were in the vicinity of Jalan
Pegawai and the nearby wet market and another 4 cases in Taman Makok. He
said the death of a 37-year-old market trader on 23 Jul 2003 was the second
such death in the state in 2003.
Dr Rajapathy said that since the discovery of the cases in Jalan Pegawai
and the market area, the state health department had checked 1206 premises
and fogging was conducted on at least 3 occasions to control the spread of
dengue. He said 202 premises in Taman Makok were also checked and 2
residential premises were compounded when _Aedes_ mosquito larvae were
detected.
Dr Rajapathy said the state health department had stepped up anti-dengue
measures, and the number of reported dengue cases in Penang was greatly
reduced this year. "Up to 26 Jul 2003, there were 282 cases in Penang
compared with 374 cases for the same period of 2002," he said.
Bukit Mertajam Wet Market Vegetable Sellers Association deputy secretary
Chang Song Cheung said that it was important to thoroughly clean the market
because 7 of his friends had contracted dengue including the one who died
last week. Chang said the wet market was filthy with clogged drains and the
traders were unhappy with the services provided by the contractor appointed
by the Seberang Perai Municipal Council. There are about 800 traders, but
the contractor only hired 6 workers to maintain the area.
"Something should be done because dengue fever is spreading rapidly among
us," he said after accompanying Berapit assemblyman Lau Chiek Tuan to the
Seberang Jaya Hospital to visit 2 of his friends.

Australia: Dengue Fever Case Total Reaches 456 in North Queensland
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Cairns is facing one of the worst dengue fever outbreaks on record with
more than 450 people contracting the disease since March 2003. Health
workers are fearful of a surge in cases during the summer months as the wet
season looms, traditionally the best breeding season for the dengue
mosquito, which lives in still water, has a penchant for daylight hours,
and attacks people indoors.
More than 500 people in Cairns were struck down in 1997-99 during an
outbreak that lasted 70 weeks. But the latest outbreak [is] expected to
exceed that tally. The number of people afflicted during the latest
outbreak is 456, with 20 of them admitted to hospital.
Locals have been warned that catching a second bout from a different strain
could lead to the deadly dengue haemorrhagic fever, which causes internal
bleeding. Tropical Public Health Unit entomologist Dr Scott Ritchie said
although the outbreak was showing signs of slowing down, there were enough
cases and mosquito-breeding sites to sustain the outbreak into the summer
months. "If there are still new cases being reported come the wet season,
this could lead to an escalation of the outbreak," Dr Ritchie said. "This
is what occurred in Cairns's last outbreak in 1997-99, and the dengue
action response team are still finding breeding sites."
Cairns health officials have sought help from other cities as they work to
contain the virus. Cases have previously been recorded in Brisbane.
However, dengue has constantly reappeared in the far north because of the
region's monsoonal weather and the opening of the Cairns International
Airport in the mid-1980s, which gave Asian travellers -- and the dengue
virus -- a gateway to the north.

Panama: 17 New Cases of Classic Dengue Fever in Chiriquihan
--------------------------------------------------
Evaristo Gonzalez, Regional Health Director, stated that the sanitary alert
imposed by the Health Ministry is being maintained in the province of
Chiriqui as a result of the detection of new cases of dengue fever and
malaria. According to Gonzalez, 17 new cases of classic dengue fever have
been detected in Chiriqui, with the districts of David, Bugaba, and Baru
being the most affected. The official explained that the alert was declared
because in previous years no cases of dengue had been registered during
this time of the year.
Due to these circumstances, health authorities imposed a series of
strategies to control the contagion. These include immediate medical
attention for those infected and the application of mitigation measures
such as the fumigation and elimination of breeding sites, as well as public
education about the risks of these diseases and the need to eliminate
mosquito-breeding sites in homes and surrounding areas.

Costa Rica: Estimate of Financial Expenditure on Dengue Fever Treatment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The treatment of each patient affected by dengue fever signifies a minimum
expenditure of CRC (Costa Rica Colones) 60 000 [USD150] for the Costa Rican
Social Security Fund (CCSS). So far this year, 6456 persons have been
treated, resulting in an expenditure of at least CRC 387 360 000 [USD 970
000] in 7 months. The cost of CRC 60 000 corresponds to the treatment of
patients who recover at home but attend health care centers daily for one
week for follow-up.
However, the cost for patients who need hospitalization (close to 10
percent of the total number of cases) is much higher. 4 days of hospital
care represents for the CCSS and expenditure of CRC 400 000 [USD 1000].
Anabelle Alfaro, CCSS coordinator for emerging diseases, warned that the
situation is cause for concern since the funds for these treatments do not
belong to the CCSS, but are paid by the contributors.
These are only some of the concerns expressed by doctor Alfaro and her
colleague, Teresita Solano, during an electronic discussion organized
yesterday [Fri 1 Aug 2003] by nacion.com. Another concern is that the
clinical presentation of the current cases is much more severe. That is,
that the blood platelet count is much lower than before, indicating that
these patients are victims of a second dengue infection.
Last Friday there were 55 patients hospitalized in medical centers
throughout the country. This year, the Central Pacific (Puntarenas) region
has been the most affected, with 2409 cases, followed by the area of La
Chorotega, particularly Santa Cruz, Carrillo, and Nicoya, with 2224 cases,
and the Huetar Atlantica region (Limon), with 1131 cases. To date, there
have been 11 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. In 2002, 27 cases were
registered.
Teresita Solano, Director of Surveillance for the Ministry of Health,
emphasized that the best way to stop the propagation of the disease is to
eliminate the mosquito-breeding sites, and explained that fumigation is not
a preventive measure but is taken to eradicate the adult infected mosquito.

Brazil (Ceara): Dengue hemorrhagic fever in 30 cities
-----------------------------------------------------
The 24 Jul 2003 weekly dengue bulletin of the Ceara state health
secretariat (Sesa) confirmed an additional 295 cases of classic dengue
fever. So far in 2003, the disease has affected 18 459 persons, with 12 687
cases originating in 163 municipalities of the interior of the country, and
5772 cases originating in the capital. There have been 244 cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever, 3 more than the number reported in the last bulletin.
The number of cases being investigated increased from 19 to 25 cases, of
which 10 were fatal, and are awaiting confirmation of the diagnosis. Cases
of dengue hemorrhagic fever have already been registered in 30 municipalities.
According to Sesa, the increase in the number of cases is due to the
introduction of dengue virus type 3 and its propagation through 23
municipalities. 593 samples of blood for viral isolation were collected
from 37 municipalities. Dengue virus type 3 was isolated from 136 samples
from 23 of the 37 municipalities.
The index of infestation by _Aedes aegypti_ for the period March-May [2003]
indicates that only 30 of the municipalities of the state of Ceara do not
register the presence of the mosquito. 48 municipalities have an index of
up to one percent; 49 an index of 1 to 3 percent, and 57 municipalities
show an index higher than 3 percent. The World Health Organization (WHO)
recommends an index of not more than 1 percent of presence of the mosquito.

Thailand: More Than 30 000 People Infected
------------------------------------------
The situation concerning dengue haemorrhagic fever in Thailand remains
serious, with more than 30 000 people infected -- 32 of whom have died --
over the past 7 months, a senior public health official said yesterday.
Dr Charan Trinwuttipong, the Director-General of the Disease Control
Department, said his department considered the current situation serious,
particularly among those over 15 years of age. The Department said it had
found a new strain [serotype?] of the viral disease a couple of years ago
and that this strain was spreading, mostly among adults. Once infected with
virus, the victim shows serious symptoms fairly quickly, it added.
An 18-year-old female student died recently after having had a fever for 2
days, Charan said. "People should be aware that anybody could have this
form of dengue fever, not only children," he said. People who develop a
high fever without the presence of nasal mucus should consult a doctor. And
they should not take painkillers without a doctor's consent, as certain
medications [aspirin] might increase the severity of the symptoms, Charan said.
Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan said the Ministry was concerned
about the situation, even though the number of people killed by the disease
this year was lower than in 2002. More importantly, dengue fever spreads
quickly, particularly in urban areas, during the rainy season in July and
August. According to Ministry statistics, over the past 7 months the number
of people struck down by the virus was highest in the Central region, which
saw 12 716 cases. Of these, 10 have died. While there were fewer cases in
the Northeast (11 745), there were more deaths, with 16 people succumbing
to the virus. In the North, there were 4922 cases with 5 deaths, while in
the South, 4127 people were infected, and 4 died.
