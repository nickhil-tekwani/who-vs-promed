Public health officials are warning passengers who recently flew from India to Vancouver or passed through the local airport that they may have been exposed to measles. An infectious individual is known to have taken 2 flights last month [June 2018], 1st from New Delhi to Guangzhou, from Guangzhou on to Vancouver.

Those who took China Southern flights CZ 3028, which departed [23 Jun 2018] at 11:55 AM, or CZ 377, which departed [24 Jun 2018] at 12:50 AM, may have come in contact with the virus. In addition, BC Centre for Disease Control said anyone who was at the Vancouver International Airport on [Sat 23 Jun 2018] after 9:30 PM should be wary.

As some of the passengers and flight crew may have travelled on to other destinations in Canada, the BCCDC is also warning Canadian and Pacific Northwest public health officials of the case.

Travellers are asked to check their immunization status. The majority will be immune, but those including infants and people who haven't been given the vaccine are at risk. Symptoms can show up between a week and 2 weeks after exposure - in this case by about [15 Jul 2018].

The New Jersey Department of Health is warning residents about an individual suspected of having measles who might have exposed others while in Burlington and Camden counties. The infected person developed symptoms after being exposed to an individual who acquired measles while traveling internationally.

The Health Department recommends that anyone who visited the locations listed below during the specified dates/times should contact a health provider to discuss potential exposure and risk of developing the illness. [...more]

"It is critical that New Jersey residents and visitors are up to date on their vaccinations to avoid the possibility of becoming ill with measles," New Jersey Health Commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal said. "As we can see, exposure to someone with measles may result in transmission, so getting vaccinated is the best defense."

[3] Brazil and Venezuela: Yanomami indigenous people
Date: Thu 05 Jul 2018

A devastating measles epidemic is plaguing the indigenous community Yanomami in the Amazon, Venezuela border with Brazil, because of isolation, and precarious living conditions of families of this ethnic group.

Since March [2018], there are reports of indigenous sickened by the outbreak of measles, and the total number of people affected is unknown.

Yanomami Indians approached Wataniba, a socio-environmental working group of the Amazon, to share their concern and alarm regarding the epidemic prevailing in the communities of Alto Ocamo - Parima in Venezuela, in the region of Onkiola, the Brazilian side. The alarm is significant given the epidemiological vulnerability of people in front of this disease.

The 1st warning came from members of the Yanomami organization Hutukara, settled in Brazil who in March 2018 reported by radio to Yanomami health personnel in Chalbaud Delgado, there were sick people with measles in the sector "Hokomawe and Momoi" a region for members of the Yanomami Hutukara organization, which covers a large area of more than 11 communities in Venezuela and as many in Brazil. The Venezuelan side includes towns like Tokori, Hokomawë I, Hokomawë II, Koaiampu I, Koaiampu II, III Koaiampu, Irotha and Oroshi, all difficult to access.

Then they learned that 23 Yanomami arrived at a hospital in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima state in Brazil, with one case was already verified for the disease, while 22 remained as suspicious. The affected cases are members Hokomawë and Momoi sector of the organization Yanomami Hutukara.

The presence of thousands of illegal miners who have invaded the region may be the likely source of the epidemic. Despite repeated warnings, the authorities have not taken the necessary measures to expel them.

In Brazil, at least 23 indigenous patients have gone to a hospital, but most of those affected are unable to access medical assistance, as they live in very remote areas.

Survival International is calling on the authorities in Venezuela to provide immediate medical assistance to these remote communities. Survival's director Stephen Corry said today: "When [indigenous people] suffer from diseases that have never met, many of them die and whole populations can be annihilated. These people are the most vulnerable on the planet. Immediate medical attention is all that will prevent its complete devastation."

[This is a very serious situation for the indigenous people who always suffer from introduced pathogens to which they have no prior exposure and consequently, no immunity. Potentially, hundreds of Yanomami could become infected and die if no intervention is taken by the governmental authorities. It is urgent that medical care commence immediately.

The Yanomami are the largest relatively isolated tribe in South America. They live in the rainforests and mountains of northern Brazil and southern Venezuela.

Like most tribes on the continent, they probably migrated across the Bering Straits between Asia and America some 15 000 years ago, making their way slowly down to South America. Today their total population stands at around 35 000.
At over 9.6 million hectares, the Yanomami territory in Brazil is twice the size of Switzerland. In Venezuela, the Yanomami live in the 8.2 million hectare Alto Orinoco - Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve. Together, these areas form the largest forested indigenous territory in the world.

Thousands of gold-miners are now working illegally on Yanomami land, transmitting deadly diseases like malaria and polluting the rivers and forest with mercury. Cattle ranchers are invading and deforesting the eastern fringe of their land. Yanomami health is suffering and critical medical care is not reaching them, especially in Venezuela.

The Brazilian congress is currently debating a bill which, if approved, will permit large-scale mining in indigenous territories. This will be extremely harmful to the Yanomami and other remote tribes in Brazil.

A 17-year-old girl died at Bordeaux University Hospital following neurological complications related to measles. This is the 2nd death caused by measles in New Aquitaine, the 3rd in France since November [2017]. The patient is said to be from the region, but it's not know where she contracted the disease . With less than 10 confirmed cases per month, New Aquitaine is no longer in an epidemic phase, but many vulnerable people are still not vaccinated. If the threat has been curbed, it must continue to prevent to avoid a possible return.

Nearly half of the cases in France come from New Aquitaine

According to the Regional Health Agency (ARS), since [6 Nov 2017], 1096 cases of measles were confirmed (2567 in France) in New Aquitaine. This represents almost half of the cases in France, 1 in 4 cases required hospitalization, 12 patients were transferred to intensive care and 2 died. Nearly 90 percent of these cases were not or insufficiently vaccinated, as 2 doses are needed to be fully protected.

The ARS asks people to check their vaccination and, if in doubt, to get vaccinated. Measles can lead to respiratory and neurological complications that can have serious consequences.

[Relatives of unprotected individuals] are also vulnerable to since the disease is very contagious: 1 person can infect up to 20 people. Especially fragile people such as children under 1 year and immunocompromised people cannot be vaccinated [so can only be protected by herd immunity when a high enough proportion of the population living around them is immune. - Mod.LK]

There is no cure for the disease, only drugs to relieve the symptoms. The most effective solution is to get vaccinated to prevent spread.

2nd death in New Aquitaine
--------------------------

In June [2018], a 26-year-old patient died of the disease. And last February [2018], a 32-year-old mother who was not vaccinated died at CHU [Centres Hospitaliers Régionaux et Universitaires] Poitiers.

The MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine is now mandatory for children born after 1 Jan 2018. The 2nd dose that is administered later guarantees immunity.

Health officers are urged to carry out massive exercise on the Supplementary Immunisation Activity (SIA) here and in Tatau to prevent the spread of measles. Bintulu Health officer Dr. Norliza Jusoh said the SIA had actually started on [2 Jul 2018] after a measles outbreak was reported here since [13 Apr 2018]. The SIA is a preventive measure which develops herd immunity against the spread of the disease.

"For the record Bintulu has the highest number of measles infection with 179 cases, of which 92 cases were tested positive for measles following lab tests on [3 Jul 2018]," she said during a briefing at the Resident's office here yesterday [Wed 4 Jul 2018].

A total of 171 cases were recorded in Bintulu itself and 8 in Tatau District.

Dr. Norliza said the SIA would be carried out for a month until [31 Jul 2018] as a preventive measure to curb the spread of the disease. She said free door-to-door vaccination from 8am -- 10pm on Mondays to Sundays would involve children aged 6 months -- 15 years old. She added that early detection and treatment was vital in preventing the spread of the disease.

Under the Children National Immunisation Programme, 2 doses of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine shots are given to children aged 9 months -- 12 months.

The SIA programme here is divided into 3 areas, namely, Jepak (Week 1) , Sg Plan/ Kidurong (Week 2) and Bintulu (Week 3 and 4). Dr. Norliza said from past experiences, the medical personnel from Bintulu Health Office had encountered difficulties approaching house owners at the residential areas. Many of them did not allow the staff to enter their houses, but asked them to give their children the jabs at the gate under the scorching hot sun.

"For your information, this vaccine is very sensitive to light so it is recommended that it is given in a dim area, even if you don't allow us to enter, it's fine, but not at the gate," Norliza said.

For house owners who might feel unsecured with the presence of the medical staff, she assured them that their personnel would wear the department's uniform and official name tags.

A community leader from Jepak who was present at the meeting has volunteered to join the teams if his service is required.

Bintulu Resident Jack Aman Luat, who chaired the meeting, said the people should not fear the personnel coming to their home for they are doing a very good job in containing the spread of the disease. He also urged the Health Office here to distribute pamphlets to every household in Bintulu to make the people more aware of the disease.

[The measles outbreak is due to the high number of children who have never received the full MMR vaccine protocol to protect them from this disease. It is hoped this vaccination campaign will correct the problem. Education on the value of the vaccine is also important for the future generations' protection. - Mod.LK]
