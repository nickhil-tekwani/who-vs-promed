Guinea
--------
6 cases of yellow fever were reported in Macenta District (S) in late 2002.
Travellers going outside of urban areas are advised to be in date for
yellow fever vaccine. Take steps to avoid mosquito bites.
[Given the risk that patients with yellow fever could be hospitalized in
the capital, and spread the epidemic there, it would be prudent for all
travelers to Guinea to be vaccinated. ProMED would appreciate confirmation
of the diagnosis & further details. - Mod.JW]
[The see also listing below is just a sampling of reports of yellow fever
occurrences related to countries in the African yellow fever endemic zone
that have been posted on ProMED-mail over the preceding several years. Of
note are the 2 cases of yellow fever occurring in Europeans who travelled
to known yellow fever endemic areas without a history of having been
vaccinated against yellow fever. In both instances, (ex Gambia 2001 and ex
Cote d'Ivoire 1999) there had not been reports of active foci of yellow
fever in people living in the countries at the time, further highlighting
the need for yellow fever vaccination prior to travel to the endemic yellow
fever zones in Africa (and in South America), even if there are no reports
of "ongoing human disease" in the area. One has to remember that disease
surveillance does not capture all cases, so that an absence of reporting of
cases in humans does not always reflect a true absence of the disease. In
addition, there have been many yellow fever vaccination campaigns covering
residents of the endemic zones, so that an absence of disease in humans
does not necessarily reflect an absence of the disease in primates. The
mosquitos that feed on the primates (and humans) are able to transmit the
virus vertically (through their eggs), and thereby continue to serve as
reservoirs for the disease and keep the cycle of transmission of the virus
ongoing. - Mod.MPP]
