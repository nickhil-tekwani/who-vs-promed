The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and Doniphan County Health Department continue to investigate an outbreak associated with an election day Indian taco dinner at the Highland United Methodist Presbyterian Church in Highland, Kansas, on [Tue 7 Aug 2018]. A survey was launched on [Fri 10 Aug 2018] to collect illness and exposure information from those that attended the dinner.

As of [Fri 31 Aug 2018], 115 persons have completed the survey, 69 have reported gastrointestinal illnesses, and 14 have tested positive for _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport. These numbers are preliminary.

Testing of food that was served at the dinner has been completed, and all tested negative for _Salmonella_ except for a sample of tomatoes that tested positive for the same strain of _Salmonella_ Newport. Tomatoes were provided by multiple people, so an environmental assessment of the sources of tomatoes is planned to potentially determine how this contamination occurred.

In addition, KDHE is assessing whether other persons that did not attend the taco dinner could have been sickened from consuming these tomatoes.

[A taco usually contains a number of ingredients in addition to a protein (beef, pork, chicken, or fish) including tomatoes and lettuce. Any of these can be tainted with enteric pathogens. It appears that the tomato is the "smoking gun" here. - Mod.LL
