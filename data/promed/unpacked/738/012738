With 5 more cases of hepatitis E coming to fore, the number of people diagnosed of the infection in Cheki-Wangund village of Kulgam district in South Kashmir has reached 13. The doctors had last week confirmed outbreak of hepatitis E in the village after 8 people were tested positive for the infection. The highly contaminated water supplied to the inhabitants by the Public Health Engineering (PHE) department was attributed as the sole reason for the outbreak.

"Another 5 people have tested positive for infection," said a doctor today [4 Mar 2016]. He said that out of 59 samples taken for testing to Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) laboratory in Barzulla Srinagar, 5 tested positive. "The health department has already deputed a team to the area which is monitoring the situation," the doctor said. He added that the department was also organizing awareness camps in the area.

The water consumed by the villagers was found highly contaminated as the samples taken for laboratory showed coliform content as high as 92 per 100 ml. As per the standards, a sample of 100 ml of water is considered to be 'excellent' if its coliform count is zero; 'satisfactory' if count is 1-3, 'suspicious' if the count is 4-10, and 'unsatisfactory' for a count of more than 10.

The PHE department, on the instructions of health department and district administration, has already started supplying chlorinated water to the village. "We have now sent the samples of this chlorinated water for tests and the report is expected soon," said a doctor in IDSP. He said that the people need not to panic but only consume boiled water and maintain proper hygiene. Meanwhile, a team from Government Medical College (GMC) Srinagar has also taken 22 samples from suspected patients and the reports are awaited.

People in Cheki-Wangund and adjoining village have blamed the PHE department for their failure to provide potable drinking water. However, Deputy Commissioner has already assured the villagers of a treatment plant as well as providing them proper sanitation facilities.

[Fecal contamination of the water supply seems to be the cause was of this outbreak, confirmed with water coliform tests. It appears that person-to-person transmission of HEV is not as frequent as with hepatitis A. Vertical transmission of HEV does occur, however. - Mod.LL
