An outbreak of a virulent strain of avian influenza [AI] reported last month [August 2013] in Italy spread in the provinces of Bologna and Ferrara, according to data released by the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm. 3 more farms confirmed cases of the H7N7 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza since 28 Aug [2013], bringing the total number of outbreaks to 6, according to a presentation the commission posted online today [11 Sep 2013] from Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie [Veneto Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute], a public research institute in Legnaro, Italy.

Two of the new cases were at industrial farms owned by a poultry company affected by a previous outbreak, while the 3rd involved a rural backyard flock, according to the report. Almost 220 000 birds were slaughtered in the 3 locations to stem the spread of the disease. More than 730 000 were killed in the prior 3 outbreaks, the report showed.

Highly pathogenic strains of avian flu can spread rapidly and be fatal for both domesticated and wild birds, according to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health, known as OIE. The most recent highly pathogenic outbreaks in the EU were in 2010 in Romania and Bulgaria, according to the OIE. While Italy has had multiple cases of low-pathogenic bird flu since 1997, this is the 1st highly pathogenic outbreak since 2000.

[The 6 outbreaks mentioned above have already been covered in previous ProMED-mail postings. However, they did not include the number of birds culled so far, namely about 950 000. Additional, firsthand data describing the outbreak and its control, including preemptive killing of poultry in adjacent farms to prevent the virus further spread, is available in Italy's presentation delivered during the recent meeting of EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) in Brussels (10-11 Sep 2013); see http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1011092013_avian_italy_en.pdf (thanks to Sabine Zentis). This is a very detailed presentation addressing each of the foci as well as serosurveillance and other test around the outbreaks and in potential contact farms, plans for additional pre-emptive depopulation, statistics, and maps.

The presentation also includes the following information related to public health:
All workers taking part to depopulation measures on infected premises applied strict prevention procedures and wore protective clothing (overalls, rubber gloves, boots, turboventilated masks with FP3 filter, etc.). They were regularly checked for symptoms of AI infection. 3 cases of H7N7 human infection were identified in 3 workers who took part in stamping out procedures on outbreaks nos. 1 and 2:
- 28 Aug 2013: 1st human case of conjunctivitis
- 31 Aug 2013: 2nd case of conjunctivitis and ILI [influenza-like illness]
- 4 Sep 2013: 3rd case of conjunctivitis
- No human to human transmission

The intravenous infectivity index (IVPI) of the virus, expressing its pathogenicity, was found to be 3.0. Any avian influenza virus that has an IVPI greater than 1.2 is termed to be of high pathogenicity; for the procedures required, refer to http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf. - Mod.AS
