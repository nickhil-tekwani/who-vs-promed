A 6 year old boy from Kuala Pilah has been admitted to the Tuanku Jaafar Hospital (TJH) here after being suspected of having Japanese encephalitis (JE). The case is still under observation.

Negri Sembilan Health director Dr Abdul Rahim Abdullah said the boy was 1st brought to the Tuanku Ampuan Najihah Hospital in Kuala Pilah on 18 May [2016] before he was transferred to TJH 2 days later. "The boy's condition worsened, and he was transferred to TJH for further treatment. We ran a blood test on the victim, and we have ruled out on the possibility that he had contracted the Nipah virus, as speculated by the public.

"However, we are still investigating on how the JE virus was spread and whether or not it was caused by mosquitoes," said Abdul Rahim. [If this case is confirmed as JE, the virus was transmitted by a mosquito. - Mod.TY]

He said 2 more cases were recorded this year [2016] involving 2 children, one in Kuala Pilah and another case in Jelebu, but no deaths were reported. [It is not clear whether these 2 cases were confirmed as JE virus infections or were encephalitis cases of undetermined etiology. - Mod.TY]

Abdul Rahim said the JE virus would normally show very few symptoms, with the victim only experiencing fever and light headache. "However, one out of 250 infections can end up with a severe infection such as high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, body spasms, paralysis and can lead to death. Infection can occur at any age, but the risk is higher in children as their immune system is weaker compared to adults," he said. "There is no specific treatment for JE. Normally, the treatment given to the victim is only to reduce clinical signs from severe infections," said Abdul Rahim. Meanwhile, Abdul Rahim said JE cases in the country were last reported in 2014, involving 3 cases and one death in Seremban [see ProMED-mail archives below].

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis occur sporadically in Malaysia. South East Asia, including Malaysia, is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). There were reports that a total of 16 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases had occurred nationwide since the start of 2014, including 4 deaths, according to the Malaysia Health Ministry. There was a significant outbreak of JEV infections in 1998-1999. The current case is well within the endemic area. ProMED-mail would be interested to know whether this case becomes laboratory confirmed. If it is confirmed as JE, there is a risk of neurological sequelae.

In JE virus-endemic areas, birds, especially ardeids (herons and relatives), are reservoir hosts of the virus, which is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_. Pigs can serve as amplifying hosts. - Mod.TY
