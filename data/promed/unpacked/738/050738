A single case of anthrax in a beef cow has been confirmed in the Fort Vermilion area of northern Alberta.

This is early in the season for this soilborne disease to appear but hot, dry weather is suspected for releasing infectious spores, said a spokesperson for the provincial veterinarian's office. A spore forming bacteria, anthrax affects cattle, bison, sheep, goats and horses. Death occurs within hours and there [may] be some bloody discharge. Anthrax cases are reported in western Canada nearly every year during the summer months, usually following hot weather.

Producers are advised to report suspicious deaths to their veterinarians because a prompt diagnosis can help prevent the spread of disease. The veterinarian can determine whether vaccination is necessary. In a suspect case the veterinarian can collect samples for testing. Follow the veterinarian's advice on carcass disposal.

The provincial veterinarian's office also recommends removing surviving animals from the pasture where dead livestock was found. Do not move the dead animals and do not call for deadstock pickup. To prevent scavenging of carcasses, cover them with a secure tarp or heavy plastic.

Anthrax can cause severe disease in humans. Precautions should be taken when handling suspect cases and for further information contact a physician or community health centre. Detailed information is available at: http://www.agric.gov.ab.ca or call (780)-427-3448.

[Fort Vermilion is on the northern border of Alberta with the Northwest Territories: see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CA/01/Fort_Vermilion.html. It is an area where the local Indians provide summer grazing for cattle from central & southern Alberta. Anthrax broke out there around 10 years ago with the westerly migration of wood bison from the Peace River Delta, an enzootic hot spot for anthrax. The most recent outbreak was last summer; see post no.20150816.3581348 below. Logically not all the stock in the Fort Vermilion area had been vaccinated this spring. An outbreak this early this far north is unusual. As there is still snow in northern Wyoming we can presume that there is snow covering the ground in northern Alberta. This raises the possibility that this singular case became infected from eating contaminated hay from the field where the case in 2015 occurred.
