A viral outbreak on Prince of Wales Island killed one woman and
forced 7 others to be medically evacuated to health clinics outside
the community of Klawock, according to state health officials. Alaska
Department of Health spokesman Greg Wilkinson said there are 34
suspected or confirmed cases of adenovirus 14 [virus infection], an
air and liquid borne virus commonly associated with winter
respiratory illnesses, though he suspects there are more unconfirmed cases.

State epidemiologist Dr. Beth Funk said the virus often appears as a
common cold at first. "[Adenoviruses] in general are fairly common
and can cause a bunch of things including cold-like symptoms (and)
lower respiratory (illnesses) like bronchitis and pneumonia," she
said. "Usually, the illness is fairly mild." Wilkinson said that:
"Most people will be uncomfortable for a week or 2 but will go right
through it. It is different to see up here in Alaska, but it's not
uncommon in the lower 48 [states]."

Wilkinson said the woman who died suffered from chronic obstructive
lung disease and that the 7 people hospitalized all had pre-existing
lung conditions. One patient was flown to Alaska Native Medical
Center in Anchorage and put on a ventilator, and several others have
been transported to Ketchikan for treatment.

Wilkinson said the best way to prevent spreading the virus is for
people to wash their hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20
seconds and to avoid contact with those were are sick. "If your kids
are sick, keep them home," he said. "If you're sick, stay home from
work; since it's a virus, there's nothing we can give you. It's
something you have to ride through. Get bed rest and plenty of liquids."

The virus is most commonly spread through coughing and sneezing and
can live on surfaces for a short period of time. "It is really
important to prevent transmission by practicing good respiratory
hygiene," Funk said. "Cough into the crook of your arm and wash your
hands right away after you sneeze, cough or blow your nose."

Health care providers can get cultures to send to the state virology
lab in Fairbanks at no expense to the patient, but the viral cultures
[results] would typically take a week or longer to come back from the
laboratory, Funk said, so would most likely only provide a
retrospective diagnosis.

Contrary to rumors, no quarantines are in place, and travel to Prince
of Wales Island has not been restricted, Funk said. A spokesman for
the Alaska Marine Highway said no ferries are scheduled in or out of
Prince of Wales Island today [15 Oct 2008] and that the schedule had
nothing to do with the viral outbreak.

Prior to the outbreak in Prince of Wales, there had been a few
isolated cases of adenovirus 14 [infection] in Alaska that were
confirmed by the Fairbanks laboratory. But the state had never seen a
cluster of adenovirus 14 outbreaks [cases?] before, Funk said.
"Nationally, it's been seen only rarely until the past year, where
there have been a number of outbreaks," she said. "It seems like it
may be what we call an emerging infection." In the past 2 years,
there have been outbreaks of the virus in Oregon, Washington and Texas.

Funk believes that the number of illnesses reported from the very ill
is only capturing the "tip of the iceberg." As with other viruses,
there is a range in the severity of the illness an individual may
experience. Those suffering from other health problems should contact
their health care providers immediately if they experience any of the
adenovirus symptoms. "If you've had other problems, you want to give
your health care provider a call and not try to tough it out at
home," Funk said. "There have been deaths associated with this virus
in other outbreaks. I wouldn't say (death) is common, but it's more
of a serious illness than most of the other adenoviruses."

[Human adenovirus 14 is a member of the B subgroup of human
adenoviruses, viruses associated with upper and lower respiratory
tract illness. Type B adenoviruses are widespread in the community
and have been associated with recurrent outbreaks of severe
respiratory illness among recruits in military training units both in
the UK and the USA. Previously in the USA, types 3 and 7 predominated
among military recruits and were controlled by vaccination.
Subsequent to (but probably not related to) the discontinuation of
vaccination, new types have emerged, most recently type 14 (Emergence
of adenovirus type 14 in US military recruits -- a new challenge.
Binn LN, Sanchez JL, Gaydos JC. .J Infect Dis. 2007 Nov
15;196(10):1465-73). These outbreaks reflect the prevalence of B
subgroup adenoviruses in the general population. Indeed, type 14
adenovirus has appeared throughout the USA during the past 2 years in
association with acute forms of respiratory illness (see the
ProMED-mail references below).
