Brunei is maintaining the ban on the import of planktivorous fish such as
mackerel, sardines and molluscan shellfish such as oysters and mussels from
East Malaysia. The decision followed recent information from the Department
of Fisheries, Sabah indicating that the waters of Sabah especially in Kota
Kinabalu, Kota Belud and Kuala Penyu are still contaminated with Red Tide
toxin.
A joint statement by Brunei's Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Industry
and Primary Resources and the Ministry of Health stated that: "However the
waters of the neighbouring places of Labuan, Lawas, Limbang, Awat-Awat,
Sipitang and Miri have been found to be free of Red Tide. Controlled
importation of mackerel caught in these waters is allowed.
"As an added precautionary measure the public is advised to completely
remove the guts, gills and other internal organs of fish before cooking.
"The public is also advised to abstain from eating planktivorous fish and
molluscan shellfish such as clams, cockels, mussels of unknown origin until
further notice.
"The public is also informed that the waters of Brunei Darussalam remain
free of Red Tide. Importers of fish and molluscan shellfish are reminded
that under the Fisheries Act, it is an offence to import fish and molluscan
shellfish without permit or which are banned. If found guilty the penalty
is a fine of B$2,500 and one year imprisonment."
