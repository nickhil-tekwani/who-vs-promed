A debate over the spread of avian flu to Europe's doorstep is dividing the
scientific community
---------------------------------------------------
In Cambodia, authorities on Wednesday sprayed vaccine at 7 north western
farms containing nearly 16 000 ducks as a precaution after a mystery
illness decimated the flocks, even though tests so far had proved negative
for bird flu. A senior official from the agriculture ministry's department
of animal health confirmed local media reports that concerned duck farmers
had first reported mass deaths and illness in the flocks at farms just
outside the north western city of Battambang on 11 Sep 2005. He said
despite initial tests proving negative for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, the
birds were continuing to die in significant numbers and no cause had as yet
been identified.
"We are spraying the farms as a precaution because the results returned on
13 Sep from initial tests were negative for H5N1, as were tests results
returned to us from the lab yesterday, but ducks there are still dying,"
the official said, adding that the 7 farms under observation supported
around 15 480 ducks, and Battambang, which lies just 20 km to the south of
the affected farms, is a major transport hub for livestock and goods
arriving from the nearby border with Thailand.
At least 1000 ducks had succumbed to the mystery illness in the past week,
the official said. Cambodia has recorded 4 confirmed human deaths from
avian influenza so far, and thousands of birds have been culled or died of
the disease in the past year as the virus sweeps the region.
