St Louis encephalitis [SLE] is a disease with symptoms similar to those of
dengue. In 5 months, Sao Jose do Rio Prieto has recorded 6 times as many
cases of SLE as in the entire history of the state. The only case
recognized previously in Sao Paulo occurred in 2004, in the [state]
capital. There were 2 other cases in Brazil in the 1960s. St. Louis
encephalitis is caused by a virus in the flavivirus family, as is dengue virus.
The disease was detected in tests by the Virology Laboratory of the Faculty
of Medicine of Rio Prieto in patients suspected of [having] dengue.
The cases occurred between March and June of [2006] but were confirmed by
the laboratory within the following 2 months. The cases had the same
symptoms: high fever, headache, and malaise.

[St Louis encephalitis (SLE) cases have been described at various times in
Brazil, including Sao Paulo, but they have always been sporadic ones. I
spoke personally with a virologist and the virus was sequenced in all cases.
It is possible to assert that St Louis encephalitis may be more common than
has been imagined, perhaps mistaken for other diseases, including dengue. -
Mod.LJS
Given the spread in the western hemisphere of West Nile (WN) virus, a
flavivirus closely related to SLE virus, ProMED-mail requests information
about the results of any tests carried out to distinguish between these 2
agents. The southward movement of WN virus suggests that sooner or later it
will arrive in Brazil.
