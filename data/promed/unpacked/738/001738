Human brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan
-------------------------------
An outbreak of brucellosis has been reported in the Jelalabad region of
Kyrgyzstan in the south of the republic. At this time, 183 persons have been
diagnosed and hospitalized with this disease, according to the administration
of the region. It is thought that all of them fell ill after the consumption of
infected meat and dairy products and that the source of infection is domestic
cattle.
For this time period in 2004 [1st 6 months], the number of cases was 30
percent lower than in 2005.

[Brucellosis is endemic in small ruminants and in cattle in Kyrgyzstan. It may
be assumed, but needs confirmation, that the main causal agent in these species
(and, consequently, in humans) is _Brucella melitensis_. Data pertaining to
that issue are necessary. - Mod.AS]
[Brucellosis is a category B bioterrorism disease. - Mod.LL]
