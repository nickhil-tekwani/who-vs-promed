Ministry of Agriculture: China's recent large-scale outbreak of pig
disease outbreak - not
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The China Ministry of Agriculture announced today (23 Oct 2009) that
recent reports of epidemics among pigs in the north are not true.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, after reports of outbreaks
among pigs were published, the ministry sent teams to the area to
investigate the reports. By 20 Oct 2009, of the 31 provinces,
autonomous regions, and municipalities, 5 provinces reported
outbreaks of blue-ear disease [porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome - PRRS]. There were 7600 pigs with disease, and more than
7700 had been culled. The numbers of outbreaks and pigs culled are
much decreased compared to the same period last year [2008]. Other
diseases are stable.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Angela Huang

[The current reservations, cited above, are in disagreement with news
derived from local Chinese media, claiming that "in the North and
Northeast, the magnitude of the outbreak has been about 2 times than
what was seen in 2006". An official, firsthand notification,
preferably to the OIE, will be helpful in clearing-up the current
PRRS situation in north and northeast China.

According to China's semi-annual reports to the OIE for 2008, a total
of 91 PRRS outbreaks were recorded in 13 provinces during that year.
Cases occurred during all months, with higher incidence (64/91, 70
percent) during the 7 months April-October. The outbreaks were
reported from the following 13 provinces (in brackets, annual number
of outbreaks): Chongking (18), Anhui (1), Guangdong (27), Guangxi
(15), Guizhou (1), Hebei (2), Henan (1), Hubei (2), Hunan (5),
Jiangxi (13), Ningxia (4), Shanghai (1), Sichuan (1). - Mod.AS]

China PRRS virulence - Ebola?
-----------------------------
Re- the unusual high virulence of the PRRS epizootic in China: this
is how the initial diagnostic investigation began that led to the
Ebola-Reston virus detection in Philippine swine. It might be good to
look further at other potential sources for the increased virulence.

[Dr Edhlund's comment is valid. A reminder: between the end of 2007
and mid 2008, a sudden increase in pig mortalities was seen in the
northern Philippines. Samples from the outbreaks were sent to the
USDA Plum Island laboratory. Results showed that samples were
positive for porcine circovirus type 2 and atypical PRRS virus,
which, reportedly, was 98 percent homologous to the atypical PRRS
virus isolated in China and Viet Nam. With high morbidity and
mortality observed similar to China and Viet Nam, it was concluded
that these outbreaks were most likely caused by atypical PRRS virus.
However, the USDA Plum Island laboratory also reported to have
isolated Ebola-Reston virus from swine samples (see commentary in
ProMED-mail posting 20081220.4008).

On the other hand, according to an August 2007 Emerging Disease
Notice of APHIS (US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services),
titled "Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) in
Vietnam and China", samples of the virus from the PRRS outbreak in
Viet Nam "were being sent to an international laboratory for further
testing and characterization. In view of the need to exclude
Ebola-Reston virus, ProMED-mail remarked: "It will be interesting to
note if the samples from Viet Nam included tissues of affected
porcines; in case affirmative -- were they tested for other disease
agents in addition to the PRRS virus, and what were the results?"
(see posting 20081216.3946).

Additional requests for information on the results of tests, which
may have been performed by an international reference laboratory (the
Plum Island laboratory?) on porcine samples from Viet Nam, were
posted at later dates and are still pending. - Mod.AS]
