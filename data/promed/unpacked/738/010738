Stripe rust has been found in a crop in the lower north of South
Australia. The fungal disease affects wheat crops and can halve crop yield.
Agronomist Bill Long says the affected crop is well developed and
farmers should be looking out for other outbreaks. "Experience with
stripe rust in the past is that it can spread quite quickly, given
the right conditions, and I guess we've had a slightly warmer July
and early August [2007] than we've thought," he said. "With a little
bit of moisture I would expect that this disease could move
reasonably rapidly throughout the cropping districts."

Rainfall in early September [2007] may spell disaster for some pulse
crops in South Australia.
_Botrytis fabae_, otherwise known as chocolate spot, has been
identified in some faba bean crops in South Australia. The disease is
a mouldy fungus, which spreads in humid conditions and if there is a
wet spring it has the potential to wipe out large areas of pulse crops.
The South Australia Research and Development Institute's Jenny
Davidson says the disease was not expected this early. "Chocolate
spot likes to have warmish wet conditions. While these faba bean
crops were relatively humid, because of the cold weather we've been
seeing we hadn't anticipated that chocolate spot would be underway so
we're a little bit surprised."

[Wheat stripe rust, also called yellow rust, is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide mostly
in cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of
plants, and reduced grain number and size on developing heads. Yield
losses may vary from 40 up to 100 percent. It affects wheat, some
barley varieties, triticale, and a number of grass species. Spores
are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. The
fungus needs living plants to survive between seasons, it cannot
survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer plants may generate a
"green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops.
Chocolate spot caused by the fungus _Botrytis fabae_ is an important
disease of pulses (annual leguminous crops) including faba bean
(_Vicia faba_; also called broad bean, horse bean, Windsor bean,
field bean, winter bean). It is 1st seen as brown spots appearing on
lower leaves. This is its 'non-aggressive' phase, which is thought to
have little effect on crop yield. If warm, humid conditions persist
for several days, the disease will spread quickly and be termed
'aggressive'. It is one of the most destructive diseases in the
region of the Nile Delta and other African regions, such as Ethiopia.
The disease progresses with blighting of leaves, defoliation and loss
of flowers and pods. Stems can weaken with a strong tendency to
collapse. Flowers and pods may also develop lesions, although
affected seeds are still edible. The fungus may produce a plant toxin
thought to be responsible for the damage to the host tissue. A strong
relationship exists between disease infection in the podding region
and seed yield. Disease management includes burning of plant residue
at the end of cropping, wide spacing of plants, limiting the amounts
of nitrogenous fertilizers, crop rotation, use of clean seed, control
of volunteer plants, and fungicides. Host cultivars with varying
levels of tolerance are being developed.
The related, more virulent species _B. cinerea_ affects a similar
range of crops intermittently, and is usually confined to the
flowering season. Other species in the genus affect a range of crops,
and many have a worldwide distribution.
Cultivated faba bean is used as food (important in many developing
countries), animal feed, and sometimes grown for green manure and
crop rotation. Faba bean straw is used for brick making and as fuel
and considered a premium cash crop in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan.
