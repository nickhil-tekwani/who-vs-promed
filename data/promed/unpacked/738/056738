Hundreds of people have died in Uganda and neighbouring Kenya, following an
outbreak of highland malaria, so called because it periodically sweeps
through highlands of Western Kenya which are not endemic malaria areas.
The worst outbreak is reported in West Pokok District where the medical
officer of health Gideon Torom put the number of cases at 18,000 of whom more
than 100 have died.
Ortum Mission Hospital was crowded with malaria cases and Dr. Torom appealed
to residents to report to hospital immediately instead of treating malaria
cases with traditional herbs.
In Uasin Gishu District, the District Commissioner Eliud Parsankul declared
an anti-malaria campaign and mobilised health and other government staff "to
cope with this menace."
More than 350 patients had been admitted in various hospitals within the
district and the D.C. said he had mobilised government vehicles to conduct
mobile clinics in remote areas of the district.
In Uganda's Kapchorwa district, about 150 people are reported dead due to
malaria. The district Medical Officer of Health Dr. Richard Okech confirmed
an increase in malaria cases and attributed the deaths to patients in rural
communities reporting late to hospitals or taking under dosage of drugs.
The Kenya Medical Association (KMA) Chairman blamed inefficiency in the
Ministry of Health for an upsurge in malaria cases.
Dr. Khama Rogo said public services, particularly environmental and sanitary
health aspects "were almost non-existent in Kenya and had completely
compromised the country's ability to control malaria."
Researchers at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) have been
studying highland malaria outbreaks for over ten years.
They blame the high incidences of the disease on a number of factors,
including post-famine suppression of immune systems of individuals in Kenya's
western highlands, due to inadequate nutrition following a period of
prolonged food shortages. The doctors' drug of choice is quinine.
