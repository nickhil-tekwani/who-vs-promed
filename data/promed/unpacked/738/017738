China county culls 11 000 dogs after 6 people die from rabies
-------------------------------------------------------------
Officials in a rural county of south-western China's Yunnan province
ordered the culling of more than 11 000 dogs after rabies killed 6
people, state media said on Sunday [26 Oct 2008] . Of the more than
90 000 dogs in Yunnan's Mi'le county, some 84 000 had been vaccinated
against rabies and another 11 500 unprotected dogs were culled, the
Beijing News quoted local media as saying. The county government
threatened to fine people who failed to hand over their dogs but some
locals protested that the policy of culling all unprotected dogs was
heavy handed, arguing that people in remote areas relied on guard
dogs, the newspaper said. Local government officials said the culling
was essential to prevent the spread of the rabies virus, it said.
After the first death in late July [2008], workers killed all cats
and dogs within a 5-kilometer (3.1 mi) radius of the victim's home, it said.

The number of deaths from rabies has risen in China in recent years,
with more than 3000 deaths reported in 2006, and some experts put
part of the blame on a higher rate of dog ownership. Dogs are
commonly kept as pets or guards in many rural areas of China but were
banned in cities until recently. Some breeds are also popular for
their meat in many areas of northern and southern China.

[Rabies is a vaccine preventable disease with good vaccines available
for both pre- and post- exposure treatment of humans, and
preventative vaccines (pre-exposure) for animals. The continued
occurrence of human cases, associated with contact with domestic
animals such as cats and dogs, signals deficiencies in the
vaccination programs -- frequently at the level of the population
where the domestic animals are not vaccinated, and when humans are
bitten, they do not seek immediate attention for post exposure prophylaxis.

In a recent publication from BioMed Central (posted on the general
ProMED-mail list Rabies - China: increased incidence 20080826.2660),
Han Si et al reviewed trends in human rabies cases in China during
the period 1990 to 2007. "The authors found that rabies was most
frequently encountered in the southwestern and southern territories
of China, especially in highly populated areas. Lu said, "The 4
rabies-endemic provinces (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan)
lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample
supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans."

Most of the patients were children or teenagers, and most contracted
the disease after being bitten by a dog, usually on the head and
neck. According to the authors, "In the worst-affected province,
Guangdong, 62.5 percent of patients did not receive proper treatment
on their wounds, 92.5 percent did not receive adequate post-exposure
vaccination, and 91.25 percent did not receive any anti-rabies
immunoglobulin." (See Han Si, Zhong-Min Guo, Yuan-Tao Hao, Yu-Ge Liu,
Ding-Mei Zhang, Shao-Qi Rao, and Jia-Hai Lu: Rabies trend in China
(1990-2007) and post-exposure prophylaxis in the Guangdong province.
BMC Infectious Diseases, (published 21 Aug 2008), available at
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2334-8-113.pdf>. This
moderator highly recommends reading this article).

Yunnan province is responding to reports of 6 human cases of rabies
in a short period. It was not mentioned as a high incidence province
in Han Si et al's study, and while background data of numbers of
cases reported per year in Yunnan over the preceding years were not
available, one presumes that the rabies control program has been
successful in Yunnan in recent years. The issue of an alert with
major animal control activities following 6 cases seems to support
that presumption.

The incidence of human rabies in China is very high. Currently there
is a global shortage of human anti-rabies vaccine and anti-rabies
immunoglobulin. Consequently travellers to the southern provinces of
China in particular should avoid contact with domestic dogs and cats,
and not rely on the availability of post-exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.CP]
