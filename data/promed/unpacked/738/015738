Amid the coronavirus outbreak, Bihar has now reported 9 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome [AES], also known as brain fever, which killed more than 300 children in the state last year [2019].

Last month [March 2020], a 3-year-old boy died due to acute encephalitis syndrome at the ICU of state-run Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur around 48 hours after his admission, said Gopal Shankar Sahni, the head of the pediatric department of the facility.

The SKMCH accounted for about 120 deaths due to AES last year [2019]. Another AES patient, a 5-year-old girl of East Champaran district, is showing improvement, said the hospital's superintendent S K Shahi.

[The AES and Japanese encephalitis season is beginning in Bihar state as it has done annually for many years. There is no indication of whether any of the 9 cases mentioned above were tested for Japanese encephalitis virus infection. AES is a common ailment in children in northeastern India, especially in Bihar state.

The issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The above report does not indicate whether any of the above etiologies have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES cases occur is just beginning, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 6-7 months. - Mod.TY
