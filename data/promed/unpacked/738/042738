Control Of First Rift Valley Fever Outbreak Outside Africa Is Under Way: WHO
Assists Saudi Arabia And Yemen
-----------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners are responding to an
outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Saudi Arabia (Jizan Province) and an
outbreak of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome in Yemen, (Wadi Mawr,
Al-Hudaydah Governorate), which is suspected to be RVF. The first cases of
suspected viral haemorrhagic fever were reported in the area on 10 and 11
Sep 2000. Laboratory analysis at the United States' Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, confirmed a diagnosis of RVF in
samples from Saudi Arabia. To date, 134 human cases of an acute haemorrhagic
fever syndrome, including 31 deaths, have been reported in Yemen, while in
Saudi Arabia there have been 160 suspected cases of RVF, including 33 human
deaths. [Rift Valley Fever is a viral zoonosis that may cause severe disease
in both animals and humans leading to high morbidity and mortality. The
disease was first identified in Kenya's Rift Valley in 1930, and is fully
described in WHO Fact Sheet NÂ° 207. These are the first cases of Rift
Valley Fever reported outside traditionally affected areas in Africa. It is
important to establish whether this is a new introduction of the virus or
whether, in fact, the pathogen has been present for some time and only now
has come to the attention of public health authorities. Ecological studies
are being carried out to determine the factors that may have triggered the
outbreak.
WHO, in conjunction with its international partners in the field, is
providing expert advice to the governments concerned in disease
confirmation, field investigation and implementation of control measures to
contain the spread of the disease, advising on how cases can be treated with
the antiviral drug, ribavarin, disseminating health education messages, and
putting in place measures to protect high risk groups, such as laboratory
technicians and veterinarians. High-level agreement between Saudi Arabia and
Yemen to conduct a joint investigation has ensured effective coordination of
the international response to control the disease on both sides of the
border. Saudi Arabia and Yemen are sharing useful information, including the
investigation protocols, and there is good logistic coordination across the
border. WHO Rift Valley Fever expert Dr Ray Arthur has played a key role
investigating and responding to previous RVF outbreaks. "I'm working with
both governments in the outbreak zone to facilitate coordination of the
investigation and implement control procedures across the border," he stated.
In Yemen, WHO and partners are assisting with the control of an acute
haemorrhagic fever syndrome (suspected to be Rift Valley Fever). Laboratory
studies are under way to confirm that the observed disease is in fact RVF.
Earlier this week an Epidemic Committee comprised of all relevant Government
Ministries in Yemen and a team of international experts, epidemiologists and
laboratory technicians from WHO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and the United States' NAMRU-3, a WHO Collaborating
Centre in Cairo, began implementation of a joint plan of action to curb the
spread of the outbreak. Dr Arthur plans to arrive in Saudi Arabia today and
was replaced yesterday in Yemen by WHO epidemiologist Dr Douglas Klaucke,
who will continue the advice and coordination function of WHO. In Saudi
Arabia, WHO, CDC and specialists in entomology and ecological studies from
the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in South Africa-all partners in the
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network-are providing direct assistance
to the Ministry of Health and the Field Epidemiology Training Programme
(FETP).

Fumigation of 'fever' area planes ordered
-----------------------------------------
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: The UAE authorities yesterday said all flights coming
from areas infected with Rift Valley Fever will be fumigated at UAE
airports. The authorities also recommended strict inspections of all
imported animal feeds to ensure they are free of the virus [presumably
originating from virus-free areas?. It was also decided to ban livestock
imports from Djibouti. A spray campaign against mosquitoes will be launched
throughout he country, particularly in border areas and at entry points.
International health experts, meanwhile, surveyed border areas in Saudi
Arabia and Yemen yesterday to help arrest the spread of the fever. Officials
in both countries said the death toll rose by Monday night to 60 from 55.
Saudi Arabia said 148 people have been infected since the outbreak of the
disease, of whom 30 have died and 21 have recovered. Yemen said 113 people
were infected of whom 30 died. The Rome-based UN Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) said on Monday it had reports of at least 74 deaths while
newspapers and local medical sources say more than 200 people have died.
An Omani delegation yesterday toured the most affected areas in Al Hudaidah
province in Yemen to study the situation.

Singapore Ministry of Health Advises Against Travelling To Saudi Arabia and
Yemen
------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: In view of the outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Saudi
Arabia and Yemen, Singaporeans are advised to avoid travelling to these
countries. Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral disease that affects cattle,
buffalo, sheep, goats, camels and humans. The incubation period of RVF in
humans varies from 2 to 6 days, but those who experience influenza-like
illness, with sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle pain and backache, are
advised to consult a doctor. Some patients may also experience neck
stiffness, discomfort when looking at bright light, drowsiness and vomiting.
Patients usually recover within 2 days to one week after the onset of the
illness. However, in some patients the illness can progress to haemorrhagic
fever, encephalitis , or infection of the eye. About one percent of humans
that become infected with RVF die of the disease. There is no known
effective medication or vaccine available [for humans.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
TORONTO: Skylink Aviation Inc., a Canadian rapid response air logistics
company specializing in peacekeeping, emergency and disaster relief
missions, has been contracted to send helicopters and aircraft to Saudi
Arabia to spray mosquitos that have caused an outbreak of Rift Valley fever.
Skylink's fleet of 7 helicopters and 11 fixed wing aircraft was on the
ground in Saudi Arabia yesterday and will begin spraying mosquitos today (29
Sep 2000) throughout Jizan, a low altitude area in the southwestern part of
Saudi Arabia bordering on Yemen to the south and the Red Sea to the west.
Skylink, which has a US$1.7 million contract for spraying with the Kingdom
