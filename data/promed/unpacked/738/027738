Anthrax creates Panic in Koraput of Orissa
------------------------------------------
Panic is occurring in the tribal villages of Koraput due to anthrax,
a disease which comes from cattle. In Koraput District it rears up
every year. Like every year before, this year some 56 persons are
affected by the disease and are under treatment; according to
government reports 3 have died but unofficially 4 have died. In the
Semiliguda Block of Koraput District, one died in Kunduli Village and
2 from Gunthaput according to the government reports. But on 21 Jun
2009 M. J. of Andoput Village died of the said disease. In the past 7
days, 8 people were affected in Gamphaguda Village.

Last year [2008], after the death of 4 anthrax patients in Luhaba
Village, the Central NICD investigation team investigated this area
and collected sand [?soil] from the areas. Since the teams returned
from the Luhaba the nearby villages were also affected this year.

In the Government Record it is mentioned that in year 2004, 11
persons were affected and 3 died; in 2005, 39 were affected and 5
died; in 2006, 18 were affected and 4 died; in 2007, 64 were affected
and 11 died. Similarly in 2008 out of 68 affected, 8 died. To date
this year 56 are affected and are under treatment. This disease
spreads when semi-cooked cattle meat is consumed by tribal villagers.
Due to which in the past 5 years about 35 persons are died from
anthrax in Koraput District. [From the reporter's numbers it was 31.

[I had to redraft this report as the English left something to be
desired but not without amusement ... "3 are killed by Govt. record."
The important thing is that this event was reported. Orissa has long
been a major national contender for the highest numbers of this
disease in India. Just from these human data, which may not be
completely reliable and certainly do not match the official numbers
reported by OIE, the CFR for 2004 through 2008 is 15.5 percent,
varying from 12 percent to 27 percent. To date this year the CFR is 5
percent-7 percent. In 2006 OIE reported that the disease was endemic
in 18/30 districts in Orissa. Patently this livestock disease is long
overdue for an effective provincial control programme, involving
minimally the annual vaccination of livestock in these 18 districts,
if not province-wide.
