No indication that infected cattle entered food chain
-----------------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture in Ireland has told consumers there is no
danger of infected meat getting into the food chain after an outbreak of
botulism in cattle.
The rare form of poisoning, which has killed a number of cattle in recent
months, is caused by bacteria in contaminated feed. The latest case was
reported in Waterford. Last night, a department spokesperson said there was
no indication that any of the infected cattle had entered the food chain.
After the toxin is eaten, the clinical signs of the disease appear in
between one and 7 days. As the disease spreads, the cow loses control of
the muscles. The muscle weakness spreads from the hind legs, gradually
moving to the head.
Similar outbreaks of botulism have also been reported in Northern Ireland,
Britain and across Europe.
Botulism is caused by a bacterium of the Clostridium family. The organisms
are widely distributed in nature but only occasionally give rise to
clinical disease in animals or humans. It is believed that the organism
proliferates in decaying organic material, producing the toxins that are
then taken up by animals.
The recent cases have been associated with cattle coming into contact,
directly or indirectly, with poultry litter that had been contaminated with
decaying poultry carcasses.
"While humans may be affected by botulism, it should be noted there are 8
known types of the botulinum toxin and that the specific toxins implicated
in the conditions in humans are not those normally associated with the
condition in cattle," the Department said in its statement. "It is also
generally accepted that humans are resistant to the types of toxin that
affect cattle. Furthermore, these toxin types are poorly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract and the toxins themselves are inactivated by heat
treatment. The risk to human health from consumption of milk or meat from
cattle on farms with cases of botulism, appears to be remote," it said.
As a precaution, however, the Department advised farmers to wear gloves, to
wash their hands thoroughly after handling poultry litter, and to avoid
unnecessary contact with the material. It also requested farmers and
veterinary practitioners to advise their local District Veterinary Office
or nearest Veterinary Regional Laboratory in the event of sudden and
unexplained illnesses or deaths of cattle on their farms which may be
associated with access to poultry litter.
