In referring to mosquitoes and birds as reservoirs of West Nile virus
(WNV), the comments by David Gaines and the response by the moderator
(MS) were both essentially correct, if you consider only what is in
the textbooks. But there is another possibility.
There are many published papers showing that flaviviruses, such as
WNV, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus
(SLEV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), etc. (and other
arboviruses), can be isolated from healthy non-viremic birds, and
indeed, from other species, such as rodents and bats. This is well
known to many arbovirologists globally.
Therefore, birds can carry the virus at levels that appear to be
below the threshold for easy detection by conventional methods.
Whether or not these apparently non-viremic birds reactivate the
virus to higher titres under stress or for some other reason has not
yet been formally established.
In this sense, birds and other species could be acting as reservoirs.
Alternatively, in theory at least, only one hungry/thirsty infected
mosquito may be needed to survive for the virus to start an epidemic
(see - Higgs et al (2005) PNAS 102, 8871-4).

[ProMED appreciates the commentary from Professor Ernie Gould. The
current thread of discussion was initiated right after hurricane
Katrina, as of 12 Sep 2005 (see archive: 20050906.2640). What we are
most concerned with are mosquito-borne infectious diseases, in
particular, the diseases caused by flaviviruses. Many human
flaviviral diseases, such as WNV, JEV and SLE etc., require a 2-host
life cycle (i.e. bird-mosquito and vise versa) in which humans are
secondary victims. The cycle between birds and mosquitoes is
considered to be dependent mutually on the 2 species. Among these 2
hosts, which one serves as the reservoir depends on the disease, and
sometimes, on one's point of view.
I agree with Professor Gould that, theoretically, only one
hungry/thirsty infected mosquito may be required to survive for the
virus to start an epidemic. After a major hurricane, such as Katrina,
field evidence (see archive: 20050917.2746) provided by Colonel
Winslow showed that there were few adult female mosquitoes and an
eerie absence of birds. For normally ubiquitous mosquitoes to recover
their full population, it may take a month or so, as mentioned by
many entomologists. But for the warm-blooded and brainy birds to
return to their normal habitats, I wonder how long it will take. I am
not an expert in ornithology. Colleagues from this field are welcomed
to share their views with us. I overheard that Montserrat Island was
totally silent without birds and bird song right after hurricane
Hugo's visit in 1992 (August).
With or without a lessened population of birds (migratory or
terrestrial) and fewer surviving infective adult female mosquitoes,
one would not expect an unusual surge of outbreaks of endemic
flaviviral infections in the hurricane stricken area, such as New
Orleans and Louisiana more broadly. - Mod.RY]

Clouds of mosquitoes are rising from the stagnant waters left by
Hurricane Katrina, plaguing recovery workers and posing a disease
threat, said a Fort Collins entomologist who is helping to coordinate
the public-health response.
"The mosquito numbers have taken off and are building," said Janet
McAllister, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We're
talking biblical proportions. Clouds of mosquitoes," McAllister said
Monday from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
McAllister is one of 6 Fort Collins CDC mosquito experts in Louisiana
and Mississippi. She is working with state health officials to revive
mosquito-control programs disrupted by the storm.
2 Air Force planes were scheduled to spray insecticide over about 150
000 acres (about 234 square miles) east and south of New Orleans on
Monday night. An area about the same size is to be sprayed tonight
north of the city, McAllister said.
The main mosquito-borne disease of concern is West Nile virus. 62
cases of West Nile illness have been reported in Louisiana and
Mississippi this year. Some eastern equine encephalitis cases also
were observed in animals before the storm hit.
Mosquito numbers started exploding about 3 days ago, McAllister said.
One Louisiana mosquito-control district reported that the number of
trapped mosquitoes has increased 800 percent over pre-Katrina levels,
she said.
Many of the newly hatched mosquitoes are "floodwater" species that
don't normally pose a serious disease threat. Mosquitoes that usually
live in tree canopies have been forced to the ground by storm damage,
and populations of salt-marsh mosquitoes are booming.
"They're very aggressive biters, and they can get to such numbers
that the power linemen can't work -- even with repellent on,"
McAllister said. "They can't function because there are so many
mosquitoes."
Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the Fort Collins CDC lab, said it's
unclear how the number of human West Nile cases will be affected.
"We've never had a hurricane hit when there was a lot of West Nile
virus activity happening at the time, so we're not quite sure what's
going to happen," Petersen said. "We're kind of in uncharted
territory."
Areas hit hardest by Katrina might see little increase in the number
of West Nile cases. In those places, West Nile-infected mosquitoes
were either killed or blown away by the storm. And many of the wild
birds that serve as a reservoir for the virus are gone as well.
"It's outside the hardest-hit areas that we would expect the West
Nile that's in the area to continue," said McAllister, who grew up in
New Orleans.
Mosquito populations are exploding on the Gulf Coast at a time when
the risk of human exposure to the blood-suckers is very high.
Rescue and recovery teams spend all day outside, and some of them
camp in tents at night. Some displaced residents are living outside.
In storm-damaged houses that remain habitable, lack of air
conditioning due to ongoing power outages has forced occupants
outside to escape the heat.
"I've never seen anything like this," McAllister said. "I can only
imagine this is what Europe looked like after World War II. There are
displaced people everywhere, and there are huge camps of responders
everywhere, living in tents. So we've got huge numbers of people --
responders as well as citizens -- that can't get away from the
mosquitoes."

[This has a different perspective than our previous posts. Clearly a
hurricane of this magnitude has not hit since West Nile Virus arrived
in the United States. - Mod.TG]
