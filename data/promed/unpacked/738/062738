Health officials expressed concern on Tuesday about signs of an outbreak of
a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis, state radio said. The disease has
been discovered in at least 6 patients in Sri Lanka in the last few weeks,
state radio said quoting health officials.
The report said that officials throughout the island were on alert against
the new strain, which occurred when tuberculosis patients had not completed
a full course of medicine.
At least 8000 Sri Lankans had been confirmed to have tuberculosis
[presumably the approximate total number of cases at the present time -
Mod.ES, and between 300 and 400 die of the disease each year, the radio
said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said in 1999 that tuberculosis
was one of the world's most deadly diseases.

[This report could be describing 6 unrelated cases of multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis in patients who did not complete proper therapy, or it could
be describing an outbreak caused by a common strain of drug-resistant
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Additional information would be appreciated.
