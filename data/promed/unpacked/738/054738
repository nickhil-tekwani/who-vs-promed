A strain of antibiotic-resistant [_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_] is growing
in Ontario at an alarming pace, raising fears that the era of
practicing safe sex is on its way out, according to a new Canadian study.

Rates of [infections due to _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_] resistant to
antibiotics known as [fluoroquinolones] jumped from 4 per cent of
cases in 2002 to 28 per cent in 2006, a study published today [3 Feb
2009] in the Canadian Medical Association Journal reveals [see
<http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/180/3/287>].

"The magnitude of the rate of resistance to [fluoroquinolones] is
unusually high by any threshold reported in North America," the study
said. The findings add further woe to already-surging gonorrhea
infection rates. From 1997 to 2007, infection rates more than doubled
in Canada, from 15 to 35 cases for every 100 000 people. Growing
evidence suggests that gonorrhea, a highly adaptable infection, is
becoming increasingly resistant to a variety of antibiotics, which
has major implications for future control and treatment of the
disease. The rising incidence of [fluoroquinolone]-resistant
[_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_] confirms those worries.

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection that, if
untreated, can lead to pelvic pain and scarring of the fallopian
tubes in women and of the urethra in men, contributing to infertility
in both genders.

The increased infection rates raise concerns that people are
abandoning safe-sex practices, which could have major and
wide-reaching effects on the population's health, according to Susan
Richardson, head of microbiology at the Hospital for Sick Children
[in Toronto] and senior author of the study. "We are concerned that
people are not taking the same precautions for the prevention of
sexually transmitted infections that they could," said Dr.
Richardson, who is also a consultant to the Ontario Agency for Health
Protection and Promotion.

[Fluoroquinolone]-resistant gonorrhea was most commonly found in
people over 30 [years of age], the study found. While other studies
have shown [fluoroquinolone]-resistant [_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_] to
be most prevalent among men who have sex with men, this study found
rates were split evenly with heterosexual men.

The resistant strain of [_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_] could have spread
through Ontario's population from people who have visited Asian
countries where the disease is widespread, the study said. Ontario
may have higher rates of [fluoroquinolone-resistant] [_Neisseria
gonorrhoeae_] because it is the largest province and a major transit
hub. Other highly populated travel centres, such as Sydney,
Australia, also have high rates of the antibiotic-resistant
infection, according to an editorial published along with the study.

While the spike in [fluoroquinolone]-resistant cases appears to be
greatest in Ontario, experts predict the trend will spread. "The
likelihood is that this will increase [in Ontario] and increase [in]
every province too," Dr. Richardson said.

There are other treatments to battle gonorrhea, including a group of
antibiotics known as cephalosporins that some countries, including
Canada [and the USA], now recommend instead of [fluoroquinolones].
Some people, however, may be allergic to those medications, making
their gonorrhea difficult to treat and raising their risk of health
consequences, such as infertility.

But an even bigger issue is that some reports show that strains of
[_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_] resistant to cephalosporins are emerging in
Pacific Rim countries, according to the editorial written by John
Tapsall, who is with the World Health Organization Collaborating
Centre for Sexually Transmitted Diseases at the Prince of Wales
Hospital in Sydney [see
<http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/180/3/268>].

One of the biggest disadvantages of antibiotics is that
[microorganisms] can mutate and become resistant to the medication,
according to Dr. Tapsall. Public health officials must take action to
bring infection rates down to prevent more resistant strains from
emerging and further limiting gonorrhea treatment options, he wrote.
"A recognition of these parallels [between resistance to
fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins] has led to renewed calls for
better control of gonococcal disease, including enhanced global
surveillance of resistance and improved treatment."

Comments on a remarkably high level of fluoroquinolone resistance in
gonorrhea isolates in Ontario (the bulk of which are from Toronto)
--------------------------------------------
In addition to the rapidity of the rise in fluoroquinolone [FQ]
resistance, other interesting features of Ontario's epidemiology
include a male-female predominance of FQ-resistant isolates that is
in excess of the expected male-female predominance in gonococcal [GC]
cases. However, although FQ-resistant isolates have been seen with
greater frequency in men who have sex with men [MSM] in the U.S.
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5316a1.htm),
we were unable to find an association between MSM status and
FQ-resistance, although our index of MSM (attendance at clinics
serving predominantly MSM clients) was admittedly non-precise.
Evaluation of the genetic epidemiology of FQ-resistant GC isolates in
Ontario is ongoing.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Fisman for his submission of the news report above
and his comments.

The World Health Organization and the U.S. CDC recommend the
substitution of a drug in treatment regimens for gonococcal disease
when the rate of resistance to that drug is 5 percent or higher in a
general community so that all recommended treatments for gonorrhea
can be expected to cure greater than 95 percent of gonococcal infections.

Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia
currently recommend the use of 3rd-generation cephalosporins
(cefixime or injectable ceftriaxone, or both) for gonorrhea
treatment. No treatment failures with the injectable ceftriaxone have
been reported, although failures with oral 3rd generation
cephalosporins have been reported (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/13/8/1275.htm>).

The following is extracted from the CDC recommendations for the
treatment of gonorrhea in the U.S.A. (see Morbid Mortal Week Rep MMWR
2007;56: 332-36, available from
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5614a3.htm>):

For the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal
gonorrhea, CDC now recommends a single intramuscular dose of
ceftriaxone 125 mg or a single oral dose of cefixime 400 mg. Some
evidence suggests that a single oral dose of cefpodoxime 400 mg or
cefuroxime axetil 1 g might be additional oral alternatives for the
treatment of urogenital and anorectal gonorrhea.

Alternative parenteral single dose regimens for urogenital and
anorectal gonorrhea include ceftizoxime 500 mg, cefoxitin 2 g with
probenecid 1 g orally, or cefotaxime 500 mg. However, these
cephalosporin regimens do not offer any advantage over ceftriaxone.
For persons with penicillin or cephalosporin allergies, a single
intramuscular dose of spectinomycin 2 g is a recommended alternative.
However spectinomycin is not available in the USA. Updated
information from CDC regarding the availability of cefixime and
spectinomycin will be available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/arg>.

For pharyngeal gonorrhea, CDC now recommends a single intramuscular
dose of ceftriaxone 125 mg; pharyngeal gonococcal infections often
are asymptomatic and more difficult to eradicate than urogenital and
anorectal infections. Spectinomycin, cefixime, cefpodoxime, and
cefuroxime axetil do not appear adequate for treating pharyngeal
gonococcal infections.

A single oral dose of azithromycin 2 g is effective against
uncomplicated gonococcal infections, but CDC does not recommend
widespread use of azithromycin because of concerns regarding rapid
emergence of resistance, as evidenced by the increase in azithromycin
MICs documented since 1999 in the USA and internationally. However,
azithromycin might be an option for treatment of uncomplicated
gonococcal infections from any site (i.e., urogenital, anorectal, and
pharyngeal) in persons with documented severe allergic reactions to
penicillins or cephalosporins.
