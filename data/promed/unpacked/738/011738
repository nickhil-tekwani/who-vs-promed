[For the map of the worldwide distribution of WPV associated cases in
2011, see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring.aspx.

In the past week there have been a total of 10 new cases of WPV
associated disease, 7 of which came from 3 of the 4 endemic countries
(Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan reported cases whereas India has
not confirmed a WPV associated case since January 2011.

Of the 3 cases of WPV associated disease reported from non-endemic
countries, Chad has reported 2 cases and one from the Xingjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in China. Of concern is that the latest reported
case in China represents spread to a previously non-affected
prefecture.

For those readers interested in the control measures ongoing in areas
having reported WPV associated disease in 2011, more detailed
information from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is available
