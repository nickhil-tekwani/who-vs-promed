An official said that 79 cases of chikungunya had been confirmed in the district. "We had sent the blood samples of suspected patients to the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad. The NIH confirmed 79 to be positive," said District Health Officer (DHO) Dr Muhammad Niaz. He said the disease 1st broke out in Gandaf village of Topi tehsil and Sherdara village of Razaar tehsil in the district.

The 2 affected villages are situated in separate tehsils but both are mountainous areas. "I spent the entire day at Gandaf village in the Gadoon Amazai belt and held a meeting with elders of the area while health officers and representatives of the local government were also present on the occasion," he said.

The NIH team also reached from Islamabad to analyse the cause of chikungunya, he added. Dr Niaz said 3 medical camps each in Gandaf and Sherdara had been established and the health teams worked round-the-clock to take care of the patients and educate others about precautionary measures. He said that 47 cases had been confirmed in Gandaf village and 32 in Sherdara village by the NIH tests.

The scare of chikungunya turned into a bigger threat, as only this month [September 2017] alone, 67 people fell victim to the disease. Director Health KMC Dr Mohammed Taufiq, during a press conference gave details on the spread of the disease in the city.

There exists the danger of an increase in cases and the citizens need to be cautious in this regard, he said. This current year [2017], 3462 suspected cases of chikungunya emerged, he said.

Director Health said that several times the issue of cleanliness has been raised before the Karachi Municipal Corporation.

[Dr Taufiq said that .....] precautionary measures are necessary such as use of nets. The disease is spread through mosquitoes and characterised by severe muscle/joint pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and also body rash. The symptoms are similar to dengue and can be misdiagnosed.

The disease takes from few days to weeks to fade away and in most cases patients have chances of complete recovery.
