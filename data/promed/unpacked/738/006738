Update 37 - SARS 23 Apr 2003 5:00 PM
------------------------------------
As of 23 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 330 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 16 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to
specific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific
community settings. This update is based on the information available to
Health Canada at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows: Ontario is reporting 136
probable and 131 suspect cases. British Columbia is reporting 4 probable
and 47 suspect cases. New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case. Alberta is reporting 5 suspect
cases. Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases. So far, 127
people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These people were
treated as suspect cases or as probable cases. These numbers are accurate
as of 1:00 PM EDST 23 Apr 2003.
Health Canada Reaction to WHO Travel Advice
On 23 Apr 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) extended its
recommendation to postpone non-essential travel to include Toronto. Health
Canada does not support the WHO's position; it is safe to travel to
Toronto. We have a clear understanding of the specific settings in which
this virus has been transmitted in Canada and confidence in the steps being
taken to manage infection control.
A travel alert from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
provides a more accurate assessment of the situation in Canada. It states
that: "Currently, all cases in Toronto are linked to Toronto's original
index case and spread has been through person-to-person contact. SARS
transmission in Toronto has been limited to a small number of hospitals,
households, and specific community settings."
Health Canada will be formally challenging the WHO's assertion that Toronto
is an unsafe place to visit through a letter to be sent today to the WHO.
Health Canada Investigation with Officials from CDC:
On 20 Apr 2003, Health Canada invited officials from CDC to come to Canada
to lend their expertise to a Health Canada-led investigation. They will be
assisting Health Canada officials as they spend time in hospitals in
Toronto, gathering information in order to compare the circumstances
surrounding those who were infected to those not infected. Health Canada
and the CDC will report as soon as possible, outlining the probable cause
of the transmission among health-care workers and recommendations for
additional measures that may be taken to prevent further spread.

WHO added Toronto today to its list of places that travelers should avoid
because of an outbreak of a contagious respiratory disease, shattering this
city's image as a safe place to live and visit. The decision stunned local
leaders and highlighted the impact of an illness that mysteriously emerged
from the Chinese countryside only a few months ago. Toronto is the first
locality outside China to be designated as a threat to international health
because of the respiratory disease. The group also added Beijing and Shanxi
Province in China to its list, joining Hong Kong and Guangdong Province as
the hot spots for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
Only 2 weeks ago, health care officials here expressed optimism that the
disease could be stopped. Efforts to trace every case and isolate everyone
who came in close, unprotected contact with every patient appeared to be
working because of what seemed to be efficient public health efforts and a
largely obedient public's accepting of volunteer quarantine. The
metropolitan Toronto area had 136 probable cases Tuesday, a more than 40
per cent rise in the last 2 weeks, although no new cases were reported today.
Even before WHO urged travelers to go to Toronto only if necessary -- a
message with enormous potential economic consequences -- the local hotel
industry had been devastated by almost daily cancellations of conventions.
Chinese malls and restaurants, the source of thousands of jobs in the large
Asian immigrant community, are almost empty. A forecast by JP Securities
Canada on Tuesday estimated that the epidemic in Toronto, Canada's largest
city and financial center, would cost the country $30 million a day. The
firm reduced its forecast for a 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent national
economic growth rate in the current quarter to 1 per cent.
City officials were livid about the WHO advice today, saying it was an
over-reaction that would worsen the economic impact of the disease. "I have
never been so angry in my whole life," Toronto's mayor, Mel Lastman, said.
"If it's safe to live in Toronto, it's safe to come to Toronto. This isn't
a city in the grips of fear and panic."
Several health officials acknowledged this week that they were confounded
by the challenge of keeping SARS from racing through hospital wards, among
family members of the sick, and then gradually spilling into the population
at large. Many are beginning to conclude that no quarantine system can be
foolproof for a disease that is hard to detect and easily confused with
other ailments in its initial phases.
About two thirds of the 330 probable and suspected cases in Canada have
been reported in Toronto. Perhaps more worrisome still is a report that a
woman who died a few days ago in the Philippines has now been determined to
have been infected with SARS in Toronto -- the first known death abroad
linked to the Canadian outbreak. WHO officials said that they took their
action against Toronto, in part, because of evidence that the disease had
been exported from the city.
A WHO official said the international spread included the death of the
Philippine woman, a nurse, and 3 probable cases in Australia linked to
trips to Toronto.
A US CDC team, invited by Canadian officials, arrived on Tuesday night to
monitor infection controls in Toronto hospitals. By the end of the week,
CDC will issue health warning cards to travelers entering the United States
from Toronto, urging them to see a doctor if they feel ill.
The daily number of new cases of SARS, brought here 2 months ago by an
elderly Chinese immigrant, was coming down. The vast majority of more than
7000 people put in quarantine had been released. 3 schools that had been
closed reopened. And most people infected were getting better. But the mood
among doctors has changed drastically in recent days.
The Mistakes: a chain of missteps adds to the risks
"SARS Rides the Rails," blared a front-page headline in The Toronto Sun
this week, echoing the first hints of a mood change in this otherwise
thoroughly stoical city.
A nurse who was not yet aware she was infected with the mysterious
respiratory disease had taken 2 commuter trains at rush hour. When news got
out, hundreds of panicky passengers called health hotlines to see whether
they might be in danger. 4 people have been found to have SARS in one north
Toronto condominium, and experts have been unable to tie one of them to any
previously known cluster. Some of the leaks are due to their own mistakes,
health officials acknowledge. In one early miscalculation, an infected
patient was transferred from one hospital to another, producing an entire
new pathway for the disease.
Last week, an infected doctor, who has said he was unaware of his disease,
went to a well-attended funeral only 2 days before going into the hospital.
And over the last weekend new reports indicated that the apparent breakdown
in isolation techniques caused a new cluster of cases among up to 15
employees at a major city hospital. Officials hypothesize that the workers
may have been prematurely taken off protective gear while in contaminated
rooms, with the virus apparently surviving on surfaces for as long as 24 hours.
The biggest potential leak surfaced 2 weeks ago, when health care officials
belatedly notified and isolated a church group of 500 people that had been
exposed at a 3 Apr 2003 funeral and subsequent prayer meetings. Many
members of the group were not notified until well after the incubation
period of the disease, usually around 10 days, meaning they could already
have exposed others outside the group. One infected man from this group was
turned away from as many as 3 hospitals before he received medical
attention for SARS, as officials misdiagnosed his mild symptoms. 29 people
among the church group, made up mostly of Philippine immigrants, have
become sick, with probable or suspected cases. Several are in critical
condition. 2 traveled to Pennsylvania and Montreal before they were
quarantined, fueling fears of further spread.
Hit hardest are the city's hospitals, where the forced quarantine of
hundreds of health workers and the closing of several emergency rooms and
other clinics has stretched manpower and resources to the limit. The
infection rate has grown so high in hospitals that this week workers were
ordered to wear 2 gloves and shields covering their entire faces when
treating patients. The use of full-body biohazard suits is being considered.

There are fears that the disease had reached the Philippines, especially
following the death of the Philippines' first "probable" SARS [case] last
week. [The woman], who worked as a nursing attendant in a home for the
elderly in Toronto, Canada, returned to the Philippines on 3 Apr 2003 to
look for a doctor for her cancer-stricken father. She rapidly developed
pneumonia-like symptoms and died on 14 Apr 2003.
Her 74 year old father, who was quarantined after his daughter's death,
died last Tuesday from "probable" SARS. Toronto, Canada's largest city, is
the center of the largest SARS outbreak outside Asia. A Philippine
Department of Health official stated that [the woman's] more than 250
relatives, neighbors, and friends living in Barangay Bakante in Alcala
Town, Pangasinan, were now under a 2 week quarantine.
Samples of [the woman's] and her father's blood were sent to a Japanese
laboratory for tests, which will confirm whether they were infected with
the virus.

[As mentioned above (and covered in ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide
(65): cases 20030423.0997), the WHO decision to add Toronto, Ontario,
Canada to the travel advice, recommending that all non-essential travel to
the area be postponed, was based on a report of a cluster of probable SARS
cases related to travel from Toronto in an as-yet-undisclosed country. The
newswire above suggests that this cluster may have occurred in the
Philippines, though confirmation of this is still pending. The issuing of
travel advice is a very difficult decision, as the economic consequences
may be significant. Of note, according to Health Canada's epidemiological
analysis of the ongoing epidemic current through 22 Apr 2003, the most
recent date of onset of SARS cases reported in Ontario was 14 Apr 2003 (see
epidemic curve presented at:
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030422_e.html>).
If the case in the Philippines is the precipitating factor for the issuing
of the travel advice regarding Toronto, it is to be noted that the date of
onset of that case pre-dates 14 Apr 2003, as the date of death reported was
14 Apr 2003. We await further information on this unfolding situation. -
