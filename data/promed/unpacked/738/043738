A migrant worker in Taiwan has been diagnosed with [a] hantavirus infection, the 1st case in the country this year [2019].

The afflicted individual, a male in his 20s, is a fisherman living in northern Taiwan. He has not traveled abroad recently, and his life is mostly spent at sea, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The male started exhibiting symptoms of the disease on 3 Aug [2019], including vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. He later developed liver and renal conditions before receiving a confirmed diagnosis of hantavirus infection.

Hantavirus is contracted through contact with rodent urine and feces or rodent bites. Signs and symptoms include fever, muscle pain, headache, abdomen pain, and flushing. Some patients may fall ill with symptoms like renal failure, hemorrhaging, and shock.

CDC noted that the individual has been discharged from hospital, and the health authorities have conducted sterilization and rodent control around locations he visited.

Taiwan sees around 0-2 cases of hantavirus infections a year, mostly among the indigenous population. Males account for 83 percent of the total confirmed cases. Residents are advised to sterilize areas contaminated by rodent excrement with diluted bleach.

[The circumstances under which the individuals acquired his hantavirus infection are not given, nor does the report above indicate which hantavirus is involved in this and in previous cases.

In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are: Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _Rattus norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in China.

The hantavirus most likely involved in the case above in Taiwan is Seoul virus harbored by _Rattus_ spp., as was the case in 2010 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100415.1221). People become infected when exposed to virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine; dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled.

An image of the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_, a reservoir of Seoul, virus can be accessed at http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg. - Mod.TY
