We have assayed mosquito samples using a PCR method developed in my lab and
patented by the University of Florida, for mosquito control [including
samples collected in Louisiana for the last 2 years. All the mosquitoes
that were assayed are _Culex quinquefasciatus_. We have noticed that two
samples from the 7/21/98 one from Jefferson Parish and one from Jackson
County were positive for SLEV. Since that time another sample was also
positive. This is 3 weeks before the first patient was diagnosed and at
least a month before the first sentinel chicken flock converted.

[The question was why there had been human cases without detecting
seroconversions in sentinel chickens (which should occur some time before
"spillover" to humans from avian hosts of St. Louis encephalitis virus.
Professor Borovsky tells us that using PCR allowed the detection of the
virus weeks before the first human case. I wonder whether the Louisiana
State Health Department knew of these results. As far as we know, New
Orleans newspapers have not reported these findings and, therefore, I can
only assume they were not told of such findings, perhaps because someone
forgot to tell them, perhaps because state officials were not themselves
informed. It would be quite irresponsible to know that a human pathogenic
arbovirus was circulating in mosquitoes and not notify state or local
officials. Might even be illegal in some places. - Mod.CHC
