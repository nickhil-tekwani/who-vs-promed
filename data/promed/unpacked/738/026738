[Today's (2 Jun 2014) reports bring the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia to 575 including 190 deaths. The 4 new cases include 2 individuals with stated multiple co-morbidities and 2 individuals without comorbidities, one of whom is stated to have had contact with a previously confirmed case. A map showing the locations of these newly reported cases and deaths can be found at the source URL.

Of note, in the last MERS-CoV update (MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (73): Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Jordan, WHO, RFI 20140601.2512766), this moderator erroneously labeled the reported case of MERS-CoV in Lebanon as an imported case with contact elsewhere in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, the individual's travel history was 5-8 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms and well outside of the observed incubation period, suggesting that infection was locally acquired in Lebanon. This moderator apologizes for this error. - Mod.MPP
