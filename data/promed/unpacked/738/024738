European health officials say there are signs that the outbreak of a
deadly strain of _E. coli_ [O104:H4] is stabilizing. They said that
despite nearly 200 new cases in Germany, the center of the outbreak,
in the 1st 2 days of June 2011, infection rates were dropping.
However, one doctor cautioned: "It may be less, but it's not over
yet."

At least 18 people have died, and 1836 have been infected by the bug
since it was 1st detected on 1 May 2011. Most of those affected are in
Germany. German clinics have been appealing for blood donations as
doctors have had to perform blood transfusions in severe cases.

The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's national disease centre,
said on Friday [3 Jun 2011] that in the previous 2 days, there had
been 199 new cases of the outbreak, bringing to 1733 the number of
infections. The WHO said a further 103 people in 12 other countries
had been sickened by the bug; all but one had recently traveled to or
from northern Germany.

Reinhard Brunkhorst, president of the German Nephrology Society, told
reporters there were some signs that the outbreaks were slowing. He
said hospitals in northern Germany, the epicenter of the scare, had
seen fewer new infections being reported each day.

"There is no reason for hysteria, because it's not spreading, and
it's not increasing; it's decreasing," he said. But he also stressed
that it was too early for doctors to positively say the end of the
outbreak was in sight.

[More "points on the curve" are needed to confirm the downtrend in
cases, which should be occurring unless a continuing source of
infection is present. With a fresh produce source, without continuing
exposure of newer produce, this is predictable. With a meat source
which can be frozen and stored, the cases can more easily continue. -

[2] Restaurant investigation

German scientists are looking for clues about the source of the
killer _E. coli_ [O104:H4] in a restaurant in the northern German town
of Lubeck after 17 people fell ill after eating there, a newspaper
reported on Sat 4 Jun 2011.

The 17 people who fell sick included a group of German tax officials
and tourists from nearby Denmark, the Lubecker Nachrichten newspaper
said.

"The restaurant is not to blame," said Werner Solbach, a
microbiologist at University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein.
"However, the supply chain could give us important clues about how the
pathogen was passed along."

A German woman, one of the tax officials at the Lubeck restaurant,
died after contracting the _E. coli_ strain. Many who contracted _E.
coli_ have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially
deadly complication that can affect the kidneys.

The group of German tax officials, who were attending a tax union
event, ate at the restaurant on 13 May 2011, the union head told
Reuters on Sat 4 Jun 2011. The Lubecker Nachrichten newspaper said all
victims ate there between 12-14 May 2011.

The German news magazine Focus reported on Sat 4 Jun 2011 that
officials are pursuing a theory in which the outbreak started at the
beginning of May 2011 in Hamburg, as people started becoming ill after
a week, consistent with _E. coli's_ incubation period.

food vehicle may be implicated as the source. ProMED awaits more

[3] Antimicrobial Issue

As enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ [O104:H4] continues to cause an
unprecedented number of life-threatening infections in Europe,
American medics are questioning Germany's approach to the outbreak,
according to the New York Times.

It reports that "the accepted medical wisdom in the USA is that EHEC
_E. coli_ infections should not be treated with antimicrobial agents
at all," and it quotes Phillip Tarr, pediatrician at Washington
University, as saying that treating patients with antimicrobial agents
to which the infecting bacteria are resistant is especially dangerous,
as this provides the infecting strain with a competitive advantage.
The NYT article also says that antibiotics can increase the chances of
kidney failure, although it does not explain how. (The reason is that
antibiotics prompt the bacteria to release more Shiga toxin, the
chemical responsible for the damage to blood vessels in the kidneys
that leads to renal failure during severe EHEC infections.)

Although you wouldn't realize it from the NYT article, German doctors
and microbiologists are well aware of these important, but not novel,
considerations. The German health authorities have told the press and
the public from the outset that the bacteria show unusual
antimicrobial resistance characteristics, but they have continually
stressed that they were not using these agents to treat these
infections. The resistance genes provide useful information to
epidemiologists and microbiologists who are trying to trace the source
of the outbreak and understand the virulence of the bacteria.

The standard treatment for the severe diarrhea and kidney failure
that can result from EHEC infections is fluid replacement and
dialysis. But these traditional methods are simply not enough to save
the lives of many severely ill patients in this outbreak. Ten days
ago, German clinicians turned to a new monoclonal antibody therapy
called eculizumab. Jan Kielstein, nephrologist at the Hannover Medical
Clinic, says that 200 patients have now been treated with eculizumab,
with promising outcomes, although it is too early to definitively
align these recoveries with the drug.

In the past 2 days, however, some German hospitals have begun using
antimicrobial agent treatments. "After intense discussions, there has
been a decision to recommend antimicrobial agents in some cases under
tight regulation of patient responses," says Angelika Fruth from the
Robert Koch Institute, the federal agency responsible for disease
control.

The German Association of Infection Biology (DGI) released a
statement on the use of antimicrobial agents on 3 Jun 2011. It states
that the use of certain antibiotics associated with enhanced toxin
secretion (including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides) is still
not recommended for EHEC infections. But it advises that the
carbapenem family of antimicrobials may be used in patients showing
neurological complications and secondary infections. Kielstein says
that "in vitro tests show that this antibiotic is effective against
this _E. coli_ strain and that the bacteria do not produce more Shiga
toxin in response to it."

The DGI statement also states that targeted reduction of intestinal
bacteria with the antibiotic rifaximin is recommended in exceptional
cases of EHEC persistence.

The NYT article also quoted Timothy Jones, the state epidemiologist
in Tennessee, who said: "Having a strain that is virulent is not
unusual." There are indeed multiple strains of _E. coli_ that cause
infection in humans. But the number of cases of the life-threatening
complication hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) that have arisen from
this outbreak is a dramatically higher proportion than usual.

[Although the carbapenem family of antimicrobial agents (including
ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem) are often still active against
multidrug resistant Gram negative bacilli, they are penicillin-like
drugs that disrupt cell wall production and may well allow more toxin
to be released, not have more toxin produced. Rifaximin is a
non-absorbable rifamycin antimicrobial agent that is used for
traveler's diarrhea, and any role in EHEC disease is speculative.
Hopefully, the use of these agents is being monitored closely for
positive and negative effects. The humanized monoclonal antibody
eculizumab (directed against a complement component) is also being
studied. Since HUS generally resolves, it may be difficult to define
its role. - Mod.LL]
