4th H5N1 bird flu outbreak reported
-----------------------------------
The highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza has now also been
found at a duck farm in the Yeongwon-myeon area of Jeongeup, North
Jeolla Province. This is the 4th case of the H5N1 strain of bird flu
that can infect humans in the same province since [3 Apr 2008].

New cases have been reported almost daily since [7 Apr 2008]. A new
outbreak has been reported in a South Jeolla provincial area, a long
way from the existing quarantined zone.

The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on
Wednesday [9 Apr 2008] said it confirmed the H5N1 strain at a duck
farm in Huji-ri, Yeongwon-myeon, Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province. "We
judged this case to be of a highly pathogenic strain and put the farm
under quarantine, considering that it is located within a 10 km (6.2
mi) radius of all the outbreaks."

The ministry said it has also received a report of suspected bird flu
at a chicken farm in Shinbuk-myeon, Yeongam, South Jeolla Province.
The ministry added it is aware of the possibility that bird flu is
spreading. The ministry is currently checking 10 farms with suspected
bird flu that have been reported so far.
