Toronto [Ontario province] Public Health says it has seen more cases of legionnaires' disease than it would expect at this point in the summer and it is advising physicians to be on the lookout for additional cases.

Dr Rita Shahin, one of the city's associate medical officers of health, said on Tuesday [23 Jul 2013] that officials have become aware of 16 cases in a 6 week period. That's well above the 3 or 4 cases that officials would usually expect to see. "We normally begin to see a spike in legionnaires' disease starting in August and we wanted to let physicians -- particularly emergency room doctors -- know about this increase and to be aware, so that they test people appropriately that are coming in with pneumonia," Shahin told CBC News in an interview.

The Toronto Public Health website says that individuals become infected by breathing in air that is contaminated with droplets containing a bacteria known as _Legionella pneumophila_. People who fall ill from the bacteria will display symptoms similar to pneumonia. Those could include fever, chills, a cough, as well as muscle and headaches.

In the current spike of cases that Toronto officials are observing this summer, there is no common link between them. Dr Michael Gardam says that there is no consensus yet on why there is an increasing number of legionnaires' cases in North America. "There's a lot of theories going around that perhaps this is related to [the fact that] we've had wetter summers, we've had global climate change and that certainly bacteria do take advantage of things like that and we may be seeing changes," Gardam told CBC News on Tuesday [23 Jul 2013].

In 2005, an outbreak of legionnaires' disease at a Toronto nursing home led to the deaths of more than 20 people.

Toronto [Ontario province] has had 5 times as many cases of legionnaires' disease in the past 6 weeks as it did last year [2012], according to public health officials. From the beginning of June [2013] to [19 Jul 2013], there were 16 reported cases of the disease in the city. "We've investigated (our cases) and we haven't found any common link. They're not clustered in one area of the city or have been linked to a common exposure. So it's really hard to say why the increase is occurring," said Dr Rita Shahin, one of the city's associate medical officers of health.

There is typically an increase in cases of the disease in August, but this year [2013] it has occurred earlier than usual. Officials are baffled about why exactly it moved up and what the future holds. "What we don't know is, has the increase just moved up in time this summer or are we going to see more cases in August?" said Shahin. "It's really hard to say what's going to happen."

Numbers for the disease province-wide are higher than the 5-year average, according to Dr Doug Sider, medical director of communicable disease prevention and control at Public Health Ontario. Between [1 Jun 2013] and [16 Jul 2013] there were 43 confirmed cases of legionnaires' [disease] across the province.

"There are so many factors that can lead to exposure to legionella bacteria that we need to understand, actively investigate and try to piece together and learn from the cases that are occurring," said Sider. Dr Michael Gardam, an infectious disease expert with University Health Network, says rates of legionnaires' disease have steadily increased in North America and Europe for the past decade. "It's one of those things that we measure that we notice is increasing, and it's not like other diseases where it's confined to one geographic area or confined to risky behaviour that you can say, 'Well, if you stop doing that, you won't get it,'" said Gardam. He noted one possible factor for the rise is increased awareness and testing for the disease in those who present with pneumonia-like symptoms.

The disease typically affects older people and those with compromised immune systems. Symptoms include high fever, chills, a cough and muscle pain, according to Toronto Public Health. It is treatable with antibiotics but can be fatal in people with pre-existing health problems, especially the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. The bacterium that causes it, _Legionella pneumophila_, thrives in stagnant water, according to Shahin.

"I've seen some speculation that (the increase in Toronto) may have had to do with the delayed onset of the hot weather and water stagnating in air conditioning units and water towers," said Shahin. Legionnaires' doesn't spread person-to-person, she said, but is acquired through bacteria that can grow in hot tubs, cooling towers or air conditioning units. "It is a fairly common bacteria, but really, if people have air conditioning units or humidifiers or dehumidifiers it's really not letting water pool there for long periods of time," said Shahin.

Last year [2012], 180 people were infected in a legionnaires' [disease] outbreak in Quebec -- 13 people died. In 2005, 23 seniors died at a Toronto nursing home after an outbreak of legionnaires' disease.

[Legionnaires' disease is rarely confirmed with laboratory testing because most cases of community-acquired pneumonia are treated empirically without identifying the causative pathogen. In addition, when legionnaires' disease is suspected, the legionella urinary antigen assay is often used to confirm the diagnosis. Because the urine antigen detects only _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, legionnaires' disease due to _Legionella_ species other than _L. pneumophila_ or non-serogroup 1 _L. pneumophila_ species will be missed. Therefore, analyzing only reported cases of legionnaires' disease will severely underestimate the burden of this disease.

An increase in cases of legionnaires' disease has also been noted in the US (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6228md.htm?s_cid=mm6228md_w#fig1). The increase is occurring mainly in Mid-Atlantic states (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania; 37 per cent increase), East North Central states (Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio; 43 per cent increase), South Atlantic states (Florida, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia; 17 per cent increase), and Pacific states (California and Washington; 33 per cent increase) (Table 2, http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6228md.htm?s_cid=mm6228md_w#tab2). The reason(s) for this increase in the incidence of legionellosis this year [2013] is unknown.
