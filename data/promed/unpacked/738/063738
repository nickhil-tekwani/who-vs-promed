South Korea probes new suspected bird flu cases
-----------------------------------------------
South Korea said on Tuesday [15 Apr 2008] it was investigating 4 new
suspected cases of bird flu, including one near Seoul, adding to a
string of recent outbreaks and raising concerns the disease may be
spreading across the country. In less than 2 weeks, South Korea has
confirmed 11 cases of the deadly H5N1 strain, but all have been
contained to the southwest of the country -- North and South Jeolla
provinces, some 320 km [200 miles] south of Seoul.

"We have received 4 fresh reports of suspected bird flu cases on
Monday [14 Apr 2008] and one is from a poultry farm in Pyongtaek city
in Kyonggi province," the Farm Ministry said in a statement.

The ministry said later in the day that the farm in Pyongtaek, around
60 km [37 miles] south of Seoul, was tested positive for H5 and more
detailed results would be available on Thursday [17 Apr 2008]. It
said more than 2000 birds at the farm would be slaughtered on Tuesday
and it had stopped the shipment of birds within a 10-km [6.2-mile]
radius of the affected site.

South Korea, which has culled nearly 2 million poultry this month,
said it would continue quarantine work in suspected areas and
encourage poultry consumption amid rising consumer concern. Duck and
chicken prices have dropped 10 percent this month, while chicken
sales at 4 major retailers surveyed by the ministry showed a 20
percent decline.

South Korea had 7 outbreaks of H5N1 between November 2006 and March
2007 and spent 58 billion won (USD 59.22 million) on quarantine
measures.

Loophole in Bird Flu Quarantine
-------------------------------
Amid a series of reports regarding suspected outbreaks of the H5N1
bird flu, the government confirmed that ducks infected with the virus
had been illegally taken out from the quarantine zone. The Ministry
for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on Monday [14
Apr 2008] that it is thoroughly investigating a possible outbreak of
the bird flu at a chicken breeding farm in Iksan, North Jeolla
Province, and a duck breeding farm in Hampyeong, South Jeolla
Province. Both cases were reported on Sunday [13 Apr 2008].

In regards to the chicken farm, doubts have risen over quarantine
management as the farm in Iksan was visited by a retail dealer who
had been in contact with bird flu-infected ducks. According to the
ministry and the Gimje Police Station, the 37-year-old dealer
identified only by his surname Park had sold the H5N1 positive ducks
to a restaurant in Geumsan-myeon, Gimje, on Saturday from a farm
located in Yongji-myeon, Gimje, which was included in the alert zone
after a suspected outbreak had been reported there.

Park bought 600 ducks from the farm between 4 and 6 Apr 2008, and
sold some 40 of them to a duck seller, identified only by his surname
Kim, who then sold them to a restaurant attached to the farm in
Gimje. The farm in question was located within the alert zone, about
1.7 km [1 mile] away from another farm where the highly pathogenic
H5N1 strain of bird flu was detected for the 1st time. Movements of
poultry have been under strict control in the area.

The probe found that Park sold 360 ducks among the remaining 560 to
some 20 restaurants in 6 cities and districts including Jeonju,
Gimje, Buan and Jeongeup, and buried the remainders. After meeting
Park, Kim visited restaurants and chicken breeding farms several
times. Among those places, the restaurant in Geumsan and the chicken
farm in Iksan have each reported suspected outbreaks of bird flu.

A total of 32 cases of suspected outbreaks of bird flu have been
either reported or found as of Monday, and 15 of them had been
confirmed so far.

[If the figures cited at the end of the above newswire -- namely 32
suspected outbreaks of which 15 already confirmed -- are correct, the
South Koreans have indeed a complex situation on their hands.

For South Korea's 3rd follow-up report on the epizootic, dated 15 Apr
2008, which includes a map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6963>.
The epidemiological commentary says:

"Out of the 11 outbreaks observed up to date in the country, 5 were
confirmed as HPAI H5N1 subtype and 6 as HPAI H5 subtype. Disease
control measures including stamping-out have been implemented.
Furthermore, viral RNA specific for HPAI H5 subtype was detected in 9
farms during the surveillance conducted in the surveillance zone (a
10-km-radius area around each infected farm). Following the HPAI
outbreaks, all chickens and ducks in the infected farms and in the
farms in a 3-km-radius area around them were stamped out as a
precautionary measure.

"Additionally, all ducks in farms in a 3 to 10-km-radius zone around
the infected farms were stamped out. Movement restrictions on poultry
were applied in the surveillance zone. In order to investigate
whether HPAI spread out into another zone or not, the surveillance
will be enhanced all over the country. All parent stock duck farms
will be tested for HPAI and trucks which proved to stop by the
infected farm have been traced as one of the disease control
measures".

titled "Quarantine efforts," can be seen at
<http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=040000&biid=2008041636178>;
the subtext says: Despite the government's all-out effort, the highly
virulent avian influenza outbreak has continued to spread. Yesterday
[15 Apr 2008], government officials in quarantine suits went to a
farmhouse to cull and bury chickens in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province
after discovering that a chicken infected with bird flu had died". -
