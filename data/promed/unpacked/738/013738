2-fold increase in the number of rabies cases in animals, Stavropol
region, Russia
---------------------------------------------------
46 cases of rabies among animals have been observed in the Stavropol
region. This number represents a 2-fold increase compared to 2003's
figures.
According to the Zoonotic Diseas
es Department in the Epidemiological Surveillance Center, the epidemiological
situation has deteriorated because of the migration of wild animals from
neighboring Chechnya. Cases of rabies are observed not only among dogs, cats
& foxes but also among horses, pigs & sheep. [In an endemic region, domestic
livestock may be preventively vaccinated. - Mod.AS]
During March 2004 alone, 50 people have been exposed to infected animals. [It
would be useful to obtain details on the species of animals to which those
people have been exposed.- Mod.AS]. According to an employee of the
Stavropol Information Agency, "Everybody who was exposed got vaccine and the
required treatment".
