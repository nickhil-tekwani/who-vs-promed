If you've bought chocolate cakes from the bakery chain Prima Deli,
you should throw them away. The advice comes from the Ministry of
Health (MOH) and the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA). The
agencies say these cakes are likely to contain bacteria called
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis, which has caused some
people to get food poisoning.

So far, 106 people have reported getting food poisoning after eating
the cakes; 6 had to be hospitalized, but have since been discharged.
They tested positive for _S._ Enteritidis. The onset of illness for
the last case was on 26 Nov 2007. The effects are felt usually 6 to
72 hours after eating contaminated food.

The MOH was first notified of a food poisoning incident on 23 Nov
2007. As more cases of food poisoning were reported, investigations
showed that the common food item in the various incidents were Prima
Deli chocolate cakes bought as early as 19 Nov 2007. The MOH and AVA
conducted joint inspections of Prima Food Pte Ltd, which produces
chocolate cakes for all Prima Deli retail outlets. Food and
environmental samples were taken for laboratory analysis.

Preliminary results suggest _Salmonella_ is the likely culprit. Prima
Food has been told to stop the production of all chocolate cakes and
to recall all these cakes from distribution and sale. Meanwhile, food
handlers are being screened and investigations are being conducted to
determine the source of the contamination.

[Baked goods themselves (which usually contain eggs, a common source
of _Salmonella_ sp.) are not classical vehicles for the transmission
of salmonellosis because, by definition, they are baked. Pastries
that are not cooked, however, are more common as reservoirs.

The source of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis contamination here may well be
icing, which can be made with eggs or, alternatively, from a bakery
employee who inadvertently contaminated the icing or the cakes
themselves after they had cooled.
