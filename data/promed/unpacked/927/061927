Aid workers in Haiti are expressing concerns that they won't have
enough resources if the latest surge in cholera worsens. After weeks
of heavy rains, the number of cases spiked to 1700 a day by the middle
of June 2011. While the number has eased somewhat, the Health Ministry
says clinics still are getting about 1000 new cases daily.

The epidemic began in rural parts of the country last fall [2010].
It's thought likely that U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal brought the
disease in. It swept through the countryside of an already
impoverished Haiti that had been overwhelmed by a January 2010
earthquake that left hundreds of thousands homeless.

The Health Ministry says cholera has sickened at least 370 000 people
and killed more than 5500.

[The initial outbreak of cholera in Haiti was a reflection of
introduction of the organism into a fertile environment, that is, one
without a semblance of a sanitary system. Now, the number of cases is
increasing, reflecting the rainy season atop the absent sanitary
system. - Mod.LL]

A total of 71 people had died from cholera-related diseases since
last November 2010, including 9 deaths last week, the Health Ministry
said on Fri 8 Jul 2011.

The number of suspected cholera cases had risen to 10 760 after 1014
new cases were registered alone in the last week. With the arrival of
the rainy season, the ministry has tightened measures to prevent the
spread of cholera and other diseases.

The 1st cholera cases in the Dominican Republic were detected in
November 2010, a month after an outbreak started in neighboring
Haiti.
