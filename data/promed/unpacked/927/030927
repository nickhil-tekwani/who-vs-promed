All Clear on Funger Hall Rabid Bat Alert
-------------------------------------------
The [George Washington] University has completed its investigation of
the discovery of a brown bat found unconscious on the 5th floor of
Funger Hall (2201 G Street, NW) in the early morning of Mon 27 Aug
2007. The bat was safely removed by University Police and placed in
the possession of D.C. Animal Control.
The University learned late Thursday night, 30 Aug 2007, that the bat
subsequently tested positive for rabies. The University has no
knowledge of any human contact with the bat and is not aware of any
other bats in the building.
University and Medical Center officials swept Funger and Duques Halls
and turned up no evidence of any other bats in the building. The
University also enlisted the service of an outside pest control firm
to search both buildings. Upon completion of that inspection,
Saturday morning, 1 Sep 2007, the contractor reported no evidence of
bats in the buildings and believes the bat found in Funger Hall was a
random occurrence from a bat that accidentally entered the building,
possibly through an open window.
As always, all persons are advised to avoid contact with any wild
animals, including raccoons, foxes, and bats. If one is seen, please
call the University Police Department at 202-994-6111 on the Foggy
Bottom Campus and at 202-242-6111 on the Mount Vernon Campus.
The D.C. Department of Health (DOH) indicates an increased presence
of bats in homes this summer. Read the D.C. DOH press release.

Rabies case confirmed in Comfort, TX
------------------------------------------
A raccoon killed by a dog in Comfort has tested positive for rabies,
according to Kendall County officials.
On Monday [27 Aug 2007, Kendall authorities were called to a
residence on Valley View Trail in Comfort after a woman saw her dog
fighting with a raccoon. The raccoon's remains were taken to
Metropolitan Health District Laboratories in San Antonio, where it
tested positive for rabies. The woman's dog was current on its rabies
immunizations, but received a booster shot and is under quarantine for 45 days.
This is the 5th documented case of rabies in Kendall County this
year. In Kerr County, there have been 3 documented cases. The first
Kerr case was in May [2007] when a Mexican free-tail bat was found
dead on the ground at Schreiner University by an 11-year-old and his
mother. Kerr County animal control director Janie Roman said there
have been 2 other rabies cases since then: a skunk in Center Point
and a cat in far west Kerr County.
Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of the infected animal
either by a bite or through an open wound. Rabies is a viral disease
that almost always is fatal to unvaccinated animals. Animals
suspected of rabies are quarantined, and upon showing signs of
rabies, the animals are tested.
Inside the city of Kerrville, pet owners are required to have their
animals vaccinated annually for rabies. Outside the city,
vaccinations are required every 3 years.

Rabid bats found in Illinois
---------------------------------
The state has confirmed bat rabies in record numbers this summer.
Through 29 Aug 2007, 79 Illinois bats have tested positive for
rabies, including 21 from Cook County [Chicago area]. McHenry, Lake,
Cook, Will and Kane counties have accounted for nearly 60 percent of
the state totals.
A New Lenox bat has been confirmed as Will County's 6th case of
wildlife rabies for 2007. The animal was found by a worker at a New
Lenox office facility late Monday [27 Aug 2007], and Will County
Animal Control shipped it for testing early Tuesday [28 Aug 2007]. A
rabies confirmation was received Tuesday evening.
Investigations conducted by the Will County Health Department and
Animal Control confirm that no human exposures resulted from the
Monday incident. However, animal control conducted door-to-door
public information activities Wednesday in an effort to minimize the
potential for additional exposures, and enhance community awareness.
The New Lenox Police Department also participated in the Wednesday canvass.
Bats found in Plainfield, Joliet, Naperville, Bolingbrook and Beecher
have also tested positive for rabies this year [2007]. All 6
confirmations have occurred since 2 Aug 2007.
"More local confirmations are certainly a possibility," said Will
County Animal Control Administrator Lee Schild. "We're certainly
hoping we can minimize the likelihood of human exposures that would
require post-exposure rabies shots. We know that July, August and
September are the busy months for bat rabies confirmations. It's
vital that people understand the risks associated with coming in
contact with bats or other wildlife."
Rabies is a fatal viral disease which can be transmitted to humans
through the bite of an infected, warm-blooded animal. Bats have
accounted for more than 96 percent of all Illinois animal rabies
cases reported since 1996.
"Our message is simple," Schild said. "It's critical that people
report any contact with bats to Will County Animal Control at (815)
462-5633) as quickly as possible. Children should be made aware of
the risk and taught not to come in contact with wild animals, or
unfamiliar domestic animals or that matter. And, pet dogs and cats
need to be vaccinated against rabies."

North County [California] residents exposed to rabid bats
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The recent exposure of 3 people to rabid bats has prompted county
health authorities to warn North County residents not to touch them
dead or alive. The 3 (1 near Poway and 2 others in Escondido), came
in contact with bats that later tested positive for rabies, the
county Health and Human Services Agency reported. All 3 have begun
receiving vaccinations for the potentially fatal disease.
According to Gundula Dunne, veterinary medical officer for the county
veterinarian's office, 8 bats have tested positive for rabies this
year [2007], but typically 5 to 15 test positive annually. In the
wild, less than 1 percent of bats test positive for rabies, she
added. Though the 3 most recent cases have all occurred in North
County, bats test positive for rabies throughout the region, Dunne
said. "Throughout the county they have bats, even in surprisingly
urban areas," she said.
Symptoms of the virus in humans include fever, sleepiness, agitation
and excessive salivation, authorities said. It can take anywhere from
several weeks to more than a year for people to develop symptoms,
said Michele Ginsberg, chief of the Community Epidemiology Branch of
the county's Health and Human Services Agency. It may also be
difficult to detect when someone has been bitten, Ginsberg said. "A
person may not be conscious that they've been bitten by a bat," she
said. "Their teeth are so tiny and the bite so minor in appearance
that it can't be detected."
Cindy Myers of the Bat Rescue of Southern California said too often
people are not careful when they are around bats. "Because bats are
so tiny, people don't show the same caution" as they do with other
wild animals, said Myers, who was one of the 3 aforementioned people
recently exposed to rabid bats.
Myers said there is an increase in bats seen now because the majority
are born in July, so there are a lot of juveniles "bumbling around
... like putting a teen on the freeway." San Diego County is home to
half the nation's species of bats, she added. Bats that come in
contact with people must be tested for rabies, she said. Her
organization rescues bats that have not [come in contact with people].
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is
difficult to tell if bats have rabies because the disease can only be
confirmed through lab tests. However, the agency reported, bats are
more likely to be rabid if they are active during the day, or in a
place where they are not regularly seen -- such as indoors or on a
lawn -- or unable to fly.
Anyone who is bitten by a bat or whose eyes, nose, mouth or wounds
come in contact with infectious material such as the animal's saliva
should wash the area and seek medical advice, the agency said. People
cannot become infected by rabies by touching bat feces, blood, urine
or by touching the animal's fur.
Owners should vaccinate pets against rabies, and pets should be
re-vaccinated within 48 hours if bitten.
Dunne, of the county veterinarian's office, advised residents to
respect bats in their natural habitat, adding that many of them are
protected or endangered. It's important, she said, "not to be overly
concerned about bats, but to be concerned with contacting them. The
best thing, like with any wild animal, is ... not to interfere with
them," she said. "If there's no contact, there's no risk."

<http://geology.com/state-map/maps/california-county-map.gif> In
California, North San Diego County (locally referred to as North
County) refers to the northern portion of San Diego County.
In of these articles, rabies seems to be a disease that people do not
think much about, yet it is a fatal disease transmitted by the saliva
of infected animals, including bats, dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and
any mammal. Domestic pets, including horses and cattle should be
vaccinated against the disease. Some states require a 3-year vaccine,
some states require a 1-year vaccine. Ask your veterinarian which
vaccine is required and how often it is recommended to re-vaccinate
your pet or livestock. A vaccination is very cheap insurance against
a fatal disease for you, your family and your pets or animals. - Mod.TG]
