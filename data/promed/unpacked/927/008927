Cholera in Uganda, Update
--------------------------------
A total of 43 911 cases and 1777 deaths (CFR 4.0%) has been reported in
Uganda since the beginning of the epidemic in late 1997.
[This compares with 38 697 cases and 1576 deaths at last report above
- Mod.JW
In some areas the situation is mainly stable or a downward trend is
occurring. No cases have been reported in Central Region for over a
month. The districts of Arua and Moyo in the Northern Region, Kamuli
in the Eastern Region and Bushenyi in the Western Region are still
reporting high numbers of cases whereas other districts in these
regions are reporting either less than 10 cases per week or no cases
at all.
Although some areas of the Western Region (Hoima, Kasese, Kibaale and
Masinidi Districts) and Busia District in the Eastern Region have not
reported for some time, the last information received indicated that
there had been a downward trend in the number of cases.
CDPC Note: With the many reports of cholera in ProMED-mail and the
few from WHO, it is hard to keep up with current outbreaks. We need a
better "score-card" for cholera outbreaks - if anybody really cares!
>From the personal prevention perpective, it is almost irrelevant if
cholera has been officially or unofficially reported. Travelers to
these areas should always take care regarding their food and drink
even if no cholera outbreak was occurring!
