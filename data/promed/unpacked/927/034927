Venezuelan epidemic becomes national emergency
----------------------------------------------
CARACAS: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called for urgent action to
fight an epidemic of dengue fever carried by mosquitoes that has killed 3
people this year and made more than 24 000 sick. Displaying a jar filled
with water and wriggling mosquito larvae, Chavez urged health workers and
the public to get rid of pools and reservoirs of stagnant water where the
white-legged dengue-carrying _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito breeds.
The disease, which causes fever, headache, and muscle pains, and can be
fatal, has [spread to 18 of the oil-rich South American country's 23
states, including the capital Caracas and its sprawling hilltop shanty
towns. Health Ministry officials said the 24 000 people with dengue fever
reported so far this year had already well surpassed the total of 21 101
cases reported for the whole of 2000.
The combination of recent rains and homes with no running water, which
oblige homeowners to store water, have multiplied the potential breeding
areas for mosquitoes. To worsen matters, many homes have no screens over
windows to keep the bugs out. Chavez said a national fumigation campaign to
eliminate dengue-carrying mosquitoes was also under way and he announced
the setting up of a free telephone hotline for the public to report dengue
cases and learn about prevention measures. State governors and city mayors
were due to meet on Thursday to discuss strategies for fighting the epidemic.
