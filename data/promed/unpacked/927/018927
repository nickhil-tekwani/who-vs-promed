This is in response to your reporting of Dr. Zelicoff's announcement of a
previously unreported 1971 outbreak of smallpox in the USSR during the
Institute of Medicine's Smallpox expert forum in Washington D.C. at the
National Academy of Science on Saturday 15 Jun 2002.
I was at the forum and heard the discussion that followed his report. The
key point that Dr.Zelicoff was making about the significance of this
incident, as it relates to the current threat, was that the disease pattern
suggested that the Russians might have genetically engineered a smallpox
virus that would resist our current vaccinia virus vaccine. He based this
on the fact that the 2 children under 1 year and the adult who died had the
severe hemorrhagic form of the disease, and that 7 others who got sick
contracted the disease despite having been vaccinated.
My interpretation of the facts reported by Dr. Zelicoff is that the severe
hemorrhagic form of the disease that was reported and documented by autopsy
reports in the 3 that died, occurred in victims who had not been previously
vaccinated. The pattern of disease reported was also consistent with
reports over the past century of epidemics occurring in a population with
waning immunity.
Although Dr. Margolis has stated the CDC's confidence that immunity against
smallpox lasts for many decades, many other reports, including a USPHS
report from 1935, suggest that full immunity may only last 3 years.(1) CDC
based its confidence on a 1990 study performed on Israeli recruits that
suggested immunity lasts up to 30 years, based on the presence of
neutralizing antibodies.(2) Nevertheless, to date, the correlation of the
presence of neutralizing antibodies and immunity remains unclear.(3)
Over the past 200 years, since Jenner introduced vaccination with cowpox,
and subsequently over the past 100 years with vaccinia virus vaccine,
complete immunity has been defined as the ability to prevent pox formation
at the site of revaccination. If we rely on this definition, then there is
a plethora of information both in our own USPHS data and the medical
literature that shows that immunity (the ability to prevent infection)
wanes over a period of 3 years. Even the Israeli study showed a significant
drop in neutralizing antibodies at 3 years. If mortality is used as an
endpoint, then the vaccinia vaccine remains significantly effective for at
least 10 years.
In our recently published study (4), we demonstrated that fewer than 10
percent of 320 previously immunized biomedical researchers and laboratory
technicians who had received vaccinia vaccine from 1994 to 2001 were able
to prevent pox formation (i.e., "immune" reaction) on re-challenge with the
vaccinia virus during re-vaccination. Overall, of the total of 621
vaccinees who received the vaccine during this period, only 6.4 percent
were immune based on the standard USPHS/WHO local skin reaction criteria
for immunity.
If you apply our study finding to the general population, the pattern of
disease seen in the Russian 1971 incident was no different than what would
be expected in a normal outbreak in a population with waning immunity.
Furthermore, the hemorrhagic cases by themselves do not imply a radically
more virulent or resistant smallpox virus, since they have been reported in
other outbreaks and well described in the pediatric literature. The fact
that the Russians worked with smallpox as a potential bioweapon has been
previously well documented. The fact that it occurred down-wind of
"Resurrection" island in the Aral Sea suggests another "accident" similar
to the anthrax release that occurred 8 years later at their Biopreparat
facility in Sverdlovsk.
Consequently, I agree with Dr. D. A. Henderson that Dr. Zelicoff's report
does not change, or add to, the variables that we are addressing in our
public health strategy against this unlikely but potentially devastating
bioterrorist threat.

Smallpox Vaccine Decision Ahead
---------------------------------
The question carries critical weight in the new age of bioterrorism: Who
should have access to vaccine against deadly smallpox?
The killer has not infected a human in more than 2 decades, and the federal
government's current policy is to vaccinate only the handful of lab workers
and scientists who work with the virus in high-security laboratories.
However, September 11 and the anthrax attacks heightened fears that
terrorists could somehow get their hands on smallpox and release it,
potentially killing thousands of people.
This week, a panel of 15 health experts meets to debate whether to expand
the vaccinations -- and then decide who would be included. The Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices, which sets vaccine policy, is expected
to make a decision Thursday. The panel's recommendation will go to Health
and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson.
In rare cases, the vaccine itself causes devastating side effects --
including brain damage and even death. If every American were vaccinated,
hundreds of people could die from side effects. [Original estimates on the
expected number of deaths following vaccination were done in an era with a
significantly smaller immunocompromised population than today. In today's
era with many immunocompromised hosts (primary immunocompromise and
acquired immunocompromise either through disease such as HIV infection or
through iatrogenically induced immunocompromise during chemotherapy)
leading normal lifestyles the potential number of serious complications and
deaths would most likely greatly exceed prior estimates. - Mods.
MPP/JW] "I would not give that vaccine to my children now," said Dr. Paul
Offit, a member of the panel and chief of infectious diseases at Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia.
The United States ended routine smallpox vaccinations in 1972, and current
U.S. policy calls instead for "ring vaccination" if a smallpox case is
confirmed. The victim would be isolated, and disease detectives would track
down and vaccinate people who had been in contact with the patient. The
advisory committee could decide to recommend changing that part of the
plan, expanding vaccinations to the entire community near an outbreak or to
the entire nation.
But the main question before the panel this week is what precautionary
steps to take, and that question is a riddle, because no one knows for sure
the exact risk of a bioterror attack. "We're dealing with a disease that's
been eradicated," said panelist Dr. Natalie Smith, immunization chief for
the California state health department. "It makes it hard for us to weigh
the benefits of a vaccine."
A Gallup poll released this month found 77 percent of Americans believe
everyone in the nation should have a smallpox shot. But health officials
fear the public doesn't fully understand the risks of the vaccine. "The
vast majority of people immunized would only suffer a sore arm," said the
panel's chairman, Dr. John Modlin of Dartmouth Medical School. "But
everyone would put themselves at risk of extraordinary but real serious
adverse events."
Whatever the panel decides, by early 2003 the government expects to
stockpile enough doses of smallpox vaccine to protect every U.S. citizen in
the event of a biological attack.
