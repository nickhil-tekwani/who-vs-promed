An outbreak of cholera brought to Haiti by UN soldiers after the 2010 earthquake has spread to Mexico, where 180 people have been sickened since September 2013, the WHO said Wednesday, 13 Nov 2013. At least one person is dead in the outbreak, the 1st local transmission of the waterborne bacterial disease since 2001. The strain circulating now is nearly identical to the bacterium that has killed more than 8000 Haitians since October 2010, officials said. It is different than the strain that circulated for a decade after 1991.

Nepalese UN soldiers were determined to be the source of the original outbreak, which spread through Haiti and the Dominican Republic and then to Cuba, where 700 people have been sickened. Before the summer of 2012, Cuba had not seen a case of cholera for a century.

Mexican health officials are bolstering drinking water treatment and sanitation efforts and launching awareness campaigns about safe food and water.

American water sources are generally regarded as safe from cholera because they're chlorinated. The WHO is not recommending any travel or trade restrictions in Mexico, but CDC has issued advice for visitors. Travelers to Mexico should make sure to drink bottled water with unbroken seals and canned or carbonated drinks. They should be leery of piped water sources, drinks sold in cups or bags, and ice. All water used for brushing teeth or drinking should be boiled or treated with chlorine tablets.

[As from the onset, most of the cholera cases reported in Mexico are from Hildalgo state. It remains uncertain what the circumstances are behind the infection's introduction into Mexico. - Mod.LL
