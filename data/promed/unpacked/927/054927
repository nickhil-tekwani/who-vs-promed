PROMED-MAIL: NEWS, INFORMATION, AND THE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS THAT MAKE YOU THINK

Dear Colleagues,

I have found that along with the news, context, and background information found in each individual ProMED post, there is much to be learned also from the aggregate data available from a service that has been thriving for almost 20 years.

Since January 2000, ProMED has reported an average of 5 outbreaks of Pertussis each year. The highest number of reports came in 2002 with 16 posts from England, Russia, and the US. In several of those years, there was only one case; in 2001 there were none. Yet, in only the 1st 5 months this year [2012], there have already been 20 posts from Australia, Canada, the US, Argentina, and Chile. Something is clearly going on.

What's causing this spike? Waning immunity after vaccination? Low vaccine compliance among adults? Changes in detection? Changes in the pathogen itself allowing it to evade vaccine immunity? Or is it declining use of antibiotics by health care providers wary of overuse and drug resistance? Is it an unintended consequence of parents who refuse to vaccinate their children? ProMED not only helps you unpack the news, it raises difficult questions like these. If information like this makes you think, makes you better at your job, improves your practice, provokes discussion among your students, please help us make this possible. Please donate to ProMED-mail today at http://www.isid.org/donate/netathon2012S.shtml.

ProMED's contribution to our field goes beyond reporting on outbreaks. Working with partners at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and HealthMap.org, we have been applying the same principles of surveillance that power ProMED-mail to monitor and analyze the early emergence of vaccine rumors. Supported by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Vaccine Confidence Project aims to improve the reach and effective delivery of vaccines by preventing wide scale program disruptions and breakdowns in public trust in vaccines. Your gift makes it possible for ProMED to engage in cutting-edge projects linking information technology and infectious diseases.

Delving deep into the ProMED archives, scientists, epidemiologists, public health officials, and the just plain curious can find a wealth of valuable information about the etiology of infectious disease outbreaks including the details that make each event unique. To make this information more readily available, and faster and easier to access, ProMED-mail is now offering the 2011 database of ProMED-mail postings on a memory stick for access on your local system. Your purchase of the archives will support the maintenance of operations, including our regional networks and activities in underserved areas, and the expansion of ProMED services. This new program presents an excellent opportunity for state-funded departments of health and research and academic institutions that are restricted from making charitable contributions to non-profits to support ProMED-mail while acquiring a valuable information resource for their libraries and labs. You can order the archives at http://www.isid.org/donate/PMM_archives.shtml.

Whether you represent an institution or a corporation, or are donating on your own, ProMED-mail uses your support to provide accurate, relevant, and timely emerging infectious disease reporting multiple times each day. Covering the entire One Health spectrum of human, animal, and crop plant diseases, ProMED-mail brings you news and unique expert interpretation and context that informs you about the disease and helps you understand how it might affect you, your family, your patients, your business, and your plans. No other source keeps you so well informed on topics you need and want to know about. No other source covers the topic of infectious diseases so broadly, deeply, and internationally. No other source provides it free of charge.

Except, of course, it is not free. We provide access to it for free, but the level and quality of service ProMED provides you is expensive. ProMED has been widely recognized for the transparency and scope of its reporting, the depth of its commentary. Now is the time for you to recognize the important role you play as a reader and supporter. Please help keep ProMED-mail unfettered, uncensored, and free; please donate right now at http://www.isid.org/donate/netathon2012S.shtml.

Sincerely,
