Mosquito Alert: Meningoencephalitis Returns to Bucharest
--------------------------------------------------------
BUCHAREST: As of 27 Jul 2001, 2 cases of meningoencephalitis have been
detected in Bucharest. This disease is caused by West Nile virus, which is
transmitted by mosquitoes, declared Verginia Marin Semen, head of the
Bucharest Public Health Department, on Thursday (26 Jul 2001), in a
statement for the Mediafax News Agency.
People are advised to be cautious, to protect themselves against
mosquitoes, to use window-nets, and to kill insects indoors. People are
[encouraged to wear long sleeves and long pants when outdoors after
sunset. Exposed parts of the body (face and hands) should be treated with
insect repellents. The Department of Public Health will notify the Mayor on
the occurrence of cases of West Nile virus-type meningoencephalitis, and
will request that insect control measures are undertaken urgently.

[A major epidemic of West Nile virus neurologic manifestations
occurred in Bucharest and southeastern Romania in 1996. In total 393
patients with serologically confirmed or probable West Nile virus
infection were identified, of whom 352 had acute central nervous
system infections, and 17 patients older than 50 years died. Fatality/case
ratio and disease incidence increased with age.
The outbreak was confined to 14 districts in the lower Danube valley
and Bucharest (attack rate 12.4/100 000 people) with a seroprevalence
of 4.1%. West Nile virus was recovered from _Culex pipiens_
mosquitoes, the most likely vector, and antibodies to West Nile virus
were found in 41% of domestic fowl. In subsequent years, neurologic
infections were diagnosed serologically as West Nile virus encephalitis
in a small number of patients in 19 southeastern districts and in
Bucharest.
Sentinel chickens placed in Bucharest seroconverted to West Nile virus
during the summer months. The continued occurrence of sporadic
West Nile virus infections in southeastern Romania in consecutive
years after the 1996 epidemic is consistent with local enzootic
transmission of the virus. - Mod.CP
