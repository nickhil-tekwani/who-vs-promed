The World Health Organisation (WHO), the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and Afghan health authorities on Sunday [16 Sep 2007]
announced a joint 3-day anti-polio campaign in the southern and some
eastern areas of the country. The programme was due to begin on 19
Sep 2007 and would be linked to Peace Day in Afghanistan on 21 Sep
2007, the 3 parties said in a statement.
"Peace days are very important to ensure all children receive polio
vaccine on the days of the campaign. Many districts in the southern
region have been missed during the polio campaigns this year [2007]
due to insecurity, attacks and other violence," the statement said.
Five children have been paralyzed by polio, a preventable disease, in
the south of the country in recent weeks.
The latest campaign will see use of the monovalent P3 polio vaccine
for the 1st time in Afghanistan. The vaccine is more effective
against the polio virus now circulating in the country, according to
the statement.
The WHO and UNICEF also called for understanding that the
immunization drive was aimed at saving Afghan children from a
preventable disease and not pushing any political agenda.

[According to the Polio Eradication website, as of 11 Sep 2007, there
have been 9 cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) infection confirmed in
Afghanistan this year, as compared with 26 cases confirmed during the
same period in 2006. Date of most recent onset of WPV type 1
infection was 16 Jun 2007, while date of most recent onset of WPV
type 3 infection was 1 Aug 2007 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>).
The monthly report from the Polio Eradication initiative for August
2007 on Pakistan and Afghanistan states:
- In 2007, 12 cases have been reported in Pakistan (6 type 1 and 6
type 3) and 9 cases in Afghanistan (4 type 1 and 5 type 3).
- Both countries held synchronized campaigns in August [2007] with
intense focus on reaching children along their shared corridor of
poliovirus transmission. In Pakistan, despite sensitive security
conditions in the tribal areas of North West Frontier Province, the
SIAs [supplemental immunization activities] proceeded with minimal
disruption. In Afghanistan, conflict in the southern region has
severely limited access to children. National polio coordinators,
along with WHO and UNICEF, flew to Helmand Province with the help of
the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to meet local
colleagues and better understand the parameters under which SIAs must
be planned in these circumstances.
- While localized within Helmand and Kandahar Provinces, the
resurgence of type 3 in Afghanistan -- which had its last type 3 case
in October 2006 -- is of particular concern given the difficulty of
reaching children and the dangers faced by polio workers as they
perform their duties. Authorities are planning to hold synchronized
mop-up campaigns in both countries using the recently licensed
monvalent OPV type 3 in late September 2007 around UN Peace Day.
- The focus in both countries is on increasing local engagement and
negotiating access to children with the support of local and
provincial civil and religious leadership. Ongoing social
mobilization work is necessary to ensure that remote, nomadic and
displaced communities fully participate in campaigns. (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/current_monthly_sitrep.asp>.)
The above newswire seems to suggest that there were new cases of
polio confirmed during the past week, and, with the comments that the
SIAs will be conducted using the monovalent OPV type 3, suggests that
they were also WPV type 3 isolates. Clarification would be appreciated.
