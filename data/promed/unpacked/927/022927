At least 40 children [with a] cholera-related disease had been
admitted to Banadir maternal hospital, south of the capital Mogadishu
on Sunday [4 Mar 2007]. Asho Mohammed Abdi, the forewoman of Banadir
medical staff, told Shabelle that 20 to 40 infected children have
been admitted to the hospital.
Abdi said, "37 people, most of them children, with watery diarrhea
were brought to Banadir hospital today, 5 Mar 2007," and called on
the residents in Mogadishu to preserve the sanitation of their environment.
On Sun 4 Mar 2007, 5 children died form watery diarrhea in the Gedo
provincial settlements, in southern Somalia. Ibrahim Isak, a medical
officer in Bardhere, told Shabelle that a large number of children
had been beset by the infection in the past few days, while the
disease is also killing older people. An older woman and 4 children
died from diarrhea on [Sat 3 Mar 2007]; in addition, at least 13
children are admitted to the hospitals in Bardhere every day.

Health conditions in Malakal continue to deteriorate as acute
diarrhea, suspected to be cholera, claims more lives with 81 reported
cases and 11 deaths. Sanitary health interventions and campaigns
around water sources are needed to avoid a widespread epidemic in
Malakal and along the bank of the Nile into Jonglei State.

[This news release, which does not give the time span when these
cases occurred, lists the outbreak under West Darfur. Malakal,
however, is the capital of the Upper Nile state in eastern Sudan as
shown at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Nile>. The Jonglei state
is just south of Upper Nile. - Mod.LL]

About 610 cholera cases, from which 10 resulted in deaths, were
registered from January to 6 Mar 2007 by the Municipal Health
Department of Cazenga, in Luanda.
Speaking to ANGOP this Wed 7 Mar 2007, the local health director,
Zola Messo, said that 15 to 20 patients are hospitalized daily.
The source added that the [presence] of puddles obstructs patient
access to health centers and most of the time they arrive in critical
condition. The director expressed worry with the spreading of the
cholera outbreak in the district, mainly in the wards of Vila da
Mata, Calowenda, and Curtume, areas that are considered critical.
Nine people have been hospitalized in the past 24 hours, however,
without claiming any lives.
