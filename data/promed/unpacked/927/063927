Sri Lanka cholera outbreak under control
----------------------------------------
A cholera outbreak in northern Sri Lanka that has claimed 3 lives is
spreading southward, but officials said on Mon 30 Sep 2002 that the
epidemic was under control.
The war-battered Jaffna peninsula confirmed about 30 cases of the
waterborne disease, and health officials said there was at least 1
diagnosis as far south as the central hill city of Kandy. "There has been a
mass influx of people into Jaffna as tourists, so that might account for 1
or 2 people outside the peninsula being identified with the disease,"
health minister Petikirige Dayaratne told Reuters.
Jaffna was cut off from the rest of Sri Lanka throughout much of nearly 2
decades of ethnic conflict, which pitted separatist Tamil Tigers based in
the north and east against the Sinhalese-majority south. But since the
government and rebels began taking steps toward peace with a truce
agreement signed in February 2001, there has been a steady flow of visitors
from the south to Jaffna, and refugees are beginning to return.
"There's a lot more movement of people around, and people returning from
outside the district," said Kandiah Sanmuganathan, the top local official
in the region, adding that the increased movement was likely to blame for
the spread of the disease. But both officials said the cholera was unlikely
to spread further, adding that the Health Department had begun a public
awareness campaign on safe handling of food and water.
"It's important we contain this because the rainy season will start any
day, and there could be flooding which would make it hard to contain,"
Sanmuganathan said.

Cholera death toll rises to 24
------------------------------
In Masvingo, 3 more people have died of cholera, bringing the death toll to
24, while 458 cases have been reported since the outbreak of the contagious
disease more than a month ago.
Head of the disease prevention and control unit in the Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare Dr Stanley Midzi said the last case was reported 5 days
ago, an indication that the situation was now under control. He, however,
would not confirm reports that a man had died of the disease at Harare
Central Hospital. No comment was available from hospital authorities.
Cholera first broke out in the Chiredzana area, south east of the district
and killed 6 people within 4 days. A week later, the highly infectious
disease quickly spread among members of the Johanne Marange Apostolic Faith
sect in Fuve area who were resisting treatment.
The government and the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society have moved in with
massive water and sanitation projects. The Red Cross has raised more than
US$100 000 to build blair toilets (which are to keep human excrement from
contaminating water supplies) and boreholes in Bikita and Zaka. The project
will see the construction of 15 new boreholes, rehabilitation of 7 existing
ones, and the building of 200 family blair toilets in the most affected wards.
As a short term measure, the Red Cross provided cholera kits with
disinfectants, protective clothing, and chlorine tablets to local clinics.
In an effort to strengthen health education promotion, the Red Cross also
gave 14 bicycles to health promoters and 6 bicycles to local clinics.

An outbreak of cholera in the Kwahu South District of the Eastern Region
has killed 2 people and confined 26 others to hospital beds in a matter of
3 days.
Reports monitored by correspondent George Antwi at Nkawkaw indicated that
from last Friday, 27 Sep to Sun 29 Sep 2002, the Nkawkaw Holy Family
Hospital had received 16 diarrhea cases with the remaining 10 going to the
Atibie Government Hospital and clinics at Obo, Nkwatia, and other towns.
Obo, where the 2 people died, had been experiencing cholera attacks since
year 2000 when supply of pipeborne water was cut following the breakdown of
a booster machine that pumped the water to Obo from Mpraeso.
When the Kwahu South District director of health services, Dr Joseph Kwajo
Larbi Opare, was contacted, he confirmed the report and said that the
result of poor sanitary and unsafe water supply from unprotected hand-dug
wells in their vicinity could be responsible for the outbreak. He
recommended the authorities to task the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL)
to chlorinate all the hand-dug wells in the district, especially Nkawkaw
and Obo. He urged the environmental health officers in the district to
ensure good sanitary conditions in all the affected areas.
Dr Opare advised that the people drink pipe-borne water or boil water from
other sources, to ensure strict personal hygiene with emphasis on hand
washing. They should not expose food to flies and ensure proper disposal of
waste. Food sold to the general public should be kept in a sieve and served
hot.
Meanwhile, a source at the Kwahu South District Assembly has informed
Chronicle that the assembly which was finding it difficult to get a site
for liquid waste disposal has now been able to secure one and has dug a
manhole for the disposal of liquid waste in the district, especially
Nkawkaw. The director of Health Services, however, assured the people that
the situation was under control and that there was enough vaccine and
personnel to contain the situation.
