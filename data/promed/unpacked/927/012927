[It has been 10 days since the last newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection was reported from Saudi Arabia, and 5 days during which time there were no active cases. With the addition of this newly confirmed case today [18 Aug 2016], there have been a total of 1446 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 608 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia since 2012. This newly confirmed case is the 5th case of MERS-CoV infection reported in August 2016 (compared with 12 cases reported during July 2016, and 46 cases reported during June 2016), representing a low level of transmission at this time. While there was one nosocomial acquired case this month, to date there has been no further nosocomial transmission and the other 4 cases reported this month were classified as primary cases. The 5 cases were reported from 5 different locations (Jubail, Hufoof, Madinah, Huraymla and Alkharj).
