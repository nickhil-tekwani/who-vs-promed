Romania has found new suspected bird flu in hens in a village 160 km (100
miles) east of Bucharest and began culling domestic fowl there, officials
said on Wednesday [21 Dec 2005].
The H5 type virus was confirmed last week in 2 villages in the Ialomita
county, 100 km east of the capital, indicating the disease could be
spreading towards Bucharest. Since October 2005, the Balkan country has
found avian flu in 22 villages in and around the Danube delta on the Black
Sea, where the deadly strain of the virus was first discovered some 300 km
from Bucharest.
9 cases have been confirmed as the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, but the
disease has not appeared close to large cities, and officials have said it
was unlikely to break out there.
"Rapid tests on samples taken from hens in the village of Stelnica, on a
Danube river tributary [Lat: 44:25:03N (44.4174), Lon: 27:50:49E
(27.8469)], raised suspicion of the H5 type," Nicolae Stefan, head of the
Animal Health and Diagnosis Institute, told Reuters. He said the village
will be quarantined and all domestic fowl culled as a precaution. He also
said that more samples from hens in the village of Traian 100 km east of
the capital showed signs of the H5 type. About 50 birds have already been
destroyed since Monday [19 Dec 2005] when authorities first suspected the
virus there.

[An official notification on an additional infected village in Romania has
been sent to the OIE by e-mail on 21 Dec 2005; see
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/Romania%20Follow%20up%20report%20No15.pdf>.
This notification refers to 2 different backyard premises, 500 m apart, in
the village of Chichinetu, Lat: 44:49:00N (44.8167) ; Lon: 27:17:00E
(27.2833). see map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=44.8167&lon=27.2833&scale=2000000&icon=x>.
Both premises are situated in a boundary area of the village, in the
vicinity of the lake Chiobaiesti. There are 136 backyard premises in the
village, including a total of 3350 fowl. The distance from the previous
outbreak in Ciocile is 3.5 km.
Veterinary and local authorities decided to apply a partial stamping-out,
culling 329 poultry from 22 backyard premises, since the first cases
appeared (14 Dec 2005). Disinfecting was performed, also the installing of
"sanitary filters" at the entrance to the infected area. Quarantine, zoning
and screening was also performed.
