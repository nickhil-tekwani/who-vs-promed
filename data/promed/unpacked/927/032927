Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) has broken out amoung the
white-tailed deer population of northern and Central Missouri and, if
past outbreaks are any guide, some areas could lose substantial numbers
of the state's premier big-game animal. As of yesterday, Missouri
Department of Conservation officials had recorded reports of hemorrhagic
disease among deer in 12
counties. The disease killed more than 50 captive deer at the Heartland
Wildlife Ranch northwest of New Cambria, said Tom Skinner, conservation
agent for Macon County.
The reported number of dead wild deer is much smaller, Skinner said. The
numbers should begin climbing as archery hunters start staking out spots
for the hunting season that begins Oct. 1, he said. "We'll get our big
reports starting next weekend, as the hunters go looking for sign and
see those dead deer in the woods," Skinner said. Most of his reports of
dead deer have come from farmers who find the animals in fields as they
are harvesting crops or mowing hay. "This thing just started, and being
it is hot and dry I expect to hear more about it soon," he said.
Hunters who are worried they've killed what was an unhealthy deer should
tag the deer and check it, then obtain another tag for free from the
conservation department. [No comment - MHJ]
The last major outbreak of hemorrhagic disease in Missouri killed about
10 000 deer in south-central sections of the state in 1988. This year's
outbreak has been reported in Howard, Randolph, Callaway, Macon,
Chariton, Grundy, Mercer, Daviess, Camden, Miller and Carter counties.
Despite reports from all around the area, no infected deer have been
reported in Boone County.
The disease is caused by an orbivirus transmitted from deer to deer by
midge flies. Major outbreaks in Missouri usually occur when hot, dry
weather causes animals to congregate near water supplies.
Missouri is home to an estimated 850 000 white-tailed deer, and hunters
killed a record 219 000 deer during the 1997 hunting season. If this
year's outbreak becomes as bad as the 1988 round of the disease, the
number of deaths would rival the annual count of deer killed in
collisions with
vehicles. Missouri motorists reported 8110 collisions with deer during
1997, said Bill Heatherly of the conservation agency's wildlife
division.

[In Louisiana we get outbreaks of EHD in deer each June. Interestingly,
the closely related Blue Tongue virus, also spread by midges, does not
cause disease here until mid-September, though cattle will commonly show
a fleeting BT seropositivity in June during the EHD season - Mod.MHJ]
