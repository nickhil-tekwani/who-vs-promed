According to the CDC, tetanus is uncommon in the USA, with an average of 29 reported cases per year from 1996 through 2009. Nearly all cases of tetanus are among people who have never received a tetanus vaccine, or adults who don't stay up to date on their 10-year booster shots.

In Alaska, the Bureau of Epidemiology released a bulletin last week on 2 relatively recent cases of tetanus (2012, 2014), which contains detailed case reports. Regarding the 2014 case, they describe a 77-year-old non-English speaking male living in Southeast Alaska who presented in August 2014 with hand swelling with presumed cellulitis without an obvious wound. The man was a diabetic whose only documented tetanus shot was a single vaccination in 2007. He was treated with the antimicrobial amoxicllin/clavulanate, which appeared to help his hand swelling.

However, 10 days later, he arrived at the hospital with the following symptoms: Difficulty walking, possible altered mental status, fever, sore throat, and altered speech. While hospitalized, the patient subsequently developed dysphagia, rigidity, grimacing, clenched hands, and tremors. He was clinically diagnosed with tetanus 5 days after admission once alternative diagnoses (e.g., metabolic imbalance, subdural hematoma, and stroke) were ruled out. He received Td vaccine and TIG, slowly recovered with supportive care, and was discharged 3 weeks after admission.

Alaska health officials say this and the other case demonstrate the risk of tetanus among persons who are not up to date with vaccinations. They suggest that health providers may not always assess wound patients for tetanus vaccination status and miss an opportunity for tetanus prevention.

Tetanus diagnosis is based entirely upon clinical findings; therefore, clinicians need to keep tetanus in their differential diagnosis in persons presenting with acute onset of muscle spasm. Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never received a tetanus vaccine or adults who are not current with their tetanus booster. Tetanus does not spread from person to person. The bacteria are usually found in soil, dust and manure and enter the body through breaks in the skin, usually cuts or puncture wounds caused by contaminated objects.

[Tetanus is a potentially fatal disease characterized by skeletal muscle rigidity and painful convulsive spasms, which are caused by a potent neurotoxin, tetanospasmin, produced by the vegetative form of _Clostridium tetani_, an anaerobic spore-forming Gram-positive bacillus. _C. tetani_ is a member of the normal intestinal flora of animals, including humans. Tetanus usually occurs following contamination of wounds by soil or animal feces in which the spores of _C. tetani_ can be found.

A newly published article demonstrates that the extracellular matrix proteins called nidogens (or entactins) appear to be the receptor for the tetanus neurotoxin to enter the neuromuscular junction (Bercsenyi K, Schmieg N, Bryson JB, et al: Tetanus toxin entry. Nidogens are therapeutic targets for the prevention of tetanus. Science. 2014;346: 1118-23).

Abstract:
"Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) is among the most poisonous substances on Earth and a major cause of neonatal death in nonvaccinated areas. TeNT targets the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) with high affinity, yet the nature of the TeNT receptor complex remains unknown. Here, we show that the presence of nidogens (also known as entactins) at the NMJ is the main determinant for TeNT binding. Inhibition of the TeNT-nidogen interaction by using small nidogen-derived peptides or genetic ablation of nidogens prevented the binding of TeNT to neurons and protected mice from TeNT-induced spastic paralysis. Our findings demonstrate the direct involvement of an extracellular matrix protein as a receptor for TeNT at the NMJ, paving the way for the development of therapeutics for the prevention of tetanus by targeting this protein-protein interaction."

Tetanus may follow surgical procedures, burns, deep puncture wounds, crush wounds, otitis media, dental infection, animal bites, abortion, and pregnancy. The presence of necrotic tissue and/or foreign bodies increases risk for tetanus because they favor growth of _C. tetani_. Tetanus can also follow injection of contaminated illicit drugs. Neonatal tetanus occurs usually in developing countries in infants with infection of the umbilical stump who are born to a non-immune mother. Infants of actively immunized mothers acquire passive immunity that protects them from neonatal tetanus. Tetanus is not directly transmitted from person to person.

Tetanus occurs in people who are inadequately immunized, i.e., people who have not completed the primary series and received appropriate boosters. Recovery from tetanus is not necessarily associated with immunity, and primary immunization is indicated after recovery from tetanus.

A recently published article (Collins S, White J, Ramsay M, Amirthalingam G: The importance of tetanus risk assessment during wound management? IDCases 2015; 2: 3-5, doi:10.1016/j.idcr.2014.11.003) underscores continued assessment for tetanus risk even in mild wounds.

Abstract:
"Public Health England undertakes surveillance of vaccine preventable diseases including enhanced surveillance of clinically suspected tetanus. In the United Kingdom, tetanus has become increasingly rare due to the success of the national routine immunization program. Consequently, few practitioners have experience of diagnosing and managing patients with clinical tetanus. We report 2 cases of tetanus where comparatively minor wounds proved fatal. These cases highlight the importance of the accurate identification and management of tetanus prone wounds and the fatal consequences from untreated injuries in susceptible individuals. We conclude that appropriate risk assessment for tetanus prophylaxis forms an essential part of wound management."
