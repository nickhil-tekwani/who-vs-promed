NSW [New South Wales state] Health is warning residents and visitors
in southern and western NSW to take extra precautions to protect
themselves against mosquitoes following the detection of the Murray
Valley encephalitis (or MVE) virus in NSW. The MVE virus has been
detected in sentinel chickens located near Leeton, Hay and Moama in
the south of the state, and also in the Macquarie Marshes, located in
the west of the state approximately 100km [60 miles] from the
townships of Brewarrina, Walgett, Nyngan and Coonamble.

Positive MVE findings in chickens are relatively rare in NSW. The
important message is to avoid mosquito bites and be alert to any
symptoms. The current area of risk for MVE extends in regions west of
the Great Dividing Range and is likely to be highest around rivers and
wetlands, especially along the Murray, Darling, and Paroo rivers and
their tributaries and in recently flooded areas in western NSW.

The increased risk of human cases is related to increasing numbers of
mosquitoes that carry the virus and can transmit it to birds and
occasionally people. Mosquito numbers increase with warmer
temperatures and rainfall. MVE activity was seen last summer and
autumn in sentinel chickens and in mosquitoes, and 2 human cases of
MVE infection were detected in NSW. There have been no human MVE cases
reported so far this summer [2011] in NSW and no MVE detections from
mosquito trapping.

[Murray Valley encephalitis has been circulating within the past month
in Western Australia state, and earlier this year (2011) in South
Australia and Victoria states as well as the New Territory (case in a
Canadian traveler). The above report indicates that it is now
circulating actively in New South Wales state, although with no
reported human cases so far. Advice for people to avoid mosquito bites
is prudent, and one hopes will be heeded by the public.
