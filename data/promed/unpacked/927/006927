At least 50 people have contracted a highly-contagious and potentially life-threatening disease spread through rat urine.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease having already claimed the lives of 7 dogs in the last year in inner-Sydney, New South Wales [NSW], but experts said it's now infecting people, Daily Telegraph reported.

University of Sydney professor of veterinary microbiology and infectious diseases Jacqueline Norris said the disease is 'shed out in the urine' and spreads easily from animals to humans.

'We haven't seen this disease in New South Wales in decades so it's a high likelihood there's a common environmental source,' she said.

'You can get direct contact, so directly splashed urine into a mucosal surface like your eye, mouth, or skin. But most frequently it's accessing the same external indirect surface, so out in the environment.'

Symptoms in humans vary, and can range from mild headaches to blood in the urine and skin hemorrhages.

Data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System showed there have been 50 cases of leptospirosis this year [2019] and 144 last year, with most cases originating in Queensland, as the bacteria thrives in warm and humid climates.

A NSW Health spokeswoman said most cases reported are from regional areas 'often in association with floods or mouse plagues'.

'The most effective way to prevent any transmission from infected pets or another source of the infection to humans is for people to wash their hands with soap after touching animals,' she said.

'Keep cuts and scratches covered when there is a chance they could come in contact with animal urine.'

Vets have also issued a grim warning for pet owners in Sydney.

Doctor Nima Rahmani, a vet with Vets on Crown Surry Hills clinic, said the dogs likely became infected after drinking contaminated water in Sydney's inner-city.

Potts Point Veterinary Hospital said 2 cases of leptospirosis were diagnosed in the past month in Surry Hills. 'Both dogs only frequented one park, Ward Park on Devonshire St,' it said in a Facebook post.

'Environmental flooding (such as what has happened in Surry Hills due to extensive ground disturbance due to the Light Rail) can saturate the soil and prevent evaporation of urine and the presence of stagnant or slow-moving water can prolong survival of organisms in surface water.

'Peak incidence in dogs in leptospira infected areas often follows periods of heavy rainfall or flooding.'

One dog that died was the unofficial mascot of a local gym. 'It is with a heavy heart we tell you, unfortunately our unofficial club mascot passed away this week. Her owner would like to pass on his thanks to everyone who sent their wishes of good will whilst she was in intensive care,' they wrote on social media.

'Losing a fur child is like losing a child -- so our heart goes out to his owner in this sad time.'

This article states that vaccination is not always effective. It does depend on which serovars are in the vaccine and which are the cause of the problem. "Prevention of leptospirosis via vaccination is complicated by the fact that _Leptospira interrogans_ has more than 200 subtypes causing illness in animals and people. The available vaccines protect against only a handful of the most common subtypes infecting dogs, which limits their protective value. Nevertheless, the available vaccines are effective and safe when used as directed, and many veterinarians recommend the vaccination for dogs at risk for exposure." (http://www.vetstreet.com/care/leptospirosis-vaccine-for-dogs)

"Leptospirosis is more common in areas with warm climates and high annual rainfall but it can occur anywhere.

"Risk factors for leptospirosis
-------------------------------
Dogs are most commonly affected. Leptospirosis in cats is rare and appears to be mild although very little is known about the disease in this species. Common risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs residing in the United States [and likely anywhere - Mod.TG] include exposure to or drinking from rivers, lakes, or streams; roaming on rural properties (because of exposure to potentially infected wildlife, farm animals, or water sources); exposure to wild animal or farm animal species, even if in the backyard; and contact with rodents or other dogs. [Other exposure risks would be flood waters. Often in flooded areas rodents, which frequently carry leptospirosis, are involved and pets may not have clean sources of water in disaster situations such as floods. - Mod.TG]

"Dogs can become infected and develop leptospirosis if their mucous membranes (or skin with any wound, such as a cut or scrape) come into contact with infected urine, urine-contaminated soil, water, food or bedding; through a bite from an infected animal; by eating infected tissues or carcasses; and rarely, through breeding. It can also be passed through the placenta from the mother dog to the puppies.

"Signs of leptospirosis
----------------------
The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary. Some infected dogs do not show any signs of illness, some have a mild and transient illness and recover spontaneously, while others develop severe illness and death.

Signs of leptospirosis may include fever, shivering, muscle tenderness, reluctance to move, increased thirst, changes in the frequency or amount of urination, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes), or painful inflammation within the eyes. The disease can cause kidney failure with or without liver failure. Dogs may occasionally develop severe lung disease and have difficulty breathing. Leptospirosis can cause bleeding disorders, which can lead to blood-tinged vomit, urine, stool or saliva; nosebleeds; and pinpoint red spots (which may be visible on the gums and other mucous membranes or on light-colored skin). Affected dogs can also develop swollen legs (from fluid accumulation) or accumulate excess fluid in their chest or abdomen.

"Leptospirosis may be suspected based on the exposure history and signs shown by the dog, but many of these signs can also be seen with other diseases. In addition to a physical examination, your veterinarian may recommend a number of other tests such as blood tests, urine tests, radiographs (x-rays), and an ultrasound examination.

"Treatment and prevention
-------------------------
Leptospirosis is generally treated with antibiotics and supportive care. When treated early and aggressively, the chances for recovery are good but there is still a risk of permanent residual kidney or liver damage.

"Currently available vaccines effectively prevent leptospirosis and protect dogs for at least 12 months. Annual vaccination is recommended for at-risk dogs. Reducing your dog's exposure to possible sources of the _Leptospira_ bacteria can reduce its chances of infection.

"Although an infected pet dog presents a low risk of infection for you and your family, there is still some risk. If your dog has been diagnosed with leptospirosis, take the following precautions to protect yourself:
- administer antibiotics as prescribed by your veterinarian;
- avoid contact with your dog's urine;
- if your dog urinates in your home, quickly clean the area with a household disinfectant and wear gloves to avoid skin contact with the urine;
- encourage your dog to urinate away from standing water or areas where people or other animals will have access;
- wash your hands after handling your pet.

"If you are ill or if you have questions about leptospirosis in people, consult your physician. If you are pregnant or immunocompromised (due to medications, cancer treatment, HIV or other conditions), consult your physician for advice."

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide. The disease is transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes usually with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals, such as rats, dogs, or cattle, are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, _Leptospira_ are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal. _Leptospira_ can survive for weeks to months in warm fresh water or soil flooded with fresh water. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall, for example, during the monsoon season (July-October).

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is 200 mg of doxycycline, once a week for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available. The news report states that rapid diagnostic test kits have been provided at district and rural hospitals, but does not specify the type of diagnostic test included in these kits. - Mod.ML]
