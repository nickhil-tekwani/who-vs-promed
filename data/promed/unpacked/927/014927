WHEAT STEM RUST, STRAIN UG99 - AUSTRALIA ex ETHIOPIA: INTERCEPTION

In NSW, a recent consignment of wheat seed from Ethiopia was found to
have fungal spores growing on it. These were identified as teliospore
of _Puccinia graminis_ var _tritici_ stem rust of wheat [and
suspected to be strain Ug99; see below - Mod.DHA]. This [strain of]
stem rust is exotic to Australia and of high quarantine risk. It is
slowly spreading from Africa to the Middle East and is causing great
concern among wheat breeders, as there are currently no genes
available for resistance to its spread. Wheat is an economically
important crop worth AUD 4.2 billion [USD 2.7 billion] annually in
Australia, and this disease has the potential to devastate our
industry. The entire consignment of wheat seed was destroyed with
full agreement from the importers.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 70 percent are reported, but
some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the
most dangerous at present is strain Ug99, which has overcome the
major resistance gene used in our current wheat varieties. It is
estimated that Ug99 could reduce world wheat production by 60 million
tons (for more information on stem rust and Ug99, please see previous
ProMED-mail posts and links listed below).

Ug99 is spreading eastwards from its origin in Uganda and is now
considered to be present in much of East Africa, including Ethiopia.
At this time, Ug99 has apparently not spread beyond the Middle East,
and other strains of stem rust are present in Australia (an outbreak
was reported recently from Western Australia, ProMED-mail post no.
20080905.2769). However, due to its origin, the rust found on the
Ethiopian wheat was considered likely to be Ug99 (AQIS NSW, personal
communication), and, therefore, the seed was destroyed. This
quarantine interception was a narrow escape illustrating the vital
role of quarantine inspections. Any wheat import consignment from a
Ug99 area must be considered of extremely high risk.
