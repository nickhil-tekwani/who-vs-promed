Recent avian influenza outbreaks in Asia; as of 14 Jan 2005
-----------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) occurred among
poultry in 8 countries in Asia (Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Lao,
South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam) during late 2003 and early 2004. At that
time, more than 100 million birds either died from the disease or were culled.
From 30 Dec 2003 to 17 Mar 2004, 12 confirmed human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) were reported in Thailand and 23 in Vietnam, resulting
in a total of 23 deaths. By late Feb 2003, however, the number of new human
H5 cases being reported in Thailand and Vietnam slowed and then stopped.
Within a month, countries in Asia were reporting that the avian influenza
outbreak among poultry had been contained. No conclusive evidence of
sustained human-to-human transmission was found.
Recent developments
-------------------
Beginning in late June 2004, new lethal outbreaks of H5N1 among poultry
were reported by several countries in Asia: Cambodia, China, Indonesia,
Malaysia (first-time reports), Thailand, and Vietnam. There has not been a
resurgence of avian influenza in South Korea and Japan, and the outbreaks
are reported to be controlled in those countries. It is unknown to what
extent H5N1 outbreaks in the other countries may be ongoing. For more
information about outbreaks in poultry, visit the World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE) website.
The new outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Asia were followed by renewed
sporadic reporting of human cases of H5N1 infection in Vietnam and Thailand
beginning in August 2004. Of particular note is one isolated instance of
probable limited human-to-human transmission occurring in Thailand in
September 2004.
As of 14 Jan 2005, there have been 48 human cases of avian influenza A
(H5N1) in Vietnam and Thailand resulting in 35 deaths. For more information
about H5N1 infections in humans, visit the World Health Organization (WHO)
website.
Assessment of current situation
-------------------------------
The avian influenza A (H5N1) epizootic outbreak in Asia is not expected to
diminish significantly in the short term. It is likely that H5N1 infection
among birds has become endemic to the region and that human infections will
continue to occur. So far, no sustained human-to-human transmission of the
H5N1 virus has been identified and no evidence for genetic reassortment
between human and avian influenza virus genes has been found; however, the
epizootic outbreak in Asia poses an important public health threat.
If these H5N1 viruses gain the ability for efficient and sustained
transmission between humans, there is little preexisting natural immunity
to H5N1 in the human population, and an influenza pandemic could result,
with high rates of illness and death. In addition, genetic sequencing of
influenza A (H5N1) virus samples from human cases in Vietnam and Thailand
show resistance to the antiviral medications amantadine and rimantadine, 2
of the medications commonly used for treatment of influenza. This would
leave 2 remaining antiviral medications (oseltamavir and zanamavir) that
should still be effective against currently circulating strains of H5N1.
Efforts to produce a vaccine that would be effective against this strain of
influenza A H5N1 are under way. Vaccine reference virus strains already
have been made and provided to manufacturers to produce pilot lots for
human clinical trials as well as to produce a larger quantity of H5N1
vaccine, but mass production and availability of such a vaccine is some
time off.
Recent research findings give further cause for concern. New research
suggests that H5 viruses are becoming more capable of causing disease
(pathogenic) for mammals than earlier H5 viruses and are becoming more
widespread in birds in the region. One study found that ducks infected with
H5N1 are now shedding more virus for longer periods of time without showing
any symptoms of illness. This has implications for the role of ducks in
transmitting disease to other birds and possibly, to humans as well.
In addition, other findings have documented H5 infection among pigs in
China and H5 infection in felines (experimental infection in house cats in
the Netherlands and isolation of H5N1 viruses from infected tigers and
leopards in Thailand), suggesting that cats could host or transmit the
infection. These finding are particularly worrisome in light of the fact
that reassortment of avian influenza genomes is most likely to occur when
these viruses demonstrate a capacity to infect multiple species, as is now
the case in Asia.
CDC response to outbreaks -- domestic
-------------------------------------
In Feb 2004, CDC issued recommendations for enhanced domestic surveillance
of avian influenza A (H5N1). Following the reports of human deaths in
Vietnam in August, CDC issued a follow-up Health Alert Network (HAN)
message on 12 Aug 2004 reiterating criteria for domestic surveillance,
diagnostic evaluation, and infection control precautions for avian
influenza A (H5N1).
The HAN also detailed laboratory testing procedures for H5N1. CDC
collaborated with Association of Public Health Laboratories on 2 training
workshops for state laboratories on the use of molecular techniques to
identify H5 viruses. Planning for a third training workshop is under way.
CDC is working collaboratively with Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists and others to assist states with pandemic planning efforts.
CDC is working with other agencies such as the Department of Defense and
the Veterans Administration on antiviral stockpile issues.
CDC response to outbreaks -- international
------------------------------------------
CDC worked collaboratively with WHO to conduct investigations of H5N1 in
Vietnam and to provide laboratory diagnostic and training assistance. CDC
has performed laboratory testing of H5N1 viruses from Thailand and Vietnam.
CDC has implemented a USD 5.5 million initiative to improve influenza
surveillance in Asia. CDC has conducted or taken part in 9 training
sessions to enhance local capacities to conduct surveillance for possible
human cases of H5 and to detect influenza A H5 viruses by using laboratory
techniques.
CDC has developed and distributed a reagents kit for the detection of the
currently circulating influenza A H5 viruses. CDC is monitoring the
situation and remains in close contact with WHO and other international
partners. In addition, CDC continues to work collaboratively with WHO and
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on safety testing vaccine seed
candidates and the development of additional vaccine virus seed candidates
for influenza A (H5N1).

control precautions for avian influenza A (H5N1), visit

On 4 Feb 2004, CDC and USDA issued an order for a ban on the import of all
birds (Class: Aves) from affected areas in South East Asia. On 10 Mar 2004
CDC, in coordination with USDA, lifted the embargo of birds and bird
products from Hong Kong. On 28 Sep 2004 the list of countries affected by
the embargo of birds and bird products was expanded to include Malaysia.
Information on influenza A (H5N1): background
---------------------------------------------
Influenza A (H5N1) is a subtype of the type A influenza virus. Wild birds
are the natural hosts of the virus -- hence, the name avian influenza or
bird flu. The virus was first isolated from birds (terns) in South Africa
in 1961. The virus circulates among birds worldwide. It is very contagious
among birds and can be deadly to them, particularly domesticated birds like
chickens.
The virus does not typically infect humans. In 1997, however, the first
instance of direct bird-to-human transmission of influenza A (H5N1) virus
was documented during an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry in Hong
Kong; the virus caused severe respiratory illness in 18 people, 6 of whom
died. Since that time, there have been other instances of H5N1 infection
among humans (see General Information on Avian Influenza). However, H5N1
viruses thus far have not been capable of efficient human-to-human
transmission; health officials continue to monitor the situation closely
for evidence of H5N1 transmission between people.
Infected birds shed virus in saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Avian
influenza viruses spread among susceptible birds when they have contact
with contaminated excretions. It is believed that most cases of H5N1
infection in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry or
contaminated surfaces. <http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/outbreaks/asia.htm>
