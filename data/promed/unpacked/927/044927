----------------------------------------------------------------------
It's not strange to see these cases of encephalitis appearing in
Mumbai. Mumbai, being a hub, has a high number of people from the
affected states of UP and Bihar that work as temporary workers in the
city. The appearance of disease after Diwali [festival of lights], in
the last week of October, when a large number of these migrant workers
visit their homes in the north of the country, should point towards
imported cases than actual transmission in the city. Also, it might
point towards the higher than estimated transmission of the yet
undiagnosed etiological agent in the Northern states of the country.

[ProMED-mail thanks Prabhjot Sing for these interesting comments. It
would be of interest to know the recent travel histories of the
patients involved to know, as Dr Singh suggests, if these are all
imported cases or have been locally acquired. Ronan Kelly of
FluTrackers suggested that Chandipura virus infection should be
considered as a possible etiologic agent in some of these recent
(2011) encephalitis cases in India (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100807.2690). Laboratory tests are needed to confirm or rule out
this possibility.
