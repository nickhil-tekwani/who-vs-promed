Illness in Military Personnel in Afghanistan - the UK situation as of at 3
pm Saturday 18 May 2002
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------
It has been reported by the UK Ministry of Defence that there has been an
outbreak of diarrhoeal, vomiting and febrile illness in a military field
hospital in a war zone in Afghanistan see
<http://www.phls.co.uk/publications/CDR%20Weekly/pages/news.html#afghan>
Some of the cases have been transferred to Europe [& caused secondary
infections there -- see below. - Mod.JW]
Patients infected in Afghanistan
-----------------------
The first patient arrived in a UK hospital on Tue 14 May [2002]. He had been
moderately unwell and had had diarrhoea and vomiting, and reportedly also
meningism. On 17 May, 6 more patients transferred having had symptoms of
vomiting and diarrhoea. All were relatively well on arrival and have
remained so. Another moderately to very unwell patient was transferred to
Germany. No information is available on that case except that his condition
is improving. Another 3 patients are awaiting repatriation to the UK, one of
these is reportedly moderately to severely unwell. Patients have not gone to
other countries.
Infected contacts
--------------
Two or 3 adults who had direct contact with the cases outside Afghanistan
have developed the same symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting: 2 men in the
airvac crew and one female contact in the UK.
Cause
-----
Faeces of 4 patients and one of the contacts have tested positive for
Norwalk like virus (NLV) at the Public Health Laboratory Service Central
Public Health Laboratory (by RT-PCR and/or electron microscopy), [said] Dr
David Brown. Further investigations are being undertaken. So far,
bacteriological investigations have all been negative but are difficult to
interpret in patients who have received antibiotics. However, despite
reasonable speculation in ProMED no shigella was detected.
Control measures
--------------
Normal infection control measures for a viral gastrointestinal outbreak are
being applied for those potentially and actually exposed in the UK staff.
Contacts have been followed up and many are now outside the expected
incubation period for NLV. Surveillance will continue.
Conclusion
--------
The epidemiological and viral results confirm NLV as the major cause of the
gastrointestinal outbreak in UK military personnel in Afghanistan, with some
transfer to the UK.
