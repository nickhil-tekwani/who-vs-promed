Re: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome case in Nebraska
--------------------------------------------------
[ProMED-mail post archived as "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - USA
(Nebraska) 20020702.4650" stated that the death of a man at a Scottsbluff
hospital [in Jun 2002] was Nebraska's first case of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome. Dr Leschinsky has sent the following correction. We appreciate
Dr. Leschinsky's help in putting the record straight. - Mod.CP]
This is actually the second case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome reported
in Nebraska, but the first fatality. The previous case of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome occurred in 1998. I only have some demographic data. The
case-patient was a 40 year old male who lived in Dundy County, which is the
extreme south west corner of the state, bordering Kansas and Colorado.
Testing was done at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
University of New Mexico. I have not been able to find any clinical or
epidemiological data on this case-patient.

[A careful search of ProMED-mail archives shows that we reported the
original case in Nebraska and a further, suspected, case in 1999. The
latter was evidently not confirmed, as only 1 case appears in CDC's June
2000 update. - Mod.JW]
