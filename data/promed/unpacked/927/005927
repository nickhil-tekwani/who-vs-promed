Health authorities said Tuesday [23 Aug 2011] that 2 people have been
confirmed infected with cutaneous anthrax, while [a further] 33 others
were suspected as having the disease in Liaoning Province.

Wang Tianyu, an official with the emergency response office of the
Liaoning Health Bureau, said the 2 patients -- both locals in
Niuzhuang Township, Haicheng City -- were diagnosed after their cell
samples tested positive for the disease by state-level labs. Suspected
anthrax infection cases were first reported in Haicheng on 6 Aug 2011.
All those 35 people either confirmed or suspected to have the disease
have been hospitalized.

"No new suspected anthrax infection cases have been reported for the
past 11 days," said Wang.

He said the patients were suspected to have been infected with the
cutaneous anthrax through skin contact with diseased cattle. So far,
local authorities have slaughtered 551 cattle and seized 2450 beef
products on the market.

No one has died from the disease after the epidemic was discovered in
the province, said Wang.

[It is hard to tell whether new cutaneous cases have been found or
whether we have journalistic drift on the numbers ... I suspect the
latter. That they now report that '551' cattle were slaughtered turns
this event from an embarrassing veterinary event [in that some humans
were infected with this highly preventable disease] to the needless
slaughter of so many livestock. Anthrax is not a contagious disease.
The animals that you see sick or dying following the index case are
essentially all that are or will be affected, unless you allow the
rest of the herd access to the carcasses and any bloody soil -- cows
love licking salt and therefore blood is very attractive and
dangerous.

A key part of post-outbreak control is to treat any animals suspected
of incubating disease with a long acting antibiotic but otherwise to
promptly vaccinate the herd. That a case or cases have occurred is all
the proof one needs that they were effectively unprotected and
unvaccinated. Get them out of the field or meadow where the carcasses
are [awaiting burning or burial] and vaccinate them immediately. As
all anthrax vaccines are 'live' any animal treated with antibiotics
can be vaccinated 7-10 days later. Slaughtering contacts is an
expensive waste of time and encourages owners to never call the vet
again when you have an unexpected death. So it is very expensive both
in the short term and in the long. - Mod.MHJ]
