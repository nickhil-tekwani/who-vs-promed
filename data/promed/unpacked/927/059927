The National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), Vom, said on [Tue 11 Aug 2015] that new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] (bird flu) have been discovered in Abia and Enugu states. Dr Mohammed Ahmed, the executive director of the institute, said that it was the 1st time the flu was found in the 2 eastern states. "The last cases we stamped out in May [2015], after destroying more than 1.4 million birds, affected only 18 states. Now the 2 states have come down with the disease and brought the total to 20 states," he said.

He said that the new cases had been traced to the purchase of birds in Ibadan at the "point of lay" [when they are about ready to start laying] by some poultry farmers in the 2 states. "Unfortunately, the young birds came down with the disease, which means that we have not been enforcing the restriction in movement that is a key step in controlling disease."

While advising farmers to be more proactive, he said that the purchase of birds at the point of lay was "certainly not the best," because farmers would not know how the birds were raised. He said that purchasing of birds at the point of lay was mostly done by "lazy" farmers, adding that the attitude was "very dangerous, deadly, and costly". He therefore advised farmers to always patronize well established farms that have massive hatcheries and were meticulous on biosecurity. "The small poultry farms do not take biosecurity seriously. But the big farms have massive investments and do not play with the safety of their birds."

Ahmed also suggested a division of labor among poultry farmers that would enable some to specialize in feed mills, while others to devote themselves to hatchery, point of lay and point of cage. "When that is done, we shall minimize the current tendency to pounce into all aspects that had consistently proved hazardous." The executive director called for intensive surveillance by stakeholders in states to curtail outbreak of the bird flu. "The only way we can contain the flu totally is by consistent surveillance; we must always pick samples from affected areas and areas not affected," he said.

The NVRI boss said that the national technical committee on bird flu had suggested to the Federal Government, the establishment of an active surveillance unit and was still waiting for response. "Once we receive the response and the go ahead, we shall start the active surveillance and I am sure that we shall then be able to check the spread of the flu." Ahmed said that the institute was also working to protect the nation's birds from Newcastle and gumboro [infectious bursal disease] diseases. "The Newcastle disease affects younger birds, while the gumboro disease affects the older ones but we are working to ensure none affects us," he said.

He cautioned poultry farmers against cluster farms, saying that they would record massive casualties if the disease affects any of the farms. "The cluster farms situation is particularly bad in Plateau and Kano [states] and we have tried to discourage farmers from it because it is dangerous," he said. He also spoke on the payment of compensations to owners of farms, whose birds were destroyed, saying that the exercise was in progress. "The compensation has been spread into batches; batches 1, 2, and 3 have been paid. The others have been verified and payment will resume soon."

The 3 new outbreaks in south west Nigeria were reported to the OIE on 11 Aug 2015, in follow-up report no 10 of this epizootic, which started on 24 Dec 2014. According to the said report, the outbreaks are located in Omi Addio, Iddo, Oyo state (broilers and turkeys, but only broilers were affected), Erikorodu farm estate, Ikorodu, Lagos (layers of over 20 weeks old) and Omi, Iddo, Oyo (broilers). The report, including an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=18357.

Since the start of the south western epizootic of HPAI H5N1 in Nigeria, 28 new outbreaks have been reported to the OIE from this region. Their total statistics, so far, are the following: out of 149 654 susceptible birds, there have been 33 769 disease cases, of which 33 289 died. 43 803 in-contact birds have been destroyed.

During 2015, Nigeria has reported to the OIE 2 separate HPAI H5N1 epizootics within its territory. Both are at present officially regarded as "continuing." The 1st one, mentioned above, is located in south and southwest Nigeria.

The 2nd, and larger epizootic reportedly started on 2 Jan 2015, and has since spread within northern and central Nigeria (Kano, Plateau, and Bauchi states), causing 169 (reported) outbreaks so far. The most recent follow-up report (no 9) addressing this epizootic was submitted on 4 Aug 2015, reporting "no new outbreaks". All reports addressing this epizootic since its start, and a map showing the 169 infected locations as of 7 Jul 2015, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16926.

The disease has been spreading into and within other West African countries since early 2015, and so far has been reported from Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, and Ghana; see interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/oqenf47 (click on the West African cluster and zoom in). - Mod.AS]
