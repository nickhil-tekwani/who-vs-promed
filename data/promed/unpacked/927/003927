According to the China Daily, "the incidence of infectious diseases
increased by 7.7 per cent and the death rate 14.9 per cent this year" (it
is not clear from the report exactly what is meant by "this year"), due to
recent earthquakes, floods, and droughts. The report mentions
hepatitis, typhoid, and dysentery in particular as having increased, as
well as "snail fever" (schistosomiasis). "Food and water-transmitted
intestinal epidemics might happen at any time."
In addition, "the density of flies, mosquitoes and rats has been increasing."
