The current outbreak of swamp fever in Ireland is believed to stem from
plasma illegally imported from Italy
"Swamp fever" continues to claim victims in Ireland, with another 2 cases
confirmed last week, bringing the total to 24. Although the Irish
Department of Agriculture admitted to H&H that Equine Infectious Anaemia
(EIA) or swamp fever is or was spreading via biting insects, it stressed
all cases can still be linked.
"What we do not have at the moment is an isolated case on its own -- that
would be much more concerning," said Tom Myers, a superintendent veterinary
inspector for the department. "I believe all the cases are linked to known
sources -- a couple might appear to be out of the loop but they are all
linked."
About 1100 horses have been quarantined. Work is ongoing to establish the
source of outbreak but it is believed to stem from plasma illegally
imported from Italy. Mr Myers said exactly how many foals may have been
treated with the plasma is unconfirmed.
Swamp fever was not known in Ireland before this summer, but Mr Myers said
at least 2 horses died from an "unknown condition" before a mare died at
Troytown Veterinary Hospital in Co Kildare on 14 Jun 2006, and the disease
was identified. Since then, 20 cases have been linked to Troytown or other
studs which may have used the Italian plasma. Four more cases, one a
non-Thoroughbred confirmed last week, are not part of the surveillance
programme, indicating that the plasma may have been used more widely.
"There has been evidence of transmission through biting insects. But it is
only thought to have been the cause of infection where horses have been
kept in close proximity, where one had been exposed to infection via
another route," said a spokesman for the department of agriculture. "Threat
of transmission this way is decreasing as the weather gets colder."
Troytown was reopened in August 2006 after sterilisation. The hospital's
partner Hugh Dillon said: "There has been and is no reason for panic, but
there is no reason for complacency either. There have been record sales at
Goffs, with many buyers from UK."
The World Organisation for Animal Health last week confirmed an outbreak of
swamp fever in Germany -- the 1st in 4 years -- where 10 horses have died
and another 34 have been identified with the disease or at high risk of
infection. The cases, and the strain of swamp fever introduced in Ireland
from the Italian plasma, are reportedly traceable to Eastern Europe. [The
report to OIE from Germany had not identified a source. See posting
referenced below. - Mod.MHJ]
"People must remember that swamp fever is endemic in Eastern Europe and
with the movement of horses in Europe, they have to be extremely vigilant,"
said Mr Dillon.
The estimated cost of the outbreak in Ireland is still unknown. The
government is paying for testing for restricted animals, plus a
contribution to vets call-out fees. All horses entering any sale in Ireland
must produce a negative Coggins test [the definitive test for the disease].
No cases of swamp fever have been found in mainland UK to date. While all
racehorses from Ireland must produce a negative Coggins test to run in the
UK, a DEFRA spokesman said there were no plans to introduce routine Coggins
testing for all horses coming from Ireland to the UK.

[There seems to be a consistent pattern these days: between, on the one
hand, major jumps of diseases from country to country or sudden appearances
in countries with a long and reliable history of not having that disease
and -- on the other hand -- the background movement of vaccines, alive and
dead, or other contaminated products such as this equine serum from Italy,
which in this instance originated in "Eastern Europe."
This is only exacerbated when some afflicted countries -- not the Northern
Ireland authorities who have patently done an outstanding job -- seem to
pull back from a vigorous epidemiological investigation. And this applies
to countries where these products originate.
These are investigations which cannot be done by one country alone. The
problem is global. If we do not work together on this, it will be just a
matter of time before these contaminated products get us all. While I have
the highest regard for livestock owners, all it takes is one or 2 to do
something stupid, that they think can't do any harm, and soon we are
spending very significant sums to sort it out. - Mod.MHJ]
