TropNet reports two 27-year-old patients who presented with acute muscular sarcocystosis to 2 hospitals in The Netherlands in September and October 2012. They had travelled together in Malaysia from 20 Aug 2012 until 6 Sep 2012, visiting Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, Tioman, Pehentian and Penang.

They both became ill on 4 Sep 2012 with complaints of myalgia of the neck and shoulders, fever, chills and malaise. A 3rd travel companion did not have any complaints. The 1st patient subsequently traveled to Thailand, where she continued to have intermittent fever, headache and myalgia of the neck and reported to The Bangkok Hospital at Koh Samui on 30 Sep 2012. Physical examination showed a temperature of 39.9 C [103.8 F], small bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, no cardiopulmonary abnormalities and no hepatosplenomegaly.

Laboratory examination showed some proteinuria, an eosinophil count of 0.677 x 10e9/l, and elevated creatinine kinase of 659 U/L (reference value 30-135 U/L). She subsequently developed hoarseness, pharyngitis and symmetrical subcutaneous swelling of the face and eyes. Because of persistent myalgia and suspicion of trichinellosis, the patient was treated with albendazol 200 mg bid, and a muscle biopsy was taken. Pathological examination revealed many small irregular foci of neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration with necrosis of muscle cells. Some foci showed clusters of small fusiform basophilic bodies about 0.5-1 micron in width and 2 to 3 microns in length, which are compatible with bradyzoites. There were many round, oval to elongated fusiform shape cysts of bradyzoites noted in the muscle fibres. Many cysts showed no cellular reaction. Some cysts showed foci of neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration at the ill-defined border.

The patient continued albendazol and returned to The Netherlands on 9 Oct 2012. Upon her return, she developed an excruciating headache with frontotemporal localization, nausea and night sweats. She reported to the Leiden University Medical Center in The Netherlands and was admitted for analysis. A cerebral MRI revealed a thrombosis of the left sigmoid sinus, after which she was treated with anticoagulants and corticosteroids.

The 2nd patient returned to the Netherlands on 6 Sep 2012 with persistent fever and myalgia, which slowly subsided in few weeks. Complaints returned in the beginning of October 2012 when she also developed fever, swelling of her face and myalgia. She was admitted to the Bronovo Hospital in The Hague, The Netherlands, and because of the medical history of her friend, she was also treated with albendazol. Her eosinophil count was 1.5 x 10e9/l. She slowly recovered and now still has small intermittent headache.

[The previous cases (see below) had all visited the Tioman Islands and were presumed to have been infected there. It is indeed a puzzle that further cases from other geographical locations have not been reported, and ProMED will be happy to post other reports. - Mod.EP
