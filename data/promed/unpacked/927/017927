SHIGELLOSIS, CHANGING EPIDEMIOLOGY - CANADA: (ONTARIO) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

For 2009 and continuing into 2010, Toronto Public Health has detected
a shift in the epidemiology of reported shigellosis cases. _Shigella
sonnei_, the predominant species of _Shigella_ being reported in the
past (69 percent of cases from 1999-2008) has been replaced by _S.
flexneri_ (56 percent of cases reported from January 2009 to January
2010, inclusive). A more focused analysis of cases reported since
November 2009 shows that this trend continues, as 78 percent of the 27
cases reported since then have been due to infection with _S. flexneri_.

Prior to 2009, _Shigella_ infected individuals most commonly reported
travel and/or foodborne exposures. The majority (93 percent) of cases
reported since November 2009 were male (compared to 56 percent male
cases observed over the previous 10 years) and 67 percent lived in
downtown Toronto, an area which includes Toronto's gay village. The
public health investigation of those cases reported since November
2009 revealed that sexual contact reported by men who have sex with
men (MSM) was the most widely reported risk (44.4 percent of cases
confirmed oral-anal contact as a risk compared to an average of 7
percent reported in the previous 10 years). As the profile of
shigellosis shifts from mostly children and travelers to primarily
affecting MSM in the downtown core, the median age has also increased
from 32 years (1999 to 2008) to 36 years (2009 to January 2010,
inclusive),

Substantial increases in shigellosis-HIV co-infection have also been
noted. The co-infection rate rose from 7.7 percent of shigellosis
cases reported between 2000 and 2007 to 20 percent in 2008 and then
27.5 percent of shigellosis cases reported 2009. The most recent
reports of shigellosis cases indicate a further increase in the HIV
co-infection rate, as 44 percent of those cases reported in Toronto
since November 2009 also had a documented infection with HIV. The
pattern of sexually transmitted shigellosis among MSM, and the high
rate of HIV co-infection has only been described a handful of times
and often attributed to changes in sexual practice among those with
HIV to "lower risk" sexual activities (e.g., oral-anal contact and/or
serosorting of sexual partners).

Toronto Public Health is interested to learn if other geographic areas
are experiencing similar shifts in their shigellosis cases
particularly in the northeast parts of Canada and the USA, as there is
substantial mixing of MSM populations in Toronto, New York City,
Boston and Montreal.

We are also interested in the description of any strategies that local
or regional public health authorities have initiated to address this
shift and/or increase in shigellosis cases. Further investigation of
this shift through case control methodology or social network analysis
to better define the population's risk activities is being considered.
Any information from other organizations which have recently
undertaken similar studies would be appreciated.

[ProMED thanks Effie Gournis for this posting and welcomes discussion
regarding the observations.

Shigellae were described over 100 years ago by the Japanese
microbiologist, Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4
species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_.

Shigella is transmitted from an infected person to another usually by
a fecal-oral route. Shigella are present in the diarrheal stools of
infected persons while they are ill and for a week or 2 afterwards.
Most Shigella infections are the result of the bacterium passing from
stools or soiled fingers of one person to the mouth of another person.
This happens when basic hygiene and handwashing habits are inadequate.
It is particularly likely to occur among toddlers who are not fully
toilet-trained. Family members and playmates of such children are at
high risk of becoming infected. Some sexual practices performed by MSM
will also produce a high risk situation. Part of the reason for the
efficiency of transmission is because a very small inoculum (10 to 200
organisms) is sufficient to cause infection as compared with many
enteric pathogens requiring 5 or 5 logs of organisms to produce
transmission. - Mod.LL]
