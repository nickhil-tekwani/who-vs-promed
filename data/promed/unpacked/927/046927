The dreaded monkey pox virus has continued to spread in Delta state, with the state government on Wed 8 Nov 2017 confirming one case of the virus among the 5 suspected cases that were earlier reported.

Results from the other samples sent to the laboratory in distant Dakar, Senegal are expected, according to the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Nicholas Azinge, who made this known during the debriefing session of officials of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).

NCDC officials have been in the state since 27 Oct [2017] to get firsthand information from communities where there are suspected monkeypox cases in a bid to provide technical assistance on the disease.

Dr. Azinge listed Aniocha South, Ethiope East, Ika North East, Ndokwa East and Sapele local government areas [LGAs] as the localities where the 5 suspected cases were initially detected, adding that the cases are being handled by experts.

He disclosed that a total of 45 contact persons are under follow up by relevant authorities, of which 16 have been completed.

Azinge stated that constant border patrols of the neigbouring council areas of Patani, Bomadi, Ughelli and Burutu to Bayelsa state have been stepped up with the view to stopping suspected cases from further entering into the state unnoticed.

Assuring residents of the state, the commissioner said government was on top of its game, as it has carried out sensitization of disease surveillance officers in the 25 LGAs in collaboration with the World Health Organization.

He urged the general public not to panic but to go to the nearest health facility if they notice any signs/symptoms of the disease.

[The previous report for Delta state indicated that 9 suspected monkeypox cases were hospitalized (see Monkeypox - Africa (13): Nigeria (DE) 20171020.5393564). The above report indicates that there are 5 suspected cases and one confirmed case.

The monkeypox situation in Nigeria generally, and Delta state specifically, remains unclear. Although ProMED-mail posted a report indicating cases in Delta state among 74 suspected cases nationally, no case numbers for the state were given at that time. In the previous report for Delta state, the Delta state Commissioner for Health denied that there were any cases. The one confirmed case indicates that at least one case has occurred in that state. Perhaps the results of tests done on the blood samples taken from the above cases as well as the 74 suspected cases in 11 states will help to clarify the situation by confirming or by ruling out monkeypox in these cases.

As noted in previous posts, the main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
