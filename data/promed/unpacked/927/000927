Martin [fictitious name] has had syphilis 3 times. The first case put him in Dunedin hospital with a brain disease. The disease is caused by _Treponema pallidum_, a corkscrew-shaped bacterium that can be passed on through sex, and spread through the bloodstream. It may cause small ulcers around his genitals or mouth and then copper-coloured sores on hands and feet, but Martin (not his real name) does not recall. There may even have been no symptoms. The first Martin knew something was wrong was when he became increasingly unwell and lethargic - to the point he was hospitalised. To begin with, doctors treating him could not pinpoint the problem. But then, realizing he was HIV-positive, a blood test for syphilis was ordered. By then, the bacteria had crossed the blood-brain barrier. "I had early-stage neurosyphilis,'' Martin, who is in his 40s, says. "But they got it in time. I didn't go insane.'' That was almost a decade ago. Since then he has caught, and been treated for, syphilis a further 2 times. He is not alone.

Health practitioners say New Zealand is experiencing a syphilis pandemic. Last month, it was reported that 400 cases were voluntarily notified by sexual health clinics during 2017 - that's a 500 percent increase in 5 years. In reality, the numbers could be much higher, they say. Similar reports are coming from other developed countries. Last year [2017], the medical journal The Lancet said incidences of the Great Pox - as syphilis was called when it 1st panicked Europe in 1495 - had increased dramatically in North America and Western Europe during the past decade.

It does not seem that syphilis will die off any time soon. If it is not treated, syphilis can be serious, even deadly. That is why Martin gets checked every 6 months. He thinks he has probably had the STI trifecta; gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis. Having had 3 run-ins with syphilis, most recently in the past couple of years, he says it has changed his approach, a little. "I now have a bit more of a dialogue rather than going in blind and hoping no-one has anything,'' Martin says. But the penicillin treatment, although sore, is short, sharp and effective. "You get 2 jabs in the butt. A couple of days later, you get it again and that's it.'' Ironically, that has helped syphilis become a pandemic, he believes. "People are complacent ... They know they can get treated. It is part of the solution and part of the problem. It curbs your behavior a little. But when you're out there to have fun, these are just the things that get in the way sometimes."

[The annual surveillance report on sexually transmitted infections in New Zealand for 2012 said that there were 83 cases of syphilis in 2011 and 80 cases in 2012 (https://surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/annual_sti.php?we_objectID=3567). The latest annual surveillance report on sexually transmitted infections in New Zealand was for 2014 (https://surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/annual_sti.php?we_objectID=4248), and it said: "The number of cases of syphilis reported by SHCs [sexual health clinics] and FPCs [family planning clinics] increased notably between 2013 and 2014 (from 85 to 141 cases). The cases were predominantly male (95.7 percent), MSM, and occurred most commonly in the 20-24 years and 30-34 years age groups. The majority of MSM cases occurred in the NZ European ethnic group (57 percent). Syphilis cases were predominantly reported from clinics in the Auckland region and Canterbury DHB [District Health Board]."

Compared to 80 to 85 cases of syphilis reported annually for 2011-2014, the above news report says that 400 cases were reported by sexual health clinics during 2017, said to be a 500 percent increase in 5 years.

The increasing incidence of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections can be attributed to a change in sexual behavior away from safer sexual practices of the 1980s and '90s during the midst of the AIDS epidemic. As evolving medical therapy has changed HIV infection into a more manageable chronic disease, people have become complacent and stopped using condoms.

Other factors include increased frequency of testing for syphilis, use of geolocating apps on smartphones that facilitate multiple anonymous hook ups for casual sex such as Grindr, Internet chat rooms, pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs", and lack of education about the necessity of safer sexual practices.

We are not told in the news report above the specifics with regard to the increasing numbers of syphilis cases in New Zealand. For example, are the people involved disproportionately still MSM or are they of a particular race or ethnicity? Have they used cell phone apps, such as Grindr, "party drugs", PrEP, etc.? Knowing this type of information may help pinpoint prevention efforts. - Mod.ML
