France reported on Friday [11 Mar 2022] that a total of 662 clusters of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been detected between November 2021 and February 2022, and almost 4.18 million birds have been culled, including 3.44 million birds in southwest France.

The outbreak included 611 clusters in poultry farms, 36 in wildlife and 15 clusters in barnyards, the French Agriculture Ministry said.

The clusters of HPAI have stabilized in southwest France, which is the main poultry production region, but have increased in the northwest of the country, said the ministry, adding that new measures of protection are conducted to decelerate the spread of the virus.

France saw an outbreak between autumn 2020 to spring 2021, during which 492 clusters were detected in poultry farms. The government ordered the cull of some 3.5 million birds, mostly ducks, in its southwest region.

[2] Pre-emptive culling, Vendée

France will drastically step up the culling of chickens, ducks and other poultry to contain a bird flu outbreak worse than last winter's, the agriculture ministry said on Friday [11 Mar 2022].

It is the 4th major flu epidemic for French poultry farms since 2015, mainly in the country's southwest, home to the lucrative yet controversial foie gras liver pate.

By wiping out the populations where the virus is spreading, officials hope to shorten the outbreak and prevent it from reaching other poultry-raising regions.

Over 4 million birds had already been culled this year [2022] before the outbreak spread to western France over the past 2 weeks, especially the Vendée department along the Atlantic coast.

The Vendée is considered "strategic" by the ministry because many farms raise birds exclusively for breeding, so clearing the latest virus from the zone is key "for a recovery of activities once it has been sanitised."

Nearly 190 infected sites have been detected in the department, up from just 74 on Sunday [6 Mar 2022], the ministry said.

"We estimate there are still 3 million animals that must be culled" in the region, the ministry said.

So far, 611 infected sites have been detected overall, surpassing the outbreak of last year [2021], when nearly 500 sites were found requiring the culling of 3.5 million birds.

Quarantine measures have been taken against the virus, and farmers are compensated by the government for losses that can reach millions of euros.

[During the 1st week of March 2022, 59 new outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in commercial poultry in France were reported by OIE. The majority (38) of these 59 outbreaks occurred in commercial duck premises. A further 2 outbreaks have been reported in noncommercial backyard poultry premises; one with 22 geese and one with 3 red junglefowl (_Gallus gallus_). There have also been 2 HPAI H5N1 events reported in wild birds, involving a mute swan (_Cygnus olor_) and a whooper swan (_Cygnus cygnus_).

The said details, and a map (no 3), showing the distribution of HPAI H5 outbreaks in poultry and captive birds, and cases in wild birds, in Europe (including the UK), as reported to OIE between September 2021 and 7 Mar 2022, is available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1060076/hpai-europe-220307.pdf. The map presents flyways of the wild birds.

The continuously updated HPAI data from EU's reference laboratory for avian influenza (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, IZSVe), based upon information from 31 European countries (UK not included), presents a graphic with weekly totals of the HPAI events, as identified in 3 categories (poultry, captive birds, wild birds). The epizootic peaked during the 2nd week of 2022, after which a weekly decrease is apparent.

The said website presents also a table including all HPAI-positive events (poultry, captive and wild birds) reported between 8 Oct 2021 and 11 Mar 2022; see at https://www.izsvenezie.com/documents/reference-laboratories/avian-influenza/europe-updates/HPAI/2021-1/total-events.pdf.

According to the table, a total of 1250 outbreaks were reported in poultry farms as of 10 Mar 2022; the 3 leading countries are France (529 outbreaks), Italy (315), and Hungary (113). The total number of confirmed-infected wild birds, in the said countries, is 2003, led by Germany (1083), Netherlands (377) and Denmark (104). - Mod.AS
