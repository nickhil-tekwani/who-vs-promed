The Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) as of 17 Dec [2021] has received 3 reports of invasive _Haemophilus influenzae_, type b (Hib) infections in 3 unvaccinated children [It is not clear over what period these reports have been received. - Mod.SH]. These children reside in Amish communities in south central and south eastern Pennsylvania. Low rates of vaccination in this population combined with seasonal community events may result in additional cases of Hib.

- Healthcare providers should have a heightened awareness for Hib infections, especially among those who are unvaccinated, and be prepared to promptly recognize and treat the disease.
- Chemoprophylaxis should be initiated within 2 weeks of onset of disease and may be in conjunction with treatment, in consultation with an infectious disease healthcare provider.
- Healthcare providers should report invasive cases of _H. influenzae_ of any type within 24 hours of diagnosis through PA-NEDSS or by calling 1-877-PA-HEALTH (1-877-724-3258) or your local health department.

Epidemiology
-----------
Hib can cause a variety of diseases from mild respiratory infections to more severe illness such as meningitis (inflammation of the coverings of the spinal column and brain), bloodstream infections, pneumonia, arthritis, and infections of other parts of the body. Hib spreads person to person either through exposure to respiratory droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions from infected or colonized individuals.

Prior to the availability of the Hib vaccine, Hib disease was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children under 5 years old in the USA. In 2019, there were an estimated 7130 cases of invasive Hib resulting in 1050 deaths nationwide. Due to widespread Hib vaccination in children, most cases now occur among elderly [people] and unvaccinated children. In Pennsylvania, there are an average of 5 invasive Hib infections in children each year. In the prevaccination era, hearing impairment or other neurological sequelae occur in 15-30% of survivors. Case fatality ratio is 3%-6%, despite appropriate antimicrobials.

Risk factors
------------
Hib disease can occur in any age group. Children who are household or daycare contacts of an individual who is infected or colonized with Hib are at increased risk for infection, with those under 4 years old at greatest risk. Invasive Hib disease is most likely to occur in [the following population]:
- younger than 5 years old and with incomplete Hib immunization
- functional or anatomic asplenia, including sickle cell disease
- HIV infection
- antibody and complement deficiency syndromes
- hematopoietic cell transplant recipient
- chemotherapy or radiation therapy for malignancy

Clinical presentation and diagnosis
-----------------------------------
Infections with Hib range from mild to moderate, noninvasive disease to more severe, invasive disease. The commonest clinical syndromes caused by Hib are meningitis, otitis media, epiglottitis, uvulitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, septic arthritis, and cellulitis.

Diagnostic testing of possible invasive Hib infections is recommended as Hib infections may present similarly to other infectious disease such as influenza or COVID-19. For patients with invasive disease, the diagnosis of Hib infection should be confirmed by PCR-based assays or culture. Ideally, clinical specimens for testing should be collected before starting antimicrobials.

Treatment and prophylaxis
-------------------------
Beta-lactam antimicrobials are the preferred empiric treatment for Hib infections; however, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and tetracyclines typically have activity against _H. influenzae_. Due to rising ampicillin resistance, intravenous 3rd-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, are recommended for invasive Hib infections.

Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis with rifampin may be indicated for all close contacts of an individual with invasive Hib. Close contacts are defined as individuals who live with the individual with invasive Hib infection or spent 4 or more hours with the individual with invasive Hib for at least 5 out of the 7 days prior to the patient's hospitalization. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all households who meet the following criteria, at least one child (index case or household member):
- less than 12 months old who has not completed the primary Hib vaccine series
- less than 4 years old who has not received an age-appropriate number of doses of Hib conjugate vaccine
- less than 18 years old who is immunocompromised

For households that meet these criteria, all close contacts should receive prophylaxis, regardless of age. Chemoprophylaxis may be considered for childcare or school contacts following one case of invasive Hib infection. It is recommended in facilities and schools where unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children attend, and 2 or more cases of invasive Hib have occurred within 60 days. Post exposure chemoprophylaxis of contacts, where indicated, should be initiated as soon as possible and without waiting for serotyping results.

Also, to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage of Hib, chemoprophylaxis is recommended for the individual with invasive Hib infection if they did not receive at least one dose of ceftriaxone or cefotaxime and they meet one of the following criteria:
- younger than 2 years old, or
- resides in household with at least one contact younger than 4 years old who has not received an age-appropriate number of doses of Hib conjugate vaccine

Chemoprophylaxis should be initiated within 2 weeks of onset of disease and may be in conjunction with treatment, in consultation with an infectious diseases healthcare provider.

Prevention
----------
Timely Hib vaccination of young children is important for the prevention of Hib infections. Infants may receive their 1st dose of Hib vaccine as early as 6 weeks old. All children should receive their primary vaccine doses from 2 through 6 months old and a booster dose at 12-15 months old. Guidelines for Hib vaccination, including routine and catch-up vaccine schedules, can be found in the Hib ACIP vaccine recommendations at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hib.html.

[As a medical student rotating through pediatrics at the Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, in the early 1970s prior to the introduction of type b _H. influenzae_ vaccines, a day did not go by without an admission for invasive Hib disease.

_Haemophilus influenzae_ is a small Gram negative coccobacillus with several antigenically distinct capsular polysaccharide subtypes (a-f). There are also unencapsulated, nontypable strains. _H. influenzae_ colonizes the nasopharynx and spreads from person to person by respiratory droplets. _H. influenzae_ type b (Hib) strains are the most pathogenic due to their propensity to cause invasive disease, especially meningitis and bacteremia, although other encapsulated strains also can cause invasive disease. Hib virulence factors include a unique polysaccharide capsule (polyribosylribitol phosphate or PRP), as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the biological activity of which, although chemically different from the LPS of the Enterobacteriaceae, appears to be similar to that of other Gram negative LPS.

The prevalence of Hib invasive disease (for example, meningitis, bacteremia, metastatic foci of infection) peaks in infants aged 6 months to 3 years, which corresponds to the period when blood has been found to lack bactericidal antibody against Hib, whereas the blood of neonates (with transplacentally acquired antibody), older children, and adults is bactericidal for Hib. This activity is due to antibody against the type b capsular polysaccharide.

Hib infections have declined dramatically in the USA since Hib capsular polysaccharide conjugated to protein antigens vaccines became available. Prior to the widespread and routine immunization of children against type b organisms, Hib was the commonest cause of pediatric bacterial meningitis in the United States. In the pre-Hib vaccine era, about 20 000 instances of invasive Hib disease occurred annually. Since use of Hib conjugate vaccines began, the number of cases of invasive Hib disease has decreased by more than 99%.

This decline has been attributed to the conjugate vaccine's effect on preventing nasopharyngeal carriage of Hib, which decreases spread of Hib in the community and thus creates a barrier around unimmunized children because of the effect of herd immunity. With increasing trends related to anti-vaccination movements, more cases may be seen. - Mod.LL
