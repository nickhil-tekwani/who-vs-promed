Measles Virus Nomenclature Update: 2012
-----------------------------------
[Extracts of this document are reproduced to illustrate the considerable genetic diversity of measles viruses and their potential for evolutionary change. Fortunately despite this extensive genetic change, no strains appear to have evolved antigenic change sufficient to escape control by the current attenuated measles virus component of the MMR triple vaccine. - Mod.CP]

introduction
----------
The genetic characterization of circulating wild-type viruses is a critical component of measles laboratory surveillance and molecular epidemiological studies. The combination of molecular analysis and standard case investigation provides a sensitive means to describe the transmission pathways of measles virus and to document the interruption of endemic measles transmission. Absence of endemic genotype(s) is one of the criteria for verifying measles elimination in a country or region. A standardized methodology and nomenclature is used to define measles sequences and genotypes. Two global reporting platforms have been developed to collect and analyse sequence data, the WHO Global Measles and the Measles Nucleotide Surveillance (MeaNS) databases.

The nomenclature used to describe the genetic diversity of wild-type measles viruses was proposed initially by WHO in 1998, and was reviewed and updated in 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2006. This report updates the existing documentation and incorporates the significant increase of data generated by the WHO laboratory network (LabNet) in the last decade. In addition, this report clarifies the standard naming convention for measles virus, and introduces 2 databases that enable reporting, storage, and analysis of genotype information. Functional considerations relating to the mechanism of genotype classification and intra-genotype variation/stratification are also discussed. [See:David A. Featherstone, et al. Expansion of the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network 2005–09. Journal of Infectious Diseases, 2011, 204 (suppl 1):S491–S498.]

The following are examples to illustrate the current nomenclature:

MVi/ London.GBR/3.12/2[D4]
MVs/NewYork.USA/17.11[G3] (SSPE)

WHO measles database
-------------------
The global database for measles genotypes was developed by WHO LabNet in 2006 to collate information generated from enhanced measles virus surveillance activities following the development of the WHO/UNI CEF Global Immunization Vision and Strategy 2006–2015.5, 6 The database collects information on the location and date of the case, with genotype and WHO virus name recorded. Sequence data are not recorded in this database. However, accession numbers to the GenBank7 (National Institutes of Health, United States) collection of all publicly available DNA sequences are listed if available. Contact details of the submitting laboratories are provided in the event that further information is needed.

As of January 2012, data on 11319 genotype reports have been submitted from 135 WHO member states with the earliest viruses dating from 1954.

MeaNS database
--------------
The MeaNS9 database was started in 2008 as a joint project of the Health Protection Agency, London (United Kingdom) and WHO. The database collects sequence information, submitted by contributors or downloaded from GenBank, from either the complete protein coding sequence of the H gene, the complete protein coding sequence of the N gene, or the sequence of the 450 nucleotides coding for the carboxyl-terminal 150 amino acids of the nucleoprotein (N-450). Sequence data can be uploaded to GenBank via a specially created interface (optional, but strongly encouraged), and all submitted sequence names and genotypes are submitted weekly to the WHO measles genotype database. Additional information, including epidemiological information on the case, is also collected if available. There must be sufficient information provided to create a “WHO name” if one has not already been provided. All individual sequences can be assigned for Public or Private viewing. If the latter is chosen, the sequence information is only available to the administrators and measles LabNet focal points in WHO.

Currently (January 2012) there are 8150 sequences entered in the database from 7727 different samples. Of these, 7691 sequences are from N-450, and 581 are full H gene. Of the samples submitted, 43% are D4, which reflects the recent outbreaks in multiple countries of the world due to this genotype.

Measles genotypes
----------------
The most variable region of the measles virus genome is the standard N-450 and sequence from this region is the minimum required for assigning measles genotypes. Analysis of the nucleotide variation between strains defined 8 measles virus clades (A–H) and 24 subclades referred to as genotypes with the operational taxonomic unit being the genotype (Table 1).

[Table 1 is the crux of the document and should be refried when interpreting epidemiological and surveillance information. It can be accessed via the source URL above].

However, not all recognised genotypes are still in circulation, with 6 genotypes have not having been reported this century despite improved surveillance (B1, C1, D1, E, F and G1) and may be considered “inactive”. A further 5 genotypes have not been detected since 2006 (D2, D3, D10, G2 and H2), suggesting that they may be inactive, with the caveat that surveillance gaps still exist. Virtually all the recently identified cases of genotype A are from patients with recent vaccination, with the last putative wild-type A genotype virus reported for 2 sporadic cases in 2008.

The updated naming convention now requires all vaccine strains detected in recent vaccinees to be identified by the addition of VAC to the strain name. Laboratories are encouraged to use well validated wild-type strains or synthetic RNA as positive controls in place of vaccine strains to minimize the potential for contamination.

Updating of genotype reference strains
-------------------------------------------------
The list of measles genotypes recognized by WHO and the reference strains for each genotype are shown in Table 1. The table has been revised from previous reports to include one new genotype, D11. Genotype D11 viruses were detected during an outbreak in Yunnan province in China close to the border with Myanmar. The 24 reference strains are often divergent from the contemporary sequences in each genotype. However, these sequences still provide adequate representation of the genotype lineages and no other changes are required.

Genotype Diversity
-----------------------
Evolutionary analysis of the 7691 N-450 sequences within MeaNS showed that the genotype structure defined in 2001 was replicated by phylogenetic lineages using this much larger dataset; however, the level of sequence diversity within and between genotypes highlighted that the 2.5% diversity thresholds proposed in 2001 are no longer applicable.

Naming of sequence variants for tracking purposes
-------------------------------------------
Since sub-genotyping of measles virus is not methodo logically viable [see original text for explanation. - Mod.CP], direct comparison of sequence data will be needed to recognise transmission pathways that are within a single genotype and have spread widely over time and geographically. The recent outbreaks of D4 and B3 genotypes have shown that sequence identity within the N-450 region of the genome provides a use- ful mechanism for tracing the spread of measles virus. The N-450 sequence found in MVs/Enfield.GBR/14.07 was first detected in the United Kingdom in 2007 and identical sequences were found in multiple European countries for the next 4 years. Designating this sequence as a “sequence variant” has enabled the transmission of this strain to be monitored following its introduction into Europe. Viruses with slightly variant N-450 sequences (1–2 nucleotide differences) compared with the “MVs/Enfield.GBR/14.07-variant” have also seeded continuous transmission events throughout Europe and representative sequences from these viruses should be designated as separate sequence variants. Linking strains to defined variants based on N-450 sequence identity provides an accessible and convenient nomenclature that reflects currently circulating viruses while still utilizing the broader genotype designation.

Summary of major recommendations from this report
---------------------------------------------
• The WHO measles genotype database and MeaNS play a critical role in virological surveillance for measles by allowing almost real time tracking of viral strains at the global level.

• Timely submission of genotype and sequence information to the WHO measles and MeaNS databases is now required of all laboratories in Lab-Net. Laboratories should carefully review the criteria for generating a standard WHO name because this information is used to link the global databases.

• New reference sequences apart from D11 are not required at this time and use of the existing reference strains will produce a valid genotype assignment.

• A sub-genotyping system for measles will not be useful. Instead unique sequences that have shown widespread transmission over time will be desig- nated as a sequence variant or matched to an existing sequence variant by MeaNS.

Conclusions
----------
As several WHO Regions move towards measles elimination goals, adequate virological surveillance will become an essential component of the surveillance systems that will be needed to verify that the elimination targets have been reached. Molecular surveillance in many countries, particuarly in the European Region, has shown that the endemic genotype or genotypes can change relatively quickly. Therefore, constant monitoring of cases and outbreaks is necessary and the timely sharing of data is critical.

The laboratory methods to perform genetic analysis of wild-type measles strains are firmly established in LabNet. The challenges for LabNet will be to continue to expand virological surveillance activities especially in those countries where virological surveillance is not adequate. LabNet laboratories are now actively developing quality control and quality assurance protocols for the molecular techniques so that this part of laboratory surveillance will be held to the same high standards that are currently in place for serological testing. It may become necessary to extend the sequencing window for molecular epidemiology of measles virus beyond the recommended N-450 in regions where strains with limited genetic diversity are circulating. The laboratories in LabNet are currently evaluating the utility of sequencing additional regions of the genome and a similar database is in development to enable tracking of rubella sequences.

27 deaths attributed to a measles-like disease in Bumba, Equateur province
----------------------------------------------------------------
Since the outbreak began in December 2011 up to the end of of February 2012, there have been more than 1067 cases and 27 deaths as a consequence of a measles-like infection recorded in the Yambuk health zone in the region of Bumba, Equateur province. The same sources state that the symptoms of the disease that doctors believe to be measles were observed in the health area Yalosemba, 88 kilometers from Yambuku-center. Clinical samples have been sent to two reference laboratories doing the past two weeks for confirmation of the diagnosis of measles.

Dr. Louis Mpia, a WHO representative, declared that that the situation is serious but advised the population to remain calm while waiting for laboratory results. "Vaccination will not be implemented until the disgnsis of measles virus infection has been confirmed. In the meantime appropriate medical treatment will be made available.

Measles epidemic in Russia began in Chechnya
---------------------------------------
The number of Russians who contracted measles is growing every day. Over 500 cases have been recorded in 13 regions of Russia. The FirsT News Agency has reported that the outbreak originated in the Chechen Republic. However, now the epidemic is beginning to decline. Earlier, the World Health Organisation (WHO) predicted that by the spring of 2012 measles would have been disseminated throughout Europe. Already, measles has spread to France, Spain, Italy, Romania, Greece and Germany. In 2011. The the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has reported more than 30 thousand cases of measles. As for Russia, 631 cases of measles have reported so far. In total 411 cases (65.1%) were registered in November and December. 2011. Thus, the incidence of measles, compared with 2010 (127 cases) had increased five-fold.

In January 2012 the spread of measles in the Russian Federation continued. In particular measles case were recorded in the Volgograd, Belgorod and Novosibirsk regions, the Chechnya Republic and the Stavropol Territory. For the first time in seven years, an outbreak of measles was recorded in North Ossetia (there were 45 cases). In St. Petersburg, according to recent data, there have been 152 cases of measles, and around 300 in Moscow.

Measles is an acute viral disease. It is transmitted by airborne droplets and is characterized by fever, lethargy, weakness, headache, rash, mucosal lesions. The disease can be severe, especially in adulthood. There may be neurological complications. The maximum incidence is among children under the one year of age. and slightly less in children aged 1 to 4 years.

Measles outbreak in Liverpool worsens, public health experts say
------------------------------------------------------
The number of measles cases in and around Liverpool is continuing to grow, public health experts have warned. According to the Health Protection Agency (HPA), there are now 36 laboratory confirmed measles cases in and around the area. A further 35 probable cases are under investigation and numerous reports from GPs are in the process of being followed up. The majority of the cases are in Liverpool and neighbouring areas of South Sefton (Aintree and Waterloo), but there are six are in Knowsley, three in St. Helens and one in Widnes. The majority of cases are children under the age of five who were not vaccinated at the optimum age of 13 months and babies and toddlers who are too young to be vaccinated. A small number of adults have also been affected. [see: HPA press release: http://www.hpa.org.uk/ProductsServices/LocalServices/NorthWest/NorthWestPressReleases/nwest120229Liverpoolmeaslesoutbreakupdate/. - Mod.CP]

The advice to parents is to contact their GPs and arrange for any unvaccinated children to be protected by MMR vaccine as soon as possible. Dr. Roberto Vivancos, a consultant with Cheshire and Merseyside HPU, said: "If parents aren't sure if their children have previously been vaccinated, they should check with their family doctor.

"Measles is highly infectious and unvaccinated children will always be at risk when it gets into a community. Furthermore, when unvaccinated older children pick up an infection they present a risk to siblings and other babies and children who are too young to be vaccinated."

The HPA is also advising people with symptoms of measles to stay away from school, nursery or work until at least four days have elapsed since the rash developed. Patients are also advised to telephone their GP practice before attending in order to make arrangements for minimising the measles patient's contact with other vulnerable patients, and to avoid contact with infants and pregnant women who are more vulnerable to the infection.

A measles unit in Liverpool composed of HPA and NHS staff is actively engaged in tracing contacts of measles cases. Where appropriate, contacts are given preventative treatment to limit the spread of infection.

Measles outbreak at North Wales school Ysgol Eifionydd spreads to 30 children
------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 30 children have now been diagnosed with measles in an outbreak linked to a North Wales school. Public health experts said an additional 11 children associated with Ysgol Eifionydd School in Porthmadog had been confirmed with measles in the last couple of days. There are fears the potentially deadly disease could spread further across North Wales amid relatively low take-up levels of the MMR vaccine.

All the 30 children affected so far have either not had any MMR [tripe vaccine] or only received one dose -- two doses are needed to protect against measles, mumps and rubella. Public Health Wales and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board are
continuing to urge families throughout Gwynedd to ensure their children are vaccinated with MMR. Two vaccination catch up sessions were held last week in the Porthmadog area, where 30 children had the triple combined jab. GPs in Gwynedd are also offering MMR vaccinations to local children. Dr Chris Whiteside, a consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said: "Measles is highly contagious and spreads very easily. We predicted that the number of cases would rise but it is sad nonetheless that it has risen so sharply. "As long as there are children who have not had their two MMR vaccinations, there is the potential for more people to become ill with measles.

"There is then a danger for the disease to spread to unvaccinated friends, family or others who cannot be vaccinated due to existing health problems and who are therefore highly vulnerable to measles infection.

"Many of the cases under investigation have not received their scheduled MMR vaccinations. "I therefore urge parents in North Wales who have not arranged immunisation for their children to act immediately to get them vaccinated. "MMR is a safe and effective vaccine that protects children from the most severe viral-rash illness of childhood.

Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral disease, which can cause complications including pneumonia, meningitis and ncephalitis, particularly in children under five, those with weakened immune systems and children with
a poor diet. It can be fatal in rare cases.

New measles case confirmed in Adams County, NE Indiana
-------------------------------------------------
INDIANAPOLIS: Indiana health officials have confirmed a new case of measles [the 17th] in the state, and this time it's in northeastern Indiana and unrelated to an outbreak in the Indianapolis metro area.

Spokeswoman Amy Reel of the Indiana State Department of Health says an unvaccinated resident of Adams County south of Fort Wayne was exposed to measles while traveling overseas. She says that person also may have exposed
other persons to the highly infectious disease during a trip to the emergency room at Bluffton Region Medical Center on the evening of Monday, 20 Feb 2012. Bluffton is in Wells County, also south of Fort Wayne.

In central Indiana, 16 linked cases have been confirmed in Boone and Hamilton Counties.
