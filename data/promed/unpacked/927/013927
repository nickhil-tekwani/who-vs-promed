In Chita [now called, since 2008, Zabaykalsky Krai - CopyEd.MSP], 5
people have contracted trichinosis due to consumption of stray dog
meat. In 2009, 9 cases have been reported in the Chita region, and dog
meat was the cause of infection for all of them.

[In June 2008, 14 inhabitants of Tungokochen village and 12

ProMED reported on an outbreak in 2005 in Buryatiya (Russia), also
caused by the consumption of dog meat (Trichinellosis, dog meat, human
- Russia (Buryatiya) 20050407.1010). Trichinellosis is reported
frequently from Russia, but bear and infected pork are the main
sources of human infections. - Mod.EP]

[Trichinellosis, also called trichinosis, is caused by eating raw or
undercooked meat of animals infected with the larvae of a species of
worm called _Trichinella_. See CDC Fact sheet at:
