On the advice of the professors of virology of Sri Venkateswara University, tests were conducted on patients [with mystery fever in Chittoor district and other parts of Rayalaseema region in Andhra Pradesh state] for leptospirosis. Around 120 cases of leptospirosis were suspected in the district when tests were carried out in Tirupati.

Leptospirosis is another mystery fever, [which is] caused by _Leptospira_. [It] is spread through urine of [chronically infected] rodents. It is prevalent in rat-infested areas and can spread through contaminated food or water. Even pets [and] farm animals can spread the disease; however, person-to-person transmission is rare. [The professor] advises people to have their pets examined, avoid contact with animal urine or body fluids, and not to swim, walk or consume water that may contain animal urine.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals, or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life.

_Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation.

Rayalaseema is a geographic region in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayalaseema). It includes the southern district of Chittoor, which has a population of 4 170 468 according to the 2011 census of India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittoor_district). For a map of Rayalaseema showing the district of Chittoor, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rayalaseema.png. A map of India showing the central location of the state of Andhra Pradesh is accessible at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm. Tirupati is a major pilgrimage and cultural city in the Chittoor district of India. It is the largest city in the Rayalaseema region (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirupati_(city)). - Mod.ML
