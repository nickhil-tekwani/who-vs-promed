- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 isolated in the country was in Magaria district, Zinder province with an onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018].
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in Niger in 2018 is 10. The outbreak is genetically-linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018 through 5 Dec 2018].
- Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Horn of Africa
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- The most recent cVDPV2 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected on [11 Oct 2018] from Waberi district in Banadir province. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was isolated from an environmental sample also from Waberi district, Banadir province collected on [23 Aug 2018].
- Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 was 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
Emergency Operation Centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nation-wide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly-immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week.
- 2 genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates were detected, from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case (with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018], in a 6-year old girl with no history of vaccination, from Molumbo district, Zambézia province), and 1 isolated from a community contact of the case reported on [10 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year old boy with AFP, also from Zambézia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2).

Indonesia
- A new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak has been confirmed in Indonesia.
- 2 genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected, from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and from a sample of a healthy community contact, in Papua province collected on [24 Jan 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

[WPV1 (wild poliovirus) continues to circulate in Pakistan -- the report above confirms a case previously reported (see Poliomyelitis update (12): global (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Niger) 20190208.6306787 and see section [2] below reporting 2 additional cases in Punjab just confirmed). While there were no positive environmental samples reported from Afghanistan, it is too early to declare interruption of transmission of the WPV in Afghanistan.

As for cVDPVs, (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus), a new focus has been identified in Indonesia's Papua province, albeit according to the report above, the cVDPV1 identified in Indonesia is not related to the cVDPV1 identified in Papua New Guinea. As with WPV, it is too soon to declare interruption of transmission of the cVDPVs in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia, Mozambique, DR Congo, and Papua New Guinea.

[2] Pakistan (Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa): 2 new cases, media report
Date: Fri 15 Feb 2019
Source: ARY News [edited]
https://arynews.tv/en/two-more-polio-cases-reported/


ARY News reported on [Thu 14 Feb 2019], 2 new polio cases in the country.

According to prime minister's focal person for polio eradication, Babar Bin Atta, the 1st case was reported in a 4-month-old girl in Hangu [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa], while another case was detected in an 8-month-old boy in Lahore's Shalimar town area [Punjab].

He said a total of 4 cases of polio had been reported in the ongoing year [2019].

Atta said the Punjab government's health minister had been informed about new polio case.

While announcing soon pay a visit to Punjab, he said the teams would investigate the root causes of new cases of the crippling disease. Any official in the anti-polio teams found responsible will face strict action, he added. He vowed to unveil the government strategy on anti-polio.

The surge in the number of polio cases has set the alarm bells ringing as Pakistan is on the verge of eradicating the crippling disease that has paralysed hundreds of children in the country.

Though concerted efforts are being made to interrupt the transmission of the poliovirus, it is still circulating in the environment, pointing to the gaps in the programme.

Earlier, the 1st polio case of the year 2019 had been reported from Bajour district [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa], on [2 Feb 2019], according to Focal Person to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Polio Eradication Babar Atta.

"Sad News: The ongoing active virus circulation in Bajour Tribal District has paralysed yet another child as Pakistan reports its 1st polio case of 2019 from Khar. The child is 11 months old. Bajour has now reported 6 polio cases alone during the last 3 months," he tweeted.

[The media report above mentions there have been 2 newly confirmed cases of wild poliovirus -- 1 in Lahore, Punjab, the other in Hangu, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. In the past few weeks there were reports of positive environmental samples in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, so the identification of active cases is not totally surprising. This will now bring the total number of WPV1 cases reported for 2019 to 5, with 4 of the 5 cases reported from Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]
