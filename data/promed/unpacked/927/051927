Taiwan experienced a higher rate of flu-related deaths and hospitalizations in the flu season after the 2009-10 pandemic than during the pandemic itself, according to a study in PLoS One yesterday [24 Apr 2012, see below].

Using data from 12 labs that make up Taiwan's Influenza Laboratory Surveillance Network, Taiwanese researchers noted that 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu (pH1N1) caused 44 deaths, but in the next season (through the 13th week of 2011), 93 pH1N1 deaths were confirmed, as well as 30 H3N2 fatalities and 128 total flu deaths. In 2010-11, H3N2 dominated until December 2010, when pH1N1 resurged. During 2009-10, 22 (50 per cent) of the 44 pH1N1 deaths were in the 20 to 49 age group, compared with 24 (26 per cent) of the 93 pH1N1 deaths in 2010-11. In comparison, pH1N1 deaths in the 50 to 64 age group rose from 9 (21 per cent) in 2009-10 to 49 (53 per cent) in 2010-11. During 2009-10, 1297 hospitalized flu cases with severe complications were reported, of which 937 (72 per cent) were caused by pH1N1 and 161 (12 per cent) by H3N2. Those numbers rose to 1751, 1040 (59 per cent), and 606 (35 per cent) in 2010-11. The authors conclude that reemergence of pH1N1 in 2010-11 "had an intense activity with age distribution shift."

[The following is the citation and abstract of the paper entitled: Nationwide surveillance of influenza during the pandemic (2009-10) and post-pandemic (2010-11) periods in Taiwan. Chuang J-H, et al. PLoS ONE 7(4): e36120, http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036120#top.

"Introduction: Although WHO declared the world moving into the post-pandemic period on 10 Aug 2010, influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus continued to circulate globally. Its impact was expected to continue during the 2010-11 influenza season. This study describes the nationwide surveillance findings of the pandemic and post-pandemic influenza periods in Taiwan and assesses the impact of influenza A(H1N1) 2009 during the post-pandemic period.

"Methods: The Influenza Laboratory Surveillance Network consisted of 12 contract laboratories for collecting and testing samples with acute respiratory tract infections. Surveillance of emergency room visits and outpatient department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) were conducted using the Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance system and the National Health Insurance program data, respectively. Hospitalized cases with severe complications and deaths were reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System.

"Results: During the 2009-10 influenza season, pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 was the predominant circulating strain and caused 44 deaths. However, the 2010-11 influenza season began with A(H3N2) being the predominant circulating strain, changing to A(H1N1) 2009 in December 2010. Emergency room and outpatient department ILI surveillance displayed similar trends. By 31 Mar 2011, there were 1751 cases of influenza with severe complications; 50.1 per cent reported underlying diseases. Of the reported cases, 128 deaths were associated with influenza. Among these, 93 (72.6 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and 30 (23.4 per cent) A(H3N2). Compared to the pandemic period, during the immediate post-pandemic period, increased numbers of hospitalizations and deaths were observed, and the patients were consistently older.

"Conclusions: Reemergence of influenza A(H1N1) 2009 during the 2010-11 influenza season had an intense activity with age distribution shift. To further mitigate the impact of future influenza epidemics, Taiwan must continue its multifaceted influenza surveillance systems, remain flexible with antiviral use policies, and revise the vaccine policies to include the population most at risk."

These observations emphasize the value of continuous active local surveillance of influenza, which, in this situation, has revealed an unexpected increase in intensity and shift in age distribution in a post-pandemic period.
