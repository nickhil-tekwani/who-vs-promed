Norway has just notified 2 imported non-fatal cases of cholera for the
period 4 Jun - 21 Jul 1998.

[Another case of late reporting by a developed country. While it is highly
unlikely that imported cases will start an epidemic in Norway, which has a
good public water & sanitation system, it is important for the public to
know from which countries the disease is being imported, so that people in
Norway & elsewhere returning from those
countries with diarrheal symptoms can be warned to seek medical attention
to avoid serious health consequences.
Can anyone tell us from which country or countries the cases were imported?
