Outbreak of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 in Kathmandu, Nepal
-------------------------------------------------------
Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital has seen a significant increase in the number of patients with influenza-like illness [ILI] over the past several weeks in Kathmandu. Patients with complaints of high grade fever, cough or sore throat, bodyache, headache, keep coming to this hospital for the confirmation of [influenza A(H1N1)pdm09], locally known as swine flu.

A total of 27 (18 per cent) laboratory-confirmed (that is, by real-time PCR) cases of [influenza A(H1N1)pdm09] have been reported by the National Public Health Laboratory in the past one month (March 2014) alone. It is believed that so far 5 deaths were associated with [influenza A(H1N1)pdm09] during the treatment course. Influenza A subtype H3 and influenza B are other influenza viruses circulating simultaneously in Kathmandu. The number of patients with influenza-like illness is likely to increase in the coming days, because so far, no effective preventive measures have been placed to avoid further spread of the virus. Moreover, no information about [influenza A(H1N1)pdm09] virus is available beyond the capital Kathmandu, so a large number of patients are possibly being misdiagnosed with other infectious diseases due to lack of modern laboratory equipment.

A delay in laboratory confirmed diagnosis (PCR) is another major challenge for the initiation of early antiviral treatment. PCR test reports are usually available in 5 days or longer after specimen receipt in the laboratory, while clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral (oseltamivir) is administered within 48 hours after onset of influenza symptoms or exposure to patients with confirmed influenza virus.

Nepal government should encourage people with fever and cough or sore throat to visit hospital/doctors to prevent potentially serious [influenza A(H1N1)pdm09] complications.

[According to results at this medical center, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is the dominant strain and is causing significant morbidity and mortality in the Kathmandu region. As Dr Sher Bahadur Pun notes, results of testing often arrive too late to institute appropriate antiviral treatment. Thus, US CDC and others recommend empiric antiviral treatment in those presenting with ILI and risk of complications (based on age, pregnancy, or other comorbidities) as early as possible, pending lab testing or even if initial lab testing is negative. ProMED-mail appreciates Dr Sher Bahadur Pun's report. - Mod.LM

Influenza update 208 -- 7 Apr 2014
----------------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, the northern hemisphere influenza season appeared to be approaching interseasonal levels in most countries. The proportion of influenza B detections however increased slightly in many regions, especially Asia, the Middle East, and North America.

- In North America, influenza levels continued to decline and the season was coming to its end. Late season circulation of influenza B continued, however, the overall levels of influenza remained low.
- In Eastern Asia, influenza activity was approaching interseasonal levels, with influenza B emerging as the current predominant virus. This timing aligns with previous seasonal influenza trends in the region. Mongolia continues to experience elevated influenza activity, despite levels beginning to decline.
- In Tropical Asia, influenza activity continued to decline, aligning with global seasonal trends. While in Thailand influenza activity remained elevated, small decreases were seen.
- In Northern Africa and Western Asia, influenza activity remained low despite the increasing proportion of influenza B positive samples.
- In the Caribbean, influenza activity remained low and at interseasonal levels in most countries, however ILI activity and influenza detections increased in Guyana and Guadeloupe.
- In the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity remained low and detections were sporadic.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 3 Apr 2014, 12:35 UTC), during weeks 11 to 12 (9 Mar 2014 to 22 Mar 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 96 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 65 498 specimens. 10 986 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 7407 (67.4 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 3579 (32.6 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 2747 (57 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2072 (43 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 222 (87.1 per cent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 33 (12.9 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[Influenza continues to circulate at low levels in Asia as indicated in the WHO and most influenza globally is still A(H1N1)pdm09.
