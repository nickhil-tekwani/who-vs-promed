NEWCASTLE DISEASE, PHEASANTS - UK (ENGLAND): CORRECTION
*******************************************************
Date: Sun, 17 Jul 2005 13:09:35 +0100
From: "Fred Landeg Off" <fred.landeg@defra.gsi.gov.uk>

While your report of Newcastle Disease in pheasants in England is factually
correct since it is based on our Press release, your subject heading ["ex
France"] is unfortunately very misleading.
The origin of infection of the Pheasants is still under investigation and it
is for example also possible that the pheasants acquired infection from a
wild bird source in England.
We are working very closely with the French authorities to investigate the
origin of infection.
I would therefore be grateful if you could correct the misleading subject
heading or your earlier post.
