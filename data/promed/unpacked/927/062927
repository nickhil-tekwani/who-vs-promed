Strange Cassava Disease Worries Farmers
---------------------------------------
Farmers in Rivers State are worried over the strange death of newly planted cassava crops.

They said most of the crops planted this year [2016] died few weeks after sprouting.

While some link the development to heat from the scorching sun, others believe the death is as a result of a strange disease.

Most of the cassava farmers have started replanting as a result of the disease. A farmer said, "The major implication of the replanting exercise is that one had spent more money to buy the cassava stems to plant. The rampant death of the new cassava plants has resulted in scarcity of cassava stems. It is a big setback."

When contacted, the [local] Farmers Co-operative Association confirmed the development. It has become a new source of concern in the area and [it is] feared that it might lead to late and poor harvest.

[According to the report above, death of cassava crops appears to be fast and occurring within a few weeks of planting. Some of the known fungal or bacterial diseases of the crop may be fast acting, but the description of symptoms is not sufficient to suggest a likely cause. Reliable diagnosis will be crucial for devising management strategies for the farmers.
