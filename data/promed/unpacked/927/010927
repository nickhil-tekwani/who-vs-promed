A Further Comment on the Causation of "Hajj Flu" in Saudi Arabia
----------------------------------------------------------------
The following comment is a response to an enquiry from Dr. James Neville,
MD, MPH of San Antonio, Texas, who wrote the following: "The report of an
outbreak of cases of cough and tonsil inflammation among students in Saudi
Arabia makes me wonder about the role of adenovirus as the etiologic agent.
We have observed that symptoms are primarily fever, sore throat, cough;
symptomatic duration seems to be 3-5 days. Antibiotics are not used, as the
infection is self-limiting. I was wondering if the cases had been tested
for viral pathogens, adenovirus in particular?"
We do not have the precise clinical information about "the strange disease
outbreak among students of a school in the Asyer area [that has alarmed
the citizens of Surat Obeid." We are quite far away from that region. Our
clinic deals with only the Staff and their dependents of National Guard
Hospital. The so called "Hajj Flu" starts as a viral infection and after 3
or 4 days it appears to get worse. Although most of the cases are
self-limiting, quite a considerable number of individuals become ill with
very pustulant tonsillitis or bronchitis or even patchy pneumonia. It could
be due to an initial adenovirus infection. We do not do viral studies as a
routine, because we cannot wait for the results to decide the course of the
management of the illness. We cannot anticipate whether the illness will be
self-limiting or will become complicated with secondary infection.
Therefore those people who do not improve after about 3 or 4 days and who
may develop tonsillitis with chesty cough are treated with an antibiotic.
Factors such as humidity and the constant invisible sand dust in the air in
this part of the world may contribute to the development of secondary
infection. Almost all the buildings here are fully air conditioned 24 hours
a day, and this might be a contributory factor for the rapid spread of the
pathogens, whether they are virus or bacteria. They seem to survive for a
longer period of time in the cooler air.
It is of interest to note that the routine throat swabs taken from the
members of the medical team returning from their Hajj duties this year
showed the presence of meningococci W135 (under 2%). These individuals were
asymptomatic and were already immunized against meningitis A & C. It is
thought that a strong virulent variety of meningococci C, brought by the
pilgrims from distant parts of the world, become mutated into a variant
called W135, which develops in individuals who are already immunized with
vaccine containing A & C only. This has been reflected in the cases of
meningitis in pilgrims returning from Hajj to countries like the UK and
Europe, where the illness was due to this variety W135. Therefore, the
authorities in Saudi Arabia are making it mandatory for visiting pilgrims
to have quadrivalent meningitis vaccine containing W135. In the USA and
Canada only the quadrivalent vaccine is used as a routine for people posted
abroad in tropical countries.
