Death of Young Woman Following Hemorrhagic Fever-like Illness
-------------------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI: Medical centers in Central Province have been placed on high alert
following the death of a woman from a hemorrhagic fever. Doctors have yet
to confirm the [diagnosis of the disease, and samples taken from the
Kiganjo Police Training College have been sent to Europe, South Africa and
the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) for laboratory investigation.
In the meantime, medical and health personnel have taken measures aimed at
ensuring that there is no spread of the fever. The patient, a 20-year-old
woman, was admitted to the Consolata Mission Hospital 7 days ago
complaining of headache, chest and abdominal pains. By the time the patient
reached hospital, she was running a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, said
Dr Innocent Kaihura, the physician who cared for the woman. Dr Kaihura said
that she failed to respond to treatment and her temperature continued to rise.
"On Monday, she went into shock and started bleeding from all openings in
her body. She was bleeding from the eyes, nose, mouth, gums and the arm
where we had inserted an intravenous drip." Dr Kaihura said that such a
condition could have arisen also from the drugs she had taken [been
given?, causing a clotting disorder. He also said she could have been
suffering from peptic ulcers. Dr Kaihura said that the hospital called in
Ministry of Health officials, in accordance with a government circular
directing all health institutions to report signs of hemorrhagic fever.
Dr Kaihura pointed out that the woman was unlikely to have died from Ebola
hemorrhagic fever, as this fever takes anywhere from 2 days to 3 weeks to
incubate. "She had been at the College for more than a month before she
started feeling unwell," Dr Kaihura said. The Central Province pathologist,
Dr Moses Njue, who conducted the autopsy, said that there were 6 other
possible causes of death with similar symptoms. Dr Njue added that "It
should also be understood that the patient was not just hemorrhaging but
she had fever -- very high temperatures -- and was suffering convulsions.
Other conditions with similar symptoms, which are also being looked into,
are: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) -- bleeding that occurs
due to severe illness [such as meningococcemia and other types of
Gram-negative bacteremia - Man. Ed. DS; blood dyscaria in which the blood
clotting system becomes defective; severe malaria; typhoid; meningitis; or
a general reaction to medication. Ebola hemorrhagic fever was the least
likely diagnosis.
The team, which accompanied Dr Njue during the autopsy, wore protective
gowns provided by KEMRI, and the place and body were disinfected after the
postmortem. The hospital administrator, Father Thomas Matenjwa, said the
patient's body remained in the mortuary as a precautionary measure. The
body was expected to be kept in isolation until the family completes
funeral arrangements. He said health officials will supervise the burial.
As a further precautionary measure all doctors, nurses, and other hospital
personnel who had cared for the patient have been examined by KEMRI and
Ministry of Health officials. "They have all been instructed not to travel
outside their home areas," he said. The officials also examined classmates
and staff at the College, where similar precautionary instructions were given.
Ebola hemorrhagic fever last struck in Uganda in Oct 2001 when more than
150 people died from the disease in Gulu. Immediately afterwards, the Kenya
Government set up screening facilities along the common border with Uganda.
Ebola hemorrhagic fever is contagious and spreads through contact with the
fluids of an infected person. Within 4 days of contracting the disease, a
newly infected person experiences flu-like symptoms including fever,
weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by
vomiting, diarrhea, rash, limited kidney and liver functions, and finally
internal and external bleeding. Death usually occurs within 48 hours.

[Previous reports of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Kenya have not been
confirmed by laboratory investigation. There is a suggestion in the present
report that the patient may have undergone some rather aggressive therapy,
which may in part have been responsible for the deterioration in her
condition. - Mod.CP
