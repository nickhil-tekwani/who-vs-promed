Epidemic of rabies among animals in Tyumen areas (Russia)
-----------------------------------------------
9 persons have been hospitalized in the south of the Tyumen area, following
exposure to rabid animals, mainly foxes. During recent days, several
attacks of rabid foxes on cattle and domestic dogs have been reported.
Last week [3rd week of October 2004], 5 inhabitants of the village
Krivolukskoe were hospitalized in the Central regional hospital of
Yalutorovsk, following their exposure to sick calves. The animals had been
bitten by an infected pup.
All 9 hospitalized [for post-exposure treatment? - Mod.AS] persons are
well, and are not showing clinical symptoms.
The chief Sanitary Officer of the Tyumen area, Jury Ustjuzhanin, has today
[25 Oct 2004] declared that rabies seems to have spread among wildlife in
several areas of the southern parts of the region. He remarked that the
State Sanitary Control is about to send a written request to managers of
hunting organizations to cull foxes in the southern region. Arrangements
have been made for a burial site for the cadavers of infected animals.
Several settlements in the south have been put under quarantine,
vaccinations of animals carried out, and stray dogs caught.
Since the beginning of 2004, about 50 rabies cases in animals have been
recorded in the southern Tyumen area, of which, 44 have been
laboratory-confirmed.
According to the Tyumen epidemiologists, over 4000 persons report annually
to physicians following animal bites, scratches, and exposure to animal saliva.
