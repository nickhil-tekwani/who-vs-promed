There are now 20 reported dengue fever cases in the Cayman Islands.
There is one confirmed case, one negative case, and 18 awaiting
results. Of the suspect patients, 7 have no recent travel history to
countries with dengue fever, which means the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito
could be spreading the dangerous tropical disease locally.

Out of the 20 reported cases, 3 of the patients tested negative and
will have to be retested. "It takes a minimum of 5-7 days after
symptoms develop for the test to detect [dengue virus antibody rise.
- Mod.TY] fever," said medical officer of health Dr. Kiran Kumar. "As
a result all negative tests need to be followed by a 2nd round of tests."

Although dengue fever is not endemic to the Cayman Islands, the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is present on Grand Cayman and its
population is estimated to have surged by 1300 percent in the
aftermath of Hurricane Ivan.

However, recent samples indicate populations may be down due to
spraying and other targeted programmes, said Bill Petrie, director of
the Mosquito Research and Control Unit (MRCU).

Since 1st receiving confirmation of a dengue fever case in Grand
Cayman 15 Oct [2007], the MRCU has been targeting both areas where
_Aedes aegypti_ numbers are known to be high and areas around the
homes of patients.

The mosquito is thought to be most prevalent in areas of George Town
particularly Windsor Gardens and parts of West Bay. The mosquito,
which mainly lives and breeds around residential areas flies only
relatively short distances. This means it is critical that residents
upturn any standing water in and around their home for their own
safety, Mr Petrie said.

As many as 12 new patients including a woman and her child were
diagnosed with having dengue fever on Saturday [3 Nov 2007]. The
number of dengue fever patients has risen to 70 after the addition of
fresh cases in Lahore during the last 3 weeks. Luckily, neither any
case of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) nor dengue shock syndrome
(DSS) was reported from any corner of the city. Moreover, no death
was reported owing to the said fever. Around 50 patients have so far
been discharged from public hospitals after their recovery.

[It appears that the dengue outbreak in Lahore may be accelerating.
ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information about new cases
and any mosquito vector control measures that are being taken.
