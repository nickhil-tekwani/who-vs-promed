A cat in the northern Arizona community of Winona has tested positive for
bubonic plague. The Coconino County Health Department said fleas collected
from prairie dog burrows about 2 miles away from the home where the cat
lives also tested positive for plague. Winona is about 12 miles east of
Flagstaff, along Interstate Highway 40.
The area is the only location in Coconino County where plague has been
confirmed this year, although officials believe the disease may be more
widespread. There have been no human plague cases reported in Arizona in
2006. Plague is curable with antibiotics if diagnosed and treated early.

[It would be interesting to get more details about the clinical presentation
of the cat. No human case is mentioned, so I assume that the owner and
veterinarian involved recognised the zoonotic potential associated with
plague in cats and took appropriate hygiene measures to keep safe. There
have been documented cases of pneumonic plague transmission to veterinarians
and other humans.
Plague monitoring programs in the western United States have a long history
of surveillance in wild animal population such as prairie dogs. Calvin
Schwabe, in his classic text, Veterinary Medicine and Human Health (Williams
and Wilkins, 1984), provides a detailed description of these surveillance
programs and their public health significance. Although the text is very
hard to get hold of now as it out of print, it is well worth the effort, as
there are numerous descriptions of the potential areas by which
veterinarians contribute to public health. Like other public health programs
which require significant infrastructure, plague surveillance in wild
animals has suffered from time to time. In the case referenced above,
however, we certainly see the value to people in Arizona of testing these
wild animal populations. - Mod.PC]
