[1] Omicron spread
Date: Tue 14 Dec 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/14/who-omicron-spreading-at-unprecedented-rate


The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the coronavirus variant omicron was spreading at a rate not seen with previous strains and was likely present in most countries. The discovery of omicron was first announced in November [2021] by scientists in South Africa, which was the 1st [country] to experience a surge in COVID-19 driven by the new variant.

"Seventy-seven countries have now reported cases of omicron, and the reality is that omicron is probably in most countries, even if it hasn't been detected yet," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters during a media briefing in Geneva on Tuesday [14 Dec 2021]. "Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant."

The WHO chief also lamented that some people were dismissing omicron as a mild variant. "Surely, we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril. Even if omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems."

The discovery of omicron triggered worries that it could cause another surge in global infections, leading many countries to impose travel restrictions on several southern African nations.

The WHO chief said the UN health agency supported giving COVID-19 vaccine boosters, as long as the distribution of shots was prioritised and fair. "Let me be very clear: WHO is not against boosters. We're against inequity. Our main concern is to save lives, everywhere. It's really quite simple: The priority in every country, and globally, must be to protect the least protected, not the most protected," he said.

Tedros said the emergence of omicron has prompted some countries to initiate their COVID-19 booster programmes for their entire adult populations despite lacking evidence for the effectiveness of boosters against the omicron strain.

"WHO is concerned that such programmes will repeat the COVID-19 vaccine hoarding we saw this year [2021] and exacerbate inequity. It's clear that as we move forward, boosters could play an important role, especially for those at highest risk of severe disease [and] death."

He noted that 41 countries had still not been able to vaccinate 10% of their populations, and 98 countries have not reached 40%. Moreover, the WHO chief said there were significant inequities between population groups in the same country when it came to vaccinations. "If we end inequity, we end the pandemic. If we allow inequity to continue, we allow the pandemic to continue," Tedros warned.

[2] Modeling: potential impact of omicron in England
Date: Sat 11 Dec 2021

New modelling from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) suggests the omicron variant has the potential to cause a wave of transmission in England that could lead to higher levels of cases and hospitalisations than those seen during January 2021, if additional control measures are not taken.

The research is not yet peer reviewed and is set out in a pre-print paper. The team used the latest experimental data on the antibody-evading characteristics of the omicron variant to explore plausible scenarios for the immune escape of omicron.

The team selected the level of transmissibility and introduction time of omicron to match with the growth of observed S gene target failure data in England, given the emerging evidence on immune escape. These scenarios were used to project the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission into the 1st half of 2022 for England. The results project a wave of COVID-19 transmission for all scenarios considered, with varying levels of infections, hospital admissions, and mortality depending on the assumptions made.

Under the most optimistic scenario (low immune escape of omicron and high effectiveness of boosters), a wave of infection is projected which could lead to a peak of over 2000 daily hospital admissions, with 175 000 (95% CI: 139 000-198 000) hospitalisations and 24 700 (19 500-28 700) deaths between 1 Dec 2021 and 30 Apr 2022, if no additional control measures are implemented over and above the current "Plan B" policy in England.

In this scenario, bringing in control measures early in 2022 which are equivalent in stringency to Step 2 of the roadmap -- which involved restrictions on indoor hospitality, closure of some entertainment venues, and restrictions on gathering sizes -- would be sufficient to substantially control this wave, reducing hospitalisations by 53 000 and deaths by 7600.

The most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape and lower effectiveness of boosters) projects a wave of infection which is likely to lead to a peak in hospital admissions around twice as high as the peak seen in January 2021, if no additional control measures are taken, with 492 000 (418 000-537 000) hospitalisations and 74 800 (63 500-82 900) deaths. In this scenario, the team estimates that stronger measures may be required to keep the peak number of hospital admissions below the January 2021 peak.

Dr Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM's Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID), who co-led the research, said: "There is a lot of uncertainty about the characteristics of omicron, and whether omicron in England will follow the same course as it has in South Africa. More data over the next few weeks will strengthen our knowledge on omicron and the consequences of this on transmission in England. However, these early projections help guide our understanding about potential futures in a rapidly evolving situation.

"In our most optimistic scenario, the impact of omicron in the early part of 2022 would be reduced with mild control measures such as working from home. However, our most pessimistic scenario suggests that we may have to endure more stringent restrictions to ensure the NHS [National Health Service] is not overwhelmed. Mask-wearing, social distancing and booster jabs are vital, but may not be enough.

"Nobody wants to endure another lockdown, but last-resort measures may be required to protect health services if omicron has a significant level of immune escape or otherwise increased transmissibility compared to delta. It is crucial for decision makers to consider the wider societal impact of these measures, not just the epidemiology."

Assumptions about the levels of transmissibility and immune escape of omicron were formulated using "S" gene target failure (SGTF) data from cases in England -- these are cases that are not yet confirmed with genomic sequencing to be omicron but thought to be highly likely to be omicron, as the omicron variant causes this failure, but the widespread delta variant does not.

For the 2 immune escape scenarios considered, the team estimate the omicron variant to be between 10% less transmissible than the delta variant to 35% more transmissible than delta. The researchers account for the additional protection afforded by booster doses against omicron in their scenarios. If a very high uptake of booster vaccines is achieved, then this is projected to further mitigate projected surges in cases, hospitalisations and deaths.

Dr Nick Davies from CMMID, who co-led the research, said: "These are early estimates, but they do suggest that overall omicron is outcompeting delta rapidly by evading vaccines to a substantial degree. If current trends continue, then omicron may represent half of UK cases by the end of December [2021]. Further analysis suggests that the booster programme is vital, with a counterfactual scenario with no boosters showing a peak in hospitalisations that could be as much as 5 times as high as the scenario with boosters."

The research team say these projections are subject to considerable uncertainty, with limitations including the early nature of the data used to make predictions, uncertainty over policy decisions that will be made over the next several months, and a lack of information on the relative severity of omicron.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"We model the potential consequences of the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant on transmission and health outcomes in England, with scenarios varying the extent of immune escape; the effectiveness, uptake and speed of COVID-19 booster vaccinations; and the reintroduction of control measures. These results suggest that omicron has the potential to cause substantial surges in cases, hospital admissions and deaths in populations with high levels of immunity, including England. The reintroduction of additional non-pharmaceutical interventions may be required to prevent hospital admissions exceeding the levels seen in England during the previous peak in winter 2020-2021."

"Summary
- We adapted the LSHTM real-time transmission model (used to evaluate the roadmap out of lockdown, for instance) to take account of the recent introduction of the omicron variant into England.

- To account for key uncertainties such as omicron's degree of immune escape and the effectiveness of booster doses against omicron, we constructed a number of different scenarios. We construct low and high estimates of immune escape, which are broadly in line with estimates from early neutralisation studies (measurements of the effectiveness of existing antibodies against omicron) and one modelling study, released up to 9 Dec 2021 (1-6).

- Given these low and high estimates, we estimate the transmissibility of omicron (relative to delta) by calibrating our model to S-gene target failure (SGTF) data from England (see Fig. 1b in the main text).

- Again, we construct high and low estimates for the effectiveness of booster vaccines against omicron, based on the empirically measured impact of booster doses on neutralising antibody titres (which are assumed to be a correlate of protection against infection and serious disease) (7). This results in 4 main scenarios: low escape + high booster efficacy, low escape + low booster efficacy, high escape + high booster efficacy, and high escape + low booster efficacy, in order from most optimistic to most pessimistic.

- In all 4 main scenarios, we model a policy of compulsory mask wearing in shops and on public transport from 30 Nov 2021, as well as introducing 'Plan B' measures from 12 Dec 2021. Under these control measures, our most optimistic scenario projects peak daily hospital admissions of 2400 (95% projection interval: 1700-3600) in England occurring in January 2022. Our most pessimistic scenario projects peak hospital admissions of approximately twice the size of the January 2021 peak.

- We also model the introduction of additional control measures over and above the 'Plan B' measures. We model these additional measures as returns to previous stages of the UK government's 'roadmap out of lockdown' from Spring-Summer 2021, which consisted of 5 steps, from 'step 0' to 'step 4', with step 0 being the most stringent. In our most optimistic scenario (low immune escape + high booster efficacy), less-stringent measures are projected to keep hospital admissions substantially below the January 2021 peak. In our most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape + low booster efficacy), the model projects that the same less-stringent measures do not keep hospital admissions below the January 2021 peak, but more stringent measures have a stronger impact.

- Due to a lack of data, we assume omicron has the same severity as delta. If omicron exhibits lower severity than delta, this would decrease the projected number of severe outcomes in our model.

- We do not evaluate the impact of alternative control strategies such as enhanced mass testing, which could form part of a package of less-stringent control measures capable of mitigating the epidemic.

- This is a work in progress, and further updates will be made as more data become available."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Although myocarditis and pericarditis were not observed as adverse events in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trials, there have been numerous reports of suspected cases following vaccination in the general population. We undertook a self-controlled case series study of people aged 16 or older vaccinated for COVID-19 in England between 1 Dec 2020 and 24 Aug 2021 to investigate hospital admission or death from myocarditis, pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias in the 1-28 days following adenovirus (ChAdOx1, n = 20 615 911) or messenger RNA-based (BNT162b2, n = 16 993 389; mRNA-1273, n = 1 006 191) vaccines or a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test (n = 3 028 867).

We found increased risks of myocarditis associated with the 1st dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines and the 1st and 2nd doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine over the 1-28 days postvaccination period, and after a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We estimated an extra 2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0, 3), 1 (95% CI 0, 2) and 6 (95% CI 2, 8) myocarditis events per one million people vaccinated with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively, in the 28 days following a 1st dose and an extra 10 (95% CI 7, 11) myocarditis events per one million vaccinated in the 28 days after a 2nd dose of mRNA-1273. This compares with an extra 40 (95% CI 38, 41) myocarditis events per one million patients in the 28 days following a SARS-CoV-2 positive test.

We also observed increased risks of pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Similar associations were not observed with any of the COVID-19 vaccines, apart from an increased risk of arrhythmia following a 2nd dose of mRNA-1273. Subgroup analyses by age showed the increased risk of myocarditis associated with the 2 mRNA vaccines was present only in those younger than 40.

Discussion
----------
In summary, this population-based study quantifies for the 1st time the risk of several rare cardiac adverse events associated with 3 COVID-19 vaccines as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 in adults was associated with a small increase in the risk of myocarditis within a week of receiving the 1st dose of both adenovirus and mRNA vaccines, and after the 2nd dose of both mRNA vaccines. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of hospitalization or death from myocarditis, pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmia.

[4] China (Mainland): 2nd case omicron
Date: Tue 14 Dec 2021 23:03 EST
Source: CNN [abridged, edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/13/china/china-first-omicron-case-intl-hnk/index.html


China has detected its 2nd case of the omicron coronavirus variant in a traveler more than 2 weeks after he arrived in the country from overseas, posing a fresh challenge to the government's zero-COVID strategy. The case, reported in the southern city of Guangzhou on Tuesday [14 Dec 2021], came a day after health authorities in the northern port city of Tianjin said they detected mainland China's 1st omicron infection -- also in a traveler who arrived from overseas.

The Tianjin case was identified as an asymptomatic carrier on arrival. The individual was already in quarantine while genome sequencing confirmed he had the omicron variant -- suggesting the variant had not been directly exposed to local residents. The 2nd case, a 67-year-old man, entered China on 27 Nov 2021 in Shanghai and underwent 2 weeks of centralized quarantine, during which he repeatedly tested negative. The man then flew from Shanghai to Guangzhou on AirChina flight CA1837. AirChina staff confirmed to CNN the flight was nearly full, with all economy seats taken and only 6 seats remaining in business class.

The man then entered into home quarantine. He was tested again on 12 Dec 2021 -- a full 15 days after first arriving in China, with the result coming back positive in the early hours of 13 Dec 2021. Subsequent genome sequencing reviewed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed it was the omicron variant, according to authorities.

Unlike the Tianjin case, the man has been diagnosed as a confirmed case -- meaning he has symptoms. He is now being treated in isolation in hospital, officials said. Following his diagnosis, 10 544 people connected to the man have been tested for the virus -- so far all results have returned negative.

Chinese authorities did not reveal when, where or how the man caught the virus. On average, it takes between 5 and 6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show; however, it can take up to 14 days, according to the World Health Organization.

Much remains unknown about the fast-spreading omicron variant, including its incubation period. The variant carries an unusually large number of mutations that scientists worry could potentially make it more transmissible and less susceptible to existing vaccines. Last month [November 2021], omicron was identified in 2 returning travelers in separate rooms on the same floor of a designated quarantine hotel in Hong Kong, leading scientists to believe it may have passed through the air in the hallway.

Chinese public health experts and state media have previously voiced confidence in the country's ability to tackle the new variant, citing China's strict border control measures and its ability to swiftly identify and isolate infected cases and their close contacts. In China, all overseas arrivals must be tested for COVID before they leave the airport, followed by at least 2 weeks of centralized quarantine. This is often followed by another lengthy period of home isolation. Throughout the process, international arrivals are prevented from coming into contact with the wider community until they have completed the required quarantine process.

But China's ambitious zero-tolerance strategy -- composed of mass testing, snap lockdowns and extensive quarantines -- also comes with great economic costs, as well as no shortage of disruption to daily life. Beijing is due to host the Winter Olympics in February [2022]. As the event approaches, authorities are resorting to ever more stringent measures to curb local outbreaks, which have continued to flare up with increasing frequency. The country has now reported locally transmitted cases every day for the past 8 weeks.

On Tuesday [14 Dec 2021], eastern Zhejiang province, home to the country's key manufacturing and export hubs, reported 44 new cases, bringing the total caseload over the past week to above 200. Authorities in virus-hit areas swiftly quarantined tens of thousands of residents, suspended businesses, events and tour groups, and canceled flights, ferries and bus services.

The travel restrictions in medium- and high-risk areas will be in place until 15 Mar 2022 -- well after the Winter Olympics is over, and around the time the country's annual legislative meetings are completed in Beijing. Keeping infections away from the Chinese capital is a top priority for the government, as the city gears up for the Games. All flights from the city of Ningbo, a major industrial hub, to Beijing have been canceled, while only one daily flight from Hangzhou, the provincial capital, to Beijing is allowed.

In other parts of the country, infections are also being reported. In the north, Inner Mongolia reported 5 symptomatic cases and 4 asymptomatic infections, while the provinces of Heilongjiang and Shaanxi each reported one confirmed case, according to the National Health Commission. In the southern province of Guangdong, 2 people in the manufacturing hub of Dongguan were tested positive Monday [13 Dec 2021], prompting a local lockdown.
