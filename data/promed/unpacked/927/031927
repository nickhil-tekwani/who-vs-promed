Indonesian Polio Cases Rise to 225; Disease Spreads in Capital
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia's polio cases rose to 225, with a 4th case reported in the
capital Jakarta, a week before the nation holds its 3rd vaccination
campaign this year [2005], the World Health Organization said.
The number includes a 25-year-old man who died in West Jakarta, WHO said in
a statement. There were 4 new cases in Banten province.
"The incident shows how serious and rapidly polio virus could harm human
life, therefore, as there is no cure for polio, immunization is the only
way to prevent someone being exposed to the virus,'' the statement said.
More than 1020 cases of polio, which causes paralysis and sometimes death
and affects mainly children under 5 years old, have been confirmed in 13
countries this year [2005], WHO said on its Web site [the actual count
available on the polio eradication web-site is 1053 cases as of 16 Aug
2005. - Mod.MPP]. The outbreaks, including one in Yemen in April 2005 with
400 cases, are calling into question whether WHO will be able to meet the
target this year [2005] for its eradication program.
Indonesia plans to hold a nationwide vaccination campaign on 30 Aug [2005]
and 27 Sep [2005] in all 33 provinces in the country to halt the spread of
the disease, targeting 24.4 million children under 5 years old, WHO said on
its Web site.
2 rounds of vaccinations in West Java and Banten provinces and the nation's
capital, cost the government USD 2.37 million, WHO has said. The cost of
the campaign may rise to more than 200 billion rupiah (USD 20 million) in
total, Yusharmen, an Indonesian health ministry official, said earlier.
Other Countries
6 countries are still polio-endemic: Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Niger,
Nigeria and Pakistan, WHO has said. 6 other nations, all in Africa, were
listed as having "re-established transmission,'' with outbreaks lasting
more than 6 months [the countries listed as having reestablished
transmission are: Sudan, Chad, Mali, Central African Republic, Burkina Faso
and Cote d'Ivoire [see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/fixed/casecount.shtml> - Mod.MPP].
WHO said it needs USD 50 million for global immunizations for the 2nd half
of 2005 by July and needs multiyear pledges for the following 3 years, the
most pressing of which is USD 200 million for 2006, it said. The money is
needed to keep the disease from re-emerging if eradication is achieved.
The 1st of the Indonesian cases was detected on 21 Apr [2005] in Sukabumi
district in West Java province. Sukabumi is about 100 km (62 miles) south
of the capital, Jakarta.

[The above report represents an increase in 20 cases since the last
ProMED-mail posting on this outbreak on 7 Aug 2005. In addition, it reports
on the 1st death attributable to poliovirus infectious in this outbreak.
The "good news" is that there have not been further reports of cases on
other islands (outside of Java) in the Indonesian archipelago since the
report of the 2 cases on Sumatra in early July 2005 (see ProMED-mail
reports Poliomyelitis - Indonesia (13) 20050706.1906 and Poliomyelitis -
Indonesia (11): Sumatra 20050701.1864). The "bad news" is the increase in
the number of cases occurring in Jakarta, a very populous capital city.
(According to one web-site, the greater metropolitan area has a population
of 17 593 429, and ranks as the 7th largest greater metropolitan area in
the world. See <http://www.pubquizhelp.34sp.com/geo/popcity.html> with
data source <http://www.world-gazetteer.com>). - Mod.MPP]
