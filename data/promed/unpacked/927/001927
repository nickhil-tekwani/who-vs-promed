Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Nelson, Nelson, Nelson-Marlborough
Date of start of the outbreak: 27 Aug 2014
Outbreak status: resolved (1 Sep 2014)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-closed
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
New Zealand green-lipped mussel (_Perna canaliculus_) / 0 per cent / 0 per cent / - / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: _Perna canaliculus_ broodstock at aquaculture facility

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments
An aquaculture facility notified the Ministry for Primary Industries of a suspected detection of the protozoan parasite _Perkinsus olseni_ in a New Zealand green-lipped mussel (_Perna canaliculus_). The notification was based on histopathological findings during routine health monitoring by the aquaculture facility. No unusual mortality or signs of ill health have been observed in _Perna canaliculus_ at the facility. New Zealand's national animal health laboratory verified the presence of perkinsus by histopathology and confirmed _P. olseni_ via conventional PCR and sequencing. This is the 1st detection of _P. olseni_ in New Zealand green-lipped mussels. _P. olseni_ is known to occur in wild populations of the bivalves _Austrovenus stutchburyi_ (Veneridae), _Macomona liliana_ (Tellinidae), _Barbatia novaezelandiae_ (Arcidae), and _Paphies australis_ (Mesodesmatidae), as well as farmed and wild populations of _Haliotis iris_ (Haliotidae) in the North Island of New Zealand.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Investigation and Diagnostic Centre (IDC), Wallaceville (national laboratory) / New Zealand green-lipped mussel (_Perna canaliculus_) / gene sequencing / 1 Sep 2014 / Positive

[Several species of the genus _Perkinsus_ are responsible for causing perkinsosis in molluscs such as oysters, mussels, clams, and abalone worldwide. _Perkinsus olseni_ is the only species known to cause this disease in the Asia-Pacific region and is responsible for perkinsosis in abalone, clams, and pearl oysters. _P. atlanticus_ is a junior synonym of _P. olseni_ (http://tinyurl.com/k7ngn3e).

The following information was obtained from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Fact Sheet on Infection with _P. olseni_, http://tinyurl.com/og6oerr:

"_Perkinsus olseni_ causes death in juvenile and adult molluscs. Overall mortality is 30-40 per cent in molluscs that are 3-4 cm long.

Infected molluscs may exhibit any of the following signs:
- behavior: gaping
- appearance: decreased rate of growth; brown, pus-filled spots in the foot, gills and mantle; retracted mantle; very thin body; pale digestive gland.

The causal agent of _P. olseni_ is not a risk to human health."

The New Zealand green-lipped mussel, (_Perna canaliculus_), also known as the New Zealand mussel, the greenshell mussel, kuku, and kutai, is a bivalve mollusc in the family Mytilidae, the true mussels. _P. canaliculus_ has great importance as a cultivated species in New Zealand (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perna_canalicula).
