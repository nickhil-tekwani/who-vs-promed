Bovine tuberculosis on a Friesian dairy farm
--------------------------------------------
A veterinarian of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority
(VWA) discovered, late last month [July 2010] during a post mortem
examination of a cow, changes suspected to be due to tuberculosis.
Subsequent examinations of material from the carcass showed that the
animal was most likely infected with bovine tuberculosis [TB].

Tests on all other cattle on the farm revealed that 20 percent of
them had the disease. These animals were killed to prevent further
spread. The farm was put under quarantine on the day of initial
suspicion, preventing movement of animals.

The investigation into the origin of the infection has so far
revealed the introduction of cattle from 7 Dutch farms. The cattle on
all these farms are also being tested. In addition, all 41 farms
which have received animals from the infected farm since 1 Jan 2009,
are tested as well.

The remaining cattle on the infected farm in Friesland, are to be
tested at least twice, with an interval of 2 to 4 months. In case
found negative in both tests, the permit to remove animals will be regained.

The 1st test results of the other farms are expected during the
course of next week [week of 30 Aug 2010]. Until then, these farms
are also under animal movement restrictions.

Bovine TB [Btb] is a disease which can be transmitted from animals to
humans. In particular, drinking raw milk or consuming raw milk
cheeses is risky. Bovine TB in humans can lead to vague symptoms such
as fatigue, lethargy, emaciation, mild pyrexia, and night sweats.

Netherlands has been long been recognised by the EU as a BTb-free
country; only on rare occasions have TB-bovines been found.

The farms involved in the current event have not been engaged in the
trade of raw milk or the production of raw-milk based cheeses. The
milk from these farms is delivered to a dairy where milk is
pasteurized. The pasteurization process inactivates possible present bacteria.

Over 2 years ago, 12 calves on 6 Dutch farms were found infected with
bovine tuberculosis. The animals originated from a farm in England,
where the disease is more common.

[In July 2008, the Netherlands (officially bovine tuberculosis-free
Member State), based on the epidemiological investigation followed by
the notification received from the United Kingdom, detected a number
of cases of infection with _Mycobacterium bovis_ in calves under 42
days of age coming from a single holding in the United Kingdom, that
went down with tuberculosis after the dispatch of the animals.

Dutch and Belgian farmers imposed a (self) ban on British cattle
following the revelation that 12 veal calves were positive for bovine
tuberculosis. The Dutch Agriculture Ministry condemned this breech of
biosecurity, particularly as there had been no TB in the Netherlands
since 1999; this was followed by discussions in Brussels, which led
to the publication of an acceptable regime for the interstate
(intra-EU) trade in bovines below 42 days of age. For the data on the
discussion and its outcome, see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/report_working_group_bovine_tuberculosis.pdf>.

The results of investigations into the origin of the current case are
anticipated with interest. Is this a ramification/late emergence of
infection related to the 2008 event, or a new introduction into the
Netherlands? - Mod.AS]
