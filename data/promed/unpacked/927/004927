Re: Wild birds, Romania, posting 20051130.3460
----------------------------------------------
Great blue heron (_Ardea herodias_) [included in the list of
H5N1-affected birds from Romania] is a New World species that is not
found in Europe. Unless the report refers to a captive individual in
a collection (which seems unlikely), I suspect that the bird referred
to in the report is a Grey Heron (_Ardea cinerea_), found across
Europe, Asia (as far east as Japan and as far south as Indonesia) and
Africa. The bird is resident through much of Europe, although
northerly populations do migrate south during the winter. A dead Grey
heron found in Hong Kong in 2004 tested positive for the virus.
[Re 20051130.3460], I am forwarding excerpts taken from the Handbook
of the Birds of the World, published by Lynx Editions
(<http://www.hbw.com>), with transcribed data on Distribution and Movements.
1. Mute Swan, _Cygnus olor_
----------------------------
Distribution: British Is, C and N Europe through C Asia to E China.
Feral populations in North America, Japan, South Africa, SW Australia
and New Zealand.
Movements: Truly wild populations mainly migratory, particularly
where displaced by cold weather; spend winter in more temperate
zones. European and feral populations mostly sedentary, males
defending territory for most of year. Recorded as vagrant in Pakistan.
2. Lesser white fronted Goose, _Anser erythropus_
-------------------------------------------------
Distribution: Narrow bands across Arctic Eurasia.
Movements: Migratory, main wintering areas on coastal plains of
Caspian and Black Seas and in E China. Occasionally mixes with flocks
of _A. albifrons_ and occurs much further W than normal range;
regular in Britain.
Status and Conservation: ....Reckoned to be endangered in Europe:
best wintering grounds seem to be on Pannoic Planis, Hungary, where
species formerly vary abundant, but now amasses only a few thousand birds.
3. Grey Heron, _Ardea cinerea_
--------------------------------------
Distribution: _Ardea cinerea cinerea_, mostly of Palearctic, thinly
through Africa, India and Sri Lanka. _A. c. jouyi _ [the sub-species
found in Hong-kong? - Mod.AS] Japan to N Burma and S to Java.
Movements: Populations of extreme N migratory, further S tend to be
sedentary or dispersive. In Palearctic, migratory tendency increases
towards N and E; breeding populations of Iberian Peninsula, Britain
and Ireland are sedentary, but others E to Siberia mainly migratory,
though some individuals overwinter on breeding grounds; most
migration towards SW, more rarely towards S or SE, starting
Sept/Oct, with return starting in Feb.
Birds of Far East [_A. c. jouyi _] migrate to S China; 2 birds ringed
in SE Siberia recovered in N Thailand; partial migrant in Japan.
4. Common moorhen, _Gallinula chloropus chloropus_.
----------------------------------------------------
Distribution: Europe, North Africa, Azores, Canaries and Cape Verde
Is E through W, C & S Asia to Japan, S to Sri Lanka and C Malaysia; N
populations winter S to Mediterraneana region, sub-Saharan Africa and S. Asia.
Movements: In W Palearctic, resident or dispersive in S and extreme
W, partially migratory to migratory elsewhere, extent of movement
increasing further to N & E. Almost wholly summer visitor to former
USSR and Finland, while relatively few remain in N Scandinavia, N
Germany and Poland in winter. N European birds winter S to Iberia,
Italy, Balkans and N Africa. Autumn movements mainly SW from N Europe
and S-SE from C Europe; main S movements Sept-Dec, juveniles
dispersing from Jul; return passage Mar-May. Winter range of emigrant
Russian birds, and extent of dispersal by Near East birds, unknown.
Passage noted Azerbaijan Mar-Apr and Oct-Nov.

[Martin's corrective comment is appreciated; for a picture of the
Great blue heron, see
<http://www.johnsonmill.com/images/Great%20Blue%20Heron%202.jpg>, and
for the Grey heron,
<http://www.camacdonald.com/birding/DesJardin/GrayHeron1(DD).jpg>.
The data on the distribution and movements of the 4 species found
infected in Romania are much appreciated. They might be helpful in
studies into the origin of the infected wild birds, an issue which
remains unresolved.
Ornithologists may significantly contribute to epidemiological
studies and surveillance activities related to the H5N1 panzootic. - Mod.AS]
