TB outbreak in North Dakota traced to boy from Marshall Islands
--------------------------------------------------
An boy from the Marshall Islands spread tuberculosis to 56 people, including
many of his playmates, after coming to live in rural North Dakota -- a case
researchers said underscores the need for tighter medical screening of
children adopted from abroad.
The outbreak was discovered in 1998, when one of the boy's guardians was
treated for a painful hip that turned out to be a TB infection, researchers
reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. TB is common in the
Marshall Islands, a Pacific Ocean chain midway between Hawaii and Australia,
but is rare in North Dakota. In the preceding five years, only two cases had
been diagnosed in the rural two-county area around the boy's home.
The medical journal did not identify the community, but news reports
from the time said it was Lakota, a town of 900 about 140 miles from
Bismarck. The extent of the outbreak and the fact that a student had
spread TB were known, but other details -- namely, that the student
brought the tuberculosis from the Marshall Islands -- were not released
then.
The boy was 9 years old when diagnosed in 1998 and living with
unrelated legal guardians for two years. He had been given a TB test
shortly after he arrived in this country in 1996, but the test was less
reliable than the newer Mantoux test. Officials could not give
additional details because of privacy laws. The 56 people he infected
represented one-fifth of all the people who had spent time with him.
They included three of the four people he lived with, 16 of his 24
classmates and teachers, 10 of the 32 children who rode his school bus,
and nine of the 61 children and adults at a day care center.
Most people infected by tuberculosis do not get sick and cannot spread TB
because the immune system encloses the bacteria in hard capsules. The
disease can affect bones, the brain and other organs; it is spread when the
bacteria get out of their capsules, collect in the lungs and get coughed
into the air. A 1965 review of 84 school-based outbreaks around the United
States in the middle of this century found only 4 cases in which the
original patient was younger than 10, the authors of Thursday's study
reported. The researchers included Ferry and Amy B. Curtis of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
Although the boy's tuberculosis was not drug-resistant, the outbreak
points out problems that could occur when children are adopted from
countries where drug-resistant TB is becoming epidemic, said Laurie
Miller, an adoption medicine specialist at New England Medical Center's
children's hospital in Boston. "I think we will see much more clinical
disease, and the disease will be much more difficult to treat in the
future," she said in an interview. In an editorial in the journal,
Miller said children brought into the country for adoption should be
tested for conditions such as TB and syphilis. U.S. families have
adopted more than 125 000 children from other countries since 1986.
Although children must get check-ups before they get a visa to travel to
the United States, that is not enough to ensure that the youngsters are
healthy, Miller said.
