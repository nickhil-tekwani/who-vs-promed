Autumn may be starting to set in, but it is not stopping the mosquitoes and the spread of the disabling Ross River Virus on the Sunshine Coast.

Sunshine Coast Hospital and Health Service Public Health Physician, Dr Andrew Langley said there had been 178 cases of Ross River Virus notified to Queensland Health in the Sunshine Coast, Noosa and Gympie council areas this year [2016] so far. But this figure was only people who had seen a doctor and provided a specimen for laboratory testing. It was also 1.4 times the average number of cases at this time of the year for the last 5 years (126 notifications). Last year [2015] was however an unusual spike with 351 cases notified by this time.

The number of notifications is also on the rise. "Since the start of 2016, numbers of notifications in the region have increased with at least 20 cases currently being notified each week," Dr Langley said. Hopefully though the numbers would soon be in decline as the cooler weather set in. "Ross River Virus is a seasonal disease, with more cases usually occurring in late summer and autumn," Dr Langley said.

Across Queensland, 1426 cases of Ross River Virus had been notified this year so far, which is similar to the 5-year average (1431 cases). However, in 2015, 6192 cases had been notified by this time.

Ross River Virus causes inflammation and pain in multiple joints. Dr Langley said other symptoms may include a fever then a raised red rash up to 10 days later. "The joint pain can be severe and usually lasts from 2-6 weeks," he said.

The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes.

Protect yourself:
-----------------

- avoid being bitten by mosquitoes; particularly avoid being outside during times of heavy infestation of mosquitoes (e.g. early evenings in the warmer months)
- use insect repellents and wear protective, light coloured clothing
- screen living and sleeping areas
- check your home regularly for potential mosquito breeding areas (e.g. any uncovered water containers should be emptied regularly).

[Ross River virus (RRV) infections occur sporadically across Australia. The summer-autumn has been a very active period for transmission in 2015 and again in 2016. Especially hard hit has been Queensland state, where cases have been mounting over the past 2 years, reaching 4645 cases in 2015 and 1426 cases so far this year.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring.
