Ebola: the National Management Committee regrets "mistake" by WHO
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The latest figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) on Ebola haemorrhagic fever have been contradicted in a press conference Sat 7 Jun [2014] by the national committee for management of the disease, which speaks of a "mistake" on the part of the UN institution.

According to the national committee, the disease has caused 126 deaths instead of 208 reported by WHO. The minister for development cooperation, Kutub Moustapha Sanoh, member of the committee, said that the figures reported by WHO in Geneva do not come from his representation in Conakry.

Koutoub Moustapha Sanoh and the minister of health, Colonel Remy Lamah, say WHO made a "mistake" in the numbers. They state that there have been 208 cases of Ebola in all. Among them there are 126 dead, [the rest] cured and sick. "The representative of WHO recontacted us to say that this figure was not correct," reported Koutoub Sanoh. "Instead of coming to us to try to understand what the numbers represent, WHO reported directly that there have been 208 deaths from Ebola in Guinea. Initially we saw Doctors Without Borders [MSF] speak of a unprecedented epidemic ... This is not normal. We must try to find out exactly what we are talking about," says Fode Tass Sylla, another member of the national committee.

This is the 2nd time that the national committee has disapproved of the WHO disease [count]. On 19 Apr 2014, the national health crisis committee has had to "groom" the numbers after WHO reported 122 deaths out of 197 confirmed cases. After this correction, the technical coordinator of the WHO Ebola outbreak, Dr J Bosco Ndohokvzwayo had said it is necessary to follow the communications strategy and government figures.

In announcing on Sat 7 Apr 2014, the latest figures on the disease, the health minister reiterated that the spread of the disease is due to the abandoning of the rules of hygiene. Once more he asked the media to continue their support in raising the awareness of the population.

Ebola in Sierra Leone: outbreak threatens to overwhelm volunteers
-----------------------------------------------------------------
When a team from Tulane University sent a batch of protective clothing and equipment to help workers fighting an outbreak of Ebola virus [disease] in Sierra Leone last month [May 2014], they were fairly confident the 300 or so packs would be enough for a good start. They couldn't have predicted what they would be up against.

The World Health Organization says 22 new cases of Ebola virus [disease] were reported in Sierra Leone between 29 May and 5 Jun 2014. WHO counts 81 cases with 6 deaths but Sierra Leone's health ministry says it has a total of 95 confirmed and suspected cases.

"This is worse than expected. I am fearful that it could get much worse," said Robert Garry, a virologist and specialist in viral hemorrhagic fevers at Tulane University. Garry flew to Kenema Government Hospital last month [May 2014] with as much personal protective equipment (PPE) as he could carry, but he says they are running out fast. "We have to ration them," he said.

Kenema Hospital is treating 11 patients with Ebola, all being kept in isolation; 6 more have died. With each worker needing a complete change of gown, mask, gloves, goggles, and other protective gear with each visit, that means supplies go fast.

At least 35 lab-confirmed Ebola cases have been traced to a traditional healer whose grieving patients apparently handled her body at her funeral and became infected themselves, Garry says. The healer had treated patients just over the border in neighboring Guinea. This cross-border outbreak is worrying health officials because it's spreading in an area where people cross from one country into another casually, passing through large cities on their travels.

Ebola is one of the deadliest viruses known. It kills quickly, taking anywhere between 50 per cent and 90 per cent of victims, depending on the strain. [In the current outbreak in Sierra Leone, the CFR (case fatality rate) is running at 6/95 or just over 6 per cent. - Mod.JW] The good news is it doesn't spread terribly easily -- it requires direct contact with bodily fluids. But caregivers and health care workers can become infected while caring for patients, and funeral rituals such as washing a body can expose more people.

And if people don't know they've been exposed, they can travel sometimes long distances to spreads the virus to others when they themselves become ill. WHO says experts are trying to track down 30 people now.

"Community resistance is hindering the identification and follow-up of contacts," WHO says. "They are just scattering," Garry confirmed. "It's very hard to track them down." Garry's working with local and international experts to identify cases, distribute protective gear, train workers and test samples.

"Unfortunately, these numbers will rise dramatically as cases from the Koindu and Daru regions are tallied. Reports from the field for villages surrounding Koindu and Daru are grim."

The outbreak started in Guinea earlier this year [2014], the 1st time Ebola had been seen in West Africa. WHO says at least 21 people died and 48 new cases of suspected Ebola were recorded in Guinea between 29 May and 3 Jun 2014, taking Guinea's total to 344 [but see [1] above. - Mod.JW]

With more than 215 deaths so far, the West African outbreak is one of the worst on record. The biggest outbreak on record affected 425 people in Uganda in 2000, killing 224 of them.

Education is the key to fighting it. Garry says many people in affected regions don't understand it's a virus and often don't believe advisories about how it's spread. His team is educating health care workers so they can protect themselves and teach others. A poster is being used to educate health care workers in Sierra Leone about symptoms of Ebola virus [see comment below]. "They pay attention once they hear how it's spread," Garry said. "The idea is to train these people here to go back and disseminate the main instructions about the disease."

An Ebola virus disease [EVD] infection often looks like malaria at first, so people may not suspect they have it. It later progresses to the classic symptoms of a hemorrhagic fever, with vomiting, diarrhea, high fever, and both internal and external bleeding. With so many bodily fluids pouring from a patient, it is easy to see how caregivers could become infected.

"Ebola is a disease that scares people and that is perceived as mysterious, but people can overcome it," says Marie-Christine Ferir, emergency coordinator for the group Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF] Doctors Without Borders. "Earning people's trust is essential in efforts to fight the epidemic."

WHO says 6 experts and 5000 sets of protective equipment have been sent to Sierra Leone by various groups.

Garry says his team is building on years of groundwork. He's been working with the Kenema hospital for a decade to build its capacity to fight another viral hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever. Protective measures for health care workers treating patients with Lassa fever or Ebola are the same. "We tell them to wear gloves and to protect their eyes," Garry said, speaking by telephone from the hospital. "And we've shown people how to do a traditional burial, [but] wearing gloves. And you can allow the body to be washed briefly. Workers have been attentive to the traditions, allowing the body to be wrapped without exposing people to the virus."

Genetic analysis of the virus causing the current outbreaks show it's distinct from the virus seen in east Africa. This suggests it may be from a local source. No one's sure just where Ebola comes from. It can affect great apes but fruit bats are a prime suspect.

Garry, who was only scheduled to stay for a couple of weeks, now says he is not sure when he can leave. "I don't think it's going to be soon," he said.

[The disagreement over statistics of the outbreak in Guinea is unfortunate, but it is encouraging to hear that the death toll is not as high as previously reported. WHO has repeatedly stated that the statistics are subject to revision.

It is heartening to hear that basic rules of hygiene are now being observed in relation to patients in Sierra Leone.

A poster currently in use in that country is shown at

A rumour that an EVD case has occurred in the state of Acre, Brazil, illustrated with a photo of a gory patient or corpse, is obviously false. - Mod.JW
