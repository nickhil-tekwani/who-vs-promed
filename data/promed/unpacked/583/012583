Venezuela Update
----------------
CARACAS: A dengue fever epidemic has killed 6 people and [affected more
than 36 600 in Venezuela, the Health Ministry said on Thu 6 Sep 2001. More
than 3000 of the cases involved a potentially fatal form of the
mosquito-borne disease. A total of 36 612 cases have been reported this
year, more than double the figure over the same period last year, the
Ministry said in a statement. It indicated that there were 5838 new cases
last week. A total of 6 people have died this year after contracting dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) following Dengue virus type 3 infection.
There is no vaccine for the disease. Victims suffer headaches, rashes,
cramps, and severe muscle pain. Most recover after a week, but those with
Dengue virus type 3 infection begin to bleed internally even after
appearing to have recovered. Death can result if victims do not receive
medical treatment. On 26 Aug 2001, President Hugo Chavez insisted that the
epidemic was under control and didn't merit a state of emergency, as had
been requested by the Venezuelan Medical Association.
Alfredo Pena, Mayor of greater Caracas, has declared a local emergency in
the capital, where nearly 4800 cases have been reported, including 1061
type-3 cases. Fumigation trucks patrol the streets, and officials are
urging residents to eliminate pools of stagnant water where mosquitos breed.

Nicaragua Update

MANAGUA: The government has sent medical teams to combat an outbreak of

in the Autonomous North Atlantic Region (Caribbean Sea) of the country,
which is located 300 kilometers to the northeast of Managua. The Ministry

Costa Rica Update
-----------------
The seasonal rains have been ideal for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the
vector of dengue fever, and [as a consequence there have been 8 persons in
Guanacaste afflicted by dengue hemorrhagic fever. Rogelio Pardo, Minister
of Health, reported that only 3 [of the cases of DHF remain in the Enrique
Baltodano hospital in Liberia, where they are now recuperating. But the
fight is not only concentrated on the cases [of DHF admitted to the
hospital but [also to diminish the cases of classical dengue in the
provinces of Guanacaste, Limon, and Puntarenas.
During July and August, in the Chorotega region of Guanacaste an average of
320 cases of dengue fever were diagnosed per week, but in the last 4 days
this has fallen to 185. Projections are for 5500 cases [of dengue fever
for the year 2001.
In Puntarenas there were 80 cases reported per week during the months of
July and August; now there are 44.
As part of the effort to contain the advance of dengue fever, the Costa
Rican Social Security Institute (CCSS) has invested an additional sum of 72
million Costa Rican colones (approximately US $216 000) in the province of
Guanacaste. The objective is to increase the [number of primary health
care personnel and to educate the residents of the cantons [districts.
When the mosquito vector of dengue fever returned to the country in 1993,
after an absence of 50 years, the number of cases of classical dengue fever
approached 14 000. For this year, the projections of the Ministry of Health
oscillate between 5500 and 6000. In the year 2000, there were 4908 cases of
dengue reported and the highest peak [of reported cases of dengue fever
was in 1997, with 14 421 cases.

Philippines Update
-------------------
At least 800 dengue fever cases have been recorded in the province by
August, provincial health officials said. Provincial health office records
showed that the number of people afflicted with dengue fever this year has
tripled compared to last year's figures. The fifth dengue fatality recorded
in Pangasinan this year was a 5-month-old baby girl from Bolinao town.
Governor Victor Agbayani ordered the 14 public hospitals in the province to
treat dengue patients without charge and provide them with medicines.
Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit warned on Wednesday that cases of dengue
fever could continue to rise and cause another epidemic if prevention and
control measures are not sustained. The warning came as health experts
disclosed that the number of dengue cases is expected to peak this month or
in October. "Dengue cases will continue to rise but prompt referral and
proper case management will decrease the number of deaths," Dayrit told
reporters. Dayrit urged local government officials to assist her department
in identifying hot spots and high-risk areas, creating dengue watch at the
village level and in intensifying information dissemination on mosquito
control.

Bangladesh Update
-----------------
BANGLADESH: At least 8 people have died of dengue fever in the country and
about 573 have been afflicted by the disease as of 7 Sep 2001, according to
official sources here on Friday. Unofficial sources, however, believe that
the actual number of dengue cases so far is much higher. In the capital,
many dengue patients are rushing to different hospitals and clinics
everyday. Experts believe that this year's dengue outbreak may be less
serious than that of the last year. Unlike the situation in the previous
year, the physicians as well as the people are now aware of the disease.
More is known about its identification and case management. Last year, 93
persons reportedly died of dengue and a total of 5551 persons were attacked
by the disease.
Some 15 000 people have been infected with dengue fever in the Bangladeshi
capital Dhaka and its surroundings, one year after the disease killed 70 in
the country, hospital and media reports said on Tuesday. Only 2 people are
known to have died from the disease this year in Dhaka, but about 4 times
as many people have contracted dengue fever compared with last year.
Doctors said the disease has spread because of an ongoing dry spell
following last week's heavy monsoon rains, conditions that help the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes which carry the virus to breed quickly.

Singapore Update
----------------
SINGAPORE: Cases of the sometimes fatal mosquito-borne disease dengue fever
have surged in Singapore, a news report said Thursday. A total of 953 new
dengue cases were reported from July through August, up sharply from the
892 cases in the first 6 months of this year, The Straits Times newspaper
reported. Singapore has a population of about 4 million.
Officials at Singapore's Environment Ministry, which tracks dengue cases,
would not immediately comment on the report. A 28-year-old woman died from
dengue in Singapore in August, the only death from the disease reported
this year, the newspaper said. Dengue has remained a problem in Singapore
despite spraying, public education campaigns and increased fines for those
found with mosquitoes breeding on their property. Controlling the insects
is difficult in Singapore, a tropical island which is regularly drenched by
monsoon rains.
