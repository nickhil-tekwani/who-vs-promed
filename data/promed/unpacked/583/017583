As Southern Sudan heads towards a [9 Jan 2011] referendum on
secession, it is battling to contain its biggest kala azar outbreak in
8 years. The severity of this outbreak is just one symptom of the
wider medical humanitarian crisis facing the region, warns the
international emergency aid agency, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF),
which includes an abysmal lack of healthcare, chronic malnutrition,
regular outbreaks of preventable diseases, and insecurity that
displaces communities and destroys lives.

Kala azar, or visceral leishmaniasis, is a neglected tropical disease
contracted through the bite of a parasite-carrying sandfly, and is
endemic in Southern Sudan. Symptoms include an enlarged spleen, fever,
weakness, and wasting. It thrives in poor, remote, and unstable areas
with extremely limited healthcare.

"With kala azar, it's always a race against time to save lives. Yet
the race is too often lost before it ever begins, as three-quarters of
people are unable to access even basic medical care and the weak
health system cannot cope with such emergencies," says MSF medical
coordinator Elin Jones. "This epidemic then further compounds the
already dire medical humanitarian situation facing the population."

If untreated, kala azar is fatal in almost 100 percent of cases within
1 to 4 months, but timely treatment can mean a success rate of up to
95 percent. By the end of November 2010, MSF had treated 2355 people
for the disease in Upper Nile, Unity, and Jonglei states -- 8 times
more than for the same period in the previous year.

This outbreak was further exacerbated by the reality that peoples'
immune systems were already weakened by increased levels of
malnutrition this year [2010]. In the 1st 10 months of 2010, MSF
admitted 13 800 patients with severe malnutrition to its clinics, a 20
percent increase in numbers treated compared to the same time in 2009
and a 50 percent increase compared to all 2008.

On top of this, tens of thousands of Southerners are returning from
Northern Sudan and further abroad in advance of the upcoming January
[2011] referendum, and will thus be exposed to diseases endemic in the
South, such as malaria, measles, meningitis, tuberculosis. Their
presence will put enormous additional strain on already limited
resources, including food, water, and healthcare provision.

In addition, insecurity remains an ever-present reality in southern
Sudan. Throughout 2010, it is reported that over 900 people were
killed and 215 000 people displaced, due to inter-tribal violence,
rebel groups like the LRA [Lord's Resistance Army], and new militias.

"As the world focuses on the politics of the approaching referendum,
it must not lose sight of the people, who are plunging from one
emergency to the next," says Rob Mulder, MSF Head of Mission in
Southern Sudan. "Southern Sudan remains mired in a humanitarian
crisis, and as a viable health system will still take years to fully
build, peoples' immediate needs for food, shelter, and healthcare must
be better met. This will require a sustained and robust emergency
response from the government and international community."

MSF has been providing emergency medical humanitarian assistance in
Sudan since 1979. Currently MSF runs 27 projects across 13 states of
the country, providing a range of services, including primary and
secondary healthcare, responding to emergencies as they arise,
nutritional support, reproductive health care, kala azar treatment,
counseling services, surgery, paediatric and obstetric care.

[Visceral leishmaniasis is endemic in Southern Sudan and is
increasing. An 8-fold increase in the number of treated people is
alarming and as pointed out, the infection is fatal in most cases
without treatment.

As clearly underlined, visceral leishmaniasis is linked to
malnutrition and malnutrition is also highly prevalent in the region.
Furthermore health care is almost non-existent, with the only
providers being relief organizations like the MSF.
