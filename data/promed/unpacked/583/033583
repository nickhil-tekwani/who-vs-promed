[The etiology of the illnesses is not stated. Knowing the incubation period between the meal and onset of symptoms and whether vomiting or diarrhea was the prominent symptom or both and whether fever was present can help with the diagnosis.

"Bulgur, also called riffoth or burghul, is a cereal food made from the cracked parboiled groats (whole grains) of several different wheat species, most often from durum wheat. It originates in West Asian cuisine" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgur). "Ayran also called doogh, dhallë, daw or tan, is a cold savory yogurt-based beverage of Turkic origin" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayran). It is not clear which of these vehicles was responsible.

Nevruz or Nowruz is the Persian-language term for the day of the Iranian New Year.

Melikgazi is a metropolitan district of Kayseri Province. - Mod.LL
