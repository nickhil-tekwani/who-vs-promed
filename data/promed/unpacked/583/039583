It's 2018, and black lung disease is on the rise in Appalachia. Researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) looked at 3 federally funded clinics between 2013 and 2017 and documented the largest cluster of advanced black lung disease -- ever. In that time period, the clinics treated 416 coal miners primarily from Virginia and Kentucky with complicated black lung, the most advanced stage of the disease.

Not only are coal miners experiencing an uptick in the most fatal form of black lung, they're also being diagnosed at a younger age. "There's an unacceptably large number of younger miners who have end-stage disease," lead researcher David J Blackley told the New York Times. "The only choice is to get a lung transplant or wait it out and die."

This new study follows a 2016 NPR [National Public Radio] investigation revealing that the number of cases of black lung in central Appalachia was likely much higher than NIOSH's official count. The disease declined throughout the 1990s, but now the clinics' black lung specialist says that within 2 weeks, he's seeing the same number of cases he used to see in an entire year.

Why? After exhausting thicker seams, today's miners have to dig more deeply into rock to unearth coal. The combination of coal dust and silica dust from cutting into rock is a deadlier concoction than what plagued miners in the past.

Federal investigators this month [February 2018] identified the largest cluster of advanced black lung cases ever officially recorded. More than 400 coal miners frequenting 3 clinics in south western Virginia between 2013 and 2017 were found to have complicated black lung disease, an extreme form characterized by dense masses of scar tissue in the lungs.

The cluster, identified following an investigation by National Public Radio [NPR], adds to a growing body of evidence that a new black lung epidemic is emerging in central Appalachia, even as the Trump administration begins to review Obama-era coal dust limits. The severity of the disease among miners at the Virginia clinics "knocked us back on our heels," said David J Blackley, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, who led the research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It was equally troubling, he said, that nearly a quarter of the miners with complicated black lung disease had been on the job fewer than 20 years. Across the coal belt in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia, "there's an unacceptably large number of younger miners who have end-stage disease and the only choice is to get a lung transplant or wait it out and die," Dr Blackley said.

Scientists have linked the new wave of lung disease to miners breathing in more silica dust, the likely result of a decades-long shift toward mining thinner coal seams that require cutting into the surrounding rock. Silica dust from pulverized rock can damage lungs faster than coal dust alone. Modern machinery, insufficient training for workers, and longer work hours may also contribute to increased dust exposure, experts say.

Black lung, a chronic disease caused by breathing in coal mine dust, declined precipitously between the early 1970s and late 1990s, following new health and safety rules put in place by the 1969 Coal Act. The legislation for the 1st time established airborne dust limits in coal mines and set up a health monitoring program for working miners, offering free chest x-rays every 5 years. But by 2000, black lung was on the rise again. An advanced form of the disease, rarely seen in the mid-1990s, made an especially dramatic comeback.

Data represent a 5-year moving average among underground miners with at least 25 years on the job who participate in the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program. The upward trend in severe black lung disease has been clear for some time, but "what we're really learning now is the magnitude of the problem," said Carl Werntz, an associate professor of occupational medicine at West Virginia University, who treats miners in Morgantown.

In addition to the Virginia cluster, Dr Blackley's team previously found 60 miners with complicated black lung at a single clinic in eastern Kentucky. Overall, investigators have confirmed nearly 500 cases in just 4 clinics over the past 4 years. NPR, which began a wider survey of clinics in 2016, has unofficially recorded nearly 2000 cases over a similar time period.

Those figures are far higher than the federal government's voluntary screening program for working miners, which recorded fewer than 100 cases of complicated black lung disease nationwide between 2011 and 2016. Researchers note the true extent of black lung disease among current and former coal miners remains unclear.

New rules for coal dust under review
To combat black lung disease, the Obama administration in 2014 issued a new coal dust rule. It lowered dust exposure limits for the 1st time in 4 decades, increased sampling frequency and required the use of real-time personal dust monitoring devices. The rule was challenged by coal industry groups as costly and overly burdensome. A federal appeals court upheld it in 2016.

Last December [2017], the Trump administration announced a retrospective review of the 4 year old regulation as part of a broader rule-cutting agenda, a move that alarmed mine safety advocates and medical experts. "In light of these trends showing more debilitating disease, we need more protection, not less," said Judith Graber, an assistant professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health.

A Mine Safety and Health Administration spokesperson said the agency's review was required and "will be used to determine if the 2014 rule is achieving its desired result." David Zatezalo, a former miner and coal industry executive who now leads the agency, told Congress on [Tue 6 Feb 2018] he has no current plans to roll back the updated dust limits.

Phil Smith, director of communications and governmental affairs for the United Mine Workers of America, said if the rule isn't working, "then we need to beef it up even more."

[The combination of these 2 articles yields different information for a more complete picture of this horrible situation. The 2nd article, from the New York Times includes remarkable and sad tragic pictures of what lungs look like as well as graph of the fluctuation of cases over the years.

Coal worker's pneumoconiosis (CWP; also known as black lung because of the black dust of the coal) is a lung disease that results from breathing in dust from coal, graphite, or man-made carbon over a long period of time. The risk of getting coal worker's pneumoconiosis depends on how long the worker has been around coal dust. Most people with this disease are older than 50. Smoking does not increase your risk of developing this disease, but it may have an additional harmful effect on the lungs. Primary symptoms are shortness of breath and coughing.

There is no specific treatment for this disorder. Further exposure to the dust should be avoided. The outcome for the simple form is usually good. It rarely causes disability or death. The complicated form may cause shortness of breath that gets progressively worse. While smoking may not affect the disease, it may affect the condition of the lungs and worsen the breathing. Therefore, smoking with this condition is strongly discouraged.

Workers should wear a protective mask when working around coal, graphite, or man-made carbon. Companies should enforce the maximum permitted dust levels. All workers should avoid smoking.

Coal mine dust isn't uniform; it's a jumble of substances and particle sizes, which vary in their effects on the lungs. [11: see URL below for details of references] Larger "thoracic" particles settle in the bronchi, the main air passages to the lungs. [12] The presence of coal mine dust in the bronchi stimulates the production of mucus, Petsonk explains, so that people can more easily cough up the offending particles. It's an efficient system, but prolonged inhalation of the dust can lead to chronic bronchitis in miners. "Coal dust particles are very reactive, including the chemical bonds on the surface," Petsonk explains. "They will interact with anything nearby, including the body's tissue, which creates an inflammatory response."

It's the smaller respirable dust particles, though, that create the damage most associated with CWP. Because of their small size -- often 2.5 microns or less in diameter -- they can easily travel beyond the bronchi, into the bronchioles and alveoli. Any small particle this deep in the lungs, whether from cigarette smoke, car exhaust, or coal mine dust, can create irritation in the site where it lands. [13] The body's immune system attacks the particles, creating inflammation in the surrounding region. Although this inflammation can help kill invading pathogens, it can't remove components of coal mine dust such as coal and silica, which remain in place and cause lung tissue damage. The body then doubles down on its efforts, which further damages the delicate lung tissue. The result is chronic inflammation that ultimately scars the lungs, creating patches that radiologists can see on X rays and CT scans. [14]

Workers with CWP show symptoms which include chronic cough, increased phlegm production, and shortness of breath. CWP sufferers also are at increased risk of emphysema, [16] which is an important cause of morbidity among miners. [17] In addition, the lungs frequently develop progressive massive fibrosis (PMF).

As for why the increase in CWP is most striking in central Appalachia, the content of the coal itself might play a role, says Andrea Harrington, a postdoctoral research scientist at New York University School of Medicine. The coal mined in this region has an unusually high concentration of pyrite, an iron compound commonly known as fool's gold. [33] The iron in pyrite is fairly chemically reactive, stripping electrons from water molecules and creating reactive oxygen species in the form of hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide, and/or singlet oxygen.
