[Now that the West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to CDC
through ArboNET are appearing weekly in MMWR (see part 7 below),
ProMED-mail will no longer provide abstracted information from the USGS
West Nile virus maps. A summary map of the current situation is reproduced
in MMWR, and the more detailed USGS maps, down to county level in some
categories, can be accessed as follows by anyone requiring such detailed
information:

The following updates include confirmation of the first human case in 2003
(in South Carolina), and 3 human cases of uncertain status in Texas. Only
extensions of West Nile virus geographic range or host species, and
exceptional items, will be posted separately from now on. - Mod.CP]

Texas: Blood Donation Tests West Nile Virus-Positive
---------------------------------------------------
Testing the nation's blood supply for West Nile virus began just days ago
and already has uncovered the first infected donation -- in Texas --
letting health workers stop the blood from reaching any patients, the Food
and Drug Administration said on Thu 3 Jul 2003.
The donor was a 46-year-old woman in Harris County, Texas, who was allowed
to give blood because she displayed no West Nile fever symptoms, the FDA
said. While confirmatory testing is still under way, the discovery does
signal that "blood is much safer than last year," said Hira Nakhasi, FDA's
chief of transfusion-spread diseases.
West Nile virus is spread mostly by infected mosquitoes, but about 13 of
2002's record 4000 West Nile cases are believed to have been caused by a
blood transfusion. In 2002, the only way to guard the blood supply was to
turn away potential donors with telltale flu-like symptoms. But while West
Nile can kill (it's especially risky for the elderly) the majority of
people infected have such a mild case they don't experience symptoms.
So blood specialists raced to adapt a technology that detects low levels of
other viruses in blood, called nucleic acid testing or NAT, hoping it could
find West Nile virus, too. On Tue 1 Jul 2003, blood banks began using
experimental West Nile NAT tests made by 2 competitors, Roche Molecular
Diagnostics and Chiron Corp., to screen all donations before they're
shipped to hospitals. On Thursday, Roche reported the first positive test
result.
So far this year no human case of West Nile virus infection has been
detected, but the virus has been found in mosquitoes and animals in 28
states. Health officials urge that people wear insect repellent while
outdoors and regularly dump water in containers, where mosquitoes breed.

[It is not clear from the report when this blood donation was given. As of
4 Jul 2003, no human case of West Nile virus has been confirmed this year
in Texas or elsewhere, consequently it would be unexpected at this time to
detect virus in a fresh blood donation. The PCR NAT test may be detecting a
cross-reacting flavivirus nucleic acid or perhaps a non-infectious West
Nile-virus nucleic acid.
Since this comment was prepared, 3 cases of West Nile virus infection have
been reported in Texas (see below), and one confirmed in South Carolina -

Texas: Harris County(Houston)- West Nile Virus Update
--------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 3 Jul 2003, Harris County has recorded 20 West Nile
virus-positive dead birds, 2 West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools
(_Culex quinquefasciatus_) and 23 suspected West Nile virus-positive
mosquito pools (the same species). [Data supplied by Dr. Ray Parsons,

South Carolina: First Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection in 2003 Confirmed
---------------------------------------------------
An Oconee County man has been confirmed as the first human case of West
Nile virus in the United States this year, state and federal health
officials said on Mon 7 Jul 2003.
The man was described as older than 65 years and otherwise healthy. He was
released from the hospital in June 2003 and has been improving, said C.
Earl Hunter, commissioner of the South Carolina Department of Health and
Environmental Control. The man reported being bitten by mosquitoes while he
was out fishing.
"The West Nile virus seems to be here to stay in South Carolina, so the
best way to avoid the disease is to reduce exposure to and eliminate
breeding grounds for mosquitoes," Hunter said in a news release.
It is the first case of the disease in a human in the United States [in
2003], said Karen Hunter of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta. In the United States last year, there were 4156 total cases of
the virus and 284 deaths caused by the disease, according to CDC statistics.
"Last season's West Nile virus outbreak was basically unprecedented for an
arboviral infection in the United States in recent memory," Dr. Stephen
Ostroff, deputy director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases,
said last month in a teleconference. "And whether or not this season will
be a replay of what happened last year, it's a little too early to tell
that," Ostroff said.
In South Carolina in 2002, there was one case of West Nile in a Union
County woman. However, the origin of her virus was uncertain because she
had traveled, said DHEC spokeswoman Clair Boatwright. Not everyone who is
exposed to the virus becomes ill. "This is the first case where someone
felt badly enough to be hospitalized," Boatwright said of the most recent case.

South Dakota; West Nile Virus Infection Detected in Birds, a Dog and Horses
---------------------------------------------------
The year's first confirmation of West Nile virus in birds involves a blue
jay in Estelline and a crow in Sioux Falls, the state Health Department
said on Mon 6 Jul 2003.
West Nile antibodies were found earlier in several horses. A dog in Clark
County also has been found to be infected, the Health Department said.
No human cases have been confirmed yet. South Dakota had 37 confirmed human
cases last year.

South Dakota: West Nile Virus Detected in 5 Horses
---------------------------------------------------
The state's new horse surveillance program has uncovered signs of West Nile
virus in 5 horses in the past 3 weeks, confirming that the disease has come
out of hibernation across South Dakota. State officials had expected that
the disease would re-emerge and said that the findings do not indicate a
new or elevated threat. No horses or humans have become sick from the
disease yet this year. "It's just an indication that West Nile virus is
probably circulating out there," said state veterinarian Sam Holland. "It's
time for people to strongly consider all the mosquito-control measures
we've been recommending," said state epidemiologist Lon Kightlinger.
In early May, officials found antibodies against West Nile virus in 6
horses in Roberts, Moody and Lincoln counties in eastern South Dakota. The
latest test found antibodies in horses in Stanley and Hughes counties in
central South Dakota and Fall River County in the southwest.
Last year, every county in the state reported West Nile illness in horses.
At least 37 humans were infected; 14 became seriously ill, but none
died.South Dakota began the horse surveillance program this year in hopes
that horses would be a simpler and more sensitive indicator of human
risk.Horses, like humans, are not a common host of West Nile virus. When
the virus appears in horses, that could signal humans to watch out.
More than 100 cedar waxwings, a species of fruit-eating birds, have been
found dead recently throughout eastern South Dakota. But none of them have
tested positive for West Nile, according to health officials. There is
evidence that an unknown toxin killed the birds, said Bill Antonides, a
conservation officer for the state Department of Game, Fish and Parks.
Officials said horses are more effective sentinels for West Nile virus than
birds. Dead birds commonly lie on the ground for long stretches, making
testing impossible.

Texas: Human Case Diagnosed in Montgomery County; Third in Texas
--------------------------------------------------
Another human case of the West Nile virus has been found -- this time in
Montgomery County. 2 people in northwest Houston were diagnosed with the
virus late last week. Health officials say the latest victim lives in the
Porter area. Montgomery County health officials haven't released a lot of
information about the West Nile case, citing patient privacy issues.
Folks in Montgomery County say they're concerned but aren't going to let
fear rule their lives. Recent rains have left plenty of standing water in
the area, creating breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that carry the
virus. Mosquito control in Montgomery County is spraying 5 nights a week to
stop the spread.
[It is not clear whether these are suspected or confirmed diagnoses. They
do not appear in the MMWR West Nile virus surveillance report which
follows. - Mod.CP]

United States: West Nile Virus Activity, Tue 1 to Wed 9 Jul 2003
--------------------------------------------------
This report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to
CDC through ArboNET as of Fri 9 Jul 2003. During the reporting week of Thu
3 Jul to Wed 9 Jul 2003, the first verified human case of WNV
meningoencephalitis in 2003 was reported from South Carolina in a man aged
70 years. The date of onset of illness was Thu 29 May 2003.
During 2003, in addition to the one human case of WNV meningoencephalitis,
130 corvids (crows and related species) and 63 other dead birds with WNV
infection were reported from 28 states; 22 WNV infections were reported in
horses from Texas (n = 4), Minnesota (n = 3), Oklahoma (n = 3),Wyoming (n =
3), Kentucky (n = 2), Wisconsin (n = 2), Alabama (n =one), Arkansas (n =
one), Georgia (n = one), Missouri (n = one), and North Dakota (n = one).
One canine infection was reported from South Dakota. WNV sero-conversions
were reported in 55 sentinel chicken flocks from Florida and North
Carolina. South Dakota reported 9 sero-positive sentinel horses. 53
WNV-positive mosquito pools were reported from 8 states (Colorado, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, New Jersey, and Texas).
