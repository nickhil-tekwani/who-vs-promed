Cassava threatened by witches' broom disease
--------------------------------------------
Cambodia's cassava crop is under serious threat if a disease that has been spreading in the country since last year [2013] is not brought under control soon, agricultural experts said.

Witches' broom disease looks set to aggressively spread unless farmers take action soon. The Colombia-based International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) will host "urgent meetings" to raise awareness among government officials and farmers in an effort to stamp out the disease before it causes significant damage to the industry.

"In Cambodia, the destructive cassava witches' broom spells disaster for farmers," said Kris Wyckhuys, CIAT. Cassava is one of Cambodia's most important agricultural products.

[A] local agronomist said that after being first detected in the region in Thailand several years ago, the disease then spread to Viet Nam and more recently to Cambodia. "[The] outbreak will continue if farmers [are] still using the [same] planting material. The main problem is Cambodia always imports the planting material from Viet Nam, which make[s] the disease spread so fast."

[Two phytoplasmas have been reported to be associated with witches' broom disease of cassava (CWBD) in different areas: in Southeast Asia, cassava witches' broom phytoplasma (synonym cassava phyllody phytoplasma; _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris group 16SrI); and in Brazil a phytoplasma of the 16SrIII (X-disease) group, which also contains the cassava frogskin pathogen from the southern Americas (see ProMED-mail post 20071130.3864).

Symptoms may include excessive proliferation of branches ('witches' brooms'), small leaves, shortened internodes, purple discolouration of 'brooms', stunting, and loss of plant vigour. Characteristically, shoot distortion or leaf chlorosis are not normally observed. Tubers are reduced in size with rough textured skin and brown streaks in the flesh. The disease can seriously affect starch content of tubers. Total crop losses have been reported as well as up to 30 percent reduction in starch content of harvestable roots. CWBD also leads to loss of planting material. Disease development is favoured by moderate temperatures, symptoms become less obvious or even disappear at higher temperatures.

CWBD is mainly spread by vegetative propagation of the crop and mechanical transmission (for example with agricultural tools) has also been reported. No insect vectors have been identified so far, but research on CWBD epidemiology is continuing. Disease management relies on the use of certified clean planting material. Thermotherapy followed by meristem tip culture may be used to obtain phytoplasma-free tissue culture lines for propagation.
