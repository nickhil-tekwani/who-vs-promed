A woman carrying the West Nile virus was diagnosed in Nice on 20 Oct 2017. The case is not serious. The person is now cured. This is the 1st human case reported in France since 2015 said the ARS (Regional Health Agency).

The woman from Nice [Alpes-Maritimes department, Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur region] had symptoms resembling a flu and underwent blood tests that confirmed this case. Other human cases were diagnosed in Europe between 28 Sep and 5 Oct 2017.

"This person is now cured and in good health" (ARS News Release). The virus had not reappeared in the region since 2003, when 7 people were detected carrying the virus. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, who become infected by feeding on birds. Humans and horses can become infected. West Nile virus was first detected in 1937 in West Africa, precisely in Uganda. Since then, it appeared massively in North America (USA and Canada) in 1999, then in 2000 in the Camargue region, where many horses were infected.

ARS statement
-------------
"The Regional Health Agency Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur informs that a person carrying the West Nile virus was diagnosed on [20 Oct 2017] in the Nice, Alpes-Maritimes department. This person is now cured and in good health. This 1st human case reported in France since 2015 is evidence of a circulation of West-Nile virus. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, between 28 Sep and 5 Oct 2017, several cases humans have been reported in Europe: 9 in Romania, 4 in Italy, 2 in Hungary, and 1 in Greece.

This possibility of viral circulation requires taking several measures, namely:
- establishment, as a precaution, of temporary control measures and restrictions for the collection of blood products and organ harvesting of residents of the Alpes-Maritimes;
- a search for other cases around health facilities in the Alpes-Maritimes with a hospital emergency service and the laboratory of the University Hospital of Nice.

West Nile fever, also known as "West Nile virus disease", is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes (mainly _Culex_) that become infected by feeding exclusively on infected birds. Horses are "accidental hosts", which can not in turn transmit the virus, unlike other flaviviruses (yellow fever, dengue fever, or Zika in particular). In most cases, human infection with West Nile virus does not produce any symptoms. In some cases, it manifests as a flu-like syndrome (fever, pain, headache) and more rarely, it can cause neurological complications.

The circulation of West Nile virus is currently monitored in France by a triple system: human, equine, and avian. This surveillance network was set up in the Camargue in 2001, and then extended to the departments around the Mediterranean in 2004.

The inhabitants of the Alpes-Maritimes are called to protect themselves against mosquito bites. To avoid mosquito bites it is advisable to use: the electric diffusers inside the houses, insecticide coils only outdoors, a mosquito repellent, recommended by your pharmacist, on uncovered areas of skin.

[With increasing distribution of the WNV vector, there has been a rise in the number of reported WNV cases from Europe. This mandates continued surveillance efforts in animals and humans. - Mod.UBA]
