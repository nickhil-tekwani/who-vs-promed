Cases of measles, a disease that has affected hundreds of people in
neighbouring Angola, have now reached 15 in Namibia. Acting
Chairperson of the National Health Emergency Committee (NHEC), Dr
Rheinhardt Collin Gariseb, told New Era 3 more cases were confirmed
positive yesterday morning [Tue 1 Sep 2009], bringing the total number
of positive cases to 15 by yesterday from 12 on Friday [28 Aug 2009].

Despite the increasing numbers of people testing positive for measles,
Dr Gariseb gave assurances that all necessary measures were in place
to minimise the spread of the disease, especially among children under
the age of 5. He could not provide the number of those admitted to
Engela hospital.

The disease is reported to have spread from Angola, where by last week
there were 99 cases of measles diagnosed in the districts of Kwanhama,
Cahama and Coroca in southern Cunene province of Angola. The health
sector is said to be holding awareness campaigns to inform communities
about symptoms and care to better prevent the disease.

Ohangwena Regional Health Director Kaino Pohamba told New Era on
Monday [31 Aug 2009] that Namibia and Angola were involved in
cross-border talks on how to prevent and respond effectively to measles.

Symptoms of measles are high temperature, skin eruptions, pimples,
conjunctivitis, sore eyes, cough and flu [fever]. The Ministry of
Health and Social Services yesterday [1 Sep 2009] appealed to
guardians to take their children to health centres for vaccination
against the disease.

The health department has urged the public and medical practitioners
to be aware of measles symptoms and for parents to get their children
vaccinated after a reported outbreak in Gauteng. Fidel Hadebe,
spokesperson for the health department, said there was a possibility
that the disease could spread to other provinces, as over 131 cases
had been reported by 30 Aug 2009. About 109 cases were from Gauteng,
with 97 of these from the Tshwane (Pretoria) health district. Random
cases have been reported in other parts of the country, including
Mpumalanga with 8 cases. The Western Cape recorded 5, while 3 were
reported in the Eastern Cape. The North West Province and Northern
Cape both recorded one case each. Some suspected cases were yet to be
confirmed in Limpopo.

Measles is an infectious disease that is spread through contact with
the nose and throat discharges of an infected person and is mostly
spread when an infected person sneezes or coughs. An infected person
can infect others for several days before and after developing
symptoms. It is known to spread faster in areas where infants and
children gather, such as schools, day care centres and health care
facilities.

According to the World Health Organisation, measles remains a leading
cause of death among young children, although a safe and
cost-effective vaccine is available to prevent the disease. In 2007,
about 197 000 measles deaths were recorded globally, nearly 540 deaths
every day or 22 deaths hourly.

Hadebe [Health Department spokesperson] called upon the public to work
hand-in-hand with the health department in eradicating the virus. He
said it was unfortunate that some parents still chose not to vaccinate
their children even though the health department had a structured
system to facilitate effective vaccination. "Parents and caregivers of
children are urged to ensure that children have received all their
vaccines for the age of the child by checking their Road to
Health/immunisation cards. If unsure, have these checked at the local
clinic. Two doses of measles vaccine should be administered, at 9 and
18 months of age. Measles immunisations are available free of charge
from all public and municipal health clinics," he said. Medical
practitioners were urged to put surveillance measures in place to
prevent further outbreaks by promptly reporting suspected cases of
measles or German measles [rubella] to their nearest local authority
health department.

In an effort to contain the outbreak, the Tshwane district launched a
mass measles immunisation campaign from 24 Aug to 5 Sep 2009 targeting
all schools. Parents should bring their children even if they had
received their measles vaccines. "School children will be immunised at
school, and therefore parents are asked to complete and return consent
forms obtained from the schools. Parents whose children are not in
school should please take their children to the local clinic or health
facility for immunisation," said Hadebe.

[These are serious outbreaks in southern Africa which appear to be
spreading, as elsewhere, as a consequence of localised resistance to
vaccination and incomplete coverage of the population.
