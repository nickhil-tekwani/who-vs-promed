We would like to expand the discussion in ProMED related to suboptimal vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for the 2010-11 season recently published by Ohmit et al in Clinical Infectious Diseases [1]. Commentary in the above ProMED-mail posting suggests that the Ohmit VE estimate of 31 percent (95 percent CI -7 to 55 percent) for 2010-11 is substantially lower than that reported by other established VE networks for that season, cited instead as closer to 60 percent.

In fact, an earlier publication in Clinical Infectious Diseases also highlighted dramatically suboptimal VE for the 2010-11 season [2]. In Canada, the sentinel surveillance system reported an overall adjusted VE against medically-attended laboratory-confirmed influenza of 37 percent (95 percent CI 17-52 percent) for 2010-11 [2]. This estimate was driven by predominant circulation of influenza A/H3N2 subtype virus and the participation of adults 20-49 years in whom VE against the dominant circulating H3N2 variant was just 39 percent (95 percent CI 0-63) [2].

Earlier studies have raised the hypothesis that previous influenza vaccination may affect current vaccine protection [3,4]. The evidence presented by Ohmit to support this hypothesis is interesting but weak given their limited sample size available for stratified analysis. In their Tables 2 and 3, the number of cases available for stratified VE analysis by prior immunization status is small, especially among those vaccinated in 2010-11 but not in 2009-10 (just 12 cases overall), and even smaller when further stratified by age and subtype [1]. This small number of cases results in unstable estimates and very wide and overlapping confidence intervals that preclude robust conclusions about the effects of prior immunization on current VE.

Contrary to commentary in the ProMED posting, vaccinated participants in other studies based on sentinel schemes have also typically been repeatedly immunized: in the Canadian publication we highlighted that over 70 percent of the vaccinated participants in 2010-11 had been previously immunized in both 2008-09 and 2009-10 [2], a high proportion of repeat immunization similar to that noted in other seasons and by Ohmit et al [1]. However, as in the Ohmit paper, sample size available for stratified analysis has been small. Caution should, therefore, be applied until additional studies adequately powered to assess the influence of prior immunization on current VE become available.

In our 2010-11 publication, we highlighted concerns about suboptimal VE despite reports of vaccine match to circulating strains based on conventional haemagglutination inhibition characterization [2]. However, we also highlighted genetic evidence for mutation in antigenic sites of the haemagglutinin surface protein of the dominant circulating H3N2 strain [2], reporting 8 amino acid substitutions relative to the 2010-11 WHO-recommended vaccine strain (A/Perth/16/2009-like) [5]. We furthermore highlighted that the egg adapted vaccine strain actually used by manufacturers that season (A/Victoria/210/2009(NYMC X-187) itself showed 4 further amino acid mutations in the haemagglutinin relative to the WHO-recommended strain, rendering the vaccine even more divergent (just 90.8 percent identical) relative to the dominant circulating H3N2 virus that season (i.e. 12 versus 8 amino acid substitutions in antigenic sites) [1].

These fuller observations from the 2010-11 season should not be overlooked in trying to understand suboptimal VE. It is noteworthy that each of these concerns has again been echoed during the recent 2012-13 season including suboptimal VE under 50 percent for the H3N2 component [6-8], as well as mutations in circulating viruses [6], changes in the egg passaged vaccine strain (IVR-165) relative to WHO recommendation [5], and the possible effects of prior immunization [6]. Understanding the complex agent, host, and environmental factors, their interactions, and their influences on vaccine performance remains critical, but differentiating their effects and varying contributions from year-to-year will require in-depth and adequately powered immuno-epidemiologic investigation across multiple seasons.

[ProMED-mail apologises to Danuta Skowronski, Naveed Janjua, and Gaston De Serres for the delay in posting these very relevant observations due to an editorial error.

These authors also draw attention to a further error in the original posting, overlooked in the subsequent correction. Namely, the 95 percent confidence interval around the point estimate of VE of 31 percent from the Ohmit publication actually spans -7 percent to 55 percent; in other words, it is non-significant crossing the null. The way the 95 percent confidence interval is currently posted on ProMED, including within the corrected version, the 95 percent CI is reported to span instead +7 percent to 55 percent. ProMED-mail apologises for these additional errors introduced by transcription from an internet message rather than from the printed CIDRAP News text. - Mod.CP]
