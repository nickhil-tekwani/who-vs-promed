CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS & REPEATED GI OUTBREAKS (3)
===================================================
Gastroenteritis and Clostridium perfringens
Regarding Anita Hanrahan's inquiry of 19 January 1996, Clostridium
perfringens is a member of the normal flora of the intestinal tract, with
counts (spores) ranging widely in healthy populations from <1000 to
>1,000,000 per gram. Consequently, a single high count (> 1,000,000 per gram
of feces) on an individual is not meaningful. Hauschild suggested some
years ago that the median (median, not mean) fecal spore count for a group
of individuals suffering gastroenteritis could be diagnostic, in that it was
about 10,000 normally with a large range but rose to >1,000,000 with a
smaller range following illness caused by this organism, and remained
elevated for at least several days. I subsequently had an opportunity to
test and verify that hypothesis during an outbreak among eleven individuals
who had consumed a chicken meat pie that also contained high numbers of the
same serotype (published in Health Laboratory Science some years ago).
The pathogenesis of C. perfringens gastroenteritis, which always
involves type A (strains positive for a lecithinase that is detectable on
McClung-Toabe agar using specific antiserum), follows the ingestion of high
numbers of vegetative cells that upon sporulation in the gut release an
enterotoxin. The symptoms appear within 12-15 hours, and are characteristic
with abdominal distress and diarrhea but little or no vomiting. Immunoassay
methods are now available for detection of the enterotoxin in the feces, and
I recall seeing a paper on the use of such a method to confirm an outbreak
in a chronic care facility. It is possible, I suppose, that another kind of
etiology exists in the elderly and immunocompromised than one involving
food. Dr. McDonough suggests as much in the "new" syndrome he described in
dogs (ProMED 19 January 1996) that involves overgrowth of type A strains in
the upper small bowel precipitated by another unknown factor. It would
appear that in Anita Hanrahan's situation, a test for enterotoxin in the
feces would be very useful; a negative result indicating only normal flora,
whereas a positive result suggesting a pathogenic role for the organism.
Foodborne gastroenteritis caused by C. perfringens has commonly
implicated beef and poultry, especially in stews or gravies that have been
warmed for a second serving. The spores, common in both raw products, that
survive the initial cooking probably germinate and multiply during the slow
cooling of these viscous, fatty products, where the oxygen tension has been
reduced and atmospheric oxygen can not easily diffuse. C. perfringens can
multiply at temperatures of 120 F, consequently, if the heating for the
second serving is not sufficient the high numbers of vegetative cells will
survive and initiate sporulation in the gut with the ensuing symptoms of
gastroenteritis. For some reason, sporulation occurs easily in the
intestine but is difficult to induce in foods and even laboratory media.
