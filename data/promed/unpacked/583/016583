The prevalence of brucellosis in Wyoming's elk herds not utilizing feedgrounds decreased in 2015 according to a recent Wyoming Game and Fish Department report. But, recent testing shows 2 cow elk in the northwest portion of the Bighorn Mountains tested positive for brucellosis recently. This is the 4th year in a row that elk from the Bighorns have tested positive.

"Brucellosis in elk is likely at low levels in the Bighorn Mountains, but it is obviously still a concern to find it there," said Hank Edwards, Game and Fish wildlife disease specialist. "Based on this year's findings, brucellosis doesn't appear to be increasing in these elk herds. That said, additional surveillance is required for us to continue to monitor and understand the prevalence of brucellosis within these elk herds."

Each year Game and Fish monitors the distribution and prevalence of brucellosis within the state's elk herds by working with hunters to collect blood samples from their harvested animals. Hunters who harvest and return blood samples are the core of the brucellosis surveillance program. In 2015, over 10 500 blood collection kits were mailed or directly handed to elk hunters successful in limited quota elk license drawings in the targeted surveillance elk hunt areas. In general, hunters return between 1000 and 1500 blood samples to the Game and Fish Wildlife Health laboratory, of which approximately 60 percent are suitable for testing.

A total of 344 useable samples were collected over the past 4 years of surveillance in the southeastern corner of the state. All samples tested negative for exposure to _Brucella abortus_, the brucellosis bacterium. To date, this disease has not been documented outside of the western half of the state.

Game and Fish has been conducting statewide surveillance for brucellosis since 1991. Hunters' participation on data collection efforts for this surveillance is critical and will continue to be key for monitoring the prevalence of the disease in coming years. More information on brucellosis is available on the Game and Fish website.

[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century. In 2002, collaborative efforts of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the livestock industries, and state animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 states with no known infection.

The only known focus of _B. abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle.

The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock, hence surveillance in elk taking advantage of samples collected by hunters is a wise initiative. - Mod.PMB
