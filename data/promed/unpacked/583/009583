[1] Latest CDC report with "smoking" salami
Date: Tue 26 Jan 2010

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a
multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Montevideo
infections. Investigators are using DNA analysis of the bacteria
obtained through diagnostic testing to identify cases of illness that
may be part of this outbreak.

As of 9:00 pm EST on 25 Jan 2010, a total of 189 individuals infected
with a matching strain of _S._ Montevideo have been reported from 40
states since 1 Jul 2009. The number of ill persons identified in each
state with this strain is as follows: AL (2), AZ (5), CA (30), CO
(3), CT (4), DE (2), FL (2), GA (3), IA (1), ID (2), IL (11), IN (3),
KS (3), LA (1), MA (12), MD (1), ME (1), MI (1), MN (4), MO (1), NC
(9), ND (1), NE (1), NH (1), NJ (7), NY (15), OH (9), OK (1), OR (8),
PA (3), RI (2), SC (1), SD (3), TN (4), TX (7), UT (7), VA (1), WA
(14), WV (1), and WY (2). Because this is a commonly occurring
strain, public health investigators may determine that some of the
illnesses are not part of this outbreak.

Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began
between 4 Jul 2009 and 7 Jan 2010. Infected individuals range in age
from less than 1 year old to 88 years old and the median age is 36
years. 53 percent of patients are male. Among the 134 patients with
available information, 37 (28 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths
have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
A widely distributed contaminated food product might cause illnesses
across the USA. The identity of the contaminated product often is not
readily apparent. In outbreaks like this one, identification of the
contaminated product requires conducting detailed standardized
interviews with persons who were ill. It may also require conducting
interviews with non-ill members of the public ("controls") to get
information about foods recently eaten and other exposures to compare
with information from the ill persons. The investigation is often
supplemented by laboratory testing of suspected products. In
addition, investigators sometimes use purchase information provided
by ill persons to trace suspect products back to the point of
production. This process is labor-intensive and typically takes
weeks. It is not always successful.

During 16-21 Jan 2010, CDC and public health officials in multiple
states conducted an epidemiologic study by comparing foods eaten by
41 ill and 41 well persons. Preliminary analysis of this study has
suggested salami as a possible source of illness. Ill persons (58
percent) were significantly more likely than well persons (16
percent) to report eating salami. Additionally, 13 ill persons have
been identified who purchased the same type of sliced salami variety
pack at different grocery store locations before becoming ill. These
data suggest this product may be the source of some of these
illnesses. This sliced salami variety pack was recently recalled by
Daniele International Inc. On 23 Jan 2010, FSIS issued a notice that
Daniele International Inc. is recalling approximately 1.24 million
pounds of ready-to-eat varieties of Italian sausage products
(including salame/salami) in commerce and potentially available to
customers in retail locations because they may be contaminated with
_Salmonella_.
(<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/News_&_Events/Recall_006_2010_Release/index.asp>).
These products can have an extended shelf life of up to 1 year. The
manufacturer has voluntarily halted production of salami products.

This recall followed isolation of _Salmonella_ in a private
laboratory from a retail sample of a salami product produced by
Daniele International; this product was different than the sliced
salami variety pack purchased at different grocery store locations by
the 13 ill persons. FSIS reviewed and affirmed these private
laboratory results. The strain initially found by the private
laboratory was different from the strains causing the outbreak.
However, the Washington State Department of Health subsequently
tested the bacterial culture provided by the private laboratory (the
salami was not provided) and identified 2 different serotypes, the
strain found by the private lab and _S._ Montevideo indistinguishable
from the outbreak strain. In addition, the Iowa Department of Public
Health and public health officials in Plymouth County, Iowa
investigated a patient with _S._ Montevideo infection
indistinguishable from the outbreak strain and discovered an open
sliced salami variety pack frozen at the patient's home. The patient
had eaten this product before becoming ill. This sliced salami
variety pack was the same as that purchased by 13 other ill persons.
Using DNA analysis, the University of Iowa Hygienic Laboratory
(Iowa's public health laboratory) confirmed that the strain isolated
from this leftover salami was indistinguishable from the outbreak
strain of _S._ Montevideo.

CDC and its public health partners are continuing the epidemiologic
investigation to verify that the outbreak is controlled; to identify
the specific products or ingredients that became contaminated and how
the contamination occurred; and to identify any other food vehicles
that may be involved. It is possible that more than 1 food product
may be causing illnesses. The investigation is ongoing.

[2] "Smoking" pepper

Black pepper used to coat salami is the possible cause of a
salmonellosis outbreak that sickened people in 40 states, the Rhode
Island Department of Health said Thursday [28 Jan 2010].

Tests showed the same strain of _S._ Montevideo that has sickened at
least 189 people since July 2009 was also found in 2 open containers
of pepper at meat company Daniele International Inc.'s facility in
Burrillville, Rhode Island. 37 people have been hospitalized in the
outbreak, according to the CDC.

Annemarie Beardsworth, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island health
department, said officials there are still waiting for results from
closed containers of pepper, which are expected in 2 to 3 days.
"We're pretty sure right now that the ground pepper is the source of
the outbreak, but until we get a positive result that was taken from
a closed container, we can't be 100 percent certain," she said.
