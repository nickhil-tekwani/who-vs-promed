Number of Dengue Fever Cases Increases in Vietnam
-------------------------------------------------
HANOI: The number of cases of dengue fever is rising rapidly in Vietnam as
the disease nears the peak of a 3-4 year cycle, an official said on Tue 14
Aug 2001. As of 8 Aug 2001, a total of 18 674 people have contracted dengue
fever this year, an increase of 51 percent over the same period last year,
the Ministry of Health official said. Of these, 44 people died, 13 more
than last year.
Most of the cases were reported in Vietnam's 19 southern provinces, where
tropical conditions provide an ideal environment for [spread of the
mosquito-borne disease. A second round of an anti-dengue campaign will be
launched later this month, targeting the southern provinces, the official
said.
The practice of people in southern Vietnam of storing rain water in
containers for later use provides a good breeding ground for mosquitoes. In
1999, the government launched a program to fight the disease with an annual
budget of 15 billion dong (1 million dollars). The program has helped
reduce the number of people contracting dengue fever. Nearly 400 people
died from dengue in 1998, the year before the program's launch.

17 Dengue Fever Deaths in Batangas, the Philippines
---------------------------------------------------
BATANGAS CITY: The provincial government is set to declare the province
under a state of [emergency in the face of an upsurge of dengue cases that
has killed 17 people and afflicted [hospitalised? 217 others. Provincial
Health Officer Dr. Isagani Bolompo said 19 towns, including the cities of
Lipa, Tanauan, and Batangas, had been seriously affected by dengue fever.
Bolompo said the number of cases was expected to rise when reports from
public and private hospitals and health centers [have been collated. Most
of those who died were from Lipa and Tanauan. The rest were from Bauan, San
Pascual, and San Jose towns. Other towns affected by the disease are Mataas
na Kahoy, Mabini, Lemery, Rosario, Ibaan, Balayan, Tuy, Nasugbu, Calaca,
Taal, Padre Garcia, Taysan, Lobo, San Juan, and Cuenca.
The incidence of dengue fever has alarmed local health officials since
January. Late last month, the provincial council proposed to place the
whole province under a state of [emergency. The Center for Health
Development of the regional Department of Health said the current situation
has surpassed the 423 dengue cases reported in 1998 and 368 in 1999.
Bolompo has requested PHP 10 million from the provincial government to fund
the Dengue Prevention and Control Program. The provincial government has
PHP 32 million in reserve funds for [emergency assistance.

Total of Dengue Cases in the Philippines approaches 8000
---------------------------------------------------------
MANILA: Dengue fever cases in the Philippines have increased to 7940 so far
this year with 69 reported deaths, official figures show. Most of the cases
belonged to the 1-9 years age group. Deaths were highest among those less
than one year old and those aged over 40. The National Capital Region had
the highest number of cases with 1614, followed by Central Visayas with
1571 and Central Luzon with 1137.
There is no ongoing outbreak now and all previously reported outbreaks have
been contained, Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit stated on Wed 8 Aug 2001,
adding that the elimination of mosquito larvae and mosquito breeding sites
is one of the best strategies in controlling the population of
dengue-carrier mosquitoes.
