Chestnut growers have long battled nut rot, or _Gnomoniopsis smithogilvyi_, [which] wiped out more than 40 per cent of the national crop 2 years ago [2016], costing the industry about AUD 5 million [about USD 3.72 million].

Nut rot is the real nemesis. "[It] is an absolute pain to the industry," [an organic grower] said. "[2016] was an exceptionally bad year, probably the worst we've ever had. This year [2018] there's been patches of it emerging later on. It's not varietal specific, it's site specific. It can be in this valley but not the next. It's very complex and we know [little] about it. When you harvest the nuts they're OK, you send them out and they go rotten really fast. Some farmers have been experimenting for years with various fungicides [and] varieties of _Trichoderma_ on the trees at flowering time or on the ground to out-compete the burrs. What worked one year doesn't work the next."

CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation] has found a fungal fingerprint for the disease, which usually cannot be detected until the nut is opened. Researcher Tanoj Singh said it was the 1st study of its type for chestnuts in Australia and is thought to be an international first. He explained that the detection technology measured levels of chemical compounds, called volatiles. He said 4 biomarker compounds were found to be released by infected chestnut burrs and nuts. Chestnuts Australia said the fungal fingerprint finding was a "great breakthrough" [and] the research would be used to reassess current packaging methods.

[_Gnomoniopsis smithogilvyi_ (Gs; synonym _G. castaneae_) as the cause of nut rot of commercial chestnuts (_Castanea_ spp. and hybrids) was identified recently as a new species. It has been reported as a major cause of chestnut nut rots in Australia and parts of Europe.

The fungus affects the kernels but lives on decaying burrs and branches and may also inhabit asymptomatic flowers, leaves, and stems. Ascospores are suspected to be the primary source of inoculum, including for infection of flowers leading to nut rot symptoms the following year.

Chestnut nut rots due to other fungi, such as _Phomopsis_ species, are also known to occur.

In Australia, chestnut crops have also been reported to be affected by blight caused by the fungus _Cryphonectria parasitica_ (ProMED-mail post 20100915.3350). Illegally imported cuttings have been suspected as a possible source of this and other tree disease incursions in the country.
