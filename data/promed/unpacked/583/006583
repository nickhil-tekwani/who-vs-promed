At least 60 [now 62] Ebola virus cases have been recorded in the latest outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Monday [20 Jul 2020.

So far there are 60 [now 62] cases (56 confirmed, 4 probable), 24 [now 27] deaths, and 17 recoveries from the 11th Ebola virus outbreak in Mbandaka, Equateur province, WHO African Region tweeted.

The WHO office in the Central African country said that a total of 12 959 people have been vaccinated since the start of the drive in early June [2020].

The most affected areas in the northwestern province are Bikoro, Bolomba, Iboko, Mbandaka, and Wangata.

Last week [week of 13 Jul 2020], expressing concern, the UN health agency said it deployed over 70 experts in DR Congo to support it in the fight against the virus.

The WHO and the DR Congo government had declared the country free from the 10th outbreak on 14 May [2020].

Starting in North Kivu on 1 Aug 2018, the epidemic was the 2nd largest outbreak in the world, and particularly challenging as it took place in an active conflict zone. There were 3470 cases, 2287 deaths, and 1171 survivors, according to the WHO.

Ebola sickens 2 more in DRC Equateur outbreak, 62 total, with 27 deaths

Another 2 Ebola infections were confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, both of them in Mbandaka, the provincial capital, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office and its DRC office said on Twitter.

The new cases push the outbreak total to 62 cases, which include 58 confirmed and 4 probable cases. Three more people died from their infections, raising the fatality count to 27.

Yesterday [21 Jul 2020] the WHO's DRC office said 6 suspected patients from one family have agreed to go to the treatment center following intense community advocacy in Ipeko, the hot spot in Mbandaka. 3 confirmed cases have already been reported in the group.

The DRC's latest outbreak, its 11th, is occurring in the same area where an outbreak occurred in 2018. The illness total in the current outbreak recently passed the earlier total. The WHO has said the virus spread is occurring across a broad area of the province, and cases in Mbandaka are a concern, given its travel connections to Kinshasa and neighboring countries. Also, several infected patients were still in the community, raising the risk of further virus spread.

From Helen Branswell 22 Jul 2020 https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell/
#Ebola: +2 cases, in Mbandaka (big city, bad news). 3 deaths.
Totals to date: 62 cases & 27 deaths.
This is already the 12th largest Ebola outbreak ever. West Africa & North Kivu have changed our views on how big outbreaks can get but historically most involve 3-5 dozen cases.]

Ebola infects 3 more in the DRC, lifting cases to 60 [62 cases as of 22 Jul 2020]

At a media briefing today [20 Jul 2020], Mike Ryan, MD, who directs the WHO's health emergencies program, said the outbreak is worrying, given the dispersed nature of the outbreak, which is spread across 21 health areas in 7 health zones. Also, he said 9 people with confirmed infections are still in the community, a factor known to raise the risk of further transmission.

Investigations so far suggest that about 1 in 3 cases are linked to attending funeral, also a known transmission risk. Others have been linked to exposure in healthcare settings and among family members.

Ibrahima Soce Fall, MD, the WHO's assistant director-general for emergency response, said there are teams on the ground and the response is still scaling up, with participation by a range of partners, which is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

[3] Lessons from Ebola prepared countries for SARS-CoV-2
Date: Tue 21 Jul 2020

Ebola prepared these countries for coronavirus -- but now even they are floundering

In Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, the hard-won lessons of a deadly pandemic cannot entirely compensate for poverty and weak health systems.

Health officials who fought Ebola during the world's deadliest outbreak of the disease in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea have resurrected the tools they used during that crisis to stave off the coronavirus. Initially this led to a swift and coordinated response, and these nations have kept the number of infections low compared to many other countries around the world. But coronavirus is presenting additional challenges, and cases are on the rise.

When COVID-19 first appeared in the region in mid to late March [2020], health officials employed the strategies honed during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, including isolating people who test positive for the virus and quarantining those who may have been in contact with it. These actions probably slowed the spread of the virus. The incidence of COVID-19 reported in the 3 West African countries -- between 2 and 5 cases per 10 000 people -- is at least 12 times less than in South Africa, and 22 times lower than the rate in the United States. "We had the experience of Ebola, so the political will was there from the start," explains Mosoka Fallah, the director of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia. But infection rates are rising and for complex reasons. Researchers in these West African nations say that infections are hard to spot owing to asymptomatic cases among the overwhelmingly young population. Another challenge is that the three countries are among the world's poorest, and their health systems lack resources to protect staff and care for people with the disease.

Fallah says that slowing the transmission of the virus has become especially hard as it reaches impoverished communities without running water and electricity. There, people share latrines and wells, and go to markets regularly to purchase food that cannot be stored at home. He says, "my fear is that the coronavirus is beginning to spread from the affluent to the poor, where social distancing is almost impossible."

Following China's lead
----------------------
As the coronavirus spread in January [2020], Fallah met with the Liberian president George Weah to form a coronavirus task force that included many of the same doctors and public health experts that led the Ebola response. The group resurrected the main pillars of outbreak response. This included acquiring coronavirus tests from the World Health Organization (WHO), coordinating teams of people to trace contacts, and communicating health messages to the public. In operation centres in the capitals of the 3 countries, each COVID-19 task force began to meet regularly to adapt responses to the latest situations. Just as they had done during the Ebola outbreak.

Tolbert Nyenswah, the former director of Liberia's public health institute, says the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had helped to teach health officials these methods during the Ebola outbreak. Now based in Baltimore, Maryland, as a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, Nyenswah says he was stunned that the CDC downplayed these essential procedures in its own country. "I was shocked to see the US struggling to understand what contact tracing is, to organize a response, to put in place risk communication," he says.

The coronavirus task forces in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea decided to follow China's lead; they isolate everyone who tests positive -- regardless of symptoms. People who are very sick go to hospitals, while those with no symptoms or mild illness are sent to special facilities until they test negative. Baimba Idriss, a physician at 34 Military Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone, explains that isolating at home is impractical in the country. "A young person might be healthy, but they live with their grandmother, their aunts, their neighbours, and we need to break that chain of transmission -- and also monitor people so that if they have breathing difficulties we can treat them early," he says.

But Idriss says that a growing number of people who test positive refuse to relocate to the isolation facilities -- especially as word gets around that many people never need medical care. And he says some people aren't listening to public health advice to wear a face mask because they aren't sufficiently worried about the disease. "With COVID, people are dying, but it's not nearly as horrific as Ebola," Idriss explains.

Idriss and other doctors and researchers suspect that the virus might be causing milder illness in countries in sub-Saharan Africa compared with other nations, because the populations skew younger. More than 40% of people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea are younger than 15 years old and just 3% are older than age 65, according to World Bank statistics. And although Sierra Leone and Liberia have the same rate of COVID-19 deaths per confirmed cases as the United States -- around 4% -- John Nkengasong, the director of the African CDC based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, says he suspects that many mild and asymptomatic cases are going undetected. Guinea and many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa have case fatality rates below 2%.

Yet as infections climb, the number of people in need of serious medical care has mounted, too. This concerns Idriss because hospitals in Sierra Leone are already running out of beds, basic medicines, disinfectants, and fuel for vehicles to carry severely ill people to hospitals. Issa French, a nurse at Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, says his team lacks protective gear, gloves, and face masks. "We're using what we have left over from Ebola," he says.

Urgent needs
------------
What's more, some healthcare workers say they have not been paid in 2 months, and have stopped coming to work as a result. This problem vexed the Ebola response as well, leading to strikes among healthcare workers. "Since they never paid us what they owed us during Ebola, I've decided not to risk my life again for COVID," says an ambulance driver at Kenema Hospital. A report from the Center for Global Development, a think tank in Washington DC, projects that such problems are likely to grow worse as shutdowns and trade disruptions owing to COVID-19 damage the economies of low-income countries. Current trends suggest that falling economies will translate into a reduction of USD 2 billion in the health budgets of all low-income countries between 2020 and 2024.

[Not only is it unfair practice, but "penny wise pound foolish" as the saying goes, to not pay the healthcare workers. They are the backbone of the response to combat infectious diseases. The poor global economic situation is going to exacerbate this problem just when the healthcare workers are needed most. - Mod.LK
