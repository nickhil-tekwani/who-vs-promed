[1] Finland: grocery loyalty program "look-back" program
Date: Tue 1 Nov 2011

Retailers loath to tell consumers that their individual buying habits
can be linked with loyalty cards. There are those who worry that
"they", meaning the government and the authorities, know all too much
about one in an open and transparent society such as Finland.

While they fret, for instance, over the police patrolman's ability to
effortlessly pull up the previous year's taxable income of a person
caught speeding and liable to pay income-linked day-fines, they may
not be so aware of the similar extensive powers exercised by the
retail trade. The authorities and retailers can find out the contents
of loyal customers' shopping baskets, even if the trip to the store
has been made many years ago.

The loyalty card programmes do not usually record individual
purchases, but at the request of the authorities, retailers can
connect the data of the receipt archives with customer registers.
Using this method, Kesko Food's subsidiary Kespro, a leading
wholesaler in Finland, managed to find out within a very short space
of time a great many of those shoppers who had bought from them the
jars of tainted organic lives that were possibly life-threatening.

The names of customers were picked from the K-Plussa program, the
loyalty cards of which are used by more than 3.6 million Finns. The
same trick could also be done for other retailers' customer registers.
For example, purchases made with the S loyalty card could be traced
back 6 years.

The K-Plussa programme does not record individual purchases, just
information about the product group in question and the sum total of
purchases. The S customer card records for example the place of
purchase and the sum of purchases. What the retailers do not disclose
to their customers is the fact that regardless of the above, each
customer can later be connected with an individual purchase.

Kespro stresses that such information can be tapped only at the
request of a public authority. Last week [week of 24 Oct 2011], the
company received an urgent request from the Finnish Food Safety
Authority (EVIRA) to make an investigation into the purchases of
tainted olives, in order that dangerous products could be removed from
the customers' kitchen shelves.

Kespro did not reach all buyers, as 10 customers did not use the
Plussa card. A number of jars have also been for sale at 4 restaurants
in the Greater Helsinki area, and their customers cannot be traced
afterwards.

Data Protection ombudsman Reijo Aarnio says that the Personal Data Act
permits tapping customer registers for example when people's lives are
at risk. In addition, the police are authorized to get access to
information in criminal investigations.

It appears that the affected olives were predominantly on sale in
Finland. While 900 jars came here, only around a dozen of the same
batch were sold in Italy, and around 40 in the UK. EVIRA issued an
international alert via the European Rapid Alert System for Food and
Feed (RASFF).

[2] Finland: fatality

An elderly woman has died as a result of botulism after eating some
Italian olives that contained the toxin. According to the Helsinki and
Uusimaa Hospital District, she succumbed to the illness on Thu 27 Oct
2011. Another adult member of the same family remains in hospital. The
2nd patient's condition is said to be improving.

The olives in question were manufactured and packaged in Italy, and
the jar contains the Finnish wording "Gaudiano Bio oliivi
mantelitaytteella" (Gaudiano Organic Olives Stuffed with Almonds). The
best-before dates on the product are 08/2012 or 09/2012 and the batch
numbers H2510X or L1810X. The olives have naturally been taken off
store shelves, but it is possible there may still be some in
consumers' kitchen cupboards.

The Finnish Food Safety Authority EVIRA warns against eating these
potentially extremely dangerous products. Around 900 jars were
imported last autumn [2010]. They have been on sale at least in large
supermarkets belonging to the K-chain in Espoo (Iso Omena), Vantaa
(Jumbo), and Rovaniemi (Etelakeskus).

Roughly 160 jars have been sold from these 3 outlets, and the products
have also been on sale to customers at 4 restaurants in the Greater
Helsinki area, Kolme Seppaa (Helsinki), La Famiglia (Helsinki and
Vantaa), and Rafaello (Helsinki).

The European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) has also
been notified of the danger, and for instance the Food Standards
Agency in the UK has issued similar warnings and removed the olives
from sale in Britain.

[3] Saudi Arabia: recall

A batch of olives produced in Italy has been withdrawn from sale in
the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] after an elderly woman in Finland died
from a severe form of food poisoning. The victim is believed to have
been affected by botulism and an alert was sounded by the Europe's
Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). "A warning has already
been posted on the website of Saudi Food & Drug Authority (SFDA)
asking consumers in Saudi Arabia to take maximum precautions," said an
SFDA official in Riyadh on Sun 30 Oct 2011.

He said the Kingdom is one of the largest consumers of raw olives,
processed olives, and olive oil. The SFDA has traced the botulism
outbreak in Finland to Gaudiano Bio Olives that are imported from
Italy, he added. The SFDA has also informed the agencies to recall the
products and remove them from the shelves of supermarkets. The
contamination has alarmed olive consumers and traders across Europe
and now in the Gulf.

Referring to the tainted olives, the SFDA official said they were in
glass jars sold on to a number of supermarkets, smaller retailers, and
caterers in the Kingdom. The SFDA would like to ensure that none of
the affected olive batch remains on sale. The agency has also warned
consumers to check the olive bottles, if they have purchased earlier
and taken them home. "It is important that we contact these people and
make sure that they do not eat any of the product in question," said
the official.

[No additional cases of botulism have been reported in Finland or
elsewhere. It appears that some of the lot of implicated olives were
shipped to Saudi Arabia and remains uncertain if shipped elsewhere. -
