Two pregnant women have died after they contracted a disease spread through a parrot's infected feces, health ministry officials said, in what is likely to be the 1st such cases in Japan. According to a research team at the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, 2 maternal deaths related to the disease were found in a probe it conducted in fiscal year 2016.

The ministry and the national research agency would not say when the 2 women died.

Animal-to-human transmission of the disease occurs if a person inhales a bacterium called _Chlamydophila psittaci_ that can be found in the feces of pet birds such as parrots. Following an incubation period of 1 to 2 weeks, infected patients develop flu-like symptoms, such as high fever and a cough.

In Japan, a few dozen infections are reported annually, according to the ministry, and patients can die if symptoms become severe.

Pregnant women "should avoid unnecessary contact with pet birds, as their resistance (to diseases) is undermined during pregnancy," said Itaru Yanagihara, a department head at the research institute of Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital.

[_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. Transmission has been documented from other birds, however, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey, and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians

That severe infection due to _C. psittaci_ can occur during pregnancy and has been reported:

A number of infections including influenza and coccidiodomycosis are well documented to be more severe during pregnancy presumably due to immunological and/or hormonal changes. - Mod.LL
