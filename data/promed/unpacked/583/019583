Soroti Regional Referral Hospital isolated a patient confirmed to have Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus. The patient is a woman from Aprikila Sub County in Kaberamaido District.

She had been admitted to Soroti Regional Referral Hospital on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022] after a referral from Kaberamaido Hospital where she was taken to treat a headache and stomachache earlier in the week.

"While in Kaberamaido, we were told that her condition needed further management and she was referred to Soroti Regional Referral Hospital. It is from Soroti that we started hearing about the disease," one of the nephews said.

The Crimean-Congo fever virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals, while according to medics, human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of an infected person.

The fever presents with headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. The patient may also show reddish eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and red spots on the palate, according to information from the Ministry of Health website. Outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40%, yet there is no vaccine available for either people or animals.

Dr Wilson Etolu, a Consultant Physician at the Hospital confirmed that they are managing the patient at the COVID-19 isolation unit.

Viral haemorrhagic fevers
-------------------------
Viruses causing haemorrhagic fever are initially transmitted to humans when the activities of infected rodents and humans overlap. The viruses carried in rodent reservoirs are transmitted to human from contact with urine, faecal matter, saliva, or other body excretions from infected rodents. However, some of these vectors may spread the virus to animals, livestock, for example. Humans then become infected when they care for or slaughter the animals.

Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of VHF, but initial signs and symptoms often include marked fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength, and exhaustion. Patients with severe cases of VHF often show signs of bleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from body orifices like the mouth, eyes or ears. Some viruses that cause haemorrhagic fever can spread from one person to another.

In the African Region there are many types of VH fevers which have and continue to pose serious health risks: Marburg and Ebola haemorrhagic fevers, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Rift Valley fever (RVF), lassa fever, yellow fever and the newly emergent arenavirus. All cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.

[CCHF has occurred sporadically in Uganda over recent years and is endemic there. The virus causes a viral hemorrhagic fever, and the virus is transmitted by ticks.

Uganda lies between countries that have frequent outbreaks of RVF (Rift Valley fever) and in which CCHF is endemic: Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, and Sudan. Since 2013, when the 1st case was reported, several confirmed CCHF outbreaks have been reported in Uganda. However, detailed data on the burden, risk factors and genetic diversity of CCHF virus remains largely deficient. Tick exposure has been identified as the major risk factor in studies in Uganda. Uganda still lacks national tick control guidelines and indiscriminate use of acaricides (pesticides specially for ticks) has been observed widely. This has been cited to influence increased tick resistance to acaricides. Whether tick resistance to acaricides has increased tick populations in Uganda is unknown, however it is imperative that tick control is considered in efforts of prevention and control of CCHF outbreaks (https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0009213)

In addition, strong community engagement and social mobilization around the risks posed by tick bites and safe cattle rearing practices are needed. Furthermore, it is important to discourage eating "sanga meat" (meat harvested from sick animals) which carries a heightened risk of zoonotic transmission of VHFs (viral hemorrhagic fevers, CCHF and Rift Valley fever etc). These are important measures to consider, specially in view of the ongoing Ebola hemmorhagic fever outbreak. - Mod.UBA
