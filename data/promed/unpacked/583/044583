Low-pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) Viruses Can Infect Humans
-----------------------------------------------
European researchers have reported what they call the 1st evidence
that low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, and not just
highly pathogenic (HPAI) strains like H5N1, can infect humans. The
finding, in a study of Italian poultry workers, suggests that avian
influenza viruses have more chances than previously suspected to mix
with human influenza viruses, potentially creating hybrids that could
trigger a human influenza pandemic, according to the report published
online by the Journal of Infectious Diseases.
The researchers, led by Isabella Donatelli of the Instituto Superiore
di Sanita in Rome, took serum samples from 983 workers at several
farms in northern Italy from August 1999 until July 2003. Several
avian influenza outbreaks occurred there during that period,
including both LPAI and HPAI strains of H7N1 and an LPAI H7N3 strain.
(LPAI viruses cause mild illness and few deaths in poultry, while
HPAI viruses cause severe illness with high death rates.)
The serum samples were tested for antibodies to the avian viruses. To
ensure accuracy, the researchers tested each sample with
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays.
If either of these came back positive, a Western blot analysis was
done.
None of the 798 serum samples collected during or after the 1st 4
outbreaks tested positive for antibodies to H7N1 or H7N3 viruses.
However, 7 of 185 samples (3.8 percent) taken during an H7N3 outbreak
in 2002 and 2003 tested positive for both viruses in the HI assay,
and 4 of those 7 tested positive for both viruses in the HI assay.
Both tests showed higher titers of antibodies to the H7N3 (LPAI)
strain. In the Western blot testing, all 7 samples showed clear
reactivity, unlike control samples (which had tested negative in the
HI and MN assays).
All the workers who tested positive had been in close contact with
turkeys or chickens in dusty poultry houses, the authors report. None
of the workers reported any flu-like illness at the time of the avian
influenza outbreaks, and only one reported symptoms of
conjunctivitis, an ailment seen in some Dutch poultry workers during
an HPAI outbreak in 2003.
"To our knowledge, this is the 1st serological evidence of
transmission of LAPI viruses to humans during an epizootic in
domestic poultry," the report says. It adds that reports of human
infections associated with other avian flu outbreaks in the
Netherlands, Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Hong Kong, and Canada have
all involved HPAI strains.
The researchers call for "permanent" surveillance for avian influenza
viruses in both animals and humans to shed more light on how the
viruses jump the species barrier.
"Our findings highlight the risk of the emergence of a potentially
pandemic strain, as a result of reassortment of avian and
contemporaneously circulating human strains during outbreaks of avian
influenza caused by LPAI viruses," they write.
The authors also say, according to a Journal of Infectious Diseases
news release, that poultry workers should be regularly vaccinated
against ordinary flu to reduce the risk of gene-swapping between
avian and human flu strains.

The Abstract of the paper reads as follows: "We evaluated the
potential for avian-to-human transmission of low pathogenic avian
influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N1
and LPAI H7N3 viruses that were responsible for several outbreaks of
influenza in poultry in Italy between 1999 and 2003. A serological
survey of poultry workers was conducted by use of a combination of
methods. Evidence of anti-H7 antibodies was observed in 3.8 percent
of serum samples collected from poultry workers during the period in
2003 when LPAI H7N3 virus was circulating. These findings highlight
the need for surveillance in people occupationally exposed to avian
influenza viruses so that they can be monitored for the risk of
avian-to-human transmission during outbreaks of avian influenza
caused by both LPAI and HPAI viruses.

Extracts from An Editorial Commentary on the Puzelli et al. paper by
Frederick Hayden and Alice Croisier
-----------------------------------------------
[Readers should refer to the original text for the complete
commentary and for the specific references (32 in all) cited in the
text. - Mod.CP]
Reports of seropositivity for different avian influenza A viruses in
exposed poultry workers, including the new findings reported by
Puzelli et al. [see preceding CIDRAP report] and the recent instances
of cross-species transmission that caused human disease, raise
fundamental questions regarding the routes of transmission of avian
viruses to and between humans, possible differences in transmission
patterns between human and avian influenza viruses, and implications
for prevention in those occupationally exposed to infected animals
and also in health care, household, and community settings.
Documentation of seropositivity for avian influenza viruses in farm
workers is not a new finding, and previous studies have assessed
human susceptibility by intranasal inoculation of selected avian
influenza viruses. However, the outbreak in Europe of H7N7 virus
infection that led to many cases of conjunctivitis and one death
resulting from viral pneumonia, as well as the unprecedented
epizootic caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in
Southeast Asia, emphasize the importance of these issues.
One strength of the study by Puzelli et al. is the multiplicity of
the serological tests used, which included a microneutralization
assay with infectious virus, a hemagglutination inhibition (HI)
assay, and a confirmatory Western blot analysis with purified H7
hemagglutinin to exclude the possibility of nonspecific
cross-reactions with antibodies to human influenza viruses.
Differential absorption with human influenza virus has also been
utilized to confirm the presence of avian influenza virus-specific
antibodies.
Such methods are essential to document seropositivity for an avian
influenza virus, particularly when concerns about extensive
transmission to humans are raised, as was reported elsewhere for H7N7
virus infection in The Netherlands. The possibility that the latter
virus caused widespread subclinical infections in poultry workers and
household contacts and hence manifested efficient human-to-human
transmission was raised by a study that used a modified HI assay to
measure antibody.
Similarly, the recent report of asymptomatic infection by H5N1 virus
in northern Viet Nam, as determined by the detection of H5N1 RNA in
household contacts, requires substantiation by confirmatory
serological testing, although culture-confirmed H7N3 illnesses have
occurred without an apparent detectable serologic response. Even in
those individuals with proven seropositivity for an avian influenza
virus, it is uncertain whether they have been only exposed to antigen
or are productively infected.
The findings that seropositivity occurs in small numbers of poultry
workers exposed during outbreaks of illness in poultry caused by some
avian strains (H7N7, H7N3, and H5N1) but not others (H7N1 and H5N2)
argue for actual infection and support the notion that some avian
influenza viruses are more likely than others to infect humans.
Definitive evidence for active infection would include detection of
virus or viral RNA at the time of exposure or illness.
Transmission of human influenza virus occurs by inhalation of
infectious droplets or airborne droplet nuclei and, perhaps, by
indirect (fomite) contact followed by self-inoculation of the upper
respiratory tract or conjunctival mucosa. The relative importance of
these routes is debated, and there is evidence to support each of
them, including transmission within health care facilities, in human
influenza. It is likely that each route contributes to transmission
under appropriate circumstances and that the manifestations of
illness, respiratory tract viral loads, and, perhaps, the type of
infecting influenza virus influence the likelihood of transmission by
a particular route.
Transmission of avian influenza virus likely encompasses these routes
as well as others. Human conjunctiva and ciliated nasal epithelial
cells contain cellular receptors that are recognized preferentially
by the hemagglutinin of avian (alpha-2,3 linkages between the
terminal sialic acid residues and galactose), rather than human
(alpha-2,6 linkages), influenza viruses. The distribution of
avian-type receptors in the lower airways and other tissues of humans
requires study. However, it is particularly concerning that perhaps
only 2 amino acid changes in the viral receptor binding site may be
required to change the tropism of the H5 hemagglutinin from avian- to
human-type receptors.
Clinically apparent infections due to avian influenza viruses of the
H7 subtype typically cause conjunctivitis and demonstrate higher
viral loads in the eye than in the pharynx. In H5N1-infected
patients, conjunctivitis has not been a feature, and rhinorrhea has
been inconsistently reported. In contrast, the frequent occurrence of
diarrhea and the detection of viral RNA in most fecal samples tested
suggest that H5N1 virus may replicate in the human gastrointestinal
tract and raise the question of whether human feces could be a source
of transmission.
Most cases of human infection due to avian influenza viruses have
involved close contact with infected poultry, particularly ill or
dying chickens. During the outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997, one
case-control study found that exposure to live poultry within a week
before the onset of illness was associated with human disease, but no
significant risk was related to traveling, eating or preparing
poultry products, or being exposed to persons with disease caused by
H5N1 virus.
Another study in Hong Kong found that exposure to ill poultry and
butchering of birds were associated with seropositivity for H5 avian
influenza viruses. 4 workers who culled infected birds in Japan and 2
animal attendants who cared for infected tigers in Thailand [20] were
found to have antibodies to H5N1 virus during the outbreaks in 2004;
seroconversion indicating recent infection was found in only one of
the Japanese workers.
During the 1st wave of human infections in 2003-2004, a history of
direct contact with poultry was found in 8 of 10 H5N1-infected
patients in Viet Nam and with dead chickens in 8 of 12 H5N1-infected
patients in Thailand, whereas no clinical cases of illness were noted
in those involved in mass culling of poultry. It has been estimated
that 12 - 61 percent of rural Thai residents have regular contact
with birds. However, approximately 30 percent of H5N1-infected
patients in Viet Nam have not reported exposure to sick poultry,
which leaves the issue open to speculation about more frequent
human-to-human transmission than has been found. Infection after
consumption of fresh duck blood and undercooked poultry products has
been suspected in some cases of illness. Indeed, transmission to
felids was observed after experimental feeding of infected chickens
to domestic cats, and feeding tigers raw infected chicken led to
outbreaks of illness in Thai zoos, in which felid-to-felid
transmissions were also implicated.
Infected birds shed high concentrations of virus in feces. Direct
intranasal or conjunctival inoculation while swimming in contaminated
water or, perhaps, inhalation or ingestion of water could have been
potential modes of transmission to some H5N1-infected patients. As
for human influenza, hand contamination from fomites and
self-inoculation into the eye or upper respiratory tract remain
possible modes. Greater adaptation of avian influenza viruses to
human hosts could alter the routes of transmission and increase the
likelihood of human-to-human spread.
In addition to sporadic bird-to-human and suspected
environment-to-human transmission, human-to-human transmission of
H5N1 avian virus has been implicated by epidemiological findings in
several household clusters in which similar illnesses were reported
in relatives and in one well-documented situation in which there was
child-to-mother and likely child-to-aunt transmission in Thailand.
These probable human-to-human transmissions involved close contact
during the critical phase of illness and were inefficient without
additional chains of transmission.
Several household contacts also developed symptomatic H7N7 avian
virus infections after exposure to ill family members in The
Netherlands in 2003. However, in contrast to the studies of human
influenza viruses, molecular epidemiological studies to rigorously
establish human-to-human transmission of H5 avian viruses have not
been completed. Recent serosurveys in southern Viet Nam and Thailand
have not found evidence for inapparent infections in family contacts.
Although viral RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in swab
samples from asymptomatic family contacts of ill patients in Viet Nam
in 2005, these infections remain to be confirmed by serological
testing.
Nosocomial transmission of H5N1 virus to health care workers (HCWs)
was found by serological assessment in Hong Kong in 1997 and is
suspected in a nurse exposed to an infected patient in Viet Nam in
2005. To date, the risk of infection in health care settings appears
low, even when appropriate isolation measures have not been used.

[The evidence for susceptibility of humans to LPAI viruses is
difficult to assess. There is abundant and convincing evidence of
exposure and immunological reaction to LPAI virus antigens but not of
recovery of infectious virus. Parts of the commentary compiled by
Drs. Hayden and Croisier have been reproduced here because they
identify factors that might promote the transition of an avian
influenza virus into a potential human pandemic pathogen. The
greatest risk remains genetic interaction between avian and
conventional human influenza viruses such that a new combination of
surface antigens appears in progeny virus to which humans have had no
prior exposure nor residual immunity. Fortunately, there is no
evidence that this has happened in recent times even where, as in
East Asia, there has been massive amplification of avian influenza
viruses. Historically, genetic interaction between avian and human
influenza A viruses has been an exceedingly rare event. Nonetheless,
there is an immediate requirement for development by reverse genetics
of both H5- and H7-containing vaccines as a precautionary measure. -
