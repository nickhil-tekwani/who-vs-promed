CDC midseason check finds scant flu vaccine effect for seniors
--------------------------------------------------------------
Influenza vaccine over the past few months has provided moderate protection overall but didn't have a significant impact on protecting seniors, a study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed today [21 Feb 2013; full text available at Interim adjusted estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness -- United States, February 2013. MMWR 2013 Feb 22; 62(7): 119-23 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6207a2.htm].

The new estimate is based on adjusted results from a study network from 3 Dec 2012 to 19 Jan 2013, which showed an overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 56 percent, which was similar to an estimate earlier in the season of 62 percent and a level found in a recent careful meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. The latest report is the first of the season to look at vaccine effectiveness by age-group, and it found that for adults aged 65 and older vaccine effectiveness was not statistically significant.

The ongoing study to track the vaccine's effectives involves 5 centers in the CDC's US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network, located in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pittsburgh, Texas, and Washington. The latest estimate includes data from 2697 children and adults who were seen in doctor's offices for acute respiratory illnesses and asked if they had been vaccinated against flu. A total of 1115 (41 percent) of the study participants tested positive for flu by polymerase chain reaction; 751 (67 percent) were infected by type A and 366 (33 percent) by type B. Researchers found that 98 percent of influenza A infections were caused by H3N2, which has been the dominant strain in the United States and is typically linked to more serious illnesses [in North America].

Investigators found that 32 percent of the patients with lab-confirmed flu had received their flu vaccine, compared with 50 percent of those who tested negative. Those numbers produce an overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 56 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 47 percent to 63 percent).

A more detailed look at how the vaccine performed against influenza A and B found varied results. The vaccination rate among type A case-patients was 37 percent, versus 25 percent among type B case-patients. The VE for type A was 47 percent, compared with 67 percent for type B. The authors concluded that the estimates confirm moderate effectiveness in preventing doctor's visits for flu and are similar to the earlier US estimates, plus similar findings from Canada and Europe. They found that protection against influenza was consistent across all age-groups, but protection against influenza A (H3N2) dropped off for older people, a pattern also detected in a recent interim VE report from Europe. Vaccine effectiveness in those 65 and older against both influenza A and B was 27 percent (95 percent CI, -31 percent to 59 percent), and against H3N2 it was 9 percent (95 percent CI, -84 percent to 55 percent), but both numbers are statistically not significant.

The United States had an early and vigorous flu season that has been especially hard on seniors, who have had high levels of hospitalization from the disease. Concerns about the disease in seniors this year have renewed reminders from health officials about usefulness of early antiviral treatment. One possible reason for the findings in seniors is that some may have not mounted an effective immune response to the vaccine's H3N2 component, the group wrote. "Nonetheless, this finding should not discourage future vaccination by persons aged 65 years and older, who are at greater risk for more severe cases and complications from influenza. Although imperfect, influenza vaccines remain the best tool currently available for preventing illness from influenza."

Flu expert Michael T Osterholm, PhD, MPH, said the findings aren't surprising and are consistent with patterns elsewhere, as well findings of a recent meta-analysis in Lancet Infectious Diseases that he coauthored.

[The CDC report concludes that: Although imperfect, influenza vaccines remain the best tool currently available for preventing illness from influenza. The report highlights the value of both increasing the use of influenza vaccines, especially among children and young adults, and continuing efforts to develop more effective vaccines and vaccination strategies.

Antiviral medications are important for the treatment and control of influenza and should be used as recommended, regardless of patient vaccination status. The 2012-13 seasonal influenza vaccine provides substantial protection for the population overall, which underscores the public health value of vaccination.

Nonetheless, some vaccinated persons have become ill with influenza this season, especially among persons aged 65 years and older. Antiviral medications are an important 2nd line of defense against influenza and should be used promptly, as recommended for treatment of suspected influenza in certain patients in high-risk groups, including those aged 65 years and older, regardless of their vaccination status. - Mod.CP]
