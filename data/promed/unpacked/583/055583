Since beginning of 2010, 23 cases due to _Streptococcus suis_
infection and 5 fatalities have been reported in Phetchabun province.
Recently, 3 more cases were reported from Lampang province after
eating 'Larb' and 'Lu Mu' (Laos meat salad made with raw pork and raw
pork blood). Cases were sent to hospital by relatives. At present,
all cases have recovered.

The illness caused by the bacterium _Streptococcus suis_ is mostly
found in northern region of Thailand because some people prefer to
consume 'Larb' and 'Lu Mu', which are made from raw pork. Symptoms of
infection include high fever and acute deafness, which may occur on
one side or both. Other symptoms include headache and vomiting.
Deaths may occur in severe infections.

Dr Sirichai Phataranuthaphon, director of Lampang Provincial Health
Office stated that people should abstain from eating raw meat
especially 'Larb' and 'Lu Mu' and take care of themselves.

[The newswire above is the 3rd report of _Streptococcus suis_ in
Thailand in 2010. [2 prior reports of human _S. suis_ infection in
Thailand appeared in ProMED-MBDS (English-language posts focusing on
the Mekong River basin region of Southeast Asia): Streptococcus suis,
human - Thailand (02): Nakhon Sawan, fatal 20100813.2771 and
Streptococcus suis, human - Thailand: fatality, RFI 20100628.2159.]
In total, 3 cases were reported after consuming raw pork in Lampang.
No fatality was reported from this event. The 1st 2 reports were from
Phetchabun and Nakhon Sawan province, respectively.

According to the Annual Epidemiology Surveillance Report (AESR) 2009
from the Bureau of Epidemiology (BOE), Ministry of Public Health,
Thailand, available in Thai at
<http://epid.moph.go.th/Annual/Annual%202552/Main.html>, in 2009
there were 159 cases due to _Streptococcus suis_ infection. The
attack rate was 0.25 per 100 000 population. The male to female ratio
was 3 to 1. The peak of illness was reported in May 2009 (22 cases).

The highest number of cases was reported from the northern region
(130 cases), followed by the central (21 cases) and the northeastern
regions (8 cases). Cases in the northern region were reported from
Lampang (23 cases), Phetchabun (21), Phitsanulok (20), Uttaradit
(15), Sukhothai (13), Nan (10), Chiang Rai (7), Nakhon Sawan (6),
Chiang Mai (4), Phrae (4), Phayao (4), Tak (2), and Uthai Thani (1)
provinces.

[Human _Streptococcus suis_ infection is a potentially fatal zoonosis
that has been reported to cause most commonly meningitis, but also
toxic shock if the strain produces the appropriate toxins, and less
commonly, endocarditis. Human _Streptococcus suis_ infection occurs
mainly among those who slaughter infected pigs.

Eating appropriately cooked meat or organs from infected pigs is said
to pose no risk of _S. suis_ infection. However, eating raw infected
pork poses a risk of infection as illustrated by the report above.
Cooks who prepare food from infected pork meat and organs would also
seem likely to be at risk of infection. Person-to-person spread does
not seem to occur (see
<http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201>).

_S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; but virulent
strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling pigs
(polyarthritis, meningitis and septicemia) and in recently weaned and
growing pigs (meningitis). In addition, _S. suis_ sometimes causes
pneumonia, endocarditis, myocarditis, or abortions in adult pigs.

The viral infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
(PRRS) in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is
thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_.
ProMED-mail recently reported a PRRS outbreak in Thailand (see
Porcine reprod. & resp. syndrome - Thailand: OIE 20101201.4320). A
discussion of PRRS and _S. suis_ can be found in moderators' comments
in ProMED-mail posts listed below. - Mod.ML]
