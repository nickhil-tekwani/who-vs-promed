Two staff members at a private Riverton school are being treated for
possible rabies exposure after a bat kept as a classroom pet tested
positive for the potentially deadly disease. On Tue 15 May 2007, state and
county health officials interviewed all 95 staff members and students at
Trinity Lutheran School to determine the level of contact with the animal.
They opted to treat a teacher and a teaching assistant who had a "high risk
for exposure," said Marty Stensaas, county manager for Fremont County
Public Health Nursing.
State health officials, including state epidemiologist Dr Tracy Murphy,
planned to meet on Wednesday night [16 May 2007] with parents and school
staff members to address questions and make recommendations about possible
additional preventive measures. Several doses of rabies vaccine were rushed
to Riverton Memorial Hospital in the event parents opt to have their
children receive the lengthy and expensive series of shots, Stensaas said.
"You just have to be careful any time there is a possible rabies exposure
because it can be a deadly disease in humans," Stensaas said.
On Wed 9 May 2007, a staff member discovered the bat in the school
basement, where it was captured and stored in a cage in Steve Coniglio's
7th and 8th grade classroom. It was also displayed in other classrooms, and
students fed it crickets through the cage. No one is believed to have
touched the bat directly, head teacher Susan Tucker said.
School officials notified a local veterinarian after the bat died suddenly
on 11 May [2007]. Once the animal tested positive for the rabies virus, the
state Department of Health was called in.
Coniglio and a teacher's aide who washed the cage without protective gloves
after the bat died are receiving the rabies vaccine as a precaution. The
treatment involves a series of shots in the arm over a period of several
months at a cost of roughly USD 3500. Stensaas said parents and their
children's doctors ultimately would decide who else might get the treatment.
The rabies virus is generally transmitted when saliva from an infected
animal enters the system through a wound or a mucous membrane, Stensaas said.
The virus occasionally crops up in Wyoming, but exposure is normally
limited to a single person, making this case unusual, Stensaas said.
"Generally we only deal with one exposure at a time, and you can very
quickly determine risk," she said. "With this unknown number, we had to
dive in a little further."
Tucker said she does not expect any reprimands to result from the incident,
which she said was an unfortunate consequence of a teacher trying to turn a
fairly normal occurrence into an educational opportunity for students. She
said Coniglio took precautions to make sure students did not handle the bat
and that safety was observed. "What (Coniglio) did he thought he was doing
in a very scientific manner," Tucker said.
Stensaas praised the school staff members for their responses to the
incident, saying the "very organized" school helped make the assessment
work go smoothly. Tucker said her staff was able to keep the atmosphere
low-key despite the potential for upheaval, and that parents seemed to be
responding calmly as well. "My approach about anything we handle is
honestly and calmly, and I think they have responded back to me in just
that manner," Tucker said.
Stensaas said bats are common in Wyoming, and virtually every building is a
potential home for the nocturnal animals. She said rabies is a threat that
can be mitigated with proper education and common sense, including avoiding
animals that act oddly. "We just have to learn how to live with those risks
that are out there," she said. Officials at Trinity Lutheran School, a
private institution affiliated with Trinity Lutheran Church, are seeking
advice from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department about how to remove
additional bats that still live in the building.

[The teacher turned the bat experience into a teaching experience but it
was probably not the experience he had anticipated. Hopefully, this will
enlighten health departments, physicians, and wildlife groups to teach
public groups and individuals about rabies, animals most often affected,
and signs of the various forms of rabies in animals. They should also
emphasize that rabies is almost always fatal in humans.
Rabies is an acute viral encephalomyelitis that mainly affects carnivores
and bats, although it can affect any mammal. It is invariably fatal once
clinical signs appear [see Rabies, human, bat - USA (WI) (07): recovery
20041231.3459 for an exception. - Mod.SH]. Rabies is found throughout the
world, but a few countries claim to be free of the disease due either to
successful elimination programs and/or to their island status and
enforcement of rigorous quarantine regulations.
Transmission is almost always by introduction of virus-laden saliva into
the tissues, usually by the bite of a rabid animal. Although much less
likely, it is possible for virus from saliva, salivary glands, or brain to
cause infection by entering the body through other fresh wounds or through
intact mucous membranes. Usually, saliva is infectious at the time that
clinical signs occur, but it is possible for dogs and cats to shed virus
for several days before onset of clinical signs. Viral shedding in skunks
has been reported for up to 8 days prior to onset of signs. Rabies virus
has not been isolated from skunk musk (spray).
Horses and mules frequently show evidence of distress and extreme
agitation. These signs, especially when accompanied by rolling, may be
interpreted as evidence of colic. As in other species, horses may bite or
strike viciously and, because of their size and strength, become
unmanageable in a few hours. People have been killed outright by such
animals. These animals frequently suffer self-inflicted wounds.
The incubation period is both prolonged and variable; typically, the virus
remains at the inoculation site for a considerable time. The unusual length
of the incubation period helps to explain how post-exposure treatment,
including in humans the practice of locally infiltrating hyper-immune
serum, is effective. Most cases in dogs develop within 21 to 80 days after
exposure, but the incubation period may be shorter or considerably longer.
One reliably recorded case of rabies in a human had an incubation period
longer than 6 years.
The virus travels via the peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and ascends
to the brain. After reaching the brain, the virus travels via peripheral
nerves to the salivary glands. If an animal is capable of transmitting
rabies via its saliva, virus will be detectable in the brain. Virus is shed
intermittently in the brain.
Hematogenous spread does not occur. Under most circumstances, there is no
danger of aerosol transmission of rabies. However, aerosol transmission has
occurred under very specialized conditions in which the air contains a high
concentration of suspended particles or droplets carrying viral particles.
Such conditions have been responsible for laboratory transmission under
less than ideal containment situations. There has also been documented
aerosol transmission in one bat cave. Oral and nasal secretions containing
virus were probably aerosolized from tens of millions of bats. Aerosol
infection may occur via direct attachment of the virus to olfactory nerve
endings.
The disease is easily preventable by use of a vaccine. This moderator has
long advocated that horses and cattle should be protected by being
vaccinated. It is certainly a cheap insurance policy, given the fatal
consequences otherwise.
