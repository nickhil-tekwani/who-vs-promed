One month after a crisis broke out over dioxin contamination in
Belgian food and livestock feed, it is still not known exactly what
toxins were present, how much was there, how much food was
contaminated, and where it went. A government has fallen over the
issue, but little science is being done, and government regulators in
countries that have banned Belgian food imports are wondering if
and when they can lift the bans. This is an update on the event. I
am writing in a personal capacity. My views do not necessarily
express those of the publications for which I work.
To recap what we know: about 8 litres of used PCB, probably from a
transformer, ended up in an 80 tonne batch of recycled fats
subsequently used to make animal feed, mainly for chickens, in mid-
January 1999. It was sold as recycled animal fat, but contained
vegetable oil too. There has been talk of motor oil but that is
probably a confusion.
One theory of how this happened involves public recycling depots
for used frying fat, which also have containers for used motor oil.
PCBs shouldn't have been in either. But it is possible that someone
heading for the motor oil bin trying to quietly dispose of transformer
oil instead dumped it in the used food oil. Other theories are that
the PCBs were dumped deliberately or accidentally by a waste
dealer; or that a heat transfer pipe using PCBs as the circulating
fluid leaked, as in the Yusho incident in Japan [1968 and the Yu
Cheng incident in Taiwan.
Belgium is currently investigating several recycling companies other
than their initial suspects. In February 1999 chicken farmers
noticed that some laying hens were sick and dead, some chicks
were failing to hatch, and some that did hatch had "neurological
symptoms", probably impaired movement. One of the PCDFs in the
mix was one for which the toxicity in birds is very high, as per the
re-evaluation of relative congener toxicity done in 1998 by Martin
Van den Berg et al, Env Health Perspectives, v106 pp 775-790,
Dec 1998.
It is possible that we would never have found out about this incident
were that not the case. If the fat had been fed to cows, there would
probably have been no symptoms, and in any EU country but
Germany, which actively monitors milk for dioxins, the event might
not have been detected for months.
The Belgian farmers went to their feed companies, the feed
companies called their insurance people, they called in a veterinary
inspector, and he looked for everything, mainly nutrient
deficiencies. Then in April 1999 he wondered if it might be dioxins --
a lucky stroke of insight as dioxins are usually suspected only in
grazing animals exposed to incinerator deposits. He sent a
sample of feed, and a dead laying hen, to RIKILT-DLO, the Dutch
national lab for food quality in Wageningen, the Netherlands,
choosing them partly because VITO in Mol, the only lab in Belgium
accredited for dioxin analysis, specialises in milk. RIKILT's web site
is <http://www.rikilt.dlo.nl>
Toxicity for mixtures of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, is
expressed as toxic equivalency, or TEQ, a figure arrived at by
multiplying the concentration of each congener present by its
known relative toxicity. RIKILT found 958 TEQ pg/g fat PCDDs and
PCDFs (mostly the latter) in the chicken, and 781 ng TEQ per g of
feed. The pattern of congeners resembled the Yusho incident in
1968 in Japan, especially the PCDFs, so RIKILT concluded that
the origin was PCB contamination, and calculated the ratio of
PCB to fat on this basis. PCBs have now been confirmed by direct
measurement. These are the only numbers available for feed
contamination, apart from the PCBs noted below.
The feed companies told the government in late April 1999. It
asked for another analysis. RIKILT tested 2 eggs, intended for
hatching, and a laying hen. The eggs tested at 713 and 266 pg/g fat
TEQ, the chicken 741 pg/g fat TEQ. Another 10 chicks were also
tested and were contaminated -- levels have not been released.
They were probably collected in April 1999, but the scientists who
tested them aren't sure.
On 26 May 1999 Belgium informed its neighbours and the
European Commission as required by law. The Commission is
launching court action over the delay.
Belgium pulled chickens and eggs off the market, then products
made with eggs. Then they found cows and pigs had got the feed
so they pulled beef and pork, and stopped exporting milk on order
of the Commission though it was still sold in Belgium. They took
Belgian butter off the market, though some report finding it in
supermarkets. Indeed much depended on the cooperation
of retailers -- I saw egg waffles on snack shelves in small shops
which certainly were not removed during the crisis. Bins were set
up for people to dump banned food, but many people did not use
them, and at least some of what was dumped was spirited away.
The government tried to determine what feed companies bought
the fat, what farms bought their feed, and what farms didn't and
could therefore be exonerated so as to get food back on the
market. This was in the middle of a federal election campaign. The
government defeat on 13 June 1999 was widely attributed to anger
over the delay in informing the public about the dioxin contamination.
The numbers cited above are the only measurements of dioxins in
chickens from the period of probable maximum contamination of
which I or anyone I have talked to is aware. Analyses now being
done intensively at laboratories throughout Belgium and the region
are aimed at making sure food available now is clean. RIKILT has
found no evidence of contamination in any recent Dutch or Belgian
food. No other data has been released.
As PCBs cost less to analyse than dioxins, and this can be done by
many laboratories in Belgium, the Belgian government has
commissioned extensive PCB analyses on recent food. It is not
being analysed quantitatively for total PCBs, but for a standard set
of seven congeners being used as a marker for this incident. We
don't know how much toxicity in food contaminated by the incident
can be attributed to PCBs as no one has yet done a full congener
analysis -- and the 7 standard congeners are not the co-planar
dioxin-like types for which we have toxic equivalency factors from
which TEQ is calculated.
Without sampling and testing of food from February and March
1999, we will never know how contaminated the food was, how
much and what kinds of food were contaminated, or where it was
distributed. Apparently one Belgian institute has plans to try and
collect such samples, but it is only starting now.
The only other measurement of contamination I have been able to
acquire is from a private Belgian laboratory, which found 332 - 519
micrograms PCBs (7 congeners) per gram fat in feed. The ratio
between this and known dioxin values gram for gram in the RIKILT
measurements is about right, I am told. It is not clear from the
records that have been obtained when this feed was sampled.
The European Commission's scientific committee on food in an
opinion dated 16 June 1999 said dioxin-like PCBs accounted for
80 per cent of the TEQ in food contaminated by the Belgian
incident. This means that the 900 pg/g TEQs for dioxins that may
have existed in eggs during the period of probable peak
contamination is only a fifth of the total toxicity. But the committee
based that rough estimate on known ratios of the seven congeners
analysed to other congeners in Aroclors 1245 and 1260, thought to
resemble the original contaminant mixture, making this a very rough
estimate. Their report at
http://www.europe.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/scf/index_en.html
is largely concerned with whether to let Belgian milk back onto the
EU market.
The 80 tonnes of fat thought to be behind all this was enough to
make 1600 tonnes, or 10 million chicken-days, of feed. It is not
clear whether the authorities have been attempting to account for
all 80 tonnes of the fat in the records of the feed companies, or all
1600 tonnes of feed that could have been made from it. Sales
records are not enough to trace the contamination, because of a
widespread practice of making sales without paperwork.
Is this incident over? Everyone I have talked to says this was a one-
off, that one 80 tonne contaminated batch of fats was the problem,
and it has probably been eaten. Probably the contamination has
already gone through the food chain insofar as it affected
chickens, which have a fast turnover rate.
But some of the contamination fed to cows and hogs may still be
there and may not have gone through humans yet. No data have
been released as to whether there have been any elevated levels
of PCBs or dioxins found in meat, apart from general statements
that meat produced recently is clean.
There have been no elevated levels in recent milk, beyond
Europe's usual background, which could be due to batch dilution.
Meanwhile Austria, moved to do some analyses by this incident,
found dioxin in some domestically produced pig feed. Levels were
much lower than in Belgium, and the feed has been impounded.
Details are at
http://www.bmlf.gv.at/presse/fpresse.htm, in German.
Dioxins are given as 2 - 6 pg TEQ per g of feed, much less than
the few values reported for Belgium. I do not know if the Austrians
have done any pork analyses.
The Europeans' dioxin plight is not unique. An article to appear in
the journal Environmental Research in October will report among
the first published measurements of the levels of dioxins in
chickens during a dioxin-in-feed incident in the southern US 2
years ago. Levels were a tenth those in Belgium, but the
contamination appears to have lasted for years, and was only
picked up because of a one-off survey of dioxins in food
undertaken by EPA and USDA. Some details may be found in New
Scientist, 26 June 1999, on the web at
http://www.newscientist.com/ns/19990626/focus.html
There are plans for health surveys in Belgium to follow up this
incident, but these will be of little use without data on the extent and
nature of the contamination. A breast milk survey might be
informative, but there would be 'noise' problems -- levels in western
Europe are already high -- and unless the high levels of some
PCDFs can be taken as a signature, it would be impossible to say
whether any observed increases in dioxins or PCBs were
caused by this incident. This is especially true as this is not the first
time Europe has been affected by dioxins in feed. Dioxin-laced
citrus pulp was discovered in 1997 to be affecting milk cattle. As in
the US episode concentrations were lower than the few we know
about from Belgium, but affected a larger area for a longer time.
Some details of this are in the New Scientist article cited above.
