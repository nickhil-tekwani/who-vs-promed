The latest version is called H6N1, and represents the 1st time that this strain of [avian influenza] has jumped from birds to people [see ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (86): Taiwan, H6N1 20130621.1785829]. Flu researchers are especially wary of wild avian species like migrating geese to run-of-the-mill chickens at local poultry markets. These birds harbour a series of influenza strains that generally don't make the birds sick, but could cause serious disease in people if they jumped to human hosts. In recent years, more bird flu viruses that had never infected people before have been finding new human hosts.

Last spring [2013], for example, scientists in China reported the 1st human cases of H7N9 infections. These viruses previously circulated among birds, but mutations helped them to survive and sicken people as well.

Now, researchers in Taiwan say another avian flu strain, H6N1, may have made the jump as well. Reporting in the journal Lancet [see abstract in [2] below], scientists describe what they found when they analyzed a throat swab from a 20-year-old woman who came to the hospital with shortness of breath and flu symptoms. When they sequenced the virus in her sample, they found it was very similar to H6N1 strains that have been found in chickens on the island since the 1970s, with one exception: this H6N1 had a mutation that gave it the ability to stick to human cells and gain entry, causing infection. Specifically, the mutation helped the virus to bind to cells in the human upper airway -- a good place for viruses to attach after they are inhaled through the nasal passages.

The woman, a clerk in a deli who did not have direct contact with raw meats or poultry, recovered. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Taiwan identified and tested 36 of her close contacts, including her brother, mother, neighbors, work colleagues, and doctors who cared for her at the hospital. Only 6 had fever and respiratory symptoms similar to the woman's; none showed signs of persistent infection with the virus.

While it's too early to tell how virulent H6N1 may be in people, the fact that this bird flu mutated and gained the ability to infect people is concerning, say public health experts. The development suggests that some of the H6N1 strains circulating among poultry in Taiwan now have the ability to make people sick. That's an unstable situation, since additional mutations could make the virus either more dangerous to people or make it more innocuous; it's all a matter of chance. "As these viruses continue to evolve and accumulate changes, they increase the potential risk of human infection," said Dr Ho-Sheng Wu, from the CDC in Taiwan and one of the study's co-authors. Coupled with the shift of H7N9 from birds to people last flu season [2012-2013], this latest case suggests that it makes sense to increase surveillance of the influenza strains circulating among birds for clues about the next potential viral flu threat.

Summary
-------
Background: Avian influenza A H6N1 virus is one of the most common viruses isolated from wild and domestic avian species, but human infection with this virus has not been previously reported. We report the clinical presentation, contact, and environmental investigations of a patient infected with this virus, and assess the origin and genetic characteristics of the isolated virus.

Methods: A 20-year-old woman with an influenza-like illness presented to a hospital with shortness of breath in May 2013. An unsubtyped influenza A virus was isolated from her throat-swab specimen and was transferred to the Taiwan Centres for Disease Control (CDC) for identification. The medical records were reviewed to assess the clinical presentation. We did a contact and environmental investigation and collected clinical specimens from the case and symptomatic contacts to test for influenza virus. The genomic sequences of the isolated virus were determined and characterised.

Findings: The unsubtyped influenza A virus was identified as the H6N1 subtype, based on sequences of the genes encoding haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The source of infection was not established. Sequence analyses showed that this human isolate was highly homologous to chicken H6N1 viruses in Taiwan and had been generated through interclade reassortment. Notably, the virus had a G228S substitution in the haemagglutinin protein that might increase its affinity for the human alpha 2-6 linked sialic acid receptor.

Interpretation: This is the 1st report of human infection with a wild avian influenza A H6N1 virus. A unique clade of H6N1 viruses with a G228S substitution of haemagglutinin have circulated persistently in poultry in Taiwan. These viruses continue to evolve and accumulate changes, increasing the potential risk of human-to-human transmission. Our report highlights the continuous need for preparedness for a pandemic of unpredictable and complex avian influenza.

[As far as this moderator is aware there have been no further reports of human infection with avian influenza (H6N1) virus in Taiwan or elsewhere. It is unclear how the patient contracted the infection and there has been no report of onward human-to-human transmission of the virus. It is clear that modification of the haemagglutinin protein binding site alone is not sufficient to endow this avian influenza virus with ability to spread in the human population. In the absence of other information it can only be concluded that this particular individual by habit or genetic constitution was particularly susceptible to avian influenza virus infection at a particular time in her life. - Mod.CP]
