[Re: 22 Sep 2001: "Dengue fever cases hit 415: disease past its peak and
under control, say health authorities..."]
Macau health authorities said on Wednesday that about 700 cases have been
reported since the end of August 2001, of which 695 have been confirmed
since 30 Aug 2001. From 20-25 cases daily have been confirmed in recent
weeks, of whom 50 remain hospitalized.

Dengue Increase in Rivas Causes Health Ministry to Issue Medical Alert
-------------------------------------------------------
The state of Rivas continues under the epidemiological alert instituted by
the Ministry of Health (MINSA) because of an increase in the number of
cases of dengue fever, especially in the municipalities of Tola, Rivas, and
Belen. During 2000, 114 cases of dengue fever were reported. To date, the
numbers for 2001 have reached 675 suspected cases.
In response to this situation, MINSA designated the region's local integral
healthcare systems (SILAIS) as "Sentinel Sites" with the purpose of
achieving swifter diagnosis, better patient care, and increased
epidemiological surveillance. It is particularly important to consider that
the state of Rivas is more sensitive to the disease, given its proximity to
the border with Costa Rica, where the population is affected by serotype 3
dengue virus, while serotype 2 is prevalent in Nicaragua.
Dr. Carlos Urbina, of the epidemiology unit of SILAIS, stated that this
project would provide the means to train laboratory technicians and to
designate a physician, a pediatrician, and an epidemiologist to care
directly for patients who consult health centers with symptoms of dengue
fever. Urbina added that at the end of October [2001], a delegation from
SILAIS, headed by Dr. Julio Flores, would meet with its counterparts in
Costa Rica, with whom they collaborate through a project on both sides of
the border (Proyecto Interfronterizo), which aims to control problems such
as vector transmission.
Although no cases of infection by serotype 3 dengue virus have been
detected in Rivas, the fact is that it affects the population of Costa
Rica, producing more severe symptoms than those produced by serotype 2.
Nonetheless, there is real risk, given that a large percentage of the
population of this region, and particularly of the municipality of Tola,
work in Costa Rica. Transportation between the 2 countries is easy and
these workers return home as frequently as possible (every month, every 3
months, every 6 months, or once a year). In addition to announcing that the
health education program will continue, Urbina called on the entire
population to participate in disease prevention programs, which include the
cleaning of empty lots and the elimination of stagnant pools of water,
which promote the proliferation of disease.

[It appears we still have little idea of the full extent of the current
outbreak in Hawaii, but this article suggests local transmission on Kauai,
Oahu, and the Big Island (Hawaii) on the west or Kona Coast. Some of these
cases are several months old. - David Duffy]
Dengue fever may be spreading in Hawaii
--------------------------------------------
State health officials offered more troubling news about the dengue fever
outbreak yesterday, saying they now have suspected locally transmitted
cases on O'ahu, Kaua'i, and the Big Island.
If these cases are confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC], it means the epidemic will have spread outside Maui to
most of the rest of the state. "We are very concerned," said Health
Department spokeswoman Janice Okubo.
Previous confirmed cases on O'ahu, Kaua'i, and the Big Island involved
patients who were infected with the mosquito-borne virus while in foreign
countries. The new suspected cases involve patients with no recent travel
history.
As of noon yesterday, 19 cases of dengue fever have been laboratory
confirmed, all from East Maui. The latest are 3 cases in Ha'iku, Okubo
said. None of the confirmed East Maui cases has recent travel history off
island, verifying the first documented local transmission of dengue fever
in more than 50 years.
The number of suspected cases in the current outbreak has reached 116, a
figure that includes one case from Ka'a'awa, O'ahu; one from Anahola,
Kaua'i; and 4 from Kailua-Kona, Hawai'i. In all of the cases, the patients
had no recent travel history off their islands.
Officials have a rapid field test that has good success in predicting
whether the CDC will confirm a case of dengue. Only the Anahola case was
tested, and the results were positive, Okubo said. Okubo said the
department is conducting "high surveillance" on clinics and hospitals on
all islands and is planning to disseminate additional information to
educate the public across the state. That probably will include passing out
information at airports, she said.
Preventing further spread of dengue in Hawaii will require a sustained
community-based effort of mosquito control combined with judicious use of
insecticides, officials said. All Hawaii residents, not only East Maui
residents, are being urged to keep their properties free of sites where
mosquitoes can breed.

Number of Cases in Caracas Decreases
-----------------------------------------------
The number of cases of dengue fever in the metropolitan area has decreased.
However, the efforts against _A. aegypti_ must continue and now, more than
ever, it is necessary to destroy any breeding grounds.
This was the statement issued by Baldomero Vasquez, Health Secretary for
the Mayor's Office. The data obtained by the Mayor's Office show that
during epidemiological week 39 (between 21-27 Sep 2001), the number of
cases reported in Caracas decreased to a daily average of 164 cases,
compared to the previous epidemiological week (14-20 Sep 2001), during
which 190 cases were reported daily. Vasquez explained that during week 38,
there were 1458 infected persons, while there were 1151 cases during week
39, indicating a 21% reduction.
One of the goals is to apply preventive measures in every school.
Approximately 85% of the education centers in the metropolitan area have
been sprayed with insecticides. Of 1222 centers, 987 have been treated, and
it is hoped that by the end of this week, every school will have been
treated. The goal of the next phase is to maintain and extend protective
measures, which will be achieved through the participation of the school
community as the first front of attack against the vector.
