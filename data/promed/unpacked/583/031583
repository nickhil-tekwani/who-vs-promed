Avian influenza -- final epidemiology report published
------------------------------------------------------
Defra has today [11 Jul 2008] published a final epidemiology report
into the avian influenza outbreak confirmed in Oxfordshire on 4 Jun
[2008]. The report concludes that at the time of writing (2 Jul 2008)
infection was confined to a single premise, and there is no evidence
of infection on any contact or geographically close premises, or
evidence of spread of infection to any other premises to date.

While it has not been possible to conclusively identify the source of
the infection, the 2 most likely sources of the outbreak are thought
to be: unidentified avian influenza in domestic premises in Great
Britain, associated either by proximity or potential contact, or
avian influenza in wildlife in contact with the IP [infected premise].

Investigations are now complete.

Deputy chief veterinary officer, Alick Simmons, said: "This incident
has demonstrated again the potential for avian influenza to be
introduced into domestic poultry in the UK. The risk of further
incidents, while low, remains. I urge poultry keepers to maintain the
highest standards of biosecurity and to report suspicion of disease
promptly including where records indicate increased mortality or
reduced performance."

Notes to editors
----------------
1. The report can be viewed at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/latest-situation/index.htm>.

2. Advice and information on H7N7 avian influence is available via
the Defra Helpline on 08459 33 55 77. Poultry keepers can also call
the Animal Health recorded information line for the latest updates,
on 0844 884 4600.

3. The Surveillance Zone and remaining disease control restrictions
put in place following the outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza in
Oxfordshire were lifted on 8 Jul 2008. The Protection Zone (PZ) was
lifted on 29 Jun 2008. Some restrictions on trade with other
countries remain. Further information is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/int-trde/cins/2008/08115.htm>.

4. Avian influenza is a disease of birds and whilst it can pass very
rarely and with difficulty to humans, this usually requires extremely
close contact with infected birds, particularly faeces. As a
precautionary measure those who might have been exposed would be
offered the appropriate treatment and protection in line with
established protocols. Advice from the Food Standards Agency remains
that properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs,
are safe to eat.

(Epidemiology) Executive Summary
--------------------------------
1. Following a report of suspected avian notifiable disease in laying
hens in Oxfordshire on 2 Jun 2008, highly pathogenic (HP) H7N7 avian
influenza (AI) infection was confirmed on 4 Jun 2008. At the time of
writing (2 Jul 2008), 20 further reported cases from across Great
Britain have been negated either on clinical grounds or after
laboratory examination of samples.

2. The report presents the results of additional epidemiological
investigations and analyses carried out since the 1st epidemiology
report for this outbreak, published on 17 Jun 2008, and available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/latest-situation/index.htm>

3. On 2 Jul 2008, it appears that the infection is confined to a
single premise. Infection was ruled out at both premises of origin of
the affected birds. Investigations have found no evidence of
infection on any contact (tracings) or geographically close premises,
and there has been no evidence of spread of infection to any other
premises to date.

4. Clinical evidence from the farm's records supports virological
data that the HPAI infection derived from a pre-existing low
pathogenicity AI (LPAI) H7 virus present on the premises. Laboratory
investigations provide support for this hypothesis. H7 viral RNA was
detected from faecal samples collected from beneath Sheds 1 and 2.
Further molecular analyses yielded, from one of these samples, an
identical haemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site sequence to that of an
unrelated H7 influenza virus from 1976 from Australia, which had been
shown by in vivo testing to be an LPAI virus.

5. The 2 most likely hypotheses investigated for the sources of the
outbreak were i) unidentified AI in domestic poultry premises in
Great Britain, associated either by proximity or potential contact;
or ii) AI in wildlife in contact with the IP.
All investigations have been completed and neither of these 2 routes
could be categorically ruled out as the source of infection.

6. Wild bird activity in general was described as being low around
the IP by expert ornithologists. Overall it can be concluded that
wild bird species found on the IP did not pose a high risk for
introduction of AI.

7. It should be noted that a population of mallard ducks introduced
onto a pond on the premises in 2007 were seen to be mixing with the
poultry. Laboratory testing of samples collected from a small
proportion of these ducks was negative, but significant uncertainty
remains as to the true AI status of the mallard population due to i)
the limited availability of suitable samples from the ducks, and ii)
the inevitable time that passed before sampling the mallards
following the onset of clinical signs in the laying hens. The latter
would have significantly reduced the likelihood of detecting avian
influenza virus.

8. The detection of an HA cleavage site amino acid sequence identical
to an LPAI virus that was previously isolated from ducks, indicates
that the mallard ducks on the IP are a plausible source of infection.
Furthermore, this previously isolated virus was believed to be the
LPAI progenitor strain for an HPAI outbreak in poultry in Australia in 1976.

9. If the source of infection was another domestic poultry flock,
then, with all the investigations completed, it remains unidentified.
Despite intense field investigations and sampling, a number of
scenarios might explain the absence of positive results: i)
unidentified contacts, ii) lower than detectable level of LPAI
infection on premises within the PZ and/or identified contacts and
iii) birds having been sent to slaughter or moved off prior to
investigations commencing.

RE: AI Oxfordshire report
-------------------------
The situation at Banbury is probably more complex than has been
disclosed but my take on it is that the pond on site had mainly a
static population of waterfowl -- feral, but probably had been there
for a little while (I think the owner of the site may even have
placed them there as "ornamental" fowl).

The virus in this outbreak certainly appears to have arrived in its
low path state, kicked around for a while; it may even have been in
this group for several months or more. Any waterfowl would stay
clinically healthy in this time. It is only when such viruses spill
over into domestic chickens or turkeys that the "switch" on the virus
tends to go to the "on" position, which is a response by the virus to
being in an unusual host. The virus then causes high mortality. Even
if it went back into the waterfowl it may not cause any disease.

H5N1 on the other hand is always in the "on" position and seems to be
an unusual flu virus in being able to kill some but not all small
waterfowl and is especially bad for swans.

On that basis this virus could have come into the area much earlier
with wild waterfowl, shown no signs in them, or when they
contaminated the "domestic feral" waterfowl on site, only becoming an
issue when it got into the layers -- initially as a low path and then
as a high path virus.

I hope that makes sense.
