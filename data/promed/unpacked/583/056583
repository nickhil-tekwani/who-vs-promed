Dallas Co. sheriff's officers entered quarantined apartment
-----------------------------------------------------------
5 members of the Dallas County [Texas] Sheriff's Department who were briefly inside the apartment where a man with Ebola stayed have been temporarily put on leave. "They're very concerned," said Christopher Dyer, president of the Dallas County Sheriff's Association. "Their families are concerned..." ... The 3 deputies, a sergeant, and a lieutenant accompanied the head of Dallas County Health and Human Services Department and a doctor into the apartment late Wednesday [1 Oct 2014] night. They had gone there on the orders of Sheriff Lupe Valdez to get the people inside to sign a court order forbidding them from leaving the apartment ...
Dyer said deputies should never have been involved to begin with, because he considers it a federal issue and not a local matter ... "Let's move that family. Let's move everybody out of that building. I don't care if it's overkill. Let's do overkill. I don't think sending a few deputies in there is the right course of action." -- more

[This is over-reaction. The sick man, D., had left the apartment for the hospital days ago. Nobody else in the apartment (or the building) had symptoms. The 7 people who entered the apartment could not have become infected. A lot more public education is necessary at all levels. - Mod.JW]

Dallas: cleaning problems
-------------------------
2 Oct 2014 (New York Times): More than a week after a Liberian man fell ill with Ebola and 4 days after he was placed in isolation at a hospital in Dallas, the apartment where he was staying with 4 other people had not been cleaned and the sheets and dirty towels he used while sick remained in the home, health officials acknowledged on Thursday [2 Oct 2014] afternoon ... -- more

[See: Interim Guidance for Environmental Infection Control in Hospitals for Ebola Virus:
"Limited laboratory studies under favorable conditions indicate that Ebola virus can remain viable on solid surfaces, with concentrations falling slowly over several days. In the only study to assess contamination of the patient care environment during an outbreak, virus was not detected in any of 33 samples collected from sites that were not visibly bloody... There is no epidemiologic evidence of Ebola virus transmission via either the environment or fomites [objects] that could become contaminated during patient care (e.g., bed rails, door knobs, laundry). However, given the apparent low infectious dose, potential of high virus titers in the blood of ill patients, and disease severity, higher levels of precaution are warranted to reduce the potential risk posed by contaminated surfaces in the patient care environment."

Cleaners turned away at Ebola patient's home, cleanup delayed
-------------------------------------------------------------
3 Oct 2014 (CNN): Brad Smith of the Cleaning Guys, which was hired to sanitize the apartment, said his company does not have the proper permits to transport hazardous waste on Texas highways. The company specializes in hazmat and biohazard cleaning services. Smith said authorities sent his crew away late Thursday [2 Oct 2014] before they entered the apartment and told them to come back with proper permits. It's unclear how long that will take. "The permit is being processed through DOT (the Department of Transportation) because it is a special permit," Smith said. "This is a unique situation. Once awarded, our hazmat teams will be allowed back inside to do their jobs."

D. was visiting his son and his son's mother in Dallas, said his half-brother. The woman told CNN's Anderson Cooper she is quarantined with one of her children under age 13 and 2 nephews in their 20s. She used bleach to clean her apartment, "but it's not clear to me how systematic the cleaning was," Cooper said.

About 50 under observation after Ebola diagnosis in Texas
---------------------------------------------------------
3 Oct 2014 (Reuters): Health officials in Dallas charged with checking the spread of Ebola have narrowed their focus to about 50 people who had direct or indirect contact with an infected Liberian traveler, including 10 at high risk who are being checked twice daily for symptoms. A cleanup crew began decontaminating the Dallas apartment where the man, D., had been staying before he was admitted to the hospital 5 days ago and where he remained in serious condition on Friday [3 Oct 2014].

4 people close to D. who were quarantined in the apartment in a northeastern section of the city "will be moved to another location soon," Dallas County Fire Marshal Robert De Los Santos told reporters. Earlier, the county said it was safe for them to remain there during the cleanup.

Unprotected workers cleaned up 'Ebola Vomit' in Dallas

3 Oct 2014 (Prison Planet): Image shows unprotected workers cleaning up 'Ebola Vomit' in Dallas

[Pressure water cleaning aerosolizes vomit. Contaminated areas needed to be cordoned off from passersby and cleaned by workers wearing gloves, boots and masks at a minimum. I hope these 2 workers are being followed up. - Mod.JW]

Apartment complex power washed
------------------------------
3 Oct 2014: Perhaps someone could comment on why the apartment complex is being power washed. 1st, is such extensive cleaning actually required, and 2nd, wouldn't power washing likely aerosolize any virus present and increase the risk of transmission?

[3] Germany ex Sierra Leone: 2nd evacuated case


Ebola Virus Disease, Germany, ex Sierra Leone, HCW
--------------------------------------------------
I would like to send you a reminder about the case of an international staff doctor working at Emergency ONG Ebola Treatment Centre in Sierra Leone who fell ill with ebolavirus and subsequently medevac'd to Germany. The Italian website of the ONG reporting as following:
http://www.emergency.it/comunicati-stampa/ebola-un-medico-di-emergency-in-sierra-leone-positivo-al-virus-2-ottobre-2014.html
BBC on Germany MEDEVAC: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29473623 [see below]

This also to highlight that despite the ebolavirus hit at the centre of USA's wealthiest region, other people and other countries are facing issues with infected [evacuated] patients.

3 Oct 2014 (BBC News): A hospital in the German city of Frankfurt-on-Main has taken in an Ebola patient after he was flown in during the night under tight security. After arriving on a medical flight from West Africa, the man was brought to Frankfurt University Hospital where he was placed in an isolation ward. He is a Ugandan doctor who worked with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. It is Germany's 2nd case, with a man undergoing treatment in Hamburg after arriving from West Africa in August [2014] ... Giving details of the sufferer, Hesse Minister of Social Affairs Stefan Gruettner said he had been working for an Italian aid organisation in Sierra Leone and had helped Ebola sufferers there before becoming infected himself.

[4] Prevention & false alarms


DC, Maryland & Virginia testing patients with Ebola-like symptoms
----------------------------------------------------------------
3 Oct 2014 (NBC): A patient is being evaluated for Ebola at Howard University Hospital in Washington, DC, a hospital spokesperson confirmed Friday [3 Oct 2014]. That person has been admitted to the hospital in stable condition and is isolated. The medical team is working with the CDC and other authorities to monitor the patient's condition ... There are no confirmed cases of Ebola in DC, said the statement ... Meanwhile, at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Maryland, a patient is in isolation with "flu-like symptoms and a travel history that matches criteria for possible Ebola," according to a statement from the hospital. Lab results indicate the patient has another illness, though the patient's Ebola status is not known ... And 2 Virginians are being tested for the disease after they met the travel criteria set by the CDC, according to NBC12 in Richmond. The patients were isolated from the general population, but were not ordered to be quarantined, NBC12 reported.

Liberia: airport screening defects fixed
----------------------------------------
3 Oct 2014 (IB Times UK): People infected with the Ebola virus in West Africa can avoid detection in airport screenings and board a plane with ibuprofen and lies, according to healthcare experts. Experts have called for more to be done to identify the virus in travellers, as the current screening methods are insufficient. "The fever-screening instruments run low and aren't that accurate," infection control specialist Sean Kaufman, president of the Atlanta-based biosafety company Behavioral-Based Improvement Solutions, told Reuters. "And people can take ibuprofen to reduce their fever enough to pass screening, and why wouldn't they? If it will get them on a plane so they can come to the United States and get effective treatment after they're exposed to Ebola, wouldn't you do that to save your life?" ...

Professor David Heymann, part of the international team who investigated the 1st outbreak of Ebola in the 1970s, is an expert of infectious diseases at the London Schools of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and explained that screenings are inaccurate. "You can't find it by screening, because people could be in an incubation period for days," he told IBTimes UK ... The arrival and subsequent hospitalisation of D. has highlighted the extent that US authorities are relying on West African officials to detect the virus. Connection airports between Ebola-affected countries and the USA also have to increase their methods of detection, experts have argued. Virologist Heinz Feldmann, of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Science magazine in September [2014] that staff carrying out screenings in Monrovia airport "don't really know how to use the devices." He said he saw screeners record temperatures of 32 C (90 F), which is so low it is "impossible for a living person."

Feldmann said that his colleagues who had recently returned from Liberia reported the checks had since improved.

Shares of the energy firm fell after the news.
