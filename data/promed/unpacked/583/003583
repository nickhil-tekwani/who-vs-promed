Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR) has confirmed yet another outbreak of bird flu in the Netherlands. In Grootschermer, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was found in broiler chicken from a poultry farm.

To prevent the virus from spreading, the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) culled all 107 000 animals at the site.

WBVR has determined the virus as highly pathogenic bird flu (HPAI) subtype H5N1 and will further investigate whether its genetic makeup is similar to HPAI H5N1 viruses that caused outbreaks in the Netherlands and Europe in 2021.

[The confirmation of HPAI H5N1 in Grootschermer (Noord-Holland) was initially published on the website of WVBR on Sat 30 Oct 2021. The said official source has published today (Mon 1 Nov 2021) an additional H5 outbreak, yet to be finally serotyped/genotyped, located in Assendelft (municipality of Zaanstad, province Noord-Holland), affecting laying hens on a small-scale holding. It is probably a highly pathogenic variant of bird flu. To prevent the spread of the virus, approximately 140 laying hens and 50 walking ducks are being removed from the infected site. The evacuation is being carried out by the Dutch Food and Commodity Authority (NVWA). Within a radius of 3 km [1.9 mi] around the farm is another poultry farm. This company is being investigated for bird flu. There are no other poultry farms within a 10 km [6.2 mi] radius of the infected farm (in Dutch, at https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/vogelgriep/nieuws/2021/11/01/vogelgriep-vastgesteld-bij-kleinschalige-houderij-in-assendelft).

The distance between Grootschermer and Assendelft is about 18.5 km [11.5 mi].

Recently, HPAI H5N1 was identified in a fox in north eastern Netherlands, on the German border (ProMED post 20211101.8699389; please refer to Mod.PMB's commentary regarding H5 in mammals). - Mod.AS
