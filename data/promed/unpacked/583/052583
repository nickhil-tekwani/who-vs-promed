Unusual, severe episode of agalactia in sheep, Lorraine (France): request for information from other regions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A number of sheep flocks in Lorraine [map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lorraine_in_France.svgare] are currently facing a severe episode of significant reduction or a total absence of lactation in ewes. The Departments of Meurthe-et-Moselle and Moselle seem particularly concerned. "The GDS [National Federation of Animal Health Protection Groups] and veterinary practitioners have developed a framework for investigations in cooperation with Prof Schelcher, Veterinary School, Toulouse.

The phenomenon has been observed since the beginning of the lambing season. On 14 Dec 2012, GDS Meurthe-et-Moselle identified agalactia in 15 out of a total of about 200 farms. Affected farms were visited, the attack rate of the lambing ewes was recorded as 50 to 100 percent. The reported cases appear scattered in the departments concerned, demonstrating absence of colostrum/milk during the 1st post-parturition days. This leads to the need to hand-feed the lambs. Lactation appears again (with or without therapeutic treatment) in the ewes 2-8 days post parturition.

No particular clinical symptoms have been seen in the ewes prior to the observed compromised lactation.

The established platform of investigation applies to veterinarians and farmers in other geographical regions to report similar observations to a given e-mail address (see source url).

[This is not a case of the infectious mycoplasma disease in sheep and goats called "contagious agalactiae", which, on top of its effect upon lactation, also causes ocular and joints (arthritic) changes.

Updated results of the surveillance and of the epidemiological investigation are anticipated with interest. It will be interesting to note if the puzzling lactation issue, appearing immediately after parturition and involving a high percentage of the lambing ewes in a non-negligible number of sheep flocks (breeds not specified) in Lorraine, is found to be related to any (subclinical?) infective agent or is rather of non-infectious nature (e.g., metabolic/nutritional). - Mod.AS
