Unexplained rash: Fifth disease?
--------------------------------
More than 200 students at Marsteller Middle School, in Manassas, Virginia,
have [been affected by an unidentified rash described as "little red
bumps." "I think we may have 'fifth disease', but we may have something
else viral", said Jared Florance, Prince William County's health director.
"Or it could be an allergic reaction. We have one kid with poison ivy. We
just don't have the information to say what it is or isn't."
Prince William Health Department officials said they have not called on the
CDC for help; rather they have asked the state's regional epidemiology
expert to help sort through the clues.

[Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, which presents as a mild rash
resolving in 7-10 days, is caused by _B19 virus_, a single stranded DNA
virus classified in the genus _Erythrovirus_ of the family _Parvoviridae_.
B19 virus occurs throughout the world and is usually endemic. In temperate
climates outbreaks are not uncommon, especially among primary school
children, and tend to occur in late winter to early summer. Over 50% of all
adults have been infected sometime during childhood and adolescence. About
20% of adults and children who are infected do not develop symptoms, and
those infected develop antibodies which provide lasting immunity. An adult
not previously infected can develop a rash, or joint pain or swelling, or
both. These symptoms usually resolve in a week or 2 but may last for a
longer period. B19 virus is normally transmitted by the respiratory route,
but it occurs at very high titre in the blood; consequently blood donations
and blood products have to be rigorously screened for the presence of this
virus. B19 virus targets erythroid precursor cells and patients with
chronic haemolytic anaemia are at high risk. B19 virus infection during
pregnancy is dangerous because the fetus can be infected transplacentally.
Consequently definitive diagnosis of the cause of the current outbreak is
an important matter. - Mod.CP
