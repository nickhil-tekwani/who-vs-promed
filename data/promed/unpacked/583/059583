The lab and 2 additional agency scientists were deployed Sat [4 Oct 2014] and join a Canadian team set up previously in the district of Kailahun in eastern Sierra Leone, near the borders of Guinea and Liberia, the Public Health Agency of Canada said. A 3rd scientist will leave on Tue [7 Oct 2014]. The team already on the ground will continue to provide rapid diagnostic support to help local health-care workers, producing results within hours. The 2nd team will work with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF -- Doctors Without Borders) to monitor the effectiveness of infection prevention measures, such as hand-washing stations, face masks and disposal sites... - more

[3] West Africa: Israel to send 3 mobile emergency clinics to the region

The Foreign Ministry's Mashav department, which is the Agency for International Development Cooperation, has decided to increase Israel's contribution to the international effort ... in response to the requests by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the World Health Organization, many governments and Israeli and international aid organizations. The clinics, which were manufactured here, were built in accordance with the WHO's standards and guidelines for the treatment of Ebola. A staff of medical experts to be attached to each clinic is to train local medical staffers in its operation and equipment. In addition, staff training is to focus on preventing the spread of the disease and raising awareness among populations with high potential for infection.

An Israeli team has already been sent to Cameroon, where it was favorably received by the local authorities. The ministry sent emergency equipment to the government of Sierra Leone, and in recent weeks, it shipped personal protection equipment to teams of the African Union.

[4] ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment

Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, 5th update, 29 Sep 2014
---------------------------------------------------------------
The options for risk reduction are:

- to reduce the risk of infection by avoiding non-essential travel into the affected areas and strictly following the EVD prevention measures in communities. As there is an increased risk of infection in healthcare facilities, visitors to the EVD affected countries should identify appropriate in-country healthcare resources prior to travelling;
- to reduce the risk of importation of Ebola viruses from affected countries into the EU, the WHO recommendations related to the declaration of a Public Health Event of International Concern (PHEIC) should be applied. Screening at the point of departure (exit screening) in the affected countries is likely to be more effective and less costly than screening of passengers at point of entry in EU/EEA countries (entry screening). Therefore, entry screening in the EU should be considered only for direct flights originating from EVD-affected countries where there is no evidence of effective exit screening; and
- to reduce the risk of transmission within the EU following importation of Ebola viruses, the following options are available: enhance information and communication to travellers departing from EVD-affected countries, raise awareness and sensitise healthcare providers in the EU about EVD, and support them with resources that will help them to identify and manage potential EVD patients.

The following resources support health providers in the EU in the identification and management of potential EVD patients:

- Assessment and planning for medical evacuation by air to the EU of patients with Ebola virus disease and people exposed to Ebola virus: http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/air-transport-EVD.pdf
- Case definitions for Ebola patients in the EU: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/ebola_marburg_fevers/EVDcasedefinition/Pages/default.aspx
- Algorithm for the laboratory diagnosis of Ebola virus disease:

Ebola kills 8 soldiers -- Kesselly Barracks deserted
----------------------------------------------------------
At least 8 soldiers, among them 2 commissioned officers and 2 medical staff, have reportedly lost their lives to the deadly Ebola virus disease (EVD), the Daily Observer has reliably learnt...

The deceased, according to our source, contracted Ebola recently at the Edward Binyan Kesseley (EBK) Barracks when a lady unsuspected of carrying the disease, visited one of the victims. The 'concubine' who visited the late soldier has also been victimized by the disease... "When she slept at the EBK, it was thereafter the soldiers contracted the disease, and could not survive despite "intensive treatment" at the various Ebola Treatment Units in Monrovia," our source disclosed.

This latest setback among the rank and file of the already sparse number of soldiers has reportedly created panic among them, to the extent that some of them have begun to desert the various barracks across the country.
Based on this information, the Daily Observer yesterday contacted Defense Assistant Minister for Public Affairs, David K. Dahn, who neither confirmed nor denied the report...

The latest deaths of the soldiers sadly add to several para-military and other security personnel, including officers of the Liberian National Police (LNP), that have died. Others, including close family members, had been quarantined and subsequently released, having completed their 21 days isolation.
