2023Nov05.pdf>

As of today [24 Nov], there has been a total of 491 cases including 126
related deaths. The sharp increase in number of cases compared to the number
of 457 cases reported on 21 Nov 2005 is due to the availability of data, and
not to a factual increase in cases. 4 new cases were reported from Abujibeha
and Kadugli. 28.5 percent of all cases were under 15 years old. (See figure 1,
URL: <http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/Yellow%20fever%20outbreak%20update%
2023Nov05.pdf>). The case fatality rate is 25.7 percent (compared to 29.2
percent on 16 Nov 2005).
The most affected localities are Dilling, Abu Jibeha and Rashad. New cases
were reported from Abyei, Lagawa and elsewhere. A total of 7 localities are
affected at the moment[see figure 2 at the URL above]. There is a potential
risk for the disease to spread to neighbouring states, as some patients have
sought treatment in El Obeid Hospital in North Kordofan.
Of the total number of suspected cases, 35 percent were reported with
hemorrhagic fever, while the other 65 percent were diagnosed as mild cases
with fever signs [see figure 3 at the same URL].
WHO is looking into supporting 23 of the 40 official surveillance sites [by
providing means of] communication, as these sites are still unable to report
due to lack of telephone or radio.
A patient database was created at the State Ministry of Health (SMoH) with WHO
technical support. All patients infected with yellow fever are recorded by
name, age group, home address, locality, main symptoms at presentation and
outcome.
Vector control
--------------
SMoH, supported by WHO and UNICEF, carried out aerial spraying in Kauda,
Dilling and Talodi localities. UNMIS carried out ground spraying around the UN
agencies and NGO compounds in Kadugli, Kauda, Umm Serdiba and Mirri, as well
as in Dilling town and Julud county.
Messages on how to increase personal protection against mosquito bites and on
fumigation are continuously disseminated through local radio and television
channels.
The Sudanese Red Crescent mobilized 150 volunteers for house to house visits
for spraying, vector control and health education in Kadugli and spraying by
car in Dilling.
Vaccination campaign
--------------------
UNICEF is in the process of purchasing 1 700 000 doses of yellow fever vaccine
through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for
Yellow Fever Control in close collaboration with WHO. 240 000 doses have
already been purchased and are expected to arrive soon. In addition, 64 000
doses were mobilized by UNICEF from Nairobi, Kenya to Kauda, of which 1000
doses were delivered to the UNIS clinic for the humanitarian workers.
A total of 800 000 doses of yellow fever vaccine are expected to be mobilized
by MSF-France, of which 100 000 doses have already arrived and 200 000 doses
are expected to arrive tomorrow.
Case management
---------------
3 therapeutic centres in Abu Gebiha, Rashad (run by MSF France) and in Julud
(run by MEDAIR) are fully operational. MEDAIR is the NGO with most clinics in
South Kordofan.
The Federal Ministry of Health has mobilized 12 medical doctors to Kadugli to
support SMoH with the treatment and care of yellow fever patients. The medical
doctors will be trained in proper yellow fever case management according to
WHO guidelines.
UNMIS is supporting Habila Hospital with medical staff.
Plan of action
--------------
Mapping of all affected locations with GPS coordinates is almost completed.
Training as part of the micro-plan for the vaccination campaign will be
initialized one week before the arrival of the vaccines.
