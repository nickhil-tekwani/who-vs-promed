A worker's fellow dormitory mates clustered around the bed where he
was discovered dead on Sunday [28 Dec 2008]. They had at 1st thought
he was asleep, and it was only after paramedics examined him that they
realized he had died. Subsequently, 10 foreign workers who were
hospitalized with chickenpox on Sunday [28 Dec 2008] are on the mend,
the [Singapore] Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) said yesterday [Mon
29 Dec 2009]. They have been given medication to ease their fever and
to relieve the itch from their rashes. Some of them may be discharged
from the CDC soon, said its clinical director, Associate Professor Leo
Yee Sin.

The workers, all Bangladeshi men aged between 20 and 35, were living
in 2 dormitories in Tagore Industrial Avenue. They were admitted
after another 28-year-old worker was found dead in one of the dorms
on Sunday [28 Dec 2008]. The deceased worker's dormitory mates said
he had been sick with chickenpox for about 6 days. Police are
investigating the cause of death.

Chickenpox can become deadly if it infects many organs in the body --
especially the lungs, liver and nervous system -- and causes them to
fail, said Prof. Leo. With their immune systems weakened by
chickenpox, patients could contract another infection and die from
the combined effects.

At the deceased worker's living quarters in 468 Tagore Industrial
Avenue yesterday [Mon 29 Dec 2009], some of his friends recounted the
events of Sunday [28 Dec 2009] morning. They told The Straits Times
that a lorry was waiting to take the sick man to a clinic, but no one
wanted to disturb him as he was sleeping. They said they realized he
was dead only after paramedics from the Singapore Civil Defense Force
(SCDF) examined him and pronounced him dead at 1:38 PM. The SCDF said
they had received a call from a member of the public about him. The
paramedics also checked other workers who were feeling unwell and
ended up taking 10 of them to the CDC.

Workers interviewed by The Straits Times said they worked for Gates
Offshore, a ship repair and dormitory services company. They said the
deceased man was also a company employee. According to them, their
main recourse when they fall ill is to call their employer and hope
to be attended to. They said that their quarters had neither a sick
bay nor a supervisor to check on their health. Company Director Paul
Lee could not be reached yesterday [Mon 29 Dec 2009] for comment.

Earlier media reports said he denied the workers' allegations and
that they are checked every morning to see whether they were unwell.
Another employer who has 18 workers in the same make-shift dorm at
Tagore Industrial Avenue said he is moving them out soon, as he has
been informed by the Manpower Ministry that the quarters are not
approved.

[Chickenpox is highly infectious and spreads from person to person by
direct contact or through the air from an infected person's coughing
or sneezing or from aerosolization of virus from skin lesions.

Chickenpox (varicella) is the primary infection with _Varicella
zoster virus_ (VZV). It is a highly contagious rash illness
transmitted by airborne or droplet pathways. The usual incubation
period is 14-16 days (range 10-21 days). 2nd cases of varicella have
been reported in immuno-competent persons but are rare. Following
varicella, VZV establishes latency in sensory nerve ganglia. The
virus can reactivate later in life, causing herpes zoster (shingles),
usually localized to one to 3 dermatomes. Transmission of VZV to a
susceptible person occurs through contact with either a person with
varicella or, less commonly, a person with herpes zoster.

Many of the deaths and complications from chickenpox occur in
previously healthy children and adults. From 1990 to 1994, before a
vaccine was available, about 50 children and 50 adults died from
chickenpox every year (in the USA); most of these persons were
healthy or did not have a medical illness (such as cancer) that
placed them at higher risk of getting severe chickenpox. The majority
of the healthy adults who died from chickenpox probably contracted
the disease from their unvaccinated children.

Before the availability of varicella vaccine (available in the USA
since 1995), varicella was endemic, with virtually all persons being
infected by adulthood. Since implementation of the varicella
vaccination program in the USA, incidence has declined in all age
groups, with the greatest decline among children aged 1-4 years. Data
from passive and active surveillance have indicated a decline in
varicella cases of 70-84 percent from 1995 onwards. Varicella and
herpes zoster occur worldwide, but varicella vaccine is routinely
used for vaccination of children in only a few countries.
Additionally, exposure to herpes zoster, while less common than
varicella, poses a risk for varicella infection.

In temperate climates, in the absence of vaccination, most varicella
cases are reported among preschool- and school-aged children during
winter and spring. In tropical areas, VZV infection occurs later
during childhood and adolescence, resulting in higher susceptibility
among adults compared with temperate climates. The reasons for this
difference in disease epidemiology are unclear. In the outbreak in
Singapore described in the above report, the stressful living
conditions of the affected workers may have been a determining factor
in the spread of disease.
