The emergency meeting of EU member states' chief veterinary officers was
convened to allow the European Commission to detail its plan, which outlaws
the sale of poultry, pork and cattle products from farms suspected of using
animal feed containing the cancer-causing chemical dioxin.
"The Commission's decision was endorsed by the member states," senior
Commission farm official Alejandro Checchi Lang told a news briefing.
Checchi also said the Belgian authorities had informed the committee that
1,400 farms -- rearing poultry, pigs and cattle -- may have received the
feed, tainted by contaminated fat, a figure larger than the previous
estimate of 1,000. According to recent Commission data, there are some
70,000 farms in Belgium, but the total includes many small holdings.
Checchi also said the Commission's decision requiring Belgian exporters to
certify their products dioxin free and the authorities' failure to draw up
full documentation on where the suspect feed had gone, meant trade was
effectively on hold.
The dioxin is believed to have spread to animal feed from a Belgian fats
and oils processing company but exactly how the chemical entered the
production chain remains unclear.
Checchi said some 98 tons of fat may have been contaminated and this had
been used to produce 1,060 tons of feed.
Monday Belgium banned butter sales because it is a high fat food, making it
particularly susceptible to retaining dioxin -- a toxic chemical, which
remains lodged in the body for years.
The European Commission has been outraged by Belgium's failure to notify it
of the poisoning quickly -- the authorities first became aware of dioxin
contamination in late April. Legal action against Belgium has not been
ruled out.
Meat sales in Belgium have plunged and Renman Group, the country's largest
butchers' chain, said its shops would stay shut for three or four days this
week.
However, sales of alternatives have soared. "Rabbit and lamb sales have
more than doubled -- and fish sales have trebled," Jean-Pierre Roelands,
commercial director of supermarket chain Colruyt, told reporters.

Uncertainty over who will pay for Belgium's food contamination crisis has
paralysed both the country's farmers and the system for disposing of the
millions of products that may be tainted.
On Saturday the Belgian Agriculture Ministry exempted three abattoirs from
a 10-day old ban on the slaughter of all chickens, so battery farms could
dispose of birds which needed to be killed before they grew too big and
suffocated each other. But by Monday evening not a single bird had been
taken to slaughter. A carcass desiccating plant and a hazardous waste
incinerator chosen to destroy contaminated poultry, eggs, pork, beef,
butter and products made from them, also remained idle.
"The government is focusing on destroying animals and banning sales before
they even think about compensating farmers. So many producers are waiting
to see if their farms are declared free of contamination so they can put
their poultry back on the market," Alain De Bruyn, an expert working with
the farming union Alliance Agricole, told Reuters.
"Farms where dioxin-tainted feedstuffs have been discovered are probably
killing the birds on the farm before sending them to be destroyed. It's
cheaper than taking them to the abattoir."
"The farmers have been told they have to put up 18 Belgian francs ($0.46)
for every chicken destroyed. They shouldn't have to pay. It's not their
fault," said Pierre Herelixka, director of one of the abattoirs authorised
to recommence slaughtering.
Herelixka said he had no idea how much the crisis -- caused by the
discovery of animal feed tainted with the cancer-causing chemical dioxin --
would cost but said his abattoir could not survive more than another week
of paralysis.
"We've suffered losses too. There are 55 workers laid off, there are no
clients. It's a complete mess," Herelixka said.
The government, facing a general election in six days' time, is expected to
publish on Monday evening a list of farms that used animal feed containing
dioxin-laced animal fat supplied by Flemish animal fats processing company
Verkest.
But De Bruyn said that while investigations were focusing on Verkest, it
was wrong to assume the health scare was limited to the company at the
center of the probe.
"It's wider than Verkest," he said. "There are two Dutch firms and a
Belgian one that supplied Verkest (with fats). If their products are
contaminated, the problem could be European, not just Belgian."
In addition, he said, there was a serious problem of illegal trade in
animal fats and feed, which made it well nigh impossible to identify all
farms using dioxin-poisoned products.
Indaver waste incinerator near Antwerp, which will destroy the mountains of
potentially contaminated food, said it had no idea how much the operation
would cost. It said the incinerated waste would be dumped on monitored
landfill sites.
