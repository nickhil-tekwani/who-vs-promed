Over 200 people, about half of them children, have been hospitalised in
eastern Kazakhstan with acute intestinal infection, national health care
authorities said on Wednesday.
Kazakhstan's chief sanitary doctor Yerkin Durumbetov said the poisoning had
been caused by low-quality milk products.
A state of emergency has been imposed in Zyryanovsky District.
