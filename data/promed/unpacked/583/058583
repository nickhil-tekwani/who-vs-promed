CDC Warns of Tamiflu Resistant Flu Bug
--------------------------------------
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) warned in an official health
advisory to doctors that the most common flu bug
that is spreading in the U.S. is resistant to the
flu drug Tamiflu [oseltamiver]. The
Tamiflu-resistant virus is the flu bug most
commonly seen so far this year [2008] and has
been detected in 12 states so far, mostly in
Hawaii and Texas. The strain is not more or less
dangerous than other flu strains. Medical experts
say Tamiflu resistance was not unexpected though
the speed of Tamiflu resistance was surprising.
Last year 11 percent of type A H1N1 flu bugs were
resistant while this year, 49 out of 50 H1N1 viruses have been resistant.

CDC Director Julie Gerberding, MD, said, "There
is no crystal ball here. We can't predict if this
strain will end up being the most important one
this year. It could fizzle out. ... We're giving
a 'heads-up' to the clinicians, but we are not
making drastic changes in our treatment and prevention recommendations."

There are no ways of knowing this early in the
flu season if Tamiflu resistant flu bug will be
this year's predominant cause of the flu. In
humans 3 different flu bugs are in circulation,
with type A H3N2 strain, one type B strain and
the resistant bug is the type A H1N1 strain.
Gerberding said the current flu vaccine protects
against all 3 of the viruses and is an excellent
match for the drug resistant bug.

Tamiflu which can run USD 100 a box, has been the
most attractive treatment because it is taken in
pill form and can be given to children as young
as one year old. There are alternatives for the
flu such as Relenza, which the Tamiflu-resistant
flu bug is still sensitive to as well as older
drugs such as [the adamantanes] Flumadine and
Symmetrel, although resistance to these drugs has
been steadily increasing among type A flu bugs.

Relenza which comes in an inhaler cannot be used
for children younger than 7 for treatment, and
those younger than 5 can't use it for prevention.
Moreover, Relenza sometimes causes lung spasms,
so it can't be used by people with lung problems.

Joseph S. Bresee, MD, chief of the epidemiology
and prevention branch of the CDC's flu division
said, "Even among hospital patients with the flu,
more than half do not receive antiviral therapy.
Tamiflu and Relenza are relatively underused at
this point. He said that the current warning may
actually see an increase in the use of flu drugs
by increasing awareness in doctors on how to use them.

[A more precise statement of the situation at the
the middle of December 2008 is the following.

Europe - (from the Cumulative virological
situation Â­ 2008-2009 season (weeks 40-50/2008).
See the EISS Weekly Electronic bulletin:
<http://www.eiss.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi>:

"No antiviral resistance against neuraminidase
inhibitors was detected in the 27 A (H3N2) virus
isolates tested so far this season. Of the 26
A(H3N2) isolates that were also tested for
adamantanes susceptibility, all were resistant.
In addition, out of the 20 A (H1N1) virus
isolates tested for resistance against
neuraminidase inhibitors, 19 were
oseltamivir-resistant, but all were sensitive to
zanamivir and only 1 of 11 tested was resistant
to adamantanes. The one type B isolate tested was
sensitive to both oseltamivir and zanamivir."

United States - (from Update: Influenza Activity
--- United States, Sep 28--Nov 29, 2008). See: MMWR Weekly 12 Dec 2008
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5749a3.htm>.

"With limited influenza activity in the United
States, few viruses have been available for
antiviral resistance testing. Since 28 Sep 2008,
39 influenza viruses from 11 states have been
tested for antiviral resistance; of the viruses
tested, 28 (71.8 percent) were collected from
only 2 states. Preliminary data show that 24 of
the 25 influenza A (H1N1) isolates tested were
resistant to oseltamivir; all H1N1 isolates were
sensitive to zanamivir. All 5 influenza A (H3N2)
and the 9 influenza B isolates tested were
sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir. 25
influenza A (H1N1) isolates and 5 influenza A
(H3N2) isolates were tested for adamantane
resistance. All influenza A (H1N1) isolates were
sensitive to adamantanes, and all influenza A
(H3N2) isolates tested were resistant to
adamantanes. The adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses."

Ths the prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant
influenza A virus is not dissimilar throughout
the northern hemisphere at least. - Mod.CP]
