Workers at factories that make food flavorings are at risk of a rare
and life-threatening lung disease called bronchiolitis obliterans,
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on
Thursday [26 Apr 2007].
But the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is not
yet paying proper attention to the issue, an expert focusing on the cases said.
The hard-to-treat condition causes vague symptoms such as cough and
shortness of breath, but steadily worsens, the CDC said in its weekly
report on death and disease. It "is known to be caused by exposure to
noxious gases in occupational settings and has been described in
workers in the microwave-popcorn industry who were exposed to
artificial butter-flavoring chemicals, including diacetyl," the report read.
The CDC described the cases of 2 California workers, a 29-year-old
man and a 40-year-old woman, who became progressively sicker. The
woman eventually had to quit her job because of illness. Neither
smoked. [Chances are the report does not indicate if there were other
underlying diseases. - Mod.TG] Both were eventually diagnosed with
bronchiolitis obliterans. Diacetyl, which produces a butter flavor,
was the main suspect although the CDC team said other flavorings
might have played a role. "Neither worker was employed in the
microwave-popcorn industry; both were workers in the flavor
manufacturing industry, which produces artificial butter flavoring
and other flavors such as cherry, almond, praline, jalapeno, and
orange," the report reads. Since then, 5 other workers in the same
industry have been found to have the lung disease.
OSHA said this week it was starting a program to deal with the
problem in popcorn workers. David Michaels of the George Washington
University School of Public Health and Health Services, who has
closely tracked the issue, said the CDC had already helped popcorn
factories deal with the problem. "So 2 days ago OSHA issued a press
announcement that they are making a national emphasis program on
popcorn factories, which I think is quite cynical because the popcorn
factories are one of the few places that probably have successfully
addressed the problem," Michaels said in a telephone interview.
Safe occupational exposure levels for diacetyl and many other
flavoring chemicals have not been established, the CDC noted.
"Because the manufacture of flavorings involves more than 2000
chemicals, workers in the general flavor-manufacturing industry are
exposed to more chemicals than workers in the microwave popcorn
industry, which primarily uses butter flavorings," the report adds.

[Diacetyl has several synonyms Biacetyl; 2,3-Butanedione;
2,3-Butadione; 2,3-Diketobutane; Dimethyldiketone; Dimethylglyoxal;
and Glyoxal. Likely there are a few others as well.
According to OSHA, potential symptoms are listed as: eye, mucous
membrane, respiratory system, skin irritation; persistent cough,
phlegm production, wheezing, dyspnea (shortness of breath); unusual
fatigue; episodes of mild fever or generalized aches; severe skin
rashes. Irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, and there is
suspected cumulative lung damage such as bronchiolitis obliterans.
No IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health concentration) has
been established. One of 4 rats died after a 6-hour exposure to
vapors from heated (55 deg C / 131 deg F) artificial butter flavoring
containing 285 ppm (parts per million) diacetyl (64 percent of total
VOCs -- volatile organic compounds), but no deaths occurred among
groups of 6 rats exposed to 203 ppm diacetyl (68 percent of total
VOCs) or 352 ppm diacetyl (61 percent of total VOCs) (Hubbs et al.,
2002). Certainly, this data leads to confusing results.
A cause-effect relationship between diacetyl and bronchiolitis
obliterans has not been established. Food-processing workers with
this lung disease were also exposed to other volatile agents (Kanwal
et al., 2006; Kreiss et al., 2002; Kullman et al., 2005; Lockey et
al., 2002; NIOSH 2004, 2006).
Diacetyl is known to react with the amino acid arginine in proteins
(Riordan, 1979) and inhibits enzymes that are important for
protecting cells from oxidative damage, such as superoxide dismutase
(Borders et al., 1985) and glutathione reductase (Boggaram and
Mannervik, 1982).
There are many issues surrounding the butter flavoring that are not
clear. Certainly, if the workers are exposed to concentrations of
various chemicals respiratory and eye protection should be provided.
The MSDS (material safety data sheet) for diacetyl provides that
respiratory and eye protection should be provided.
One could argue that diacetyl is a by-product and not a product
intentionally brought into the processing plants. Likewise, diacetyl
can be the product of some fermentation. It is responsible for the
butterscotch flavoring or buttery flavorings in some alcoholic
drinks. As a product for consumption, it is classified by the FDA
(U.S. Food and Drug Administration) as "generally recognized as safe."
Bronchiolitis obliterans, a morphologic descriptor and
clinicopathologic syndrome, is the irreversible blocking of the small
airways (bronchioles) by granulation tissue and inflammation. The
inflammation tissue is not specific in histological terms. The
granulation that blocks the terminal bronchioles can also be seen in
interstitial pneumonia, infectious pneumonia, aspirations, and other
processes that result from a scarring in the lungs. The symptoms are
cough, dyspnea, and fever. It results in obstructive lung disease.
This disease may be associated with a number of toxics and some
conditions such as smoking and/or cocaine use. Other conditions may
be cancers, or some immune deficiency syndrome.
The article above only tells us the subjects of the case study were
not smokers. There may be other underlying medical conditions that
were not presented here. Certainly, diacetyl has toxic issues but the
levels that are toxic seem difficult to determine.
