[Anthrax outbreaks in Europe at this time of year are usually due to
contaminated feed, as the weather is too severe for animals to be out
grazing. This report is typical of such an event.

Previous Croatian outbreaks were in October of 2007 with a single
death in Zadarska (immediately north of Splitsko-Dalmatinska), with
herd size essentially not provided, and in 2006 in Sisacko-Moslavaka
(central Croatia) with 10 bovine cases in a herd of 18 animals. The
adjoining country of Bosnia & Herzegovina is similarly sporadically afflicted.

This is one of those instances in which a genomic investigation would
identify the probable country of origin for any contaminated feed if
it wasn't already listed on the feed sack. There are no prior reports
by ProMED of anthrax in Croatia. - Mod.MHJ]
