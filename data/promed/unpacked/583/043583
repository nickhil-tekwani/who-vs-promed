In Mayotte, the number of cases of Rift Valley fever is decreasing. A total of 124 animal foci and 141 human cases have been reported since the 1st cases occurred at the end of November 2018. A sharp decline in human and animal cases has been observed in recent weeks.

[Although the incidence of human and animal cases is decreasing, the outbreak continues. In the report of 3 Jun 2019, the CHM laboratory reported 137 human cases of RVF and 123 outbreaks of sick animals (including 97 cattle and 24 small ruminants). Now, there are 124 foci of sick animals (99 cattle and 25 small ruminants) and 141 human cases.

The report above makes no predictions as to when this outbreak may be brought to an end. Recommendations and requirements have been issued in the past 5 months that should help to reduce the number of human and animal cases. As Mod.AS noted in an earlier post, a French delegation included the following comment in its presentation of 21 Mar 2019: "What about vaccination? To date, no vaccine has been authorized in the EU." Such authorization deserves early consideration. It would be of interest to know what role, if any, mosquito vectors are playing in transmission of RVF virus during the current outbreak. If _Aedes_ mosquitoes are involved, there is a risk of transovarial transmission of the virus that can persist for months in mosquito eggs with resumption of transmission when those eggs hatch and infected adult female mosquitoes emerge. - Mod.TY
