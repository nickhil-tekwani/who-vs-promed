[2] Virus promotes mosquito feeding
Date: Tue 18 Jan 2022
Source: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA (PNAS) [edited]
https://www.pnas.org/content/119/3/e2117589119


ref: Wei Xiang BW, Saron WAA, Stewart JC, et al. Dengue virus infection modifies mosquito blood-feeding behavior to increase transmission to the host. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2022; 119(3): e2117589119
-----------------------------------------------
Significance
------------
Because dengue viruses are spread by mosquitoes during biting, transmission capacity depends on mosquito-biting behavior. For this reason, it is critical to understand how infection in mosquitoes influences biting. To answer this question, we deployed a multidisciplinary approach including high-resolution, multivariate biting behavior monitoring on mice, in vivo transmission assay, and mathematical modeling. We demonstrated that infected mosquitoes are more attracted to mice and bite more often to get the same amount of blood as uninfected mosquitoes. While the effect of increased attraction to host on transmission capacity is trivial, we showed that an increased number of bites results in successive transmission. Eventually, we calculated that the infection-induced behavior changes tripled the transmission capacity of mosquitoes.

Abstract
--------
Mosquito blood-feeding behavior is a key determinant of the epidemiology of dengue viruses (DENV), the most prevalent mosquitoborne viruses. However, despite its importance, how DENV infection influences mosquito blood-feeding and, consequently, transmission remains unclear. Here, we developed a high-resolution, video-based assay to observe the blood-feeding behavior of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes on mice. We then applied multivariate analysis on the high-throughput, unbiased data generated from the assay to ordinate behavioral parameters into complex behaviors. We showed that DENV infection increases mosquito attraction to the host and hinders its biting efficiency, the latter resulting in the infected mosquitoes biting more to reach similar blood repletion as uninfected mosquitoes. To examine how increased biting influences DENV transmission to the host, we established an in vivo transmission model with immunocompetent mice and demonstrated that successive short probes result in multiple transmissions. Finally, to determine how DENV-induced alterations of host-seeking and biting behaviors influence dengue epidemiology, we integrated the behavioral data within a mathematical model. We calculated that the number of infected hosts per infected mosquito, as determined by the reproduction rate, tripled when mosquito behavior was influenced by DENV infection. Taken together, this multidisciplinary study details how DENV infection modulates mosquito blood-feeding behavior to increase vector capacity, proportionally aggravating DENV epidemiology. By elucidating the contribution of mosquito behavioral alterations on DENV transmission to the host, these results will inform epidemiological modeling to tailor improved interventions against dengue.

[Multiple feeding by dengue virus infected _Aedes aegypti_, more frequent than with uninfected mosquitoes, is an extremely important factor in the overall transmission frequency of these viruses. The study above shows that infected mosquitoes feed 3 times more frequently than uninfected mosquitoes, significantly increasing the number of dengue infected people per infected mosquito. - Mod.TY]

[3] Cuba: _Aedes aegypti_ control
Date: Thu 14 Jan 2022
Source: World Nuclear News [edited]
https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Nuclear-technique-cuts-mosquito-numbers-in-Cuban-t


A pilot trial of a nuclear technique in a neighbourhood of the Cuban capital Havana reduced mosquito numbers by up to 90% last year [2021]. Early reports show that cases of mosquito-borne diseases were completely eliminated in the last 2 months of the trial.

In Cuba, like in most tropical countries, dengue is a growing problem. Transmitted by the mosquito species _Aedes aegypti_, this viral infection causes high fever, muscle and joint pains, skin rashes, and, in the most severe cases, death. Globally, the number of dengue cases reported to the World Health Organisation has increased 8-fold over the last 2 decades.

"In Cuba, controlling _Ae. aegypti_ is a national priority," said René Gato Armas, an entomologist and head of the sterile insect technique (SIT) group at Cuba's Pedro Kourí Tropical Medicine Institute. "After a major dengue epidemic in 1981, the government deployed an intensive national programme based on conventional methods which almost eradicated the mosquito in the late 1980s. Since then, however, epidemic outbreaks from imported cases have been frequent. Currently, dengue is considered an endemic disease in Cuba." He noted the indiscriminate use of insecticides has also triggered resistance to insecticides in _Ae. aegypti_.

SIT is an approach to insect population control relying on the release of sterilised male mosquitos. Irradiation, such as with gamma rays and X-rays, is used to sterilise mass-reared insects so that, while they remain sexually competitive, they cannot produce offspring.

For the last 5 years, Gato Armas has been working closely with experts at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) to collect baseline data and develop the pilot SIT trial as an alternative to mosquito control efforts that are declining in their efficacy and are damaging to the environment.

A pilot trial of a SIT campaign was conducted between April and August 2020 in an area of 50 hectares [153.6 acres] in El Cano, an isolated neighbourhood of southwest Havana. Arroyo Arenas, another neighbourhood of similar size, was used as an untreated control site. In the pilot trial, almost 1.3 million sterile male mosquitoes were released. Male mosquitos do not carry dengue, bite, or feed on blood.

The IAEA supported Cuba in attaining equipment to separate male and female mosquitoes ahead of irradiation and release and helped equip mosquito rearing facilities. Prior to the trial, Cuba had little capacity in insect rearing and the IAEA supported Cuban fellows to be sent for training on the technique in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and at the IAEA laboratories in Austria.

"Using the SIT for mosquitoes is relatively new anywhere in the world, and pilot trials like this one show how promising they can be," said Rui Cardoso Pereira, head of the insect pest control section at the Joint FAO/IAEA Centre of Nuclear Techniques for Food and Agriculture.

"National institutions can now effectively implement the SIT and will soon be able to support other countries in this technique," said Raquel Scamilla Andreo Aledo, the IAEA's programme management officer for Cuba.

Gato Armas said that it was possible that by the end of 2022 the project study area will increase, but it will require upgrades to equipment, including an automated 'sex-sorter', to reduce time-intensive labour and bring down costs.

The success of the sterile male technique for control of _Aedes aegypti_ in these Cuban pilot trials is very encouraging. Control of _Ae. aegypti_ populations through insecticide application or manual elimination of breeding sites has not been efficient or provided a permanent reduction of these vector mosquitoes. Trials of a variety of measures to reduce dengue transmission by these mosquitoes are underway including the release of genetically modified mosquitoes that prevent larva maturation, the introduction of _Wolbachia_ to block initiation of dengue virus infection in the mosquito midgut, and release of sterile males, as described in the report and reference above. It is going to be interesting to learn if any or all of these approaches will be logistically feasible and cost-effective. - Mod.TY]
