Caribbean:
- St Lucia. 23 Jun 2011. Public health officials have warned of
"disturbing" levels of dengue fever cases on the island. Public health
officials attributed the exceptionally high number of infections to
the rainy weather in the aftermath of Hurricane Tomas in 2010, they
told journalists yesterday [22 Jun 2011]. Last month [May 2011], there
were over 40 recorded cases of dengue fever, [the virus of] which is
spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. So far this year [2011], there
were 169 reported cases of dengue fever as compared to 95 cases in
2010 and only 18 in 2009, she said.
