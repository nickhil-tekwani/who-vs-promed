Red tide has closed shellfishing beds in Eastham and Orleans
An outbreak of potentially toxic red tide has closed all shellfishing beds
in Eastham and Orleans. Michael Hickey, chief shellfish biologist for the
state Division of Marine Fisheries, said Wednesday the beds will remain
closed until at least Tuesday.
Red tide contains a naturally occurring toxin dangerous to humans in high
concentrations. Hickey said the levels found in samples taken Tuesday
showed 118 micrograms of the toxin per 100 grams of mussel meat. State
regulations require closures when toxin levels reach 80 micrograms.
Hickey said the algae producing the toxin normally show up later in the
spring, when water and air temperatures are on the rise. He said the Cape
Cod red tide is the first he has heard of anywhere in New England this year.
The toxin, paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, is produced by a
planktonic, microscopic algae. In large concentrations, when the algae
bloom, it can turn water a reddish hue. The closure only affects bivalves
mussels, clams, quahogs, oysters and scallops. Lobsters, crabs and shrimp
are not subject to the closure, Hickey said.---
