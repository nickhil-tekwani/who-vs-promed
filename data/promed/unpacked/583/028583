African swine fever in Namibia
-------------------------------
I would like to correct some wrong, or unclear, impressions about the
transmission of African swine fever virus that appeared in posting
20050107.0056 about African swine fever in Namibia. I am sure that
something went wrong in the transcription of Dr. Huebschle's communication,
as I know he will be familiar with the well known facts of the sylvatic
cycle of the virus between warthogs and soft ticks (eyeless tampans) of the
_Ornithodoros moubata_ complex.
Transmission of the virus from warthogs to domestic pigs is entirely via
the bites of infected ticks, unless the circumstances were very unusual.
Warthogs over the age of 2 months are most unlikely to be viraemic and do
not therefore shed virus.
The "piglets" mentioned are of course warthog piglets, which is unclear
from the report. Neonatal warthogs spend the 1st 4-6 weeks of their lives
in the burrows, which are populated by large numbers of _Ornithodoros_
ticks, some of which are likely to be infected with ASF virus. The ticks
feed on the warthog piglets, which develop high viraemia, although they do
not show any signs of disease.
Once a domestic pig has been bitten by an infected tick, the rest of the
herd will rapidly be infected, as pigs are excellent multipliers and
shedders of the virus.
The separation between domestic pigs and warthogs is therefore mainly to
prevent the domestic pigs from being bitten by infected ticks. Although the
ticks normally feed rapidly and drop off the warthogs in the burrows,
fairly large numbers of ticks, in particular nymphs, have been found on
warthogs.
In the control zone in South Africa, we have seen that warthogs may
actually be attracted to sites where pigs are kept, if the separation is
inadequate, because it gives them access to feed and water, and they may
burrow under fences.
Feeding offal from hunted warthogs to domestic pigs is obviously also not a
good idea, because the skin, with any ticks that may be attached, could
form part of the offal. Virus may also be present in spleen and lymph nodes.
This information can also be found in the following references:

free-living hosts in Africa. Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research,
52, 201-209.

livestock, with special reference to southern Africa. Oxford University
Press, Cape Town. Vol. 1, 568-599.
The information in this chapter is fully updated in the 2nd edition of the
above book: Penrith, M.-L., Thomson, G.R. & Bastos, A.D.S. 2004. It should
be available very soon as the launch is on 2 Feb 2005! [Good to hear that
the long awaited 2nd edition of this excellent textbook is forthcoming. -
