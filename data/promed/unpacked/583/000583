Emerging _Streptococcus suis_ threat mainly related to occupational exposure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Streptococcus suis_, a gram-positive bacterium
that is endemic in swine in the United States,
appears to cause more human infections than has
been documented previously, particularly in
people who are in close contact with swine.
In a report at the annual International
Conference on Diseases in Nature Communicable to
Man, held [in Madison, Wisconsin] last week
[12-14 Aug 2007], Dr. Tara C. Smith described
findings from an investigation of whether _S.
suis_ is underreported or misdiagnosed as a
zoonotic pathogen. In humans, the disease can
cause septicemia, pneumonia, endocarditis,
arthritis, and permanent hearing loss.
The 1st recognized human case of _S. suis_
infection was reported in Denmark in 1968, Dr.
Smith said, and although the disease is more
common in Southeast Asia, sporadic human cases
have been reported in the UK, The Netherlands,
Germany, Croatia, New Zealand, and Greece. The
1st human case in the US was in 2006 in an adult male farmer in New York.
A 2005 outbreak in China led to more than 200
human cases with about 20 percent mortality. In
that outbreak, Dr. Smith noted, the presentation
was unusual, with many cases of toxic shock
syndrome. She added that there is an ongoing
outbreak in Viet Nam, with 45 cases and at least 2 deaths at latest count.
The study by Dr. Smith and colleagues at the
University of Iowa's Center for Emerging
Infectious Diseases looked at the seroprevalence
of _S. suis_ antibodies in 73 workers who were
regularly exposed to swine (farmers,
veterinarians, and meat packers) versus a control
group of 67 staff and students at the university.
The researchers found that the exposed
individuals had higher overall levels of
antibodies to serotype 2 (one of 2 serotypes most
likely to cause human disease) and consistently
higher titers, with the highest antibody levels
found in those with the highest or longest
exposures. Of the exposed individuals, 2 had
antibody levels 2 standard deviations above the
mean, and one of them reported never using gloves while handling sick swine.
The researchers concluded that _S. suis_ likely
infects humans more frequently than currently
recognized, particularly among those who are
regularly in close contact with swine. A planned,
larger follow-up study of swine workers will
collect sera and swabs from humans and swine and
then follow them for seroconversion and any _S.
suis_-like illness and will also try to control
for cross-reactions with other streptococcus species, Smith said.

[_Streptococcus suis_ is a gram-positive coccus
that causes severe infection (usually meningitis,
but also septicemia, pneumonia, arthritis,
abscesses, and abortion) in pigs worldwide. It
can be transmitted to humans who have contact
with pigs in slaughterhouses and farms involved
with pork production. Transmission to humans is
believed to occur through breaks in the skin
surface. Similar to the preliminary findings
reported in the news release above, a study from
New Zealand reported high antibody titers to _S.
suis_ serotype 2 among asymptomatic individuals
with occupational contact with pigs or pig meat
products (Robertson ID, Blackmore DK. Epidemiol Infect 1989; 103; 154-640).
Sporadic cases of disease due to _S. suis_ have
been described in humans; typically purulent
meningitis that may be followed by hearing and
vestibular difficulties or sepsis occurs; acute
endocarditis and septic arthritis have been reported in a few patients.
A large outbreak occurred in Sichuan, China in
2005 among people who had butchered sick or dead
pigs; about � of cases had meningitis and about �
had sepsis, but this outbreak was unique in that
over � of the 215 cases had toxic shock syndrome;
38 died -- all but one death was due to toxic
shock syndrome (reported by Yu H, et al Emerg
Infect Dis 2006; 12:914-20; and ProMED-mail
"Streptococcus suis, porcine, human, 2005 - China
(Sichuan) 20060411.1082"). A prior outbreak in
1998 in Jiangsu, China was said to be similar
with 14 deaths in the 25 reported human cases.
_S. suis_ infection in patients with splenectomy
is said to be also associated with a very high
death rate
(<http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/1/health-and-welfare/1980/lessons-from-chinas-istreptococcus-suis-ioutbreak-the-risk-for-humans>.)
Penicillin, to which _S. suis_ is susceptible, is
the drug of choice for infection caused by this organism.
Only one case of _S. suis_ human infection, that
of a man with meningitis and a history of contact
with presumptively _S. suis_-infected pigs, has
been described in the USA (Willengburg KS, et al.
N Engl J Med 2006; 354: 1325,
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/354/12/1325.pdf>
[subscription required] ).
A total of 35 serotypes of _S. suis_ have been
described, based on capsular polysaccharide
antigens. The predominant serotype causing
disease in humans is serotype 2. Almost all
isolates are reported to be alpha-hemolytic on
sheep blood agar, the commonly used medium in
routine clinical diagnostic laboratories, and
thus would resemble viridans group streptococci
and perhaps misidentified if not adequately
speciated by the commercial diagnostic panels
available in clinical laboratories
(<http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/1/health-and-welfare/1980/lessons-from-chinas-istreptococcus-suis-ioutbreak-the-risk-for-humans>).
Perhaps both asymptomatic and clinically
significant _S. suis_ infection in humans occur
more commonly than we think. - Mod.ML]
