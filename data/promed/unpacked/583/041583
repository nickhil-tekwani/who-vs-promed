Statement on avian flu cases at Corwen smallholding
---------------------------------------------------
An H7 avian influenza virus has been identified
in birds on one smallholding near Corwen, Conwy
[Wales]. Two people living on the farm have
symptoms compatible with conjunctivitis and a
fluï¿½like illness. The National Public Health
Service (NPHS) for Wales has arranged for blood
tests to check the cause of their viral
infection. Both are receiving treatment. Neither of them is in hospital.
In almost all cases of human H7 infection to
date, the virus has only caused a mild disease.
H7 avian flu remains largely a disease of birds.
Almost all human H7 infections documented so far
have been associated with close contact with dead
or dying poultry. In any case, it is very
difficult for human beings to catch flu from
birds. There has to be very close and continued
contact for this to happen and this contact in an
enclosed space. The H7 virus also does not
transmit easily from person to person.
Dr. Marion Lyons, consultant in communicable
disease control for the NPHS for Wales, said: "As
a precaution, we are identifying all those who
have been in very close contact with the birds in
the last 7 days so that we can offer them an
anti-viral medicine called Tamiflu. This can help
in reducing symptoms. We are also contacting all
those people who have been in close contact with
those people living on the smallholding since they fell ill a week ago."
"The National Public Health Service for Wales has
been kept informed by Animal Health and is
monitoring the situation closely. We are
following guidelines and plans in place for such cases of avian flu."

Pair tested for bird flu after farm outbreak
-------------------------------------------
Last night [24 May 2007] 2 adults were tested for
bird flu after Welsh authorities confirmed an
outbreak on a remote smallholding in north Wales.
However, they reassured the public that this was
not the H5N1 strain, which is potentially deadly
to humans and which resulted in 160 000 turkeys
being slaughtered this year [2007] in Norfolk.
Police cordoned off the road about a mile from
the farmhouse in Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, near
Corwen, Denbighshire. It is understood that all
the 45 chickens and 2 geese on the farm were
slaughtered and everyone entering the site was
offered the drug Tamiflu as a precaution.
The National Public Health Service for Wales said
2 people living on the farm had symptoms of flu
and conjunctivitis. Both are receiving treatment
and have had blood tests. Neither is in hospital.
Christianne Glossop, chief veterinary officer in
Wales, said the strain was H7N2 low pathogenic
avian influenza which is deadly to poultry, but
usually only provokes mild symptoms in people. It
caused the destruction of more than 4.7 million
chickens and turkeys in the US in 2002.
Speaking at the Welsh assembly in Cardiff, Dr.
Glossop said that chickens had been dying at the
smallholding over the past 2 weeks. A total of 15
22-week-old Rhode Island Red chickens had been
bought by the owners a fortnight ago [11 May
2007], bringing their total number of birds to 45
chickens and 2 geese. It appeared last night that
the disease could have been brought on to the
small holding after Dr Glossop confirmed that one
of the birds died the day after they were taken
to the site. Dr Glossop said: "At that time there
was no reason to suspect notifiable avian
disease. We have no reason to believe that the
viral infection is spreading rapidly within this
small population. This isn't another East Anglia at the moment.
Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at
Imperial College London, said: "Most influenza
viruses that infect birds are the 'low
pathogenicity' type. These viruses cause mild
symptoms in poultry, and do not transmit to
humans. Investigations are being carried out to
determine where the birds were purchased."

Welsh couple face tests after bird flu outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
In Wales, 2 people from the farm at the centre of
the first outbreak of bird flu there were last
night being tested for the virus [avian
influenz]. The couple, Barbara Cowling, Conwy
Council's dog warden, and her partner Tony
Williams, who live in the sealed-off
smallholding, in Corwen, Denbighshire, are being
treated with Tamiflu as a precaution after
developing conjunctivitis and flu symptoms.
Wales' chief vet yesterday confirmed that 10
birds had died at the T'n Llwyn smallholding from
bird flu. Tests showed that the birds were
suffering from the H7N2 strain of the virus. This
is a less contagious variety than H5N1, which has
caused the deaths of thousands of birds in
South-East Asia, and has also been seen in
Europe. A 1 km exclusion zone is in place around
the remote farmhouse in Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr.
A number of inspectors in white protective suits
spent yesterday examining the smallholding and
several chicken sheds in the back garden of the property.
Dr. Christianne Glossop, the chief veterinary
officer for Wales, confirmed the finding at a
press briefing in the Senedd building yesterday,
but sought to play down any threat posed by the
outbreak. "This is a low pathogenic outbreak,"
she said. "We have no reason to believe that the
viral infection is spreading rapidly within this
smallholding. "This is not H5N1, this is another
East Anglian situation at the moment.
"This is a smallholding in North Wales and while
we are taking this very seriously, the fact that
we are placing only a 1 km zone on these premises
at the moment obviously will hopefully make you
understand that this is low-pathogenic avian
flu." Dr. Glossop said the Welsh authorities were
working with colleagues at the relevant
departments in England and Scotland to work up an
action plan. She added that she was in regular
contact with Environment Minister Carwyn Jones
over the handling of the situation.
However, also speaking at the briefing, Wales'
senior medical officer Dr. Mike Simmons confirmed
that 2 adults had displayed what are known to be
symptoms of H7N2 bird flu. He said, "My
understanding from the National Public Health
Service, and the GPs dealing with it, is that 2
of the individuals on the farm have some clinical
signs which are suspected to be some flu-like
illness or conjunctivitis. In terms of H7, some
conjunctivitis has been identified in the past.
We are still in flu season and there are a number
of human illnesses that can cause both
conjunctivitis and flu-like symptoms.
Nevertheless, because of this incident, both of
these individuals are on treatment courses of
oseltamivir, which is known commercially as Tamiflu."
Dr. Simmons said that enough Tamiflu to treat a
quarter of the population of Wales had been moved
to the area in case the disease spread. But, he
added, "There is no ongoing risk to the public."
Laboratory staff at the National Public Health
Service (NPHS) for Wales were working overnight
on tests to determine whether Ms. Cowling and Mr.
Williams were affected by the H7 strain. Results
are expected today. Dr. Marion Lyons, consultant
in communicable disease control for the NPHS,
said, "As a precaution, we are identifying all
those who have been in very close contact with
the birds in the last 7 days so that we can offer them an anti-viral medicine.
The only documented human case of H7 in the UK
was in 1996, when a woman farmer contracted H7
influenza and suffered conjunctivitis after
cleaning out a poultry house. In 2003 an outbreak
of the highly pathogenic H7N7 strain in Holland
saw 88 people develop conjunctivitis. A vet later died.
The outbreak in Corwen is believed to have
developed after 15 22-week-old Rhode Island
chickens were brought to the smallholding 2 weeks
ago [11 May 2007], bringing the total number of
birds on site to 45 chickens and 2 geese. But one
of the birds died the day after they were taken
to the site, and by 17 May, 10 birds were dead,
all from the new group of chickens. Mr. Williams
called his own veterinary surgeon, who then
contacted the state veterinary service.
Speaking from her home last night Ms. Cowling
said her partner called the authorities as a
precaution after a group of newly imported birds
became sick. Dr. Glossop said, "At that time
there was no reason to suspect notifiable avian
disease." The 30 remaining birds on the farm were
slaughtered yesterday afternoon [24 May 2007] but
investigations were last night continuing into
the source of the outbreak. Dr. Glossop said it
was unlikely that the virus would have been
spread to a wild bird in the period before the
disease was identified, but said it could not be
discounted. She said, "The birds that were
infected died very quickly after they arrived on
the unit and the rest of the block is now under restriction.
Further restrictions could now be placed on other
farms across Britain as investigations continue
into the source of the infection. The scientific
community last night urged the public to remain
calm, but demanded that action be taken to ensure
the outbreak was controlled quickly. Dr. Colin
Butter, of the Institute for Animal Health, said,
"While we must take this outbreak seriously,
there is no reason for the public to panic. "This
is a low-pathogenic strain of virus and there was
a similar outbreak in Norfolk in 2006 that was
well contained by DEFRA with no risk to the public."

[This avian H7N2 influenza virus has been
assessed to be a strain of low pathogenicity
(LPAI) for birds and is unlikely to present a
serious disease problem for the human population.
In 2003 an extensive outbreak of an H7N7 avian
influenza strain of high (avian) pathogenicity
(HPAI) caused extensive losses in the poultry
industry of The Netherlands, but little more than
moderate conjunctivitis in the human population.
One veterinarian did die during the course of the
outbreak but the virus did not spread in the
human population. It is unlikely that the H7N2
virus present in the smallholding in Wales will
be associated with more than mild symptoms in
humans. However, until the origin of the H7N2
virus is established caution must be observed. - Mod.CP]
