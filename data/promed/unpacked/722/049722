RABBIT CALICIVIRUS DISTRIBUTION (3)
===================================
[- This information was obtained from Dr Douglas Gregg, USDA, Foreign
Animal Disease Laboratory, Plum Island; (516) 323-2500 X379. Any errors
are mine, not his. MH-J]
The FADL has maintained a rabbit viral haemorrhagic disease surveillance
programme since 1989 but has never isolated any Calicivirus or other
similar. [There is some controversy as to whether it is a Calicivirus,
French & Australian authorities notwithstanding.] They have not had
a submission in twelve months. Over the years they have seen enteroviruses,
various Clostridia, and Rotoviruses. Gregg interprets the lack of submissions
as a result of a lack of problems, not a lack of surveillance.
The North American native rabbits - Black-tailed Jackrabbits & Eastern
Cottontail - have been laboratory tested for susceptibility and found to
be naturally resistant to this virus.
The European rabbit, Orytalagus caniculus, is fully susceptible. It was
from this species that all commercial & domestic rabbits are derived.
The US commercial rabbit industry is at risk only by importation of
infected stock. As the industry stands at the moment it has no need to
import improved breeding stock, and, in fact, is exporting. There is
a risk of the hobby rabbit-breeders importing stock to improve genetic
diversity but they have been made very aware of the risks, and like their
commercial counterparts are, from all appearance, conscientious in this
matter. While the disease exists in China & Korea, the Angora rabbit
industry are not importing breeding stock.
When the disease was found in Mexico in commercial rabbitries, their
government initiated a successful 5-year programme of eradication. The
last case was in 1991, and the disease was officially declared
eradicated in 1993.
