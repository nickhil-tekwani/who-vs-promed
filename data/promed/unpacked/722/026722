There are 8 confirmed cases of typhoid fever in American Samoa but health officials insists there is no outbreak. LBJ Medical Center pediatrician Dr Mike Favassa told reporters typhoid fever is nothing new to American Samoa but warned if it's not treated right away it can be fatal.

He says there are now 8 confirmed cases since January 2013 and the last 2 cases since May 2013 are children, with one of them very sick and still recovering at the hospital. Dr Mike Favassa says the cases illustrate the importance of taking care of problems earlier rather than later. "We are taking this opportunity now to bring it to the public's attention that it is prevalent here. We are trying to nip it in the bud and find the source of the infection so we can prevent this from becoming an outbreak."

At least 66 residents have fallen ill of suspected typhoid fever in 18 villages in the town of Oas in Albay, the Provincial Health Office said [Mon 10 Jun 2013]. Cases of the water borne disease began 16 May 2013 and continued to surge, according to Dr Nats Rempillo, Albay's assistant provincial health officer, in his report to the Department of Health (DOH) in Bicol [region].

Rempillo said that among the suspected typhoid cases, 23 people were hospitalized at the Rebueno General Hospital in Oas; 5 cases were reported at the Josefina Belmonte Duran District Memorial District Hospital in Ligao City, 4 of whom had been discharged; 10 people were confined at the Bicol Regional Teaching and Training Hospital (BRTTH) in Daraga town, of whom 4 were discharged.

Marilyn Palattao, head of the Provincial epidemiology unit, said the suspected typhoid cases were reported by the Oas Municipal Health Unit (MHU) on 28 May 2013 after suspected typhoid cases were monitored in the villages of Tobog, Bagumbayan, Mayao, Iraya, Talongog, Camagong, Ilaor Norte and Sur, Maporong, Obaliw and Bongoran, Saban, Manga, San Agustin, Balogo, and Gumabao, Cagmanaba, and Busac. These villages are located about 5 to 10 kilometers [3-6 mi] from the Oas town proper.

The 66 villagers who were hospitalized were diagnosed to have suffered high fever for more than 5 days, dehydration, and loose bowel (LBM), constipation, moderate to severe headache, and weakness.

Municipal health records indicated that more than half of the people that fell sick were children (34) and 32 were adults; ages ranged from 1 to 58 years old.

Pallatao said their initial findings revealed that the patients fell ill after drinking contaminated water sourced from the town's water reservoir. Most of the households in the affected villages have been getting their drinking water from the town water reservoir.
