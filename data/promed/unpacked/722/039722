[In February 2014, Nepal reported an event of HPAI, subtype H5N1. Only an outbreak was reported in the province of Koshi. In their final report sent on 25 May 2014, Nepal declared that, "After the completion of stamping out operation, surveillance activities were intensified outside the zone and throughout the country. During the period, morbidity and mortality in poultry were investigated; samples collected were tested for avian influenza virus. All samples were negative for HPAI H5N1. Therefore, Nepal declares itself free from HPAI H5N1 with effect from 22 May 2014."
