[On 1 Feb 2014, Mongolia's veterinary services reported 3 foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks affecting cattle in the province of Sukhbaatar, located in the eastern part of the country. Sukhbaatar borders the People's Republic of China (Inner Mongolia province) to the south for 485 km (301 mi), with Dornogovi province to the west for 165 km (103 mi), with Khentii province to the north for 260 km (162 mi), and with Dornod province to the north east for 430 km (267 mi). The total number of susceptible cattle in the 3 holdings was 889, of which 76 were reportedly clinically affected without mortality, 49 destroyed (the consideration for the (selective) modified stamping out not provided). The causative agent was identified by the State Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory), where 2 tests were performed on 30 Jan 2014: non-structural protein ELISA and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), both with positive results, reporting the identification of FMDV serotype A. A follow-up report of 24 Feb 2014 notified 11 additional outbreaks, reportedly caused by the same serotype A virus spreading northwards and westwards. The total number of susceptible cattle in the 11 holdings was 4611, of which 2492 were reportedly clinically affected without mortality, 2492 destroyed. Mass vaccination of cattle was reportedly applied (see ProMED-mail post 20140224.2297695).

According to the current follow-up report, an international FMD reference laboratory (All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health, FGBI-ARRIAH), which received Mongolia's samples for confirmation, eventually serotyped the isolates as serotype O, not A.

As apparent from the website of the World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (WRLFMD) at Pirbright, 5 samples collected from Mongolian cattle were received on 17 Mar 2014 for genotyping, all identified as FMDV serotype O, topotype: ME-SA, genotype/strain: PanAsia.

The origins of the said positive samples were:
species / location / date collected
cattle / Sukhbaatar / 30 Jan 2014
cattle / Sukhbaatar / 10 Feb 2014
cattle / Ihhet, Dornogovi / 12 Feb 2014
cattle / Sainshand, Dornogovi / 13 Feb 2014
cattle / Galshar, Khentii / 17 Feb 2014

An administrative map of Mongolia is available at http://www.ephotopix.com/mongolia_political_map.html

All details of the genotyping including a dendrogram, are available in the WRLFMD batch 2014/00011 report at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2014/WRLFMD-2014-00011%20O%20Mongolia%202014.pdf.

The most closely related reference strain (92.80 percent) is O/UKG/35/2001.

It will be helpful to obtain information on the vaccine(s) applied since the start of the mass vaccination (see also RFI in ProMED-mail post 20140224.2297695). Was it a monovalent or a bivalent vaccine? Which vaccine strains have been used? In February 2014, the circulation of FMD, said to be FMDV-A, was reported from antelopes. An update on the strain affecting the antelopes will be helpful.

This event demonstrates the immense importance of international reference laboratories and their invaluable contribution to the control of the disease, globally, provided samples are timely submitted. - Mod.AS
