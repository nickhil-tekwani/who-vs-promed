The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 28 Feb 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 888, 823 confirmed and 65 probable. In total, there have been 557 deaths (492 in confirmed and 65 in probable cases) and 302 people have recovered.
- 174 suspected cases under investigation;
- 3 new confirmed cases, 2 in Katwa and 1 in Mandima;
- 2 new confirmed cases deaths: 1 community death in Katwa; 1 death of confirmed cases at Katwa CT.

Continuation of medical care in Butembo
---------------------------------------
- Following security incidents in recent days, the international NGOs Médecins sans Frontières and Alima have decided to withdraw their teams deployed in the town of Butembo while continuing their activities in the other areas affected by the epidemic. After the destruction of the 2 Ebola treatment centers (ETCs), the only functioning patient care facility in the city is the transit center (CT) located within the compound of the Katwa Reference General Hospital.

- Initially intended to support suspected patients waiting for the results of their laboratory tests, the TC has been slightly reorganized to accommodate confirmed patients from the 2 ETCs destroyed. TB management was immediately taken over by the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF, to ensure continuity of patient care.

- The doctors, nurses and hygienists working in the ETCs and the TC are all local health workers living in the area. Despite the shock of recent events, many have returned to their jobs to continue to advance the Ebola response.

- The CT has a capacity of 35 beds. Following the transfer of all patients who were at the Butembo ETC, the CT currently hosts 31 patients, including 12 confirmed cases and 19 suspected cases. All of the confirmed cases that escaped during the Butembo ETC attack were found and have been admitted to the CT. As of tomorrow [2 Mar 2019], 10 extra beds will be added to increase the capacity of the CT. The logistic teams began their work of evaluating the material damages in the 2 attacked ETCs in order to start the rehabilitation work of these structures as quickly as possible.

Vaccination
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 84 640 people have been vaccinated [see URL for cases by location].

[MSF has suspended support in the area of the attacks, as has the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA). They are both pulling their staff over security concerns. These actions are entirely understandable and a reasonable response. For the time being, WHO is maintaining staff. The fortitude of those health care workers who are returning to work in such dangerous circumstances is really admirable. The entire world should be grateful to them, since the patients depend on their expertise, and their effort is so important to the control of the spread of the virus. - Mod.LK]

[2] Summary
- Date: Fri 1 Mar 2019
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy) [abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/ebola-care-rebounds-attack-area-world-bank-oks-funds


The Democratic Republic of the Congo's Ebola outbreak grew by 3 more confirmed cases today [1 Mar 2019], and in a key development to support the response over the next 6 months, the World Bank said yesterday it has approved up to USD 80 million in grants and credits.

The World Bank support follows an urgent request from WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier this week for USD 148 million to support the Ebola response in the DRC. Earlier this week, WHO said Tedros would visit the DRC, including the main epicenters of Katwa and Butembo. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the visit is still scheduled. Tedros had warned that without help from the global community, the country is at risk of backsliding in its progress to contain the disease.

Though cases over the past few weeks have shown a decreasing trend, fresh attacks on Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in hot spots in Katwa and Butembo drove some confirmed patients into the community when they fled the violence that has led Médecins sans Frontières (MSF; Doctors without Borders) to evacuate ETC staff and significantly slowed the response. In addition, the DRC health minister said yesterday [28 Feb 2019] that officials expect a surge of cases in the affected areas.

Of the USD 80 million in support from the World Bank, USD 60 million is in grants and credits through the International Development Association, a fund for low-income countries. Also, a USD 20 million grant was approved by the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF), specialty bonds that were launched in 2017 to streamline surge funding to developing countries facing pandemic threats. The financing tool was created by the World Bank along with Japan, Germany, and Australia.

According to the World Bank statement, the group approved the PEF grant within 3 days of receiving a request from the DRC government. Half will be released immediately to fund the frontline response, with the rest released within a month or sooner, as needed. The 1st PEF funds were tapped in May 2018 during the DRC's previous Ebola outbreak in Equateur province.

In the statement, World Bank interim president and CEO Kristalina Georgieva said: "Our priority is to halt this outbreak of Ebola and limit the devastation it causes to families and communities. Today's commitment ensures that lifesaving work can be urgently scaled up, and that lack of funding is not a constraint."

In the wake of the 2 ETC attacks, MSF evacuated its staff from the hot spot. And according to the health ministry, another aid group -- the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) -- is pulling their staff as well over security concerns. ALIMA runs a transit center in Butembo, and Ebola patients were taken there after the attack on the on the city's MSF ETC.

However, intensive efforts are under way to use the Butembo MSF facility again as soon as possible. The health ministry said doctors, nurses, and hygienists working in the ETC and the transit center, where suspected patients await their test results, are local health workers, and despite the 2 attacks, many have returned to their jobs to care for Ebola patients.

WHO's African regional office said today [1 Mar 2019] on its Twitter account that the Butembo ETC has been decontaminated, and teams from WHO, UNICEF, and the DRC's health ministry are redeploying a local MSF hygienist to prepare the unit for immediate use. For now, the only functioning patient care facility is the transit center within Katwa Reference General Hospital, according to the health ministry. With modifications, the transit center has beds for 35 patients, and 31 are currently occupied by 12 confirmed and 19 suspected patients. Efforts are under way to add 10 more beds. All patients with confirmed infections who fled during the Butembo attack have been found and are admitted to the transit center, officials said.

In a related development, International Medical Corps (IMC) said today [1 Mar 2019] on its Twitter account that it is still providing training and supplies to healthcare workers and is supporting screening for Ebola symptoms in Butembo and Katwa.

Meanwhile, in its daily update today [1 Mar 2019], the DRC health ministry reported 3 new cases, 2 in Katwa and 1 in Mandima. Officials are also investigating 174 suspected cases. The latest confirmed cases lift the outbreak total to 888, which included 823 confirmed and 65 probable cases. Two more people died from Ebola, both from Katwa, including one who died in the community, raising the number of deaths to 557.

[3] Consequences and follow-up of attacks

A police officer was killed on Wed 27 Feb 2019 in the evening, during an attack by gunmen on another Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Butembo town. The attackers set fire to the center, which housed some 30 patients, police said.

Colonel Richard Mbambi, commander of the police in Butembo, indicates that the policeman killed was committed to the protection of the ETC, erected in the concession of the Institute of Agricultural and Veterinary Techniques (ITAV), Lumumba district, in the commune of Kimemi, and assigned to the organization MSF. Police authorities attribute the attack to the militia Mai-Mai Mazembe. They also report material damage, namely a vehicle, 7 motorcycles, and a generator set on fire.

[This is a waste of a life. A staff member having died during the 2nd attack was mentioned earlier. See ProMED-mail. Ebola update (23): Congo DR (NK,IT) cases, WHO, violence 20190301.6343087. This is likely the individual to whom the earlier report referred. When an individual loses his life in the course of providing protection for others, it adds to the loss. - Mod.LK]
