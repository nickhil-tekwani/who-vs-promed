In Ceara, 167 municipalities have thus far reported dengue cases in
2008. There have been 36 372 cases of the disease reported, with 18
deaths. According to the weekly bulletin issued by the state
Secretariat of Health (SESA), DHF, with 248 confirmed cases, caused
12 deaths in the week, and dengue with complications another 6
[deaths] of 482 cases up until now.

According to the SESA, Ceara in 2008 is living through the 2nd
highest number of dengue cases since 1986. Forteleza has recorded 26
034 classical dengue cases. Caucaia, in the metropolitan region, has
the 2nd highest number of cases with 748.

The region hardest hit by dengue this year [2008] is said to be
Region VI by the Executive Secretariat, with 7110 cases. With 5262
recorded confirmed [cases], the area of Region V comes next.

The municipalities in Ceara with the most cases in 2008 are:
- Fortaleza - 26 034
- Caucaia - 748

During epidemiological weeks 1-24, 2008, dengue virus type 2 was
identified in the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica,
Grenada, St. Lucia and Trinidad & Tobago. Dengue virus type 4 was
also identified in the British Virgin Islands, and virus type 1 was
identified in Anguilla and Antigua & Barbuda.

[This brief report does not indicate which of the islands had only
imported dengue cases and which had local dengue virus transmission.
As of mid-December 2007, the Cayman Islands only had imported dengue
cases and had mounted an active surveillance and mosquito vector
control campaign (see ProMED archive no. 20071218.4074). It would be
interesting to know whether the 2008 cases were also all imported cases.

Dengue fever has spread across the country, killing 48 people and
infecting more than 40 000 so far this year [2008], Public Health
Minister Wicharn Meenchainant said yesterday [31 Jul 2008].

Up to last Saturday [26 Jul 2008], 41 307 patients have been
diagnosed nationwide with dengue haemorrhagic fever [DHF], and
Bangkok was the hardest hit with 3763 patients, according to the
Disease Control Department's Bureau of Epidemiology.

Ratchaburi suffered the 2nd worst outbreak with 1710 victims,
followed by Nakhon Sawan with 1582, Phetchabun with 1304, and Rayong with 1291.

Vichan said the risk of catching dengue fever from mosquitoes this
year [2008] was running high compared to last year [2007], which saw
29 fatalities out of 60 000 cases.

The ministry's report identifies 4 strains [the 4 dengue virus
serotypes. - Mod.TY]. This year's [2008] seasonal epidemic was blamed
on [dengue virus] type 2, while last year [2007], type 1 [virus] was
virulent. People could hypothetically get infected by each of the 4
dengue [virus] strains separately in their lifetime. Permanent
secretary Prat Bunyawongwiroj said this year [2008] type [virus] 2
was more dangerous to humans, as it was more resistant to the immune system.

Vichan has ordered provincial public health offices to strictly
control and monitor the transmission of dengue fever among people in
the local area. Local authorities should spray insecticide to
eradicate the adult _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which bites humans in
the daytime. Residents should drain off any stagnant water to prevent
mosquitoes from breeding and use abate sand, a pesticide, to destroy
their larvae.

[The following moderator comment accompanied a similar posting on the
ProMED-mail collaboration with the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance
(MBDS) initiative (see Dengue - Thailand (06)X 20080801.2359). "As
of 26 Jul 2008, the number of dengue fever cases detected in Thailand
during 2008 are 41 307 cases and 48 deaths nationwide: 3763 cases in
Bangkok, 1710 cases in Ratchaburi, 1582 cases in Nakhon Sawan, 1304
cases in Phetchaburi, and 1291 in Rayong provinces. This represents
an almost 3-fold (300 percent) increase in the number of reported
cases since the last PRO/MBDS posting on dengue fever in Thailand in
early June 2008. At that time, approximately 14 000 cases of dengue
fever had been reported in Thailand as of 5 Jun 2008, representing a
72 percent increase from the same period in 2007 (see prior PRO/MBDS
posting Dengue - Thailand (05) 20080607.1820).

"Viet Nam has also had an increase in reporting of dengue fever
cases, with 28 980 cases and 28 deaths reported as of 29 Jul 2008
(see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (10) 20080731.2349).

"Of note from the newswire above is that type 2 dengue virus, which
is considered by many to be more "dangerous" than other types, is
predominant in Thailand in 2008. Through the years, there have been
"conflicting" theories on the origin of dengue hemorrhagic fever and
dengue shock syndrome presentations when compared with "simple"
dengue fever, the former 2 diagnoses being the more serious
manifestations. Two of the key theories on the cause of the serious
manifestations have been 1) sequential infection with different
dengue serotypes (there are 4 dengue virus serotypes, DEN 1, DEN 2,
DEN 3, and DEN 4); and 2) infection with a more virulent strain of the virus.

As of late July [2008], 21 000 cases of dengue fever have been
reported nationwide. Although the outbreak of the disease can happen
any time, people's awareness of prevention against it has not been much raised.

In the southern provinces, stagnant rainwater has been seen
everywhere in and around houses. Some houses even have tens or
hundreds of earthenware jars of rainwater, so if no measures are to
be taken for treatment of rainwater, this is a good breeding ground
for mosquitoes to multiply.

As far as the southern provinces are concerned, this year [2008],
dengue fever occurred earlier than expected. Children under 15 years
of age have suffered most. However, the number of adults suffering
from the disease shows signs of gradual increase.

[The following moderator comment accompanied a posting on this
outbreak that appeared on the ProMED-mail/Mekong Basin Disease
Surveillance initiative collaboration PRO/MBDS (see Dengue - Viet Nam
(09): RFI 20080729.2313 available at the ProMED-mail website.) "In
Viet Nam, the number of dengue cases reported since the beginning of
2008 has been approximately 21 000 cases nationwide. In the most
recent prior posting on dengue in Viet Nam from 14 Jul 2008, there
was a report of an outbreak in Quang Nam province, with more than 250
cases detected in a local hospital (see PRO/MBDS posting Dengue -
Viet Nam (08): Quang Nam 20080714.2136 accessible at the ProMED-mail
website). It appears as though the major increase in reported cases
of dengue seen in 2007 is continuing in 2008. While official figures
were not available, according to newswire reports posted on PRO/MBDS
in late October 2007, there were between 75 000 and 80 000 cases with
at least 76 deaths reported attributable to dengue virus infections
in Viet Nam (see Dengue - Viet Nam (16): control measures
20071031.3535 and Dengue - Viet Nam (15) 20071025.3469 -- both
reports available at the ProMED-mail website). The mention of an
increase in reported cases in adults in the newswire above also
reflects an observation seen in 2007, when there were reports of
increased reports of dengue infections in adults as well (see Dengue
- Viet Nam (14): adults, RFI 20071012.3354).

"To be a bit provocative here, one wonders whether perhaps the
reported increase in dengue cases in adults (and perhaps in children
as well) might well be a reflection of simultaneous circulation of
chikungunya virus and misdiagnosis of a mild dengue-like illness
produced by infection with chikungunya virus.

"PRO/MBDS would greatly appreciate receiving more information from
knowledgeable sources in the region on the official reports of
numbers of cases and deaths attributable to dengue, dengue
hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome in Viet Nam, including
information on age distribution of cases and numbers of laboratory
confirmed cases of dengue fever. In addition, information on possible
co-circulation of chikungunya virus in Viet Nam from knowledgeable
sources would be greatly appreciated.

Residents of Monywa township in Sagaing division have reported an
outbreak of DHF among children, some of whom are said to have died of
the disease.

One local resident said the local health system had been overwhelmed
by the number of cases.

"Monywa hospital was running out of beds for patients, and families
had to bring along their own beds so their children could be admitted
to the hospital," the resident said. "Children's clinics in town were
packed with sick children." He said most of the families had not
noticed their children had been infected with dengue hemorrhagic
fever until it had reached the final stages. "We don't know the
precise number of deaths among children in town, but there have been
a number of them," he said.

Another local said the authorities had been spraying insecticide in
areas where the outbreak started to suppress the population of
mosquitoes, the main carriers of the disease [virus].

[The above newswire and the following newswire on dengue in returning
Taiwanese volunteers who worked in Myanmar as part of the relief
efforts was originally posted on PRO/MBDS, a ProMED-mail regional
collaboration with the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS)
initiative. The following moderator comment appeared on the PRO/MBDS
posting (see Post cyclone situation - Myanmar (05): dengue
20080730.2321 available at the ProMED-mail website. "A similar
newswire appeared on the Democratic Voice of Burma website
<http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=1577>. It should be noted here
that the Sagaing Division is in the northern part of Burma and was
not considered one of the 5 divisions declared as emergency zones
following cyclone Nargi (the 5 Divisions were the Irrawaddy Delta,
Yangon, Pegu [Bago] Mon and Karen States). But, while not in the
actual emergency zone, the entire area was inundated with flooding
and most likely has residual standing water in many areas that is
ideal for mosquito breeding. In addition, one wonders whether
resources for dengue control have been diverted from relatively
'unaffected zones' in the post cyclone period so that the above
mentioned increase in dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever has been
further complicated by an acute shortage of resources.

More information on the current status of dengue fever in Myanmar
from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated." - Mod.MPP]

flooding has prompted households to store fresh water in and around
their houses, providing ideal breeding sites for _Aedes_ mosquitoes

Ten members of a Taiwan religious group have been infected with
dengue fever [virus] while taking part in volunteer relief efforts in
Myanmar in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, marking the 1st case of
mass overseas dengue fever infections to be recorded in Taiwan in
recent years, a Centres for Disease Control (CDC) official said
Tuesday [29 Jul 2008].

The cases were discovered after one of the patients, a 48-year-old
Taipei County woman, sought treatment earlier this month [July 2008]
at the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital and was diagnosed on 18 Jul 2008
with dengue fever, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi.

A subsequent investigation conducted by health authorities found that
she and 10 other members of her group had visited Myanmar to help
with the aftermath of the disaster and that 10 of the 11-member
mission had been infected with the disease [virus] in Myanmar and had
already fallen ill while in the Southeast Asian country, Shih said.

The patients were aged between 48 and 87 and come from Taipei County,
Taipei City, Taoyuan County and Changhua County, Shih said. The CDC
official said the centre is still awaiting the results of a 3rd test
on the remaining member of the mission, who tested negative for
dengue fever in 2 previous tests.

Shih said the CDC had also notified local health authorities to check
other people who might have had contact with the 10 patients after
their return to Taiwan to make sure they are not infected with the
disease [virus], which is contracted through the bite of the mosquito
that carries the disease [virus].

The Department of Health (DoH) reported that 3 people died from the
dreaded dengue virus this year [2008] in Negros Oriental province.

DoH investigation shows that the deaths were a result of late
referral to doctors.

With this, Dr Socrates Villamor, Provincial Epidemiology Surveillance
Unit, advised relatives of possible dengue victims to seek early
consultation at the nearest hospital.

The DoH top official here warned of an abrupt increase of dengue
cases in August 2008 due to the rainy season. Villamor also noted
that cases of dengue in the months of June and July 2008 increased
compared to the previous months. DoH also reported an increase of
dengue cases by 18 percent.

Villamor said that there are 486 cases recorded as of 26 Jul [2008]
this year compared to 897 cases of the same period last year. He
clarified, however, that although the cases are alarming, there is no
epidemic status in the province.

He said proper sanitation is the most important and effective tool to
prevent dengue-carrying mosquitoes.

[Interestingly, reports from 16 Jun 2008 on dengue cases in several
cities in Negros Oriental province indicated that the number of
dengue cases was significantly higher than last year (2007) (see
ProMED archive no. 20080618.1901). While there may not be a
province-wide dengue epidemic as Dr. Villamor indicated, there may be
a number of outbreaks in several locations there.

With 3 cases being reported within a week in the capital, civic
authorities have started fumigating areas where there are high
chances of mosquitoes breeding.

"We're following the standard protocol of fumigating neighborhoods
from where cases are reported," said Dr V K Monga, Health Committee
Chairman, Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

Dengue fever, caused by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, is a
post-monsoon disease, but record-high pre-monsoon showers in May 2008
and the early onset of monsoons have resulted in early onset of the
dengue season, say experts. [This statement is incorrect. Dengue
viruses cause the disease, and _Aedes aegypti_ transmit the viruses. - Mod.TY]

"We were expecting an early onset of the dengue season this year
[2008] and are prepared for the worst-case scenario," said Dr V K
Monga, chairman of MCD's health committee.

According to health experts, humidity is conducive to mosquito
breeding. [High humidity promotes adult mosquito survival. Water
catchments provide mosquito breeding sites. - Mod.TY]

[Although fogging may provide some short-term reduction in adult
mosquito populations and help calm the public by indicating that
health authorities are doing something about the problem, longer term
effective mosquito vector control requires elimination of the water
catchments that provide breeding sites.
