[Re: ProMED-mail Toxoplasmosis - Brazil: (PA) 20130629.1799160]
---------------------------------------------------------------
Brazil's obsession with toxoplasmosis is difficult to explain. The term, "toxoplasma" appears in 0.363 percent of all Brazilian publications indexed on PubMed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed, as compared to 0.086 percent of publications from the United States.

Abstracts from Gideon (http://www.GideonOnline.com) summarize 120 relevant surveys/serosurveys from Brazil, but only 19 from the combined literature of neighboring Bolivia, Argentina, and Venezuela (only 38 from the United States). Strikingly, there have been only 37 Brazilian surveys of HIV infection, and only 9 of dengue as of 2013.

The following list of Brazilian toxoplasma surveys is abstracted from the Gideon e-book series [1,2]. (Primary references available on request)

[It is quite understandable that Brazil is concerned about toxoplasmosis, and we disagree that " Brazil's obsession with toxoplasmosis is difficult to explain."

Brazil has a very high burden of ocular toxoplasmosis first described in 1992 (Glasner PD et al: An unusually high prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in southern Brazil. Am J Ophthalmol. 1992; 114(2): 136-44; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1642287. Dubey JP et al: Toxoplasmosis in humans and animals in Brazil: high prevalence, high burden of disease, and epidemiology. Parasitology 2012; 139(11): 1375-424; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776427), and congenital toxoplasmosis is more severe in Brazil compared to Europe (Gilbert RE et al: Ocular sequelae of congenital toxoplasmosis in Brazil compared with Europe. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2008; 2(8): e277; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493041/). The same is found in other countries in South America and is particularly well documented for Colombia and Suriname.

The reason the high burden of _Toxoplasma_-associated posterior uveitis and congenital toxoplasmosis is primarily explained by more virulent genotypes of _Toxoplasma gondii_ (Carneiro AC et al: Genetic characterization of _Toxoplasma gondii_ revealed highly diverse genotypes for isolates from newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis in southeastern Brazil. J Clin Microbiol 2013; 51(3): 901-7; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23284022) and widespread transmission from contaminated surface water (Bahia-Oliveira LM et al: Highly endemic, waterborne toxoplasmosis in north Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis. 2003; 9(1): 55-62; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873742/).

Thus, infection with _T. gondii_ is an infection with a much higher morbidity in Brazil compared to Europe and North America, and the prime cause of posterior uveitis. - Mod.EP
