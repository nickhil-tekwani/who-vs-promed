A Larimer County, [Colorado], resident has been confirmed as having the 1st human case of tularemia this season and is believed to have been exposed while gardening at home, according to the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment. The resident developed a lung infection from tularemia, which can be transmitted to people through insect bites, contaminated soil, or contact with an infected animal, according to a press release from the health department.

All warm-blooded animals, including pets and livestock, are susceptible to tularemia, though the bacterium normally occurs in rabbits, hares, muskrats, beaver, and small rodents. The bacterium that causes tularemia is in the urine and droppings of sick animals, contaminating the soil through that means. When a person turns up soil while gardening, mowing, or even blowing leaves, the bacteria can be inhaled, causing a pneumonic form of tularemia, the department stated.

The organism also can be transferred through contaminated food and water or even by putting hands to eyes, nose, or mouth after outdoor activities. Other ways to contract tularemia are through insect bites and by handling dead animals, according to a news release. Bacteria in animals can persist in soil or water for weeks, and it takes only a small amount to cause a transmission.

[Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or via an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _D. variabilis_ (dog tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

The infection does not spread from person to person, essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted.

_F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. Even before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia due to inhalation of _F. tularensis_ seemed to account for most of the deaths related to the infection (1). A good review of the subject written by Thomas and Schaffner can be found in reference 2.
