Avian influenza and sparrows
---------------------------------
Melville and Shortridge (in press) noted the potential role of
Eurasian Tree Sparrows (_Passer montanus_) and other terrestrial
birds that feed around fish ponds in southern China in the spread of
avian influenza. [Migratory waterbirds and avian influenza in the
East Asian-Australasian Flyway with particular reference to the
2003-2004 H5N1 outbreak. Proceedings of the Waterbirds Around the
World Conference, Edinburgh, UK, 3-8 Apr 2004. Wetlands International].
Kou et al. (2005) now report H5N1 from Tree Sparrows in China and
note that "the results suggest that H5N1 viruses might be distributed
widely in Tree Sparrows." [New Genotype of Avian Influenza H5N1
Viruses Isolated from Tree Sparrows in China. J Virol. 2005 Dec;
79(24):15460-15466. See 20051124.3413.]
The recent establishment of an Avian Influenza Task Force under the
Convention on Migratory Species [see 20051118.3359] is to be
welcomed, and the focus on waterfowl understandable, but the
potential importance of terrestrial species such a Tree Sparrows
should not be overlooked. There remains a need for further studies on
what are generally regarded as "non-migratory" terrestrial species.

[David Melville's comment regarding the need to broaden the spectrum
of studied wild avian species beyond waterfowl falls in line with a
previous observation (see 20051103.3211) alluding that sampling
restricted to habitat- or taxon-specific parameters could result in a
biased understanding of the environmental processes. - Mod.AS]
