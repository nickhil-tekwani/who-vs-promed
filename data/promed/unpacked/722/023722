Follow-up on the statement by Tom Billy, administrator of the USDA's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, yesterday that large U.S. chicken processors
have sharply reduced the level of salmonella since the roll-out of
mandatory HACCP. [Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points]
The percentage of positive tests for salmonella in chicken carcasses fell
from 16 percent last year to 9 percent this year The USDA tests samples at
meat and poultry plants for salmonella as part of the HACCP program now in
place at all plants with more than 500 employees.
Billy was further cited as saying that salmonella tests for cattle
carcasses also showed a decline but the results were based on much smaller
samples than the chicken tests. Results for salmonella tests on turkey
carcasses so far this year were not yet available.
