Both deaths from yellow fever vaccination were due to the vaccine itself.
Both patients died from a typical clinical and pathological case of yellow
fever. A post-mortem was conducted in both cases, and in both yellow fever
was confirmed. Yellow fever virus grew in blood and tissues in both cases.
Again in both cases the virus was demonstrated to be the vaccine virus, not
a wild one.
I agree that the vaccine still boasts an excellent curriculum vitae of
safety, but, in the case of Sao Paulo, the risk/benefit equation suffered
a change, and mass vaccination was interrupted.

[This is a serious setback to the campaign designed to protect BrazilÂ´s
cities from the current threat of urban epidemics of YF. One has to
believe that the 29 confirmed cases of YF arriving recently in cities in
southern Brazil are only the tip of the iceberg, & that many viremic people
are now being fed on by the urban vector, _Aedes aegypti_.
Unless the vaccine virus has undergone an unprecedented increase in
virulence during the manufacturing process, the most likely explanation for
the tragic deaths from the vaccine is that the victims were
immunosuppressed, either as a result of an underlying infection such as
HIV, or from a course of treatment for another condition - Mod.JW
