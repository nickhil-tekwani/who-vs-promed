LEISHMANIASIS, CANINE - ITALY: ADVICE NEEDED
============================================
Date: Wed, 09 Apr 1997 09:01:13 -0600
From: Steve Weber <sweber@aphis.usda.gov>
Subject: Forwarded message for request for information on Leishmania
Steve Weber received the following message from Dr.Antonio MARINO:
"I am an Italian veterinary clinician. I am interested in the therapy and
prophilaxis of Leishmaniasis in dogs. I work in a public dogs' center with
some 20% of the animals infected.
I think euthanasia of the infected dogs is the only way to deal with it but
the welfare agencies and other associations in my town do not accept that
solution and give me many problems.
Please help me, if it is possible."
Dr Antonio MARINO

assistance. MHJ]
