The death of a South Canterbury [Canterbury region, South Island] toddler from a strain of _E. coli_ has highlighted how dangerous a bacterial disease can be. South Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr Daniel Williams said it was not known how the 23-month-old, who died last week, contracted enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. "While investigations continue, it is possible that the source of the illness will not be able to be identified. Our thoughts and sympathy go out to his family at this sad time," he said.

The organism, _E. coli_ O157, is a strain found in the intestines of farm animals. It can cause serious and occasionally fatal illness by producing powerful toxins.

Williams said the illness usually began with diarrhea, which can contain blood after 2 to 3 days. "Anyone with blood in diarrhea should consult their general practice team."

He said the most important safety precautions were not to drink raw milk, thorough hand washing after contact with animals and animal feces, and ensuring clean water supplies.

[The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 percent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS.

Since Wong, et al (1) reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, if the same effect would occur in adults, if non-O157 strains would behave similarly and what the mechanism of the effect were not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.

As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases (2), the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some beginning defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.

A number of studies have studied Shiga toxin production and or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. Ochoa, et al (5) found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 as compared to non-O157 strains but Lee and Stein (6) did not.
