[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, Chapter 2.2.5 Small hive beetle infestation (_Aethina tumida_), at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.05_SMALL_HIVE_BEETLE.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"The small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida_ (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), is a parasite and scavenger of honey bee colonies. Adult and larvae small hive beetles feed on honey bee brood, honey and pollen, thus causing brood death, fermentation of honey, and comb destruction. The beetles can promote structural collapse of the nest and cause the adult honey bees to abscond. The extent of beetle-associated damage likely depends on climate conditions, among other factors. Small hive beetles tend to be more problematic in areas with warm temperatures and high humidity than in areas with lower temperatures and humidity. The small hive beetle can be a serious problem in honey-extracting facilities where stored comb, honey and wax cappings are potential feeding and breeding areas. Beetle development from egg to adult requires 3-12 weeks, depending on humidity, temperature and food availability. The flying adult beetles actively infest honey bee colonies of all strengths and sizes."

Photos of small hive beetles, _Aethina tumida_, and a map showing the distribution of disease as of 2010 can also be seen at, http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/small_hive_beetle.htm.

The outbreak reported by Costa Rica is located in the Canton of La Cruz in the Province of Guanacaste. This canton is in the northernmost part of the country https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Cruz_(canton) and borders the Province of Rivas in Nicaragua, where an outbreak of _Aethina tumida_ was reported in March of 2014 (see report below). In Nicaragua, 23 outbreaks were reported in 2014 (see annual report 2014 at, http://tinyurl.com/ong2592), and 16 outbreaks were reported during the 1st 6 months of 2015 (see 1st 6-monthly report for 2015 at http://tinyurl.com/nsxkbjc).

Now with the occurrence of _Aethina tumida_ in Costa Rica, it appears that the disease has spread throughout Central America. In December 2007, _Aethina tumida_ was confirmed in El Salvador.
