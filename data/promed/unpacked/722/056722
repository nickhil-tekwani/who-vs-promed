Signs of cercospora and powdery mildew in beet
---------------------------------------------------------
The 1st signs of cercospora and powdery mildew have been found in
sugar beet crops, British Sugar has confirmed. The appearance of
cercospora -- in crops in North West Norfolk -- may come as a
surprise to some, as the disease normally prefers hot conditions,
which have been relatively few and far between so far this summer
[2007]. But, recent wet, humid weather has encouraged its
development. Cercospora will develop when there are 5 or 6 days when
the temperature is above 17 degrees C [62.6 degrees F] and humidity
above 98 percent.
British Sugar's Colin Walters advised growers to be vigilant, but was
not unduly concerned by the appearance of either disease. "Now is the
time to be going in with a decent triazole and get everything treated
within the next 2 to 3 weeks." Treatments for controlling powdery
mildew usually last 4-8 weeks (depending on product and disease
severity), so growers considering spraying before symptoms appear
should take into account disease history and variety susceptibility,
the British Beet Research Organisation added.
Applications now would lose 2 weeks of that effect if disease did not
appear until late July, it said. Where crops were backward (i.e., not
covering or only just covered across the row) growers were advised
not to apply a triazole or strobilurin fungicide yet. If powdery
mildew was to come into these early, consider a treatment of
quinoxyfen or sulphur, followed by a triazole in mid-August, it suggested.

[_Cercospora beticola_ is considered the most destructive foliar
pathogen of sugarbeet worldwide. The fungus affects most species of
_Beta_ (cultivated and wild) and has also been reported on many weed
species which can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on sugar
beet (_Beta vulgaris_) include circular leaf spots with
characteristic black centres that coalesce and, in severe cases, can
lead to complete leaf collapse. During severe outbreaks, new leaf
growth can be seen emerging from the centre of collapsed leaves. It
reduces yield and quality of sugarbeet. In addition, control by
fungicides adds costs to producers and has selected for
fungicide-tolerant _C. beticola_ strains. Partial genetic resistance
in _Beta_ varieties is also used in disease management.
Powdery mildew of sugar beet is caused by the fungus _Erysiphe
betae_. It is a serious foliar disease resulting in sugar yield
losses of up to 30 percent. The fungus occurs worldwide in sugar beet
and also infects other edible beet crops, but its host range is
confined to the genus _Beta_ only. The precise mechanisms by which it
infects its host are still unclear. Sources of genetic resistance
have been identified in cultivated and wild _Beta_ germplasm and
resistant varieties of sugar beet are being developed. The pathogen
can also be controlled by fungicides.
