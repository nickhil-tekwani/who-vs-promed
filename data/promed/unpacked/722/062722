Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis, Canada
---------------------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 16 Aug 2019 from Dr Jaspinder Komal, deputy chief veterinary officer, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Canada

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 14 Jun 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 14 Aug 2019
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus [IHHNV]
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Calgary, Alberta
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Jun 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: closed
Total animals affected
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
White leg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei_) / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / 555 000 / 5550 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Canada received a notification on 14 Jun 2019 from a country that exports shrimp for culture to Canada that IHHN had been detected in the export facility. This outbreak cluster applies to 4 separate premises with white leg shrimp in Canada which all imported shrimp from the affected exporting facility. In one premises, the imported shrimp all died, which was believed to be a transport issue. However, the rearing water for these shrimps was not disposed of or treated before new shrimp from a domestic source were introduced. No clinical signs were noted in this population. The other 3 premises exhibited noticeable variation in shrimp size, but this could not be attributed solely to IHHN; other issues may have been responsible for the variation. Some mortality above baseline levels were noted but was attributed to other causes.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
White leg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei_) / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals

Epidemiological comments: All 4 premises are epidemiologically linked due to a common source of imported shrimp post-larvae. The additional infected premises are located in British Columbia and Ontario. The total number of susceptible animals for the outbreak cluster is 2 435 300, and the estimated number of cases is 24 353. Some morbidity and mortality were observed at 3 premises, but it is impossible to attribute to infection of the populations with IHHNV, as other concurrent issues could explain the morbidity and mortality. This explains why morbidity and mortality were reported as 0. Sampling and testing for this outbreak investigation were designed to detect IHHNV at a 1% prevalence detection limit. This 1% detection limit was used to estimate the number of cases. All these premises are land-based, closed-contained recirculation operations with no effluent discharge. There are no known IHHNV wild susceptible species in the natural environment in Canada. The 4 infected premises are under official quarantine, and any movements of animals and things in or out of the quarantine sites are under official supervision. Once all affected animals are removed, all the premises will be required to undergo cleaning and disinfection under official supervision. The goal of the investigation is to eradicate IHNNV from these premises and the country. Besides these 4 premises, there is only one more premises in Canada that cultures _Litopenaeus vannamei_. This premises was also investigated and has tested negative for IHHNV. The 1st follow-up report will be prepared and submitted when new information on any of the 4 premises that are part of this outbreak cluster becomes available or when any of the applied control measures identified have been carried out and completed.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, traceability, quarantine, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: killing for commercial use or own use, disinfection

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Gulf Biocontainment Unit (national laboratory) / white leg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei_) / histopathological examination / 14 Aug 2019 / inconclusive
Gulf Biocontainment Unit (national laboratory) / white leg shrimp (_L. vannamei_) / in situ hybridisation (ISH) / 14 Aug 2019 / positive
Gulf Fisheries Centre (national laboratory) / white leg shrimp (_L. vannamei_) / gene sequencing / 8 Aug 2019 / positive
Gulf Fisheries Centre (national laboratory) / white leg shrimp (_L. vannamei_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 8 Aug 2019 / positive
Pacific Biological Station (national laboratory) / white leg shrimp (_L. vannamei_) / real-time PCR / 26 Jul 2019 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["IHHN is an infectious disease that affects crustaceans. It is caused by the infectious hypodermal and haematopoitic necrosis virus (IHHNV), which belongs to the family Parvoviridae and genus _Penstyldensovirus_.

"The species of crustaceans that can be infected by IHHNV are listed below:
_Farfantepenaeus aztecus_ (northern brown shrimp)
_Farfantepenaeus californiensis_ (yellow leg shrimp)
_Litopenaeus setiferus_ (northern white shrimp)
_Litopenaeus stylirostris_ (blue shrimp)
_Penaeus monodon_ (giant tiger prawn)
_Litopenaeus vannamei_ (white leg shrimp)

"_Litopenaeus vannamei_ is currently the only species of shrimp cultured in land-based facilities in Canada. This species does not naturally exist in Canada's aquatic environment. None of the other susceptible species naturally exists in Canada.

"IHHNV causes disease that varies in severity in different shrimp species. For example:

_L. Stylirostris_ experience the most severe effects in which up to 90% of deaths can be observed within a few weeks of the 1st signs of the disease.

_L. vannamei_ often experience chronic infections with no or very little mortality observed over long periods of time. Even though deaths may not be significant in infected _L. vannamei_, they may still exhibit any of the following signs: poor feed conversion ratio; stunted growth; large variation in sizes of shrimps in population; appearance of shrimps with deformed shell, rostrum, appendages, abdomen, and tail; and soft and mottled shell.

"Not all infected crustaceans will show clinical signs or visible symptoms of disease.

"IHHN is an immediately notifiable disease in Canada. Therefore, any laboratory that diagnoses or suspects the appearance of IHHN in an animal is required by law to notify the CFIA.

"If IHHN is found in Canada, the CFIA would implement disease response activities to help control its spread. These may include:
- inspection and testing of animals
- controlling the movements of infected animals that people own or work with
- ordering removal of imported contaminated live or dead aquatic animals, carcasses, part of carcasses or offal, aquatic animal products
- humanely destroying infected animals
- ordering cleaning and disinfecting of facilities and equipment that is contaminated

"The chosen control measures would depend on the situation.

"IHHN cannot be transferred to humans and does not affect food safety." Source: Fact sheet - Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoitic Necrosis - Canadian Food Inspection Agency available at https://tinyurl.com/y5dv3ka7. - Mod.CRD
