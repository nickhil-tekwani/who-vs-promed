Recently, 26 people have become ill because of eating stale mackerel but have now recovered. [A representative from] Shenzhen CDC reported that histamine poisoning is a common fishborne disease in humans.

Fishborne histamine poisoning can be related to mackerel, tunny, skipjack, saury, wahoo, sardine and many other fish that contain much histidine. When this fish is stale or has been stored improperly, bacteria will turn the histidine into histamine. When accumulated to a certain amount of histamine, it will cause symptoms.

It is known that histamine poisoning happens often in Shenzhen [Guangdong province]. Histamine poisoning often happens in autumn. Clinical features include a whole body skin flush and warm discomfort in entire body, headache, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, tachycardia, chest distress and drop in blood pressure. Some patients may have wheezing. Recovery occurs in 1-2 days.

[Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels of accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is produced and can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize the naturally occurring histidine in fish. This most often occurs when fish is held at ambient or high temperatures (such as 70 to 90 deg F / 21.1 to 32.2 deg C) for several hours, but can occur at more moderate temperatures (over 45 deg F or over 7.2 deg C). Rapid chilling of fish immediately after catch is the most effective measure to prevent scombroid fish poisoning. Fish from the family _Scombridae_ (such as tuna and mackerel) contain high levels of free histidine in muscle tissue and are the commonest sources of scombroid fish poisoning, but other fish (such as mahi mahi, amberjack, bluefish, abalone, and sardines) also have been implicated.

The symptoms of scombroid are identical to those of an allergic reaction since the mediator of both are the same, histamine; but in scombroid's case, the histamine is externally produced and not secreted by the affected person's mast cells. The symptoms generally begin 15-60 minutes after ingestion and usually resolve within several hours. - Mod.LL
