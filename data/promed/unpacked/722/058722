Mali has confirmed a new case of Ebola, bringing to 8 the number of people who have fallen ill with the deadly disease in the West African country. A government statement issued Monday night [24 Nov 2014] said the patient had been placed in a treatment center. All of Mali's Ebola cases can be traced back to a 70-year-old imam who was brought to the country from Guinea, where the epidemic 1st began; 6 of Mali's 8 Ebola patients have died. The government said Sat [22 Nov 2014] that another patient who tested positive was also receiving treatment and had been isolated. Officials are monitoring 271 people in a bid to contain the disease... - more

An Italian doctor who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone is being flown to Italy, the Health Ministry in Rome said on Mon [24 Nov 2014]. The ministry said the doctor, who had been working for the humanitarian group Emergency, was in a stable condition and was eating and drinking on his own. He is expected to arrive on Monday night and will be treated in the Lazzaro Spallanzani infectious diseases institute in Rome, the ministry said.

[3] West Africa: MSF Ebola crisis update
Date: Fri 21 Nov 2014

http://www.msf.org/article/ebola-crisis-update-21st-november-2014


Since the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was officially declared on 22 Mar 2014 in Guinea, it has claimed [a reported] 5420 lives in the region. The outbreak is the largest ever and is currently affecting 4 countries in West Africa: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Mali. One person in Spain and 3 people in the USA have recovered; one person in the USA has died. Outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal have been declared over. A separate outbreak in DRC has also ended.

Following announcements made in the last weeks, deployment of international aid is slowly rolling out in the 3 main countries affected: Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. However, there is little indication that current efforts to increase capacity to isolate and take care of suspected and confirmed Ebola cases will address needs sufficiently.

Last week, MSF and 3 research institutions announced that clinical trials for 3 different treatments would be carried out at MSF sites in West Africa:

1) The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) will lead a trial for the antiviral drug favipiravir at an MSF facility in Gueckedou, Guinea;

2) The Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) will lead a trial of convalescent whole blood and plasma therapy at the MSF Donka Ebola centre in Conakry, Guinea; and

3) The University of Oxford will lead, on behalf of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), a Wellcome Trust-funded trial of the antiviral drug brincidofovir at a site yet to be determined.

The United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) has been set up and will be based in Ghana to pursue 5 strategic priorities:
- stop the spread of the disease;
- treat the infected;
- ensure essential services;
- preserve stability; and
- prevent the spread of the disease to countries currently unaffected.

MSF teams in West Africa are still seeing critical gaps in all aspects of the response, including
- medical care,
- training of health staff,
- infection control,
- contact tracing,
- epidemiological surveillance,
- alert and referral systems,
- community education, and
- mobilisation [Don't they mean ambulances and transport? - Mod.JW].

MSF has been responding to the outbreak since March 2014 and currently has more than 3400 staff working in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Mali, treating an increasing number of patients. Since the response began, 24 MSF staff members have fallen ill with Ebola, 11 of whom have recovered. The vast majority of these infections were found to have occurred in the community [i.e. not in Ebola hospitals or treatment units. - Mod.JW]... - more

[4] West Africa: Germany sends motorbikes
Date: 21 Nov 2014

The specially adapted fleet of bikes will be able to rush test samples to laboratories from remote areas, where patients can often wait 9 days or more for results. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said the motorbikes should cut transport delays to a day. Experts say faster test results could help slow the spread of the epidemic, which has so far claimed more than 5400 lives, according to the UN. "The samples coming from 53 districts in the 3 worst-affected countries -- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia -- will be able to be taken to the closest laboratory in less than 24 hours," said WFP spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs.

The announcement comes as a new airlift by the agency, the 5th since September [2014], landed in the Liberian capital Monrovia carrying water kits and generators. The WFP estimates that 1.7 million people in the 3 countries are threatened by hunger, 200 000 of them directly because of the Ebola outbreak.

[5] Liberia: New focus on tracking down rural Ebola cases
Date: Fri 21 Nov 2014
Source: NPR [edited]
http://www.npr.org/2014/11/21/365638390/cdc-tries-old-school-epidemiology-to-fight-ebola


The Centers for Disease Control is trying out a system of rapid response teams for isolated rural areas. About 2 hours outside of the Liberian capital Monrovia, just down the coast on the Atlantic Ocean, near a town called Buchanan, is basically a series of tents that are the size of a house, which serve as Ebola Treatment Units (ETU), places where people can be isolated and treated who are confirmed to have the disease. But many health experts are asking whether building these Ebola Treatment Units is the best use of medical resources now in the fight against Ebola.

This is because the characteristics of the Ebola epidemic are really undergoing significant changes in Liberia. When the epidemic 1st started in Guinea and then crossed over the borders into rural Liberia, ill people started going to the capital, Monrovia, to get care. That's when there really was an explosion of cases in Monrovia. So at that time, around September 2014, health officials saw the need for treatment centers outside the main city, treatment centers in the outlying counties, so people did not need to come to the capital.

But what's happening now is people, and families are leaving the capital and going all the way back into really remote areas from which they came when they're sick. And so local hotspots occurred all over the country in very remote areas, far away even from any treatment centers.

So what a lot of experts are saying now is that there is a need to respond to this with Rapid Response Teams -- people who can get out into very remote areas to find people who are sick, or people who have been in contact with people who are sick -- and decide what to do, there, at the very local level. What began as a medical problem has now developed, in addition, into a social problem and even a political problem.

In these very remote areas, there is a major problem getting just the simplest health information message out to the populace. "Rapid" really means teaching the sort of basic public health and preventive measures that had been easier to deal with in Monrovia, with posters and public service announcements or messages on a cell phone.

The community, helped by the Rapid Response Team, might decide to just isolate the ill people there in the village and work with the community to agree who should be quarantined and treated right there in the village. They might involve a nearby village with an existing clinic, already a part of the Liberian health system. The plan might include building an isolation tent next to an existing clinic and allowing care for ill patients there. Or they might find patients and families well enough to get all the way to an existing ETU.

The ETUs are best in certain circumstances. So locations for ETUs and how best to handle rural cases are best made on a case-by-case basis. The sooner you get someone into treatment, the better chances they have of survival, because treatment is primarily hydration and medicine to take down fever... - more

[6] Liberia: Ebola response hampered by infighting
Date: Wed 19 Nov 2014
Source: NY Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/world/africa/ebola-response-in-liberia-is-hampered-by-infighting-.html?_r=1.


The global response to the Ebola virus outbreak in Liberia is being hampered by poor coordination and serious disagreements between Liberian officials and the donors and health agencies fighting the epidemic, according to minutes of top-level meetings and interviews with participants.

Even now, 3 months after donors began pouring resources into Liberia, many confirmed cases still go unreported, countries refuse to change plans to erect field hospitals in the wrong places, families cannot find out whether their relatives in treatment are alive or dead, health workers sent to take temperatures sometimes lack thermometers, and bodies have been cremated because a larger cemetery was not yet open.

The detailed accounts of high-level meetings, the most recent from Mon 17 Nov 2014, lifted the veil on the messy and contentious process of running the sprawling response to Liberia's epidemic, one that now involves more than 100 government agencies, charities and donors from around the world.

Despite these problems, with help from donors, Liberia, one of the 3 most afflicted West African countries and the one with the highest death toll, has seen new cases drop to about 20 a day from about 100 a day 2 months ago. Experts attribute that to fearful Liberians touching one another less, more safe burials of bodies, and distribution of protective gear to health care workers. But they also warn that cases are now holding steady and could explode again... - more
