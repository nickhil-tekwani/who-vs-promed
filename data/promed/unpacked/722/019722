[In the 3 days since the last ProMED update, there have been 5 new laboratory confirmed cases and 4 fatalities reported. With these new cases, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now at 950 including 412 deaths, raising the reported case fatality rate to 43.4 percent. Of note, since 1 Mar 2015 there have been 28 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV of which 16 (57 percent) were reported to be in either critical condition or had already died at the time of their confirmation report, suggesting that the majority of cases that are confirmed are presenting with severe disease -- consistent with the case definition, but potentially missing milder clinical presentations (see discussion on the Qatari case below in section [3]).

[As with previous WHO updates on reported cases in Saudi Arabia, the update above helps to clarify and provide more information from epidemiologic investigations that were conducted after the initial reports of the cases on the Saudi MOH website. There is mention at the end of this update that contact tracing is ongoing. It would be interesting to know if there have been asymptomatic infections identified during the contact tracing.

Of the 18 cases reported in the WHO update above, 2 were household contacts of previously confirmed cases, 9 had contact with the healthcare environment in the 14 days preceding onset of illness as the most likely source of their infection (even though direct contact with confirmed cases was not always identified), and the remaining 7 had no history of high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

In the reports above, case no. 1 does not fully match with information provided on the Saudi MOH website. The report above is for a 53-year-old expat male in critical condition in the ICU, whereas the MOH report was for a 53-year-old Saudi male in stable condition at the time of report, and reported as having recovered on 6 Mar 2015. Clarification from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Qatar, 11 Mar 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [9 Mar 2015], the IHR National Focal Point of Qatar notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case are as follows:
A 69-year-old male from Al Shahaniya city developed symptoms on [27 Feb 2015]. He sought medical advice at a primary health care center on [3 Mar 2015] and was referred to the emergency department of a hospital on the same day. The patient received symptomatic treatment and was discharged on the same day. As his symptoms worsened, he was admitted to the emergency department of the same hospital on [6 Mar 2015]. The patient has comorbidities. He has history of frequent contact with camels and regular consumption of raw camel milk. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU.

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the case.

Globally, WHO has been notified of [1060] laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 394 related deaths.

[According to the reports above, as of 11 Mar 2015 there have been a total of 1060 laboratory confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV reported to WHO, including at least 394 deaths (case fatality rate 37 percent).

Reading the description of the Qatar case above having presented to an emergency room for medical care, receiving symptomatic treatment, and then worsening and being admitted to the hospital and a MERS-CoV test resulting positive, it is easy to understand how a common denominator in the presentation of many of the cases in Saudi Arabia is "contact with the healthcare environment" where there may be MERS-CoV infected individuals who are mildly symptomatic, but because of the mild illness are not thought of as suspected MERS-CoV infected. Hence, there may well be unknown contact with MERS-CoV infected individuals occurring in the healthcare environment.

[4] Germany: sequencing of MERS-CoV case
Date: Thu 12 Mar 2015
From: Christian Drosten <drosten@virology-bonn.de>


MERS-Coronavirus, Germany, sequencing posted
--------------------------------------------
A preliminary genome sequence and phylogeny for a case of MERS-Coronavirus infection reported last week [week of 2 Mar 2015] is available on our homepage, http://www.virology-bonn.de. The virus pertains to a clade of viruses detected in 2014 and particularly in 2013 in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. It is not related to viruses detected last year [2014] in the United Arab Emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi, where the German patient is thought to have acquired his infection. It is also not related to the virus that caused the spring outbreak in 2014 in Jeddah. Sequences from the present outbreaks in Saudi Arabia will be appreciated.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Drosten for sharing this information on the recently reported case in Germany with history of travel to the United Arab Emirates in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. The findings are fascinating when one tries to postulate the transmission routes from 2013 and 2014. It is interesting to see it is also related to the virus identified in Indiana, USA, in 2014. Perhaps, sequencing of more of the viruses in circulation in Saudi Arabia might shed more light on the transmission chains of the MERS-CoV. Hopefully sequences of viruses currently circulating in Saudi Arabia will be made available as per Dr Drosten's request. - Mod.MPP]
