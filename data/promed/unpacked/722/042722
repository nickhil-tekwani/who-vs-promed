People of Karnamadhu village in Karimganj district are in panic mode due to a mysterious disease that has already taken the lives of 6 children. 3 of the children were from the same family.

According to reports many more have been infected with the disease with symptoms of pain in the throat, fever and bleeding from the mouth, ultimately leading to death. Due to the fear of infection, children have been made to wear protective masks. So far around 25 people have been affected by this disease. Those affected are being treated at Karimganj Civil Hospital and Silchar Medical College and Hospital.

Officials from the health department, Assam, have performed health screening and taken blood samples that have been sent to Silchar Medical College and Hospital for examining. Dr Anup Kumar Daityari, Joint Director, Health Department, Karimganj informed, "We had received information that in Karnamadhu a few patients had died. We immediately sent a medical team who collected information that 6 children had died. 4 of these had gone to Silchar Medical College for treatment and died there. We have again sent a medical team in the morning comprising of ENT [ear, nose, and throat] and pediatricians. They have screened 25 children there. The ENT doctors have reported that some of them had pharyngitis, some had tonsillitis."

[Based on the information in the report above, the cases had sore throat with fever, with tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis seen in screened children. The important concern here is the high number of fatal cases. Since all the clinical and epidemiological information, including vaccination history is not available, the possibility of bacterial sepsis associated with streptococcal infection cannot be ruled out. Left untreated, throat infection can, in a limited number of cases, become life threatening if the airway is cut off or if the infection spreads into the bloodstream and leads to rheumatic fever or sepsis (a life-threatening bacterial blood infection).

The bleeding from the mouth mentioned above has been described as a clinical manifestation in tonsillitis and severe respiratory infections.

Other possible causes may include a toxin exposure and rarely Lemierre's syndrome, caused by _Fusobacterium necrophorum_ (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695513/]. Any updates from the health officials on the ground on the clinical course, epidemiological data, and final diagnosis will be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA]

[In the absence of suppurative local complications and invasive disease, GAS (group A streptococcal) pharyngitis is self-limited. Bacteremia rarely follows GAS pharyngitis, and an outbreak involving multiple cases of complicated GAS pharyngitis would be very unusual (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333425/). Also, bleeding from the mouth or elsewhere complicating GAS pharyngitis would also be very unusual.

Lemierre syndrome is a peripharyngeal infection, usually due to _Fusobacterium necrophorum_, which is complicated by bacteremia, internal jugular suppurative thrombophlebitis, and septic pulmonary embolization that is seen in healthy adolescents and young adults (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015694/). I doubt this would cause an outbreak with multiple cases.

However, pharyngitis is often a prominent complaint in viral hemorrhagic fever (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hemorrhagic-fever). Viruses in the hemorrhagic fever group, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Ebola, and Marburg viruses, produce acute pharyngitis early in the course of the disease (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/symptoms/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00037085.htm). - Mod.ML
