Sheep & goats / 2.00% / 0.00% / 0.00% / 0.00%
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Illegal movement of animals; vectors
Epidemiological comments: To complete the project (SORO.LIB 801.CHA) about Rift Valley fever in Libya, sample collection (from sheep and goats) from the Southern area was completed by the surveillance team. The total number of samples is 426. The following signs were reported by the surveillance team: abortion in all stages of gestation, newborn deaths after respiratory manifestation and diarrhoea in some cases. The signs appeared in goats that were involved in illegal movement.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, traceability, quarantine, disinfection, control of vectors, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; vector surveillance; ante- and post-mortem inspections.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Sheep & goats / IgM-capture ELISA / 26 Feb 2020 / Positive

[OIE's summary of the (continuing) Rift Valley fever (RVF) event in Libya, since its reported start on 12 Dec 2019, is the following:
Total outbreaks = 7 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Sheep / 264 / 22 / 3 / 0 / 0
Sheep & goats / 455 / 7 / 1 / 0 / 0

Although the event has been reported from southern desert parts of Libya, the Al Jawf area, from where the first 5 outbreaks were reported, is one of the most heavily irrigated oases in the Sahara, providing water and forage for domestic animals. In desert environments, the oases also provide suitable ecological conditions for the proliferation of mosquito populations. The weather forecast for the coming months highlights above-average rains in the area. This could maintain the ecological conditions for outbreak persistence if competent RVF mosquitoes occur in the area. However, it is not known whether RVF-competent species are present in Al Jawf because this information is not available.

The origin of the outbreak is not known but could be related to the illegal movement of infected animals from neighbouring countries.

Information on the climatic and ecological situation of the 2 new outbreaks, situated considerably west of the earlier outbreaks (map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=32934), will be useful. More information on the clinical effect of the disease, if any, in the affected flocks would also be helpful.

No information on human health involvement has become available from Libya since the start of the event. - Mod.AS
