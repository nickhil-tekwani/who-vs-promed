Experts seek help after steep rise in hospital bug infections
-------------------------------------------------------------
Public health experts are consulting hospitals in the US and Canada
for advice on tackling a virulent strain of bacteria that is thought
to be responsible for 12 deaths at Stoke Mandeville hospital over the
past 2 years, it emerged yesterday, 6 Jun 2005.
Staff at the Health Protection Agency say the particular strain of
_Clostridium difficile_ appears to be similar to one found in some
hospitals in North America. They want to establish whether it is the
same strain, and if so, to get advice on dealing with it.
_C. difficile_ is not rare, new or dangerous under most
circumstances. It is carried harmlessly in the gut of half of all
children under the age of 2 and substantial numbers of adults. The 12
deaths have to be set in the context of more than 43 000 reported
infections in 2004. But the strain persisting at Stoke Mandeville
hospital produces toxins which can cause problems for the very
elderly and frail.
Unlike the so-called superbug MRSA (methicillin-resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_), _C. difficile_ is not resistant to
antibiotics. But, said Mark Enright, a microbiologist and senior
research fellow at Bath University, it is still the use of
antibiotics that causes it to become a problem.
"It is a common component of the gut, in balance with all the other
bacteria with it which are helpful -- we can't digest food without
them. But _C. difficile_ forms spores like hardy seeds which are not
killed when somebody has a long course of antibiotics and some
strains have toxins that they excrete," he said.
This toxin production results in diarrhea. In very elderly people who
are already weak and frail because of illness, complications from
damage to the gut or the dehydration caused by diarrhea could be a
factor in their death.
"We are treating an ageing population and doing more adventurous
surgery," said Dr Enright. "People will succumb to something
eventually."
The particular problem with _C. difficile_ is that the spores are
very hard to get rid of from the ward. The alcohol wipes now used by
doctors and nurses to prevent the spread of most bacteria do not
work. Surfaces have to be cleaned with bleach and hands should be
washed with soap and water.
Dr Enright said the over-use of antibiotics in hospitals was a major
factor in the increase of _C. difficile_ cases, which went up by 32
percent between 2002 and 2003 and 23 percent between 2003 and 2004.
Overcrowding in hospitals and lack of ventilation were also issues.
The Department of Health said that diarrhea linked to _C. difficile_
was added in 2004 to the list of infections that must be reported to
the HPA in order to establish the scale of the problem. The first
results will be published later in 2005.
"The HPA has received some reports of this new strain and is keeping
a watching brief on this, but the available information indicates
that this new strain is rare in the UK," said a spokesman.

[This report suggests that the _C. difficile_ strain is indeed similar, if not
identical, to the toxinotype III strain circulating in the USA and Canada.
Clearly, antimicrobial controls and aggressive infection control must be
components of a control program for this organism. - Mod.LL]
