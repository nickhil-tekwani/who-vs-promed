B.C. avian flu outbreak spreads to 29 farms
--------------------------------------------
The avian flu outbreak, restricted 2 months ago to one farm in Abbotsford,
B.C., has now leapfrogged as far as Cloverdale -­ a farming region
southeast of Vancouver -- in Surrey, raising to 29 the number of infected
farms housing almost one million birds, a federal official revealed Thursday.
"We're working extremely hard to bring this disease under control," said
Cornelius Kiley, regional veterinarian with the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency. "But without proper biosecurity, things are not moving forward as
quickly as they could. Industry and individual bird owners must take
personal responsibility. It will make the difference."
Kiley said an emergency operations staff of 150 is working on the crisis,
but emphasized staff visiting farms are using the highest biosecurity
measures and are not responsible for the continued spread of the highly
contagious virus. Unfortunately, he said, not all people [moving with] their
machinery between farms are exercising caution.

More B.C. farms hit by avian flu
------------------------------------
Poultry from British Columbia's avian flu-plagued Fraser Valley has been
cleared to return to Canadian supermarket shelves while the number of farms
hit with the virus grows.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency lifted a ban on sales of healthy
poultry outside the quarantine zone effective today. That means producers
can finally begin shipping fresh and frozen chicken and turkey products
that have been piling up in coolers for weeks.
However, the poultry can't be exported nor even enter federally registered
processors or storage sites that handle exported products.
"If the product from the Fraser Valley goes directly to an end-use grocery
store, distribution outlets that are not federally registered, then there
is no way that this product could go for export," said Dr. Cornelius Kiley,
the agency's chief B.C. veterinarian.
Some 42 countries have imposed some form of poultry ban on products from
Canada or British Columbia.
Meanwhile, 3 more poultry operations have been found with the
fast-spreading virus, raising the total to 28 from 25 since Monday. The new
sites are outside the original 10km-wide "hot zone" where the first
avian flu cases were confirmed in February 2004. "The surveillance area
doesn't exist any more," Kiley said. "We're dealing with a larger control
area. Patterns of infection have emerged since officials began battling the
highly infectious disease," he said.
"A farm in between will start out as negative but we're finding that that
farm invariably becomes positive within a few days. We continue to believe
the main route of transmission is via mechanical means, that the virus is
piggybacking on something to get there despite all the precautions being
taken."
There are about 700 commercial poultry operations in the Fraser Valley
control zone and thousands of backyard flocks, said Kiley, who warned
poultry producers to redouble their infection-control measures.
"Our collective success here is going to have to depend on very strict
biosecurity, adhered to by everyone," he said.
Officials have begun culling the Fraser Valley's 19 million birds, with
healthy birds sent to processors and then to Canadian stores. Poultry
stockpiled since the quarantine will also head to market.
"The vast majority of this fresh and frozen poultry product is likely
already processed in a way that would allow it to go directly to the
consumer," said Kiley. Fraser Valley poultry will have to be labelled in
its bulk form, but consumer labeling will depend on the processors, he
said. "I don't see any reason why it would need to be identified down to
the smallest package form. It's already been totally inspected and it's
come from perfectly normal birds."
There's no indication of how long export bans might remain in place. Kiley
said the general international guideline is 6 months after the avian flu
outbreak has been cleared and all farms have been disinfected.
Infected bird carcasses are being disposed of through composting and
incineration. A landfill near Cache Creek, about 220 kilometres northeast
of Vancouver, has been designated to take the overflow.

B.C. minister says avian flu 'not under control'
-----------------------------------------------
B.C. Agriculture Minister John van Dongen says the avian flu in the Fraser
Valley is still out of control, after new figures show 29 poultry farms are
now infected with the virus. The spread continues in spite of bio-security
measures.
Van Dongen says mobile kilns are still the preferred way to dispose of the
bird carcasses. But he says incineration and landfills are also part of the
province's containment plan.
The province has ordered the killing of 19 million birds.
Anyone going near a farm has to wear protective clothing, and health
officials are urging people to wash vehicle tires and wipe their feet
constantly on special anti-flu mats. But in spite of those measures, van
Dongen says the virus lives on.
"The problem is not under control, and the biggest difficulty we have is
moving dead birds. And if we don't get co-operation and assistance to move
these dead birds and deal with them, then the problem will continue to get
worse," he said.
The B.C. government has invoked an emergency order to have the birds
disposed of in landfills outside the control zone.
The move has angered the community of Cache Creek. Protesters, worried
about the spread of the virus, continue to block the road leading into
their waste facility. No infected poultry has been sent to them yet. But
the minister says it must remain an option because of the large number of
dead birds.
Van Dongen will meet with the mayors of communities affected by the order
on Friday. He says they all must do their part to stamp out the spread of
avian flu.
