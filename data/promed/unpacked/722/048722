A range of 48 Nippy's fruit juice products have been taken off shelves
nationwide as a result of the city-wide _Salmonella_ outbreak. And
shopkeepers risk a $5000 fine - $10,000 for a second offence - if they
knowingly sell any of the banned items.
Laboratory tests completed about 3PM yesterday confirmed the debilitating
[organism was in the company's fresh-chilled orange juice product range.
Health authorities issued a public warning about the juices about 10 AM
yesterday when the outbreak was linked to the company for the first time
since 74 people became ill within two weeks. The warning was upgraded to a
blanket ban when medical authorities cultured _Salmonella_ from Nippy's
orange juice samples.
The contamination is the first of its type in Australia. Yesterday,
scientists and the company were unable to even hint at a source but were
continuing tests. They said _Salmonella_ should not normally survive in
fruit juices.
Almost all the 74 victims are under 30 and from metropolitan Adelaide, with
eight requiring hospital treatment. No cases have been reported in other
States.
Department of Human Services executive director, Professor Brendon Kearney,
said researchers would know on Thursday morning whether the Nippy's
_Salmonella_ strain was the same as that responsible for the widespread
illness.
