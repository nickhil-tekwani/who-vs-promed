Recent outbreaks of typhoid and anthrax in Manicaland Province are now under control, a senior health official has said. Director of epidemiology and disease control in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Dr Portia Manangazira said in Makoni District, no anthrax related deaths were reported. She said 5 seriously ill people were still receiving treatment at Rusape General Hospital. [Originally, 6 were admitted. - Mod.MHJ]

Dr Manangazira said a team from Harare, both from the health and agricultural sections, was working flat-out to control the outbreak. "We continue to ask for co-operation from the villagers to allow our officers to slaughter the affected animals. We also appeal to the villagers not to eat any products of an affected animal," Dr Manangazira said.

So far, 27 people have been treated for anthrax after they ate meat from infected animals prior to the festive season.

[Clearly there is progress in controlling this public health problem, but it patently points up the error in allowing public health officials to be involved in the animal health dimension, "One Health" not withstanding. Firstly, animals either sick with anthrax or suspected of incubating the disease can be successfully treated with oxytetracycline, commonly marketed as LA200 as it contains 200 mg of oxytetracycline dihydrate. This is a long acting antibiotic given at a dosage of 9 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of body weight. Whereas it is hard to successfully treat humans with anthrax, treatment of livestock is frequently successful and can stop an outbreak before the vaccination kicks in. As oxytetracycline stings, use penicillin-streptomycin with horses or else your life is at risk.

Secondly, if you go around slaughtering peoples' cattle, it does wonders for getting their cooperation -- they immediately tell you nothing and hide their livestock. So let us veterinarians look after the livestock and manage their owners. Just remember, if you have been using long acting antibiotics on suspect animals with a possible incubating infection, you should delay vaccinating these latter animals by 5-7 days to allow the antibiotic titre in the blood to fall below the level where it would interfere with the live Sterne vaccine. - Mod.MHJ
