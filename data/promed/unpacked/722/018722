A 2nd bacterium has contributed to the mass food poisoning in Caldwell Parish according to Dr. Parham Jaberi, assistant state health officer. In addition to the _Salmonella_ already found in stool samples submitted to the state, _Clostridium perfringens_, a bacterium commonly found on raw meat and poultry, has been identified.

"When we got the samples, we continued to test for toxins," Jaberi said. "These are organisms that, when they are ingested, they release a toxin that gets you sick. What that means is that people usually become sicker in fewer hours after eating foods."

Jaberi said information from the community related that many were sick within 12 hours of eating jambalaya prepared for a local softball fundraiser. A high majority of the people who ate the dish became ill. As of [Fri 20 Oct 2017], 125 cases of a gastrointestinal illness were confirmed with 37 people hospitalized. The ages of those with a confirmed illness range from 15 to 72.

_Clostridium perfringens_ produces a toxin that causes gastrointestinal illness and presents many of the same symptoms as _Salmonella_.

"Usually these symptoms are more severe, which could explain why some of the people in the community are really going to the hospital," Jaberi said. He said it also explains the fact that so many people who had the food became ill so quickly.

The Department of Health is continuing to test for the presence of additional organisms but does not anticipate any new findings. Some of the ingredients in the jambalaya also are being tested individually. Jaberi said the processing of food particles will take longer, and he does not anticipate results being available until the middle of next week [week of Sun 22 Oct 2017]. He said it is important for people to keep following safety guidelines, to dispose of any remaining jambalaya in their homes and to not consume the dish or any items that might have been in contact with it.

The sick should drink plenty of fluids to combat dehydration and visit their primary care doctor if symptoms persist for more than 3 days.

[It is not that rare for large foodborne illness outbreaks to be multifactorial. Both salmonellosis and _C. perfringens_ food poisoning cause foodborne diarrhea and abdominal pain. The major differences between the illnesses are that the incubation period for salmonellosis is somewhat longer, the length of illness for salmonellosis is also substantially longer and clinically, salmonellosis is associated with fever whereas _C. perfringens_ foodborne illness is not. The lack of fever is similar to _S. aureus_ foodborne illness. Unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness where the preformed toxin is ingested, in _C. perfringens_ disease the enterotoxin is formed _in situ_ in the gastrointestinal tract.

The following discussion was obtained from a previous version of the FDA Bad Bug Book (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf):

"1. Name of the organism
_Clostridium perfringens_ is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming rod. It is widely distributed in the environment and frequently occurs in the intestines of humans and many domestic and feral animals. Spores of the organism persist in soil, sediments, and areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.

2. Nature of acute disease
Perfringens food poisoning is the term used to describe the common foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_. A more serious but rare illness is also caused by ingesting food contaminated with type C strains. The latter illness is known as enteritis necroticans or pig-bel disease.

3. Nature of disease
The common form of _C. perfringens_ poisoning is characterized by intense abdominal cramps and diarrhea, which begin 8-22 hours after consumption of foods containing large numbers of those _C. perfringens_ bacteria capable of producing the food poisoning toxin. The illness is usually over within 24 hours, but less severe symptoms may persist in some individuals for one-2 weeks. A few deaths have been reported as a result of dehydration and other complications.

Necrotic enteritis (pig-bel) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often fatal. This disease also begins as a result of ingesting large numbers of the causative bacteria in contaminated foods. Deaths from necrotic enteritis are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA.

Infective dose: The symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers (greater than 100 0000 000) vegetative cells. Toxin production in the digestive tract (or in test tubes) is associated with sporulation. This disease is a food infection; only one episode has ever implied the possibility of intoxication (that is, disease from preformed toxin).

4. Diagnosis of human illness
Perfringens poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms and the typical delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the toxin in the feces of patients. Bacteriological confirmation can also be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the causative bacteria in implicated foods or in the feces of patients.

5. Associated foods
In most instances, the actual cause of poisoning by _C. perfringens_ is temperature abuse of prepared foods. Small numbers of the organisms are often present after cooking and multiply to food poisoning levels during cool down and storage of prepared foods. Meats, meat products, and gravy are the foods most frequently implicated.

6. Relative frequency of disease
Perfringens poisoning is one of the most commonly reported foodborne illnesses in the USA. There were 1162 cases in 1981, in 28 separate outbreaks. At least 10-20 outbreaks have been reported annually in the USA for the past 2 decades. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of persons are affected. It is probable that many outbreaks go unreported because the implicated foods or patient feces are not tested routinely for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin. CDC estimates that about 10 000 actual cases occur annually in the USA.

7. Course of disease and complications
The disease generally lasts 24 hours. In the elderly or infirm, symptoms may last one-2 weeks. Complications and/or death only very rarely occur.

8. Target populations
Institutional feeding (such as school cafeterias, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, etc.) where large quantities of food are prepared several hours before serving is the most common circumstance in which perfringens poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most frequent victims of perfringens poisoning. Except in the case of pig-bel syndrome, complications are few in persons under 30 years of age. Elderly persons are more likely to experience prolonged or severe symptoms.

9. Food analysis
Standard bacteriological culturing procedures are used to detect the organism in implicated foods and in feces of patients. Serological assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces of patients and for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. The procedures take one-3 days."

The FDA discussion notes that deaths from necrotic enteritis (pig-bel syndrome) are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA. The following is a paper regarding a case of pig-bel:

Gui L, Subramony C, Fratkin J, Hughson MD: Fatal enteritis necroticans (pigbel) in a diabetic adult. Mod Pathol. 2002; 15(1): 66-70; http://www.nature.com/modpathol/journal/v15/n1/full/3880491a.html

"Abstract
--------
Enteritis necroticans is a segmental necrotizing infection of the jejunum and ileum caused by _Clostridium perfringens_, type C. The disease occurs sporadically in parts of Asia, Africa, and the South Pacific, where it primarily affects children with severe protein malnutrition. The disease is extremely rare in developed countries, where it has been seen primarily in diabetics. Two cases have previously been reported in the United States, one in a child with poorly controlled type one diabetes. A 66-year-old woman with a 12-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus developed severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea after eating a meal of turkey sausage. She died unattended at home. An autopsy showed peritonitis and segmental necrosis of the jejunum and ileum. Microscopic examination showed Gram-positive club-shaped bacilli consistent with Clostridia coating a necrotic mucosa. Products of cpa and cpb genes of _C. perfringens_, type C were identified in the necrotic jejunum by polymerase chain reaction amplification."
