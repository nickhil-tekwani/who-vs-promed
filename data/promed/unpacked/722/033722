Global and US health authorities have recommended 2 new [human] influenza
virus strains for use in the influenza vaccine for the 2006-07 season.
Last week the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
selected a "Wisconsin" strain of influenza A(H3N2) and a "Malaysia" strain
of influenza B for next season. They will replace a "California" strain of
H3N2 and a "Shanghai" strain of influenza B used in the current vaccine.
The "New Caledonia" strain of influenza A(H1N1) virus used in this year's
vaccine should be used again next season as the 3rd component of the
trivalent vaccine, the ACIP said. [The strain's full name is A/New
Caledonia/20/99[H1N1].]
The ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), followed recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO)
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in picking the strains. CDC
routinely follows the ACIP recommendations on influenza vaccines. Each
February WHO assesses the influenza virus strains in circulation before
picking the strains for the next Northern Hemisphere influenza season. In a
14 Feb 2006 report on its recommendation concerning the H3N2 strain to be
used, WHO said, "Many recent isolates were antigenically similar to the
current reference virus, A/California/7/2004, but an increasing proportion
of recent viruses was more closely related to A/Wisconsin/67/2005."
Likewise, WHO said the majority of recent influenza B isolates were similar
to the strain B/Malaysia/2506/2004, rather than to the B/Shanghai/361/2002
strain used in this year's vaccine. The Malaysia strain is antigenically
equivalent to B/Ohio/1/2005, according to CDC.
A year ago, health authorities picked only one new strain for the 2005-06
influenza vaccine, keeping the other 2 the same. According to a recent
Reuters report, a spokesman for a leading vaccine manufacturer said
changing 2 of the strains in next season's vaccine may make production less
predictable. "It does put more uncertainty into the total number of doses
you're producing at any one time," Albert Thomas, director of vaccine
manufacturing for Sanofi Pasteur, was quoted as saying. His company has
been the biggest supplier for the US market in recent years. The strains to
include in each season's vaccine must be chosen early in the year because
it takes roughly 6 months to produce the vaccine. The viruses used in
vaccines are grown in chicken eggs.
The WHO report said global influenza activity from October 2005 through
January 2006 was low compared with recent years. Several countries had
outbreaks of H3N2 influenza, but H1N1 and B viruses caused only scattered
cases in most countries, the agency said.

[Contrary to the statement in the final paragraph attributed to WHO -- that
B viruses have caused only scattered cases in most countries -- the current
week 08/2006 EISS (European Influenza Surveillance Scheme) report states
the reverse -- see:
<http://www.eiss.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi?display=1&code=177&bulletin=177>.
In Europe, Lithuania reported a high intensity of clinical influenza
activity in week 08/2006. 12 countries reported a medium intensity and 14
countries reported a low intensity. Since the start of the season, more
influenza B viruses (68 per cent) have been reported than influenza A
viruses (32 per cent) for Europe as a whole. Whilst clinical influenza
activity is now declining in a number of countries (such as France), some
countries have seen very little influenza activity so far this season (such
as Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia). No human cases of influenza A(H5N1)
virus infection have been reported in the 28 countries participating in
EISS. - Mod.CP]
