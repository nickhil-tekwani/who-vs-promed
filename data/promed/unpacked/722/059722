Red River Farm Network is reporting highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been found in South Dakota. All birds in this commercial flock will be destroyed. The confirmation came from a poultry flock in Charles Mix County in southeastern South Dakota along the Missouri River. The river is, of course, a major flyway for spring bird migration. South Dakota now joins Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, the Carolinas, and Maryland as states confirming HPAI infection.

"I think it's not a matter of if it comes to Minnesota; it's when."

So says Minnesota Board of Animal Health senior veterinarian Shauna Voss. It's only been 7 years since around 9 million birds across 110 Minnesota farms were killed by avian influenza or were euthanized to prevent the spread. The economic impact on producers was nothing short of catastrophic. Now in 2022, avian influenza has been detected in the United States. Earlier this year [2022] it was first discovered in birds in the Carolinas.

The Eurasian H5 avian influenza in hunter-harvested waterfowl was first detected by Clemson University scientists then confirmed by federal testing, and the federal Agriculture Department alerted global health officials, according to The Associated Press.

Previously, the US Department of Agriculture reported an outbreak of a highly pathogenic bird flu strain in a turkey flock in Indiana. This instantly triggered a ban on Indiana poultry from countries like China and Taiwan. Certainly, many more trade restrictions will be put in place and, unfortunately, it's also fairly certain many more cases will soon be discovered. What makes the Indiana discoveries so critical is the state's location within the Mississippi Flyway. Bird flu doesn't originate in commercial poultry flocks but is instead brought to flocks through migratory birds, often through a shared water source. The risk of the pathogen to people is low, but it spreads very quickly through commercial bird populations.

In 2015, North Dakota had 2 cases of avian flu affecting over 100 000 birds

The Bismarck Tribune reports there are 9 turkey farms in North Dakota producing around a million birds annually. But all poultry producers need to be on the lookout for sick birds or a drop in egg production.

"As migration takes place this spring, we encourage producers to focus on biosecurity," North Dakota State Vet Dr. Ethan Andress said. "Anyone involved with poultry production from backyard birds to a commercial operation should review and understand how the virus could spread to their birds, and prevent the exposure before it happens."

While the numbers are still small, we're all well aware of how quickly a pandemic can spread. For information about biosecurity measures you can take with your birds along with updates on virus activity across the country see this site: https://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/avian-influenza.

[2] Delaware (New Castle County) and Maryland (Queen Anne's County): commercial flocks, HPAI H5N1
Date: Wed 9 Mar 2022
Source: Delaware.gov, Department of Agriculture [edited]
https://news.delaware.gov/2022/03/09/two-additional-cases-of-avian-influenza-confirmed-on-delaware-and-maryland-farms/


Federal laboratory testing has confirmed 2 cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI): 1 pullet operation in New Castle County, Delaware, and 1 broiler flock in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. Following an investigation by the Delaware and Maryland departments of agriculture, the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed poultry from these farms have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI).

These avian influenza findings follow previously announced cases on farms in New Castle County, Delaware, and Cecil County, Maryland. Following these cases, federal and state partners have greatly expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen to better protect the poultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula.

State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.

Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.

Considering these new cases and the prevalence of the virus in the wild bird population, all poultry owners need to increase their vigilance in protecting their flocks from contracting avian influenza.

Key biosecurity practices:

- Clean and disinfect vehicles. Don't walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can't avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock. This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wildfowl, such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station.
- Remove loose feed. Don't give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch! Remove spilled or uneaten feed immediately, and ensure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI.
- Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds, including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles.
- Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry. Wash with soap and water (always your 1st choice). If using a hand sanitizer, remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands, because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt.
- Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud, or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush before stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean.
- Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property. When handling birds, visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear. Shower out and change clothes when leaving the facility.
- Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment (e.g., egg flats and cases) that have come in contact with birds or their droppings to exit the property, ensure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected, such as cardboard egg flats.
- Look for signs of illness. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases.

If you have sick poultry or experience increased mortality in your flock:
- Commercial poultry producers should follow the procedures of contacting the company they grow for when they notice signs of disease.
- Backyard flock owners who notice any of the signs of HPAI in their flock should contact the following:

In Delaware, email the Delaware Poultry Health Hotline at <poultry.health@delaware.gov> or call 302-698-4507 and provide your contact information, size of flock, location, and concerns.

In Maryland, report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to <MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov.>.

[3] Delaware, Maryland, Missouri: commercial flocks, HPAI H5N1
Date: Thu 10 Mar 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/three-states-report-more-avian-flu-outbreaks-poultry


Delaware, Maryland, and Missouri reported more highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks at commercial poultry farms, part of ongoing activity over the past several weeks that has led to the loss of nearly 3 million chickens and turkeys.

Also, federal officials reported 50 more highly pathogenic H5 detections from testing in wild birds, including the 1st in waterfowl in Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.

Delaware reported a 2nd outbreak in New Castle County, near Wilmington on the Delaware Bay, which was confirmed on 8 Mar [2022] and affected 265 000 pullet chickens, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS).

In neighboring Maryland, the state also reported a 2nd outbreak, this time at a broiler flock of 150 000 birds in Queen Anne's County in the eastern half of the state, according to the USDA. A joint statement from the agriculture departments in Delaware and Maryland said the outbreaks involve H5N1. They added that state and federal officials have dramatically expanded surveillance to protect poultry in the Delmarva Peninsula.

The Delmarva Peninsula poultry production area also includes Virginia's eastern shore. The Delmarva Chicken Association said about 12% of the nation's poultry supply comes from the area and that the recent outbreaks are the region's 1st since 2004. It noted that the 2 earlier outbreaks in Delaware and Maryland involved layer farms.

Elsewhere, Missouri reported 2 more outbreaks in addition to earlier detections in Bates County (backyard poultry) and Stoddard County (commercial chickens). In an update, the Missouri Department of Agriculture said the virus struck a turkey farm housing 27 000 birds in Jasper Country and a commercial poultry farm housing 37 770 in Lawrence County. Both locations are in southwestern Missouri.

In other avian flu developments, APHIS reported 50 more highly pathogenic H5 detections from wild bird sampling, including the 1st in waterfowl in Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, raising the total to 357 from 20 states.

Indiana's positive sample was from a wild duck harvested by a hunter in Dubois County, which had already reported outbreaks on turkey farms. Kansas has 5 detections, all involving hunter-harvested snow geese in Barton County, which is in the central part of the state.

Meanwhile, Missouri had 22 detections, all involving hunter-harvested birds and mostly in snow geese. One was in Buchanan County in the northwest, while the others were in Chariton County, located in the north central part of the state. Nebraska's detection was in a wild goose found dead in Lancaster County, in the southeastern part of the state near Lincoln.

The other detections were in states where testing had already found the virus in waterfowl or other birds: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Most of the birds were tested after they were found dead.

The outbreaks in wild birds and poultry involve the Eurasian H5N1 strain that is circulating in a number of world regions, including Europe, where the virus has caused substantial poultry losses. The virus has also sickened one person in the United Kingdom who had close contact with poultry. The risk to humans is thought to be low, except for people who have close contact with sick birds.

Monitoring is underway in the United States in people exposed to the affected flocks, and so far, no illnesses have been reported.

[4] Iowa (Taylor County): commercial flock
Date: Fri 11 Mar 2022

https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/03/11/bird-flu-detected-in-flock-of-918000-iowa-hens/


A large commercial flock of egg-laying chickens in southwest Iowa is the 3rd to be infected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.

The Taylor County flock has 918 873 birds, said Chloe Carson, a spokesperson for the department.

Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation Friday [11 Mar 2022] for the county to ensure enough state resources are available to assist the disinfection of the site. Lab tests identified the virus on Thursday [10 Mar 2022], and state agriculture officials have said they attempt to cull all the birds of infected flocks within 24 hours of the virus' confirmation.

The virus is very contagious and often deadly to domestic birds.

"While this additional case of HPAI is not unexpected, we have prepared for this and are working closely with USDA and livestock producers to control and eradicate this disease from our state," said Mike Naig, the state's secretary of agriculture. "This is a difficult time for poultry producers. We will continue to support them and emphasize the need for strict biosecurity on farms and around poultry to help prevent the spread of this disease."

It was previously found in Iowa in a flock of 50 000 commercial turkeys on 6 Mar [2022] in Buena Vista County and in a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks in Pottawattamie County on 1 Mar [2022].

State Veterinarian Jeff Kaisand has said the likely source of infections of the previous flocks were wild birds carrying the virus without showing signs.

The Taylor County flock is the 2nd-largest to be infected by the virus in the country this year [2022], according to the US Department of Agriculture.

An outbreak in 2015 led to the culling of more than 30 million birds in Iowa.

[5] Illinois (Will and McLean counties) and Kansas (Franklin County): backyard flocks
Date: Sat 12 Mar 2022

https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-ks-il


The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a backyard mixed species poultry flock in Franklin County, Kansas, and a non-commercial backyard flock (non-poultry) in Mclean County, Illinois.

Samples from the Kansas flock were tested at the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and samples from the Illinois flock were tested at the University of Illinois Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Both laboratories are part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The samples were confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.

APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in both states on joint incident responses. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg F] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.

USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. OIE trade guidelines also call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notifications in non-poultry.

APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

Additional background
Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus, which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

The bird flu has been confirmed in a commercial chicken operation in Wisconsin, the US Department of Agriculture announced Monday [14 Mar 2022].

Samples from the flock were tested at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and confirmed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, the agency said in a statement.

State animal health officials have quarantined the property in southern Wisconsin's Jefferson County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Milwaukee. All chickens in the flock will be destroyed and will not enter the food system, the USDA said.

Farms raising turkeys and chickens for consumption have been on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity since avian influenza was recently discovered in a handful of states, including Indiana and Iowa. Producers fear a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.

Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus spreading easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the recent bird flu detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.

[This is a most unfortunate situation. Every person with birds needs to be on high alert. Protect your birds by keeping them inside if you can. Be extra cautious about who comes into contact with our birds; have them change coveralls and boots and blow their noses before entering the bird barn.

The same is true if you are a small or backyard producer: be cautious of who comes near your birds. Keep your birds inside if you can, such as in the house or garage.

If you work in a poultry house and have your own poultry, please shower and change when you come from work before you see your birds. This virus travels easily and has devastating effects. - Mod.TG
