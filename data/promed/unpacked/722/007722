HIV-positive organs used for transplant in Italy due to human error
-----------------------------------------------
In February 2007, 3 patients received human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-positive organs as a result of an error made in the
documentation by an employee at the hospital in northern Italy, where
the organs had been taken for transplant. The person wrote "negative"
instead of "positive" after reading the automatically generated
print-out report of the results of laboratory analyses, including
blood testing for HIV. The organ donor was a woman in her forties who
died at home of a brain hemorrhage but had no clinical history of any
diseases. After her death, the family had assented to organ and
tissue donation not knowing that she had been HIV-positive. Three
organs (2 kidneys and a liver) were transplanted to 3 distinct recipients.
Further blood tests routinely performed in 2 other laboratories that
collect and analyze blood samples for tissue storing in tissue banks
showed that these organs were taken from an HIV-infected donor. One
of the laboratories carried out further analysis of the donor's blood
on the same day the 3 transplants were performed. The tests included
the nucleic acid amplification technique (NAT) to detect hepatitis C
and B virus (HCV and HBV) and HIV. The results obtained 2 days later
were sent on the morning of the following day (a Saturday) by fax
only (and not communicated by phone as they should be) to the
laboratory of the hospital where the organs had been taken for
transplant. As a result, the director of this laboratory only
received the message the following Monday morning, 5 days after the
operations had taken place. He immediately alerted the regional
transplant organization. The delay in communicating this event was
declared by the Italian transplant network to be a violation of the
national and regional guidelines that demand the prompt alert of the
entire system.
The 3 organ recipients were informed of the possibility of being
infected with HIV on the same day that the donor's HIV status was
revealed to the transplant organization network. An international
task force comprised of leading experts in infectious diseases has
since taken responsibility for the treatment of the 3 patients. While
awaiting the results of the genotyping, the patients received HAART
(Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy), taking into account the
existing risk of organ rejection. All 3 have since tested positive
for HIV, but the public health authorities stated that it would take
about one year to be able to make a general commentary on their
health condition.
The accident, unprecedented in Italy's 40-year history of organ
transplantation, was concluded to be entirely due to human error and
negligence of procedures and guidelines [1].
The Italian Ministry of Health, the National Transplant Centre and
the regional authorities appointed a commission of experts to
evaluate the accident, reassess the procedures and propose possible
precautionary measures.
The authorities of the region involved in the event proposed the
introduction of the following precautionary measures when testing
donors' blood for viruses (HIV, HCV, HBV):
(1) Cross-checking the virology analysis reports to ensure that the
transcription of test results is confirmed by double signature;
(2) Using computerized procedures for the transfer of test results
from the laboratory equipment to the laboratory data-processing
management system (for example, medical records), eliminating the
manual transcription of data;
(3) Using clearly visible computerized graphic symbols to underline
the organ donor suitability;
(4) Including the number of antibodies and the related positivity
threshold besides the viral negative/positive result;
(5) Activating dedicated laboratory structures and accreditation or
certification paths in order to improve quality standards.
