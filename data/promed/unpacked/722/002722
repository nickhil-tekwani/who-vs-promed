Iris yellow spot virus on Onion in Colorado
H. F. Schwartz, W. M. Brown, Jr., T. Blunt, and D. H. Gent,
Department of Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management, Colorado
State University, Fort Collins 80523-1177. Plant Dis. 86:560, 2002;
published on-line as D-2002-0309-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication
11 Feb 2002.
A new disease was found in September 2001 on greenhouse-produced
onion transplants of cv. Colorado 6 grown in a field in Larimer
County in northern Colorado. Symptoms included straw-colored, dry,
tan, spindle- or diamond-shaped lesions on the leaves and scapes of
onion plants. Infected plants were scattered (less than 5% incidence)
throughout the outer perimeter of the sprinkler-irrigated field.
Iris yellow spot [tospo]virus (IYSV) [was detected by western blot
assays (James Moyer, North Carolina State University, Raleigh)] in 2
collections ... [of] symptomatic onion plants. ... Western blot[s]
showed a faint band from protein extracts of infected _Nicotiana
[benthamiana_]. ... IYSV can be mechanically transmitted to _N.
[benthamiana_], but it cannot be recovered and transmitted back to
onion, and it is difficult to detect in infected onion plants.
IYSV is ... transmitted by various species of thrips, including onion
thrips and western flower thrips (1). The host range for this disease
includes onion, leek, and iris. IYSV has been reported previously on
onion in Israel, Brazil, and Idaho (2). ... Bulb quality or
marketability [are not affected] ... [but] heavy losses [50-60%] of
onion bulb production are reported (1) [in Israel].

[IYSV is a tentative species in the genus Tospovirus, family
Bunyaviridae. Its natural host range is relatively narrow compared to
that of the type species, Tomato spotted wilt virus. In addition to
its presence in Colorado, IYSV-infected onions have been reported in
Utah. IYSV has been endemic in southwestern Idaho and eastern Oregon
onion, leek, and chive seed production fields for over 10 years. It
has also been detected in onion seed plants from California and
Arizona. During the summer of 2001, symptomatic plants were observed
in commercial bulb production fields in Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and
Washington. According to Moyer, presence of IYSV has been confirmed
by serology in all those states except Washington. - Mod.DH]
