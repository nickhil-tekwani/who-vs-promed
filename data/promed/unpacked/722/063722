[1] Nebraska: bird carcass disposal
Date: 27 May 2015

The Loess Hills Sanitary Landfill near Malvern is to receive its first 10 loads of chicken carcasses Thursday [28 May 2015] from infected farms in northwest Iowa, the landfill operator confirmed Wednesday.

More than 25 million commercial laying hens and pullets in Iowa have been killed by the H5N2 virus or euthanized to prevent the disease from spreading further. 1 million turkeys also have been destroyed since the 1st case was confirmed in early April 2015.

Most of the losses were in the northwest corner of the state, which leads the nation in egg production. In Sioux County alone, nearly 7 million hens died.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is covering disposal and cleanup costs. Some of the dead birds are being composted or buried on site, and others will be put into incinerators in the coming days, but federal and state officials say landfills also are needed to clear the growing backlog of rotting carcasses.

Besides the privately operated landfill in rural Mills County, only the Northwest Iowa Area Solid Waste Agency landfill near Sheldon has agreed to accept the dead birds.

The Iowa Department of Transportation has approved routes to each landfill that use state highways and interstates as much as possible and steer clear of road construction and other poultry farms, spokesman Alex Jansen said. The Mills County landfill is about 25 miles southeast of Omaha/Council Bluffs.

As a test run of sorts, the landfill will receive the initial 10 truckloads, said Bob Glebs, president of Madison, Wisconsin-based Iowa Waste Systems, which operates the landfill. If everything goes well, more trucks will arrive in coming days and weeks.

Each truck will carry 2 boxes with 10 heavy-duty biohazard bags, each holding 10 000 to 15 000 carcasses, as well as compost, sawdust or dried corn stalks. The landfill has agreed to accept as many as 1000 bags, or 10 million birds and 18 000 to 20 000 tons of total waste.
Glebs said the landfill will follow special practices that include segregating the dead birds from municipal waste and immediately covering them.

The landfill has been negotiating with federal officials since April and spent more than $125 000 to prepare the site.

Clean Harbors, a Maryland-based contractor hired by the USDA to oversee the disposal of the dead birds, will monitor the operations and disinfect the trucks after they unload their cargo.

The Northwest Iowa Area Solid Waste Agency is still waiting to receive its 1st loads and has agreed to accept 100 loads, director Larry Oldenkamp said Wednesday.

[2] Minnesota: 4 turkey farms affected

http://www.startribune.com/4-new-cases-push-minnesota-bird-flu-toll-to-over-100-farms/305515391/


The Board of Animal Health on Friday reported presumptive positive tests from flocks in Kandiyohi, Renville and Brown counties, while Blue Earth County recorded its 1st detection since the H5N2 virus was 1st confirmed in Minnesota in early March 2015.

The new cases raise the total of affected Minnesota turkey and chicken farms to 102. The outbreaks have cost producers over 8.3 million birds, not counting some newer cases for which flock sizes are still pending.

All affected commercial farms remain under quarantine. However, officials recently lifted quarantines on 14 backyard flocks in Lac qui Parle (lak-kwih-PARL') County that had been in place since 27 Mar 2015 when the state recorded its 2nd H5N2 outbreak.

1 more Minnesota turkey farm has been struck by bird flu, this time in Renville County. The Board of Animal Health announced the new presumptive case Thu 28 May 2015. The size of the flock is still being determined.

The new case raises the total of Minnesota farms affected to 98 since the state's 1st case of H5N2 avian influenza was confirmed in early March 2015.

The board says the outbreaks have cost Minnesota turkey and chicken producers nearly 8.3 million birds, not counting some farms where flock sizes remain pending.

Minnesota went 10 straight days with no reports of new cases until 6 new cases were reported Tue 26 May 2015. 3 more cases were reported Wednesday.

[4] Iowa, Nebraska: USDA statistics
Date: 28 May 2019

http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/35150/two-more-avian-influenza-outbreaks-confirmed-in-us/


2 more outbreaks of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been confirmed in the US states of Iowa and Nebraska.

The 2 latest outbreaks bring the total number of detections in the epidemic to 181, since December 2014.

Over 40 million birds have now been affected, with the total standing at 41 034 973.

These outbreaks were officially confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), though unconfirmed reports of new cases originating from the state governments have been circulating for several days.

The latest confirmed reports are:

Nebraska, Dixon county - 293 200 commercial chickens; Iowa, Pocahontas county - 20 700 commercial turkeys.

Meanwhile, an official from Purdue University has said that while it is a disappointment to many animal science students to be unable to show their poultry at fairs due to influenza restrictions, this is not their only learning opportunity and there will still be positive outcomes of their
projects.

Aaron Fisher, a Purdue Extension 4-H youth development specialist who works on the animal science projects, said: "The emphasis of the 4-H projects is on young people learning about their animals.

"Showing and selling certainly are valuable experiences, but the greater value of 4-H is the overall learning experience that comes with raising and caring for their animals on a daily basis."

His statement comes on the back of a decision by the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) on 27 May 2015 to prohibit the commingling of birds from different locations, including at shows, exhibitions and public sales. The restriction applies to all county fairs and the Indiana State Fair.

Indiana joined at least 10 other states from Maryland to South Dakota that have taken similar action because of the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza. BOAH said 16 states, primarily in the upper Midwest, have had diagnosed cases resulting in the deaths of more than 40 million birds.
