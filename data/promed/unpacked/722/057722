Concerns about the real significance of _Neospora caninum_
----------------------------------------------------
While _Neospora caninum_ is a universally distributed protozoon able to
infect several species, and produces the interesting lesions in dogs and
cattle, I suspect its real economical significance and impact still need to
be properly evaluated.
It seems there are no proven control methods for the prevention or
treatment of neosporosis. Suggested control measures focus on programs to
reduce the number of congenitally infected animals in the herd and to
minimize the opportunity for postnatal transmission from the environment.
Several types of serologic tests based on the use of culture-derived
organisms or recombinant _N. caninum_ antigens are available; they may be
used to identify infected animals and to study the prevalence of _N.
caninum_ in herds. However, we still have much to learn about the reasons
protozoal organisms are generally not present in large numbers in aborted
fetuses and stillborn calves; and the complete pathogenesis of _N. caninum_
abortion and natimortality in cattle is not understood.
Surprisingly, several studies regarding the abortigenic potential of _N.
caninum_ in cattle lack histopathological and immunohistochemical
evaluation of fetal organs and fail to examine the placenta. This deprives
these investigations of large parts of their scientific significance and
applicability, and leaves the question open about the true economic impact
of this protozoan on the cattle industry.
Positive serological titers in adults, fetuses and calves indicate exposure
to _N. caninum_ only. Cultures are only occasionally useful, and the most
sensitive PCR indicates only the presence of _N. caninum_.
Histopathology and peroxidase immunohistochemistry analysis of all organs,
and utilization of all ancillary procedures available to the pathologist
will lead to the most detailed diagnosis.
