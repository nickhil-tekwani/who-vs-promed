As of Thu 15 May 2008, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Central
African Republic has reported 2 laboratory confirmed cases of yellow
fever from the Bozoum sub-prefecture, Ouham-Pende Prefecture. The MoH
has conducted an epidemiological investigation.

In response to the outbreak, the MoH has made a request for 64 391
doses of yellow fever vaccine from the GAVI-funded Global Emergency
Stockpile for Yellow Fever Vaccine, managed by the International
Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control
(YF-ICG). The target population was estimated to be 55 035 people.
The MoH plans to vaccinate the sub-prefecture of Bozoum starting on
Tue 26 May 2008 for 3 days.
