Health officials have labeled an outbreak of paralytic shellfish poisoning as the worst seen in the Bay of Plenty. Since Wed 12 Dec 2012, 20 people have been poisoned by eating shellfish collected from the Bay of Plenty shoreline. 10 were admitted for hospital care after suffering symptoms ranging from tingling around the mouth to difficulty walking. 4 people remain in hospital.

The levels of toxins being reported from routine shellfish sampling, and the number and severity of cases underline that collecting shellfish from the affected area is a significant health risk. The health warning that was issued in August 2012 remains in place. Medical officer of health Dr Neil de Wet said people needed to heed the warning and ensure friends and visitors to the area were made aware of the risk. "Tell your family, friends and tourists that collecting shellfish is not safe at present. If you see someone collecting shellfish remind them -- we don't want anyone else in hospital this holiday."

Dr de Wet strongly advised against the collection of shellfish from Tairua on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, south to Waihi Beach and along the Bay of Plenty coast to Whakatane Heads in the Eastern Bay of Plenty. The warning includes Tairua Harbour as well as Tauranga Harbour, Maketu and Waihi estuaries, Matakana and Motiti Islands, and all other inshore islands along this coastline.

The health warning applies to all bivalve shellfish including mussels, pipi, tuatua, cockles, oysters, scallops as well as cat's eyes and kina (sea urchin). Shellfish in the affected area should not be taken or consumed. Paua, crayfish, and crabs can still be taken but, as always, the gut should be removed before cooking.

Consumption of shellfish affected by the paralytic shellfish toxin can cause numbness and tingling around the mouth, face or extremities; difficulty swallowing or breathing; dizziness; double vision; and in severe cases, paralysis and respiratory failure. These symptoms usually occur within 12 hours of a person consuming affected shellfish. Anyone suffering illness after eating shellfish should seek urgent medical attention.

[Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) (http://aquaticpath.umd.edu/toxalg/psp.html) is a significant problem in many areas throughout the world. Caused by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild, and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases death may occur in 2 to 25 hours. - Mod.LL
