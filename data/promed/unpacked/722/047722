Cox-Singh et al. have presented intriguing and important findings as
follow-up to an earlier published article on this phenomenon [Singh
et al. 2004. Lancet 363: 1017-1024]. Commentary provided by ProMED
and by NJ White [CID 2008:46: 172-3] following the recent subject
paper [CID 2008: 46: 165-71] aptly proposed that _P. knowlesi_ be
considered the 5th human malaria parasite.
Given this parasite's impressive frequency and contribution to the
overall percentage of slide-confirmed malaria cases in the focus of
study [Sarawak and Sabah (Borneo), and Pahang State, Malaysia] and
the fact that gametocytes develop in human infection, this proposal
will likely prove correct; however, definitive evidence awaits
confirmation that human-vector-human transmission (i.e., exclusive
of monkey-derived infections) occurs naturally.
Further investigation on the true extent of the distribution of _P.
knowlesi_ will surely be forthcoming.
In Southeast Asia, the reach of this parasite will likely broaden to
areas where the respective natural mammalian hosts reside. This is
especially true in Indonesia where _P. knowlesi_ is a common
parasite in a number of nonhuman primates (both cercopithecine and
colobine monkeys), most notably _Macaca fascicularis_ (Long-tailed
macaque). This primate species is common on the islands of Sumatra,
Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and not
infrequently becomes a commensal pest of humans.
Given this species' relatively close association with humans and the
availability of monkey and human-feeding anopheline vectors, these
areas would likely be conducive for established _P. knowlesi_ transmission.
The true geographical distribution of _P. malariae_ has justifiably
been called into question, and future genetic studies should help
clarify its true global presence.
This clarification is important both epidemiologically and
clinically, as _P. knowlesi_ infection is associated with greater
frequency of severe disease compared to _P. malariae_ malaria.
Interestingly, there are areas in the eastern reaches of Southeast
Asia and western Oceania that have significant foci of _P. malariae_
infection yet which have no indigenous or introduced nonhuman
primates present there. This is particularly true on the large
island of New Guinea, where isolated foci of _P. malariae_ have been
reported at a relatively high prevalence (Anthony et al. 1992 Am. J.
Trop. Med. Hyg. 47: 346-356).
