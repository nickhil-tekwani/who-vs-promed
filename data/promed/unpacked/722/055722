The country is undergoing its 4th epidemic outbreak of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF), caused by an endemic virus that was identified in 1989, so called because it is exclusive to Venezuela, specifically in the llanos [western savanna] states.

"This is the 3rd most important epidemic outbreak, after those that occurred in 2002-2003 and in 1997-1998," explained Ana Carvajal, member of the Epidemiological Commission of the Scientific Medical Societies Network of Venezuela (RSCMV by its initials in Spanish). According to the epidemiological bulletin of the Ministry of Health, in the period 2011-2012, 86 cases have been reported, 76 in 2011, and 10 in 2012."

Most of the cases have occurred in recent months and the RSCMV warns that "if this epidemiological pattern is maintained, it can be expected that in coming years [there will be] reports [of cases] in inter-epidemic periods and an increase in the number of probable cases and deaths with the appearance of each new epidemic."

Although the Ministry of Health has not published complete data of this last outbreak, it is known that cases are reported from the rural municipalities of Guanarito, San Nicolas, San Genaro de Boconoito, and Papelon, in Portuguesa state. Data about the number of people who died or were hospitalized have not been published. Antonio Brito, director of Portuguesa state health, explained that the Ministry of Health currently carries out a plan to strengthen prevention and control of this fever [disease]. "The intention is to reinforce community efforts, focusing mainly on prevention and control of VHF, given its high impact on morbidity and mortality in the savanna region," he stated.

The causal agent of VHF is the arenavirus Guanarito, which is maintained in nature in the rodent species _Zygodontomys brevicauda_, a mouse of sugar cane [habitat].

The work will be carried out along the course of the Guanare River course in the municipalities of Guanarito and Papelo and partially in the municipality of Sosa in Barinas state. "This area is of great epidemiological interest because most of the cases positive for the pathology caused by Guanarito virus are concentrated here," stated Brito.

According to the registry of Portuguesa Health, to date 800 families have been visited in this area of scattered rural settlements and communities. The historical fatality rate from this disease is 23 percent.

The Ministry stated in a report to the press that Portuguesa is the only state in the country that has the treatment required to minimize the mortality from VHF, a disease characterized by the appearance of very high fever and general malaise, advancing to a state of external hemorrhages and severe neurological damage.

[The report above indicates that there is a continuation of the outbreak first reported in August 2011. As noted in the moderator comments in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110821.2548, in 1989, there was an outbreak of a severe febrile illness in Portuguesa state, mainly among male and female rural inhabitants of all ages in the southern part of the state, characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, sore throat, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally convulsions. Since then, there have been sporadic cases, with a 40 percent case fatality rate.

The rodent reservoirs are the cotton rat _Sigmodon alstoni_ and the cane mouse _Zygodontomys brevicauda_. Guanarito virus is an arenavirus related to 2 other South American arenaviruses: Machupo virus (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever) and Junin virus (Argentinean hemorrhagic fever).
