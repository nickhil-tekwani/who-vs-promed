Re: ProMED-mail Avian influenza (64): Spain (CT) poultry, H7N1, LPAI, OIE, RFI 20130521.1729499
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Concerning the reference made to the lack of information in the ProMED-mail post for the above mentioned event, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that there are more details about the affected population than only the mention of "birds". If you read the report in the following link you will see that the affected population is described as "breeding hens".

http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13472

It is important to make more attention in the future while looking at OIE reports before releasing information in ProMED-mail post.

[We are grateful to Dr Ben Jebara for contributing his highly valued corrective observations.

The text of Spain's 'immediate notification' on LPAI H7N1 in Catalonia, as published in posting 20130520.1726182, was copied from OIE's circulated report (listserv <oie-info-web@oie.int>). That report did not include the line about "affected population". We are glad to note that the web version of the said report did include the said passage, indicating that the "birds" were, in fact, laying hens, namely _Gallus gallus domesticus_. In future, OIE's web-based information will be regarded as preferential.

The information in OIE's reports has much improved during recent years, mainly thanks to the pro-active approach of OIE's Animal Health information department which has taken the initiative to contact reporting countries whenever necessary and acquire complementary information. Most reports on avian diseases currently specify the affected poultry branch/species. However, there are still exceptions. ProMED-mail published several previous requests to remedy this deficiency in reports on avian diseases. The most recent relevant RFI's were included in posting 20130311.1581271 (referring to an OIE report from India, at http://tinyurl.com/pyunzgf) and in posting 20130516.1717982 (referring to an OIE report from Germany, at http://tinyurl.com/oon5q5l). Responses are awaited.

The requested information on the husbandry/maintenance system of the LPAI-affected poultry (laying hens) in Catalonia will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]

[The OIE report from India in ProMED archive 20130311.1581271 refers to "Birds" at a poultry farm, without specifying hens, ducks, quail or other species such as pigeons, which we have recently learned are considered poultry in China. - Mod.JW]
