Dozens of people died recently, owing to the spread of various diseases in the gold mining area of Jebel 'Amer, El Sareif Beni Hussein locality in North Darfur.

"Smallpox and measles caused the deaths of a number of gold miners lately; 3 others died of hemorrhagic fever," an activist reported to Radio Dabanga from El Sareif town.

He said that members of the El Sareif Youth Group, accompanied by a number of health workers, had visited Jebel 'Amer last week, after 17 prospectors had died on one day.

"People there told us that 5 gold miners were taken to Kabkabiya hospital, 3 to a hospital in Saraf Umra, and one is currently being treated in El Sareif."

According to the source, the deteriorating health environment resulting from the overcrowding of workers in the mines has caused the rapid spread of the disease.

[With the limited information provided, it is difficult to speculate which of the "various diseases" are circulating in the mining camp. Although smallpox is indicated, that is not possible, since it was eradicated from the planet many years ago. Monkeypox or chickenpox are among the possibilities, however. There were several cases of monkeypox disease in the Sudan in 2006.

Hemorrhagic disease may be due to several pathogens such as yellow fever (YF) or dengue viruses. Yellow fever is of particular concern, since there was a significant outbreak in the Darfur states in 2012-2013. Crowded conditions in the camp could facilitate transmission of YF virus as well as several pathogens that could be responsible for this outbreak. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information about this outbreak, especially more details about the clinical presentations, diagnoses and results of any laboratory tests that have been done.
