[Now that regular weekly reports (see below) are available for inclusion in
this update from the Environmental Risk Analysis Program (ERAP) at Cornell
University (ERAP) and from ArboNET as published in MMWR, the routine logging
of West Nile virus reports from individual states and from news media will
be scaled down. As previously, however, reports of human infection,
infection of new hosts, extension of geographical range and events of
special significance will be posted separately immediately on receipt. -

Iowa; West Nile Virus-positive Birds Confirmed in Two Counties
--------------------------------------------------------------
DAVENPORT: West Nile virus probably has traveled across Iowa, even though it
has been confirmed in only 2 counties, several experts said on Fri 19 Jul
2002. The mosquito-carried virus was first confirmed in Iowa in Sep 2001 in
a dead crow near Walcott.
The Iowa Department of Public Health reported on Thu 18 Jul 2002 that 2 more
dead birds in Scott County - a crow and blue jay - had tested positive. On
Friday, Gilchrist said a dead bird from Johnson County had been found to
have the virus. The crow was discovered in Iowa City.
