First evidence of whirling disease parasite in Alaska
-----------------------------------------------------
The first evidence of the whirling disease parasite's presence in the state
of Alaska was recently discovered. Using a very sensitive molecular test,
DNA of the parasite _Myxobolus cerebralis_ was detected in rainbow trout
from Elmendorf State Fish Hatchery in Anchorage. The discovery occurred
during a risk assessment, designed by researchers at Oregon State
University, to determine the risk of the parasite's introduction into the
state. There are no previous reports of _M. cerebralis_ in Alaska.
During 2005 and 2006, the risk assessment research team from Oregon State
University collected 180 rainbow trout from Elmendorf and Fort Richardson
state fish hatcheries. These were tested using quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR), a very sensitive test, to detect DNA of the whirling
disease parasite. A total of 14 fish from Elmendorf tested positive for the
parasite's DNA. A nested PCR assay was used to confirm the detection. To
rule out false positive results, the 18S rRNA gene was sequenced and
compared with laboratory isolates from other locations. The qPCR test
estimates the amount of DNA present in a sample and suggests that the
parasitic infection among Elmendorf State Fish Hatchery rainbow trout is
very slight.
These samples contained an estimated 10 to 1000 parasites per fish. No
external signs of whirling disease have been observed and no stages of the
parasite have been detected during microscopic examination.
This is the 1st evidence of the whirling disease parasite in the state of
Alaska. It is unknown how and when the parasite may have been introduced or
how widespread its distribution may be within the state. The closest
location to Alaska where the parasite is known to occur is the Snake River
basin in north east Oregon, south east Washington, and Idaho. The parasite
has also been found in fish from the Sakhalin Islands of Russia, across the
Bering Sea. The introduction could have occurred with the transfer of
infected fish or fish parts, movement of infected water or sediment,
movement of the parasite by wildlife, or other pathways.
The American Fisheries Society describes procedures to detect _M.
cerebralis_ during fish health inspections. These procedures are to conduct
pepsin-trypsin digest (PTD) for initial detection of the parasite. This is
then followed by confirmation using PCR or histology, microscopic
observation of fish tissues by a pathologist. The US Fish and Wildlife
Service National Wild Fish Health Survey has tested more than 2000 fish
from 26 locations in Alaska using PTD, and have not detected _M.
cerebralis_. In addition, public and private hatchery fish in Alaska are
not routinely monitored for the parasite; however, trout culture occurs at
only 3 state hatcheries (Elmendorf, Fort Richardson, and Fairbanks) while
all other facilities rear various Pacific salmon species.
Elmendorf State Fish Hatchery is located on Ship Creek in Anchorage, AK, in
the Cook Inlet basin. The hatchery relied on surface water from Ship Creek
for its water supply, the most likely source of the parasite. Alaska
Department of Fish and Game personnel will be conducting further tests to
determine whether the parasite has become established in Ship Creek. The
Department is also planning to investigate rainbow trout populations in
watersheds considered high risk for the whirling disease parasite.
There are 3 state-owned fish hatcheries in Alaska: Elmendorf State Fish
Hatchery, Fort Richardson State Fish Hatchery, and an experimental hatchery
in Fairbanks. The Oregon State University research team sampled rainbow
trout from Fort Richardson State Fish Hatchery and did not detect _M.
cerebralis_ using qPCR from any of those fish. Fort Richardson is also
located on Ship Creek and is the original source of the trout that later
tested positive at Elmendorf Hatchery.
Alaska Department of Fish and Game policy would require that all fish at
Elmendorf State Fish Hatchery be destroyed and disposed of if there had
been evidence of clinical whirling disease or if the parasite was visually
observed. The parasite's presence was only confirmed genetically, so the
fish will not be destroyed; however, the Department will take precautionary
measures to reduce the risk of spreading the parasite. No fish from
Elmendorf will be transferred to other facilities and, besides one
exception, fish will only be stocked into lakes with no inlet or outlet and
have no reproducing salmonid populations. The only exception is that
Chinook salmon from Elmendorf which will be released into Ship Creek to
maintain broodstock. More than 94 000 hatchery fish that would have
otherwise been destined for open watersheds will be transplanted into
closed systems in 2007.

[I find this article a little confusing. The risk assessment was performed
in 2005 and 2006, which is when it appears the samples were collected. It
is unclear, however, whether the analysis has just been completed, making
the actual appearance of the disease in 2005 or 2006, or if further samples
were collected in 2007. - Mod.TG
I suspect the former. Analysis and journal process takes time. Mod.SH]
