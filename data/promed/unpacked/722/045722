Measles resurgence in Spain (Barcelona)
-----------------------------------------------
33 additional cases were added to the number of people infected with
measles, bringing the total to 122 in Barcelona, a number confirmed
today [16 Jan 2007] by the Conselleria de Salud of the Generalitat
(local Health Authority).
Up to now, health care workers have immunized more than 6000
9-to-15-month-old children as an exceptional measure to stop the outbreak.
The Local Health Authority does not rule out the occurrence of new
cases in the coming weeks. In fact, 3 patients had to be admitted to
hospitals, but they have already been discharged. The outbreak was
apparently caused by a single individual.
Most persons affected by the measles virus are 9-to-15-month-old
children that are related by family, neighborhood, daycare or
pediatric consultation ties. Therefore, the Local Health Authority
decided to advance the vaccination date to 9 months, which was
usually carried out at 9 months and 4 years of age.
During the 1st 3 days of this current campaign, more than 6000
less-than-15-month-old Barcelona children were immunized with the
triple viral vaccine, which protects against measles, rubella, and
mumps. 3578 children between 9 and 15 months old are expected to be
vaccinated in the Barcelona region. There are 13 473 children between
9 and 11 months old.
Children targeted by the vaccination program should receive another
dose of the vaccine when they are 15 months old, and this will be
considered the 1st dose of the triple viral vaccine, since the
vaccine administered before age one year will not be considered
medically valid for the purposes of complying with the vaccination schedule.
The campaign is being carried out "with no problems" in the 228
Primary Care Centers of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region. On the
other hand, the "Sanitat Respon" (Health Answers) telephone line had
185 calls from 8 to 15 Jan 2007.
There have been measles outbreaks also in La Rioja, Madrid, and
Andalucia in the past few years.
