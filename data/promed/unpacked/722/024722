6 million doses of vaccine shipped to Yemen for emergency polio outbreak
response: cases rise as expected, in advance of intensified response to
outbreak
--------------------------------
6 million doses of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1) have been
shipped to Yemen, as part of emergency measures to stop the ongoing polio
outbreak in the country. UNICEF today confirmed that the vaccine will
arrive in Yemen early next week, for use in the nationwide immunization
campaign to be conducted at the end of May 2005 to immunize all of the
country's children under the age of 5 years. 10 WHO experts are presently
working with national authorities to finalize the plans for the campaign,
and train vaccinators and supervisors.
mOPV1 works faster than the trivalent oral polio vaccine to create immunity
against type 1 poliovirus, the strain causing Yemen's outbreak. Health
officials expect this vaccine to more rapidly stop the outbreak.
Confirmation of the mOPV1 availability came as Yemen reported a further 41
cases today, up from 22 in late April 2005. Epidemiologists expect that the
total number of cases will exceed 100, before the outbreak is stopped.
Yemen had been polio-free since disease surveillance began in 1996.
Experience shows that sporadic polio outbreaks in previously polio-free
countries, such as Yemen and Indonesia, can be stopped quickly, provided
high-quality immunization campaigns are implemented rapidly. While these
events strain the financial resources of the global eradication effort,
they do not threaten its ultimate success.
The real challenge to global eradication remains stopping polio
transmission in the last remaining reservoirs of transmission, from where
poliovirus has been exported, such as northern Nigeria, northern India, and
Pakistan. Epidemiological evidence shows that polio's grip is rapidly
slipping in all 3 of those key endemic countries. India has reported only
14 cases to date this year, all of them polio type 1. mOPV1 is now in use
in parts of India to wipe out the last pockets of type 1 transmission.
Pakistan has recorded only 6 cases to date in 2005, while Nigeria has
largely driven polio out of its southern states, immunizing a record number
of children in the past round.
Despite this progress, as long as the epidemic in Africa is ongoing,
polio-free countries will continue to be at risk of importations. Concern
is particularly high to protect the Horn of Africa, where weak health
systems, low levels of routine immunization and hampered access to all
populations due to civil conflict means children in this area are at
particular risk of potential spread of polio. While Somalia has not
reported a case since October 2002, preventive immunization campaigns were
conducted in February and March [2005], and are being evaluated for any
potential areas of low coverage.
To ensure the necessary polio campaigns are implemented in endemic and
high-risk countries, a global funding gap of USD 50 million must urgently
be filled by July [2005]. An additional USD 200 million is needed for 2006
activities.
Global eradication efforts have reduced the number of polio cases from 350
000 annually in 1988 to 1267 cases in 2004. 6 countries remain
polio-endemic (Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Niger, Afghanistan and Egypt),
with a further 6 where polio transmission has been re-established (Burkina
Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Sudan).
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is spearheaded by the World Health
Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF.

Yemen polio outbreak may cripple 100 children
---------------------------------------------
A polio outbreak in Yemen could cripple more than 100 children before it is
brought under control, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday.
A Yemeni Health Ministry official said in the capital Sanaa on Monday the
number of children diagnosed with the paralysing disease had risen to 40,
nearly double the initial 22 cases that WHO confirmed in late April 2005.
But WHO said more suspected cases were under investigation. "We expect that
the total number associated with this outbreak will rise to more than 100
before the outbreak is controlled," WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer told
Reuters.
The disease, which mainly affects children under the age of 5 years, causes
irreversible paralysis. Low immunisation rates among children in Yemen,
which last reported polio in 1996, have helped the virus spread, according
to the WHO.
A nationwide immunisation campaign is planned in the 2nd half of May 2005.
The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) is sending 6 million doses of oral polio
vaccine, due to arrive in the poor Arab country next week, according to the
WHO spokesman. "Past experience has shown that with rapid, high-quality
immunisation, such sporadic outbreaks can be controlled," Rosenbauer said.
Yemen was the 15th polio-free country in which the disease has reappeared
in the last 2 years, including 13 African countries and Saudi Arabia.
Last week 4 cases were confirmed in Indonesia, which last had polio a
decade ago.
The twin outbreaks are fresh setbacks to the WHO's campaign to stop
transmission of polio worldwide by year-end 2005. The source of the
resurgence of the disease in Africa is believed to be Nigeria. The
country's Kano state banned vaccines in mid-2003 because Muslim elders said
they were part of a Western plot to spread HIV and infertility.
Immunisations resumed after 10 months.

[Unfortunately the saga which began last year with the cessation of polio
vaccination in Northern Nigeria continues with the doubling of the reported
cases of polio in Yemen. The latest official count of polio cases reported
to WHO as of 5 May 2005 is as follows:
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>
Nigeria (endemic) 54
Sudan (re-established transmission): 24
Yemen (importation): 22
India (endemic): 14
Pakistan (endemic): 6
Indonesia (importation): 1
Ethiopia (importation): 1
Cameroon (importation): 1
Niger (endemic): 1
----
Total global cases of poliovirus: 124
Since 5 May 2005, there have been an additional 3 confirmed cases in
Indonesia, and now 41 cases in Yemen (it is not clear if the total number
of cases is 41 or if there were 41 new cases confirmed in Yemen -- the
polio eradication website statement suggests an additional 41 cases,
whereas the Reuter's AlertNet report suggests the total number of cases is
now 40). One worries about other at-risk countries where (1) acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) surveillance may be weak and (2) pockets of susceptible
populations have increased; as many countries stopped conducting national
immunization days after they had interrupted transmission of wild
poliovirus. - Mod.MPP]
