A statement from the [Basrah] governorate's office, a copy of which was obtained by Al-Mirbad, says that since information about the death of poultry in the Safwan areas, west of Basrah, was received and samples analyzed by the competent authorities, suspecting the emergence of bird flu disease, the governor, Asaad Al-Eidani, directed the formation of a crisis unit to follow up on the matter and investigate the facts about infection with the disease, especially confirming the recent analyses and results.

The statement added that the unit began holding its 1st meetings in the presence of officials from Basrah health, the relevant hospital, national security, operations command and some concerned parties, while urgent and strict measures will be taken to control the situation and limit its spread as quickly as possible.

A security source told Al-Mirbad earlier today, Friday [4 Jun 2021], that samples taken from a poultry farm in the Khor Al-Zubair area in Basrah governorate to Baghdad laboratories were confirmed to be infected with bird flu, while a security force went to quarantine the premises and workers, and the Zubair Agriculture Directorate confirmed the death of thousands of chickens in poultry farms due to bird flu.
