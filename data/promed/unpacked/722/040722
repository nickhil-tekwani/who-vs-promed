A salmonella outbreak potentially linked to produce has sickened at
least 172 people in 18 states, health officials said Mon, 30 Oct 2006.
Health officials think the bacteria may have spread through some form
of produce -- the list of suspects includes tomatoes. But the
illnesses have not been tied to any specific product, chain,
restaurants or supermarkets.
No one has died in the outbreak, which stems from a common form of
salmonella bacteria. 11 people have been hospitalized, health
officials said. "We're very early in the investigation," said Dave
Daigle, a spokesman for the CDC.
The CDC 1st detected the outbreak 2 weeks ago through a national
computer lab system that looks for patterns and matches in reports of
foodborne illness. The American FDA has joined the investigation and
will try to help trace the outbreak to its origin.
Most of the cases are in adults, and more than 60 percent are women,
said Dr. Chris Braden, a CDC epidemiologist investigating the outbreak.
The states involved are Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana,
Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina,
New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia,
Vermont and Wisconsin.
There are about 2500 types of salmonella. The type in this outbreak -
serotype Typhimurium - is one of the most common, Braden said.

[_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium is one of the most common
serotypes of salmonellae found in the USA representing as many of 30
percent of isolates reported to CDC. In addition to being quite
common, serotype Typhimurium is also one that may be multi-drug
resistant especially the DT (definitive type) 104 which has been
found in the USA and especially in Europe.
ProMED awaits more information regarding the investigation of the
outbreak and a further delineation of the strain involved. -Mod. LL]
