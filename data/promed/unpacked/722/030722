Indonesia alert over bird flu
-----------------------------
After the latest bird flu outbreak in South Sulawesi province, the
Indonesian Ministry of Health is intensifying surveillance in case of human
infection by the pathogenic virus, officials said.

Last week [2nd week May 2005], the ministry sent 6 specimens from poultry
workers in the province with suspected bird flu infection to Hong Kong for
laboratory tests. Earlier, at least 77 more samples were sent to Hong Kong
for the same purpose, in March and April 2005. "We sent some blood samples
of farm workers from the regencies of Sidenreng Rappang, Pinrang, Wajo,
Maros, and Soppeng," South Sulawesi Health Office Head Muhadir was quoted
as saying by the Jakarta Post on Friday [13 May 2005].

The province was hit by avian flu in March 2005. Tests on dead chickens in
the 5 regencies showed that the poultry was infected with the H5N1 strain
of bird flu, which allegedly spread from West Java Province, where the 1st
case was discovered last year [2005]. Despite the bird flu outbreak, there
was no confirmed case of human infection in Indonesia.

According to WHO representative Georg Petersen, the H5N1 virus can infect
human beings. Ministry of Health Director for Eradication of Diseases
Transmitted by Animals Hariadi Wibisono said that his office had been
intensifying bird flu monitoring in South Sulawesi Province, after the
outbreak in March 2005, by monitoring clinical symptoms in local hospitals
and health centers as well as conducting campaigns on safety procedures for
poultry workers, such as the use of masks and disinfectant sprays after
entering livestock areas.

The World Health Organization said in its website that people who ate
chicken should not worry about getting infected. If the meat is cooked
properly, the avian flu virus will be killed, as it cannot survive at high
temperatures.
