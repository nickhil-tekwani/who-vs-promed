State of play of the global animal health situation
---------------------------------------------------
OIE's official disease status can be issued for 6 priority diseases and are of major importance to OIE Members. Recognised by the World Trade Organization (WTO), as reference standards in the field of animal health, these official status reflect the level of transparency and quality of the Veterinary Services of the country, increase the value of its livestock sector and facilitate access to regional and international markets.

At this year's [2018] General Session, the World Assembly of OIE Delegates distributed 11 certificates to 10 countries for official disease status recognition:
- Argentina, Bulgaria and Costa Rica were recognised as being "free from Classical Swine Fever";
- Madagascar, Peru and Uruguay were recognised as being "free from Peste des petits rumninants";
- Nicaragua was recognised as having a "negligible Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy risk";
- Peru and Surinam, were officially recognised as "free from foot-and-mouth disease without vaccination" and a zone in Brazil and one in Chinese Taipei were officially recognised as "foot-and-mouth disease free with vaccination".

All recognized disease status is available at http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/

In addition to official status recognition, new "procedures for self-declarations" (see http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/self-declared-disease-status/ of disease freedom by countries were recently made available. Under the responsibility of OIE Members, self-declarations provide a way to enhance transparency and to give visibility, in a timely manner, to the absence of diseases in countries.
