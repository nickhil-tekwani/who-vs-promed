The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada to investigate locally acquired __Cyclospora_ _ infections in two provinces. The source of the outbreak has not been identified. Previous outbreaks in Canada and the United States (US) have been linked to imported fresh produce. The investigation is ongoing.

The risk to Canadians is low. _Cyclospora_ is not found in water or food grown in Canada. The parasite is most common in some tropical and subtropical regions such as the Caribbean, South and Central America, South and South East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In Canada, non-travel-related illnesses due to _Cyclospora_ occur more frequently in the spring and summer months. Illnesses among travelers can happen at any time of year. _Cyclospora_ infections can be prevented by ensuring you are consuming fresh produce grown in countries where the parasite is not common, such as Canada, the US and European countries.

What is _Cyclospora_?
----------------------
_Cyclospora_ is a microscopic single-celled parasite [protozoan] that is passed in people's feces. If it comes in contact with food or water, it can contaminate food and cause infection in the people who consume it. This causes an intestinal illness called cyclosporiasis. It is unlikely for _Cyclospora_ to be passed from one person to another.

Investigation Summary
---------------------
In Canada, a total of 20 cases have been reported in 2 provinces: British Columbia (5) and Ontario (15). Individuals became sick between May and early June of this year [2017]. The majority of cases (60 percent) are male, with an average age of 53 years. The investigation into the source of the outbreak is ongoing. To date, no multi-jurisdictional outbreaks of _Cyclospora_ have been linked to produce grown in Canada.

The outbreak investigation is active and the public health notice will be updated on a regular basis as the investigation evolves.

[Previous outbreaks of __Cyclospora cayetanensis_ in the US and Canada have been attributed to contaminated lettuces and greens imported from Mexico. The information that the cases in this outbreak have been found in two provinces indicates that the outbreak is again linked to food distributed to multiple retailers. - Mod.EP
