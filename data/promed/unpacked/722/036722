Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (2014/3): Hjellberget 10808, Nord Troms, Kvaenangen, Troms

Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Total animals affected:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / 714 585 / 2000 / 1500 / 500 / 107 500
Outbreak statistics:

Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 0.28 percent/ 0.21 percent / 75 percent/ 15.32 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: from an epidemiological point of view, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority considers this infectious salmon anemia (ISA) outbreak at Hjellberget to be a 1st occurrence. The Norwegian Veterinary Institute use genotyping to determine whether ISA outbreaks are an occurrence or a reoccurrence. Infectious salmon anemia was present at another location about 30 km [18.6 mi] away in May 2013 as well. The ISA cases seem to be 2 separate outbreaks without any epidemiological correlation, although both of them belong to the same administrative region, Troms. The virus relating to the outbreak will be further characterized associated with the epidemiological studies.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; official destruction of clinically diseased aquatic animals; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); emergency harvest; tracing forward; tracing back; surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone; official destruction of aquatic animal products; surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory)/ Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / histopathological examination / 7 Mar 2014 / positive
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory) / Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / immunohistochemical test / 7 Mar 2014 / positive
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory) / Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / real-time PCR / 7 Mar 2014 / positive
