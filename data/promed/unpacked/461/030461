An epidemic of typhoid fever has been confirmed in the health zone of Popokabaka by the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB). Since the beginning of this year [2021], the epidemic has caused more than 360 cases, including 17 deaths, said Dr Aimé Kayolo, head of the provincial health division of Kwilu province, on Friday [4 Jun 2021].

Among these cases, Dr Aimé Kayolo said that there were 45 cases complicated by intestinal perforations and 17 deaths, 10 of which were post-operative. Abdominal pain, fever, constipation, sometimes abdominal bloating and others are among the signs that patients suffering from this disease present, he continued.

For Dr Aime Kayolo, typhoid fever is a disease of dirty hands.

While calling on the population of Popokabaka to apply food hygiene measures, he announced an awareness campaign against this pathology for next week.

After a team from INRB took samples in Popokabaka, this institution confirmed the epidemic of typhoid fever in this territory of Kwango.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

The classic food-related cluster of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City of Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary," an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to See Also section below). - Mod.LL
