The mysterious disease of Murshidabad, India
-----------------
The aetiology of this mysterious disease is still unknown, although several
speculations like bronchopneumonia, meningitis, encephalitis, and heat
stroke are being ventured. More than 300 have been attacked by the disease,
which killed more than 56 persons. All of them are children except a few
elderly.
State officials comprised of Director of Health Services, teams from School
of Tropical Medicine, and National Institute of Cholera and Enteric
Diseases checked more than 3000 children. So far tests regarding malaria,
encephalitis, meningitis, septicaemia, and dengue fever all show negative
results.
A team of National Institute of Virology, Pune are also working on this
problem, but as of today no light has been shed on the exact aetiology of
the disease. However, the state health authorities are still not looking
into a chemical aetiological agent.

[There have been approximately 50 more cases and 20 additional deaths since
our last report from Dr. Das 5 days ago and still no etiology, infectious or
toxic, has been established for these illnesses or deaths. One of our
previous reports mentioned the possibility of strychnine toxicity. We would
welcome more details from Dr. Das or other sources, including the results of
any postmortem examinations. - Mod.LM]
[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Das for this update on the investigation
of this outbreak. It appears as though extensive infectious disease workups
have been conducted, with no identification of an etiologic agent thus far.
We await further information as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
