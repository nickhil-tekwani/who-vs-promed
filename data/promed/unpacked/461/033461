Two viruses that have never been seen in New Hampshire before have shown up in the same person.

The state public health department says a man from Hillsborough County has tested positive for both the Jamestown Canyon virus, which is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, and the Powassan virus, which is carried by ticks.

Public health director Dr. Jose Montero says both viruses have been around the United States for a while, and the Powassan virus has been found in Maine and Vermont, so the New Hampshire case is not a surprise.

He says residents should take the same precautions they use to prevent other mosquito and tick viruses, including wearing effective insect repellent and doing regular tick checks.

As further evidence that people should protect themselves from biting insects, a Hillsborough County man has become infected with 2 viruses never reported in the state before, one of them carried by mosquitoes, the other by ticks. It wasn't clear on Thursday [1 Aug 2013] where or when the patient, identified only as an adult male, became infected with the Jamestown Canyon virus and the Powassan virus, or what his condition is.

Like West Nile virus, both of these viruses can present a range of symptoms in people: sometimes none, sometimes the symptoms of a mild cold, and sometimes serious meningitis-like symptoms, including fever and changes in mental status because of the inflammation of the brain.

Chris Adamski, director of the state's Bureau of Infectious Disease, said the announcement was made partly to alert public-health officials to consider these 2 viruses -- part of a group known as arbovirus because they are transmitted by the bite of arthropods such as insects and ticks -- when diagnosing a patient. "There are a lot of arboviral infections out there, some we may not know yet or that are rare," she said. "It's important that we get a better understanding of them. If people are presenting with symptoms like this; we want to advise clinicians to consider (them)."

"While this is our 1st announcement of Jamestown Canyon virus and Powassan virus in New Hampshire, these have been in the U.S. for a while, and Powassan was found in Maine and Vermont previously, so this is not entirely unexpected," said Dr. Jose Montero, Director of Public Health at DHHS, in a public statement. "There are many mosquito-borne and tick-borne illnesses, and unfortunately, we are probably going to continue to see cases of them, which makes prevention steps all the more important."

Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), which takes its name from the California site where it was 1st isolated in 1943, is a mosquito-borne pathogen that circulates widely in North America but doesn't usually infect humans; it passes primarily between deer and a variety of mosquito species. Reports of JCV in people are unusual and have been confined to the midwestern and northeastern states and central Canada. Most reported illnesses caused by JCV have been mild, but moderate-to-severe central nervous system involvement has been reported, the state said.

Powassan virus, named after the Ontario, Canada town where it was 1st identified in 1958, is transmitted to people by infected ticks. Fewer than 60 cases of the disease have been detected in the United States and Canada in a half-century, although there are signs that its prevalence is beginning to increase. In New Hampshire, the deer tick is the species most capable of transmitting the virus to people.

Deer ticks also carry Lyme disease. A tick must be attached to a person for at least 24 hours, and more likely 48 hours, before transmitting the Lyme virus, but Powassan virus apparently can be transmitted more quickly.

[Jamestown canyon virus (JCV) is distributed throughout temperate North America, where it circulates primarily between deer and various mosquito species. Despite its wide geographic range, only 15 human JCV infections (mean: less than 3 per year) have been reported in the United States since 2004, when JCV became a reportable condition, and those have originated predominantly from the midwestern and northeastern states. JCV infections initially were described in the early 1970s to cause a mild febrile illness in humans. Serosurveys in Connecticut and New York have shown evidence of JCV infection in up to 12 percent of the population. Despite descriptions of mild illness caused by JCV, at least 11 subsequent cases with moderate-to-severe meningoencephalitis have been described, 10 in the early 1980s and one in 2001. (For more information see: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6020a3.htm).

Powassan virus (POWV) virus is classified as a member of the family _Flaviviridae_ and is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. Although in the same family as St. Louis encephalitis virus and West Nile Virus, POWV is ecologically very different. POWV was named for the town of Powassan, Ontario, the home town of a child who died from infection with the virus in 1958, and was the 1st recognized case of disease caused by the virus. It is now known that a virus isolated from ticks of the species _Dermacentor andersoni_ collected in Colorado in 1952 also was this same virus. In Canada, POWV has caused clinical disease in people in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, and has been isolated from wild mammals and ticks in Ontario. Antibodies against POWV have been reported in wild animals from British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Nova Scotia. POWV has been recognized at several different locations in the United States from coast to coast and may occur in Mexico. POWV also has been recognized at multiple locations in southeastern Siberia, northeast of Vladivostok. Human disease is rare. In Canada, 12 cases are known to have occurred in the 41 years from 1958 to 1999. Seven were in children less that 10 years of age. At least 4 cases were fatal, either during the acute disease or subsequently due to chronic debilitation. Four of the 8 surviving patients experienced some form of persistent debility. Disease, when it occurs, takes the form of infection and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis and meningitis). Most infections do not result in disease. For example, among residents of northern Ontario from 1959-1961, studies of the pattern of occurrence of antibodies indicated that 3.3 percent, 0.5 percent and 1.9 percent of the population were infected by the virus in each of those 3 years. Tick bite is considered the major, possibly the only, significant route of exposure for people, and risk of tick bite is the major risk factor for people within the geographic range of the virus.

Further information is requested regarding the person infected by the 2 viruses, his state of health, and occupation. - Mod.CP
