Concerned over increasing cases of vector borne diseases and some cases of dengue surfacing in the district [East Singhbhum district, Jharkhand state], the health department has sounded an alert.

In the city [Jamshedpur], 5 suspect cases have been reported. East Singhbhum IDSP officer Sahir Pall said that all 5 suspected cases' samples have been sent for confirmatory test at vector lab MGM Medical College of Dimna in Mango.

The 3 suspected cases' blood samples from Tata Main Hospital (TMH) are of a 5-year-old, an 11-year-old who is a resident of Chakradharpur and a 60-year-old, while 2 samples sent from Baridih-based Mercy Hospital are of 4-and-a-half-year-old and another individual.

The East Singhbhum district health department has decided to embark on the outdoor awareness campaigns. As part of the campaign, huge hording educating the people will be placed at strategic locations in the city.

Considering the high number of Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases detected in the city so far, the department has also decided to take out hordings specifically for JE. JE is a vector borne viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes after feeding on infected animals such as pigs and wild birds in the agriculture fields.

The department, which earlier used to only spray larvicidal, apart from undertaking cleanliness exercise will be opting for destroying unused containers (identified vector breeding centers) in the affected areas and educating people on not allowing water to stagnate in residential areas. This exercise would be held simultaneously with routine methods of spraying larvicidal in the area.

From district health department records, in the year 2010, over 10 000 viral cases were reported in the district in the monsoon period. The figure rose to 16 000 in 2011, mostly from chikungunya and dengue. In 2012 there were around 8000 viral cases in the city.

The local residents said that though the district health department took initiative to curb the menace, again the diseases have shot up, making life difficult for the people.

Manoj Hansda, a social worker, said that the administration lacks will to work in the fringe areas due to [the fact that] the situation is far from safe.

"I think immediate steps need to be taken to control the menace. The health department needs to spread awareness in the villages and necessary medicines should be distributed," he noted.

[Jharkhand state is located in northeastern India, an area where numerous cases of encephalitis, some due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, are reported annually, usually beginning at this time of year. The above report indicates that several mosquito-borne viruses appear to be transmitted in that locality currently. As mentioned in previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, have been proposed. No mention is made of JE virus vaccination status of the above cases nor of the population in the affected area. Vaccination is more likely to be more effective for prevention of JE cases than vector control, particularly in the areas of paddy rice cultivation that provide abundant _Culex_ vector mosquito breeding sites. The virus doubtless is endemic in northeastern India. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.
