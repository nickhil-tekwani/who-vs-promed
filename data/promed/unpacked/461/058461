Many countries around the world are experiencing measles outbreaks. As of 5 Nov 2019, there have been 440 263 confirmed cases reported to WHO through official monthly reporting by 187 member states in 2019 (figure 1 [at source URL]: Measles case distribution by month and WHO region (2015-2019), data as of 8 Nov 2019).

The following is a brief update on the global measles situation based on information shared by member states with WHO. Note that this is an evolving situation, and data [are] constantly updated. Data below are based on the latest information available to WHO.

African region
--------------
Large measles outbreaks are being reported in several countries in the region. Outbreaks are ongoing in Madagascar and Nigeria; although the rate of new cases is decreasing, cases are still being reported weekly. As of 17 Nov 2019, a total of 250 270 suspected cases with 5110 associated deaths have been reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an increase in more than 8000 cases compared to the previous week. All provinces are affected, and a national outbreak response vaccination campaign is ongoing in phases and should be completed by the end of the year [2019]. As of 13 Nov [2019], Guinea had 4690 suspected measles cases, 1091 of which were confirmed. Outbreak vaccination response activities are underway. As of 17 Nov 2019, Chad had reported 25 596 suspected cases in 94% of their districts; outbreak response vaccination is planned.

Eastern Mediterranean region
----------------------------
From 1 Jan-17 Nov 2019, Lebanon reported 1060 confirmed cases of measles (for more information, see Disease Outbreak News (DON) published on measles in Lebanon on 22 Oct 2019: https://www.who.int/csr/don/22-october-2019-measles-lebanon/en/). As of 8 Nov 2019, current outbreaks of concern include Yemen with 5847 confirmed cases, Sudan with 3659 confirmed cases, Somalia with 2795 cases, Pakistan with 1978 confirmed cases, Tunisia with 1367 cases, and Iraq with 1222 cases of measles.

European region
---------------
Many countries in Europe have experienced large outbreaks in 2019. From 1 Jan-5 Nov 2019, Ukraine has reported 56 802 cases, followed by Kazakhstan with 10 126 cases, Georgia with 3904 cases, Russian Federation with 3521 cases, Turkey with 2666 cases, and Kyrgyzstan with 2228 cases of measles. Some of these outbreaks (for example, Georgia, Russian Federation, Turkey) have resolved.

Region of the Americas
----------------------
From 1 Jan-9 Nov 2019, Brazil reported 11 887 confirmed cases of measles, with the majority of cases in Sao Paulo. A vaccination response is under way.

During the same time, Venezuela reported 520 measles cases with no new case being reported in the last 14 weeks. Colombia has reported 215 cases, which were likely acquired in Venezuela. In the USA, 2 large sustained outbreaks in New York state have also been declared over; however, small outbreaks are still occurring in other states within the USA.

South East Asia region
----------------------
From 1 Jan-18 Nov [2019], Bangladesh has reported 4181 confirmed cases of measles. Much of the current growing outbreak is centered in Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazaar; vaccination efforts continue. Myanmar has had 5286 cases, though their outbreak appears to be resolving after 2 rounds of outbreak response immunization. A nationwide vaccination campaign for children aged 9-65 months is ongoing. There is a need to also vaccinate previously unreached adults to stop the current ongoing transmission.

During the same time, Thailand reported 4852 cases, and a vaccination campaign targeting children between one and 12 years of age is ongoing; however, there is a need to conduct vaccination campaigns for susceptible populations born between 1984 and 2000 as well as migrant populations in industrial areas, people participating in travel, and tours companies and such other establishments.

Western Pacific region
----------------------
Outbreaks in the Philippines and Viet Nam earlier in 2019 drove the increase in cases in the region, but new cases are decreasing in these countries. As of 20 Nov 2019, current outbreaks include New Zealand with 2084 confirmed cases, of which 80% are in the Auckland region; Cambodia has 490 cases with cases occurring in all provinces.

From 1 Jan-23 Nov 2019, multiple countries in the Pacific Islands are experiencing outbreaks including Tonga (310 cases), Fiji (10 cases), and American Samoa (2 cases). As of 26 Nov [2019], the Samoa Ministry of Health confirmed a total of 2437 cases and 32 associated deaths, with 243 new cases reported within the last 24 hours. These islands are conducting outbreak response activities and mitigation measures, including vaccination campaigns.

Public health response
----------------------
WHO and partners coordinate their support to member states for the following activities:
- Enhancing preparedness for measles outbreak response
- Strengthening public trust in vaccines
- Strengthening surveillance, risk assessment, and outbreak investigations
- Improving clinical management of measles cases
- Implementing outbreak response immunization activities
- Evaluating outbreak response activities

WHO has established a measles outbreaks Incident Management Support system to coordinate its support to affected countries.

Situation report: Tonga measles outbreak 2019, SitRep no. 7: 394 cases

1. Summary of situation
Background: The outbreak of measles in Tonga began in early October 2019, following the return of a squad of Tongan rugby players from New Zealand. The 1st rugby player developed measles in New Zealand. Subsequently, a further 12 players developed laboratory-confirmed measles after returning to Tonga. The outbreak has involved mainly teenagers from schools on Tongatapu, as well as students from Vava'u High School. Cases on Vava'u appear to be slowing, with the most recent case reported last Thursday [21 Nov 2019]. However, cases are now being seen more widely in other age groups and other geographic locations, including the islands of 'Eua, Niuatoputapu, and Ha'apai. An interdisciplinary Ministry of Health Epidemic Task Force meets weekly to advise on management of the outbreak. In addition to routine outbreak response activities, a time-limited vaccination program targeting secondary school students has been completed on Tongatapu and has now started on other islands.
Note: Refer to earlier SitReps for further detail of the initial cases and response.

2. Current situation
As [of] 26 Nov 2019, 394 cases of confirmed or suspected measles have been identified in Tonga. Of these, 344 (87%) of cases have occurred on the main island of Tongatapu, where the outbreak began. The smaller outbreak on Vava'u has a total of 44 (11%) cases. In addition, 5 cases of rash illness have occurred in children on the island of 'Eua, while a single case of rash illness has occurred in a child on the island of Ha'apai. Note that details of the case on Ha'apai are not yet available, and data for this case [have] not been included in the analysis below.

Eight admissions to hospital have occurred among measles cases in this outbreak, with no deaths. The significant majority of cases have been managed in home isolation.

Figure 1 [see source URL] shows the epidemic curve for the current outbreak in Tonga and is consistent with a propagated outbreak matching the incubation period for measles. The significant majority of cases (blue) occurred on the island of Tongatapu, while those in orange/red indicate cases reported on Vava'u (all of which relate to the return of 2 rugby players with measles).

Figure 2 demonstrates the breakdown of cases by sex. Consistent with transmission through boarding schools, most cases are among males, while case numbers have increased among females as the outbreak has progressed. A total of 49 cases have occurred in children aged less than 5 years, an increase on the 34 cases for this age group in SitRep 6. Cases among adolescents and young people continue to form the majority of cases in this outbreak, with 325 (82%) cases occurring in people aged 10-24 years (Table 1 and Figure 3). This effect is particularly marked in males, where 249 of 282 cases (88%) have occurred in the 10- to 24-year-old age group. Consistent with previous SitReps, the predominant symptom report was rash in 387 of 394 cases (98%) and fever in 340 of 396 (86%).

[5] Samoa: measles struggle
Date: Wed 27 Nov 2019
Source: Samoa Observer [abridged, edited]
https://www.samoaobserver.ws/category/samoa/53974


The leader of an Australian medical team, Dr Dan Holmes, who has been helping Samoa to deal with the measles epidemic, has spoken about the struggles to contain a disease that has already claimed 33 Samoan lives. Speaking to the Samoa Observer, Dr Holmes said severe pneumonia has been the most prominent complication of measles in the young children suffering it. Dr. Holmes is the leader of the Australian Medical Assistance Team (AUSMAT).

From the beginning of the epidemic, the intensive care unit of the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital has been at capacity, so much so that the Australian Government flew in an 8-bed negative-pressure tent unit to help. Dr Holmes arrived with the tent and the 1st team of medical professionals to help meet the urgent demand for intensive care, especially of children. "The main complication is undoubtedly pneumonia," said Dr Holmes, who is the unit's clinical team leader.

"[Measles] affects the immune system so you are unable to fight as well as you normally would be, and on top of that the measles itself can damage the lungs. If you get a bacterial infection on top of that then it can cause a very severe pneumonia." The pneumonia caused by measles needs deeply complex treatment, Dr Holmes said, including draining infections from the lungs and administering strong antibiotics through the child's veins. "That is a lot for a small child to take and it's very difficult to sustain that for a long period of time."

As well as pneumonia, other children have been suffering encephalitis as a result of measles, the inflammation of the brain which can cause seizures. It occurs when the brain becomes infected with the virus, or by something else that gets in while the immune system is damaged by the measles. Measles can also cause long-term damage in patients, but those impacts are not yet clear, Dr Holmes said. "There is undoubtedly a chance that there is a burden on those children who have had those very severe infections, that they will go on to have some more problems in the future. At this time we are really dealing with the acute pneumonia, trying to get them better from that and out of hospital."

Dr. Holmes and his team will be leaving Samoa on Thursday [28 Nov 2019] and a new team arrived on Wednesday ready to replace them for the next 2 weeks. The reinforcements come after the Australian team, alongside their Samoan colleagues, have been working between 14- and 16-hour days, both in the intensive care unit and in the main hospital.

When the unit landed 2 weeks ago, their focus was to support the hospital to improve the flow of patients in and out of treatment. "When we arrived it was very busy, the hospital was really overwhelmed with patients with measles. It was very difficult for patients with measles to move into the hospital because the inpatient ward was really clogged up," said Dr Holmes. "The 1st thing we tried to do was improve the flow of patients into the hospital, be able to get patients who were well enough discharged from the hospital and standardise the treatment that people got."

Back in Queensland, Australia, Dr Holmes is an anaesthetist and the director of trauma at the Sunshine Coast Hospital. As an AUSMAT doctor, he has responded to health emergencies across the Pacific, including to the Philippines in 2013 after Typhoon Haiyan and to Vanuatu after Cyclone Pam in 2015. He said he has been amazed by the support and gratitude of his Samoan colleagues and the families of children he has helped treat. "The Samoan people have been amazing, incredibly friendly; their gratitude has been unbelievable to see. That of course makes us feel better about what we are doing and that we are offering something to the people of Samoa," he said. "The families have been extremely grateful and kind to us. It's been very emotional but an extremely rewarding time we've had here."

Seven New Zealand Red Cross health delegates are in Samoa supporting measles treatment and prevention activities, as the number of people suspected to have contracted this disease in the Pacific continues to climb.

The Kiwi health delegates are working with Samoa Red Cross and local agencies in hospitals and vaccination clinics. Deployed nurse from Nelson, Andrea Chapman, says: "We're trying to get everyone immunised as quickly as possible because measles is so contagious, but also educating people that the vaccination takes 14 days until it is fully effective. Although people are being vaccinated, the measles outbreak has the potential to get worse. That's why we're also encouraging people to be vigilant and careful."

Measles is a serious, highly contagious disease. Statistics from the Samoan government indicate that almost 2500 cases of measles have been reported since the outbreak began. Samoa's Ministry of Health has also confirmed that, as of Tuesday [26 Nov 2019], 32 people have died. Most of these were children under the age of 4.

Increasing vaccination rates in communities is vital to prevent further outbreaks. Samoa Red Cross staff and volunteers continue to support measles awareness-raising campaigns, hygiene promotion and assisting mobile measles vaccination sites. They are also recruiting blood donors to meet the increasing need.

https://reliefweb.int/report/fiji/measles-update-ministry-health; view original https://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Centre/News/Measles-Update-from-the-Ministry-of-Health


Since the last update on 22 Nov 2019, there are now 13 confirmed cases of measles. The latest confirmed cases are a 22 year old from Wailali Settlement and a 16 year old from Navunikabi, both in the Serua/Namosi Subdivision. The 3rd case is a 1 year old child from Vatuwaqa Suva, who was admitted at CWM Hospital but has since been discharged.

A 25 year old pregnant woman, who was mentioned as a confirmed case in the last update, has also been discharged from isolation at the CWM Hospital. Currently there are no confirmed measles patients admitted in hospital, but this can change and restrictions at CWM are now in place [see URL for list]. To date [27 Nov 2019], all but 2 of the confirmed cases are from, or are linked to, the Serua/Namosi Subdivision. And all the confirmed cases are in the Central Division.

Suspected cases continue to be reported, tested, and cleared when their results are confirmed negative by the National Public Health Laboratory. This includes an 11 year old student of the Fiji School for the Blind, a suspected case who tested negative and was cleared, and a 1 year old Kiribati national who also tested negative and was cleared.

The respective Sub-divisional Outbreak Response Teams continue to rapidly respond to notification of all cases and will not wait for a case to be confirmed by laboratory testing before launching the necessary interventions to prevent spread of the disease. The response includes isolation of the case, quarantine and vaccination of contacts and at-risk communities, as appropriate.

As mentioned in the past, the measles vaccine is now in limited supply and therefore will be prioritized to those who are at the greatest risk of catching and spreading measles.

This current restriction will change after new vaccine stock arrives later this week -- when it will be made available to further targeted groups identified by the Measles Taskforce. More information on these groups will be released shortly in an advisory notice.

Queensland's 63rd case of measles has been confirmed, with authorities warning a man who contracted the infection spent a number of hours in the Redland Hospital emergency department this week. So far, 25 people have been linked to the outbreak.

Figures provided by Queensland Health show 21 of this year's [2019] measles cases acquired the infection overseas, resulting in at least 19 more cases. Of the 21 overseas-acquired cases, 9 were infected in New Zealand, 3 in Viet Nam, 2 in the Philippines, 2 in Samoa, 1 in Myanmar and 1 case in Thailand. Three cases visited multiple measles-endemic countries.

Seven of the 63 cases reported in Queensland this year [2019] have been children under 5 years old.

[See source URL for locations of possible exposure.]

"The current (measles) outbreak commenced in early October [2019] and was related to infected travellers coming to Queensland from overseas, and then inadvertently transmitting the highly contagious virus to others," Dr Kari Jarvinen said. "Our concern now is about the ongoing risk of measles transmission from travellers coming into Australia, and for travellers from here going to overseas areas where there are a number of serious epidemics in progress, particularly in New Zealand and the Pacific region."

Metro South Hospital and Health Service has recorded about half of all Queensland's measles cases this year [2019] with 32, followed by the Gold Coast with 10. Cairns and Hinterland HHS and Metro North have both had 6 cases each. The Sunshine Coast HHS has had 5 and Townsville and West Moreton HHS have both recorded 2 each.
