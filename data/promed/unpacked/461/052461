The Center for Hygiene, Epidemiology and Microbiology of Pinar del Río ruled out that there are cases of cholera associated with the outbreak of gastrointestinal infections "by water transmission" originating in the Hermanos Cruz popular council, in that western Cuban province.

Dr. Andrés Villar Bahamonde, director of the institution, stated at a press conference that all the patients studied so far have tested negative for cholera, which is a "positive sign" in the midst of the complex situation experienced by the population of that territory, according to a publication in the official newspaper Granma.

On 5 May 2022, local media reported on the outbreak that occurred in that area of the provincial capital. According to what was said, after the 1st analysis of the microbiology laboratory, the presence of enterobacteria, presumably of the _Escherichia coli_ type, could be observed.

The specialist explained that the rains registered in the territory during the 1st days of May [2022], after several months of drought, produced floods and the contamination of cisterns in the aforementioned popular council, and from this an outbreak of diarrheal diseases among its inhabitants was derived.

However, Villa Bahamonde pointed out that the samples carried out on the water that is received in this part of the capital of Pinar del Río -- which is supplied by the 36-inch [1 m] conductor -- showed very low levels of chlorine, which contributed to worsening the situation, he notes. The publication details that among the main symptoms of the dozens of people treated in clinics, the polyclinic of this health area and the pediatric hospital, include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and fever.

According to Granma, the health expert acknowledged that the number of infected people who have not seen a doctor could be much higher.

Given this situation, the pumping of water from the 36-inch [1 m] conductor was stopped to maintain the chlorination system, and the tanks were cleaned. In addition, the population was informed of the need to boil the water before consuming it and treat it with 1% hypochlorite.

[The etiology or etiologies of the gastroenteritis is not stated.

Cholera did affect Cuba in the wake of the Haiti epidemic. The Cuba outbreak was primarily 2012-2013. The 1st cases were diagnosed in the eastern province of Granma and occurred about 21 months after the beginning of the disastrous epidemic in Haiti.

The Pinar del Río province is Cuba's westernmost province. - Mod.LL]
