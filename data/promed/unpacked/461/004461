The parasitic disease river blindness, once thought to have been
eradicated from Cote d'Ivoire, has re-emerged in some regions
following years of armed conflict that wiped out mechanisms for
surveillance and control, health officials say.
The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2002 closed its West Africa
programme to eliminate river blindness, or onchocerciasis, as a
public health threat. That was also the year an armed rebellion
divided the country.
Studies carried out from July to September 2007 following incidental
reports of cases in forest areas in southwestern Cote d'Ivoire found
that 14 percent of under-5 children there suffered from
onchocerciasis. "These results show that the situation has become
alarming in these zones, where the disease had been eradicated,"
Health Minister Remi Allah Kouadio told reporters on 19 Dec 2007,
following an onchocerciasis conference in Brussels.
The disease is caused by a worm transmitted through the bites of
infected blackflies, according to WHO. The flies carry larvae from
human to human; they mature into adult worms under human skin. After
mating, a female fly releases up to 1000 tiny worms per day, known as
microfilariae. These cause a variety of conditions including
blindness, rashes and lesions.
When WHO ended its West Africa river blindness programme in 2002,
governments were to carry on surveillance and detection using
infrastructure developed with WHO's support. But in Cote d'Ivoire,
the health ministry's surveillance activities stopped in many areas
due to the destruction of infrastructure in fighting just after the
rebellion, Health Minister Kouadio said. The government plans to
reactivate its programme to fight river blindness, starting with
additional studies to determine precisely which areas are affected.
No date is set yet for the launch, according to health ministry
spokesperson Simeon N'Da.
WHO officials could not be reached for comment.

[_Onchocerca volvulus_ does not have a zoonotic reservoir and is
transmitted between humans by blackflies (_Simulium_ spp.). An
illustration of the life cycle can be found here:

It is not surprising that the infection emerged when the surveillance
system broke down. The present report comes from the southwestern
part of Cote d'Ivoire, and spread of the infection from Liberia,
which also has suffered from a prolonged civil war and a breakdown of
onchocerciasis control, is perhaps contributing to the current
outbreak in Cote d'Ivoire - Mod.EP]
