High school students and parents are demanding answers about a tuberculosis [TB] scare at Grant Union High School. Test results show 111 students and staff tested positive for latent TB.

"My brother is on the track team and he's a football player. He's positive for it," [a] student said. Students and parents packed into the cafeteria at Grant Union High in the Del Paso Heights neighborhood Wednesday night [14 May 2014] to raise their concerns about what the new test results mean.

The county tested 200 people after a student came down with an active case of TB in February [2014]. Last week [week of 5 May 2014], another 500 were asked to be screened, but not everyone showed up. A total of 111 people at Grant Union High now have latent TB [55.6 percent of those tested]. Sacramento County public health officials said it's a high number, but it doesn't pose the same risk. Latent TB is not infectious and there are no symptoms. "The person is not contagious, is not sick, they can be around other people, " Sacramento County Public Health Officer Dr Olivia Kasirye said.

Anyone with latent TB should take preventative medication so it doesn't become serious. [A mother] said her son tested positive for latent TB. "He'll need to take medication," [the mother] said. "He doesn't have to, but if he doesn't, he'll have a higher risk of becoming active in the future."

"A person can stay in that latent phase for a long, long time," Kasirye said. "In fact, the majority of people never actually come down with disease. But a certain percentage, about 10 percent do." Active TB is rare; Sacramento County sees about 80 cases every year. The symptoms of active TB are a persistent cough, fever and weight loss. It could be fatal.

The county public health department doesn't plan to do any additional screening. They said they need to finish reviewing the data they collected already.

Many parents argued that the entire school needs to be tested to offer the community peace of mind.

"This is something that could ruin a community if it's not taken care of right now," Castillano said.

More than 100 students at Grant High School in Sacramento have been diagnosed with a "sleeping" [latent] version of tuberculosis. Health officials have now started testing students in classrooms that are connected by air-conditioning ducts.

The students have been put on a 12-week course of medications to keep the latent TB from becoming active and impacting their health.

Health officials say latent TB is not contagious, but active TB can be passed through the air.

Health officials first started testing students in early March [2014] after one student was diagnosed with active TB.

Health officials say it can be difficult sometimes to convince people with the dormant form of TB to follow through on their medications. "A lot of people who are diagnosed with latent TB infection are feeling well, and you are asking them to take this medication which is quite strong. That is why the education piece is very important," said Sacramento County Public Health Officer Dr Olivia Kasirye.

The health department says some of the dormant cases weren't discovered until officials re-examined the air-conditioning system and started testing students who were in classrooms connected by air ducts.

Health officials are working with students to make sure the students don't miss a dose, but say it will become more complicated once school lets out for the summer. "We do have a team of people with the health department who are keeping track, and we are working with the school making sure those that are being treated get their treatment every week," Kasirye said. The health department pays for the medications because it is considered a public health threat, officials said.

[Since the 1992 TB resurgence peak in the United States, the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases reported annually has decreased and the number of reported TB cases in 2012 was the lowest recorded since national reporting began in 1953 (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/reports/2012/pdf/report2012.pdf). However, in 2012 the rate in California was higher (5.8) than the national average rate of 3.2 cases per 100 000 persons and the percent of TB cases occurring among foreign-born persons (78) was higher than the national average, 63 percent; 37 percent were of Hispanic and 44 percent were of Asian ethnicity (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/reports/2012/pdf/report2012.pdf).

The 2 news reports do not mention how the index case, an adolescent who was diagnosed with active TB in early March 2014, contracted the illness. Children most commonly develop TB as a result of exposure to a case of active pulmonary TB in their immediate environment, usually in their household.

TB is caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (Mtb) that are spread in airborne droplets. People usually acquire TB from another person who has active, most often cavitary, pulmonary TB. Lung cavities tend to contain high numbers of _M. tuberculosis_ (Mtb). When patients with lung cavities cough or sneeze, large numbers of infectious aerosols are expelled into the surrounding air. The degree of contagiousness of the patient is indicated by the number of bacilli seen on smears of sputum stained specifically for mycobacteria, that is, acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Transmission of TB depends on the concentration and size of infectious particles, the proximity to the patient, ventilation of the space in which exposure takes place, and duration of exposure, as well as characteristics of the specific strain. The closer and the longer the duration of exposure in poorly ventilated spaces, the higher is the risk for transmission.

The 2nd news reports says that some of the latent TB cases weren't discovered until officials re-examined the air-conditioning system and started testing students who were in classrooms connected by air ducts. Airborne transmission of Mtb via air ventilation ducts was demonstrated many years ago using guinea pigs to detect the airborne Mtb (Riley, R, et al: Aerial dissemination of pulmonary tuberculosis. A two year study of contagion in a tuberculosis ward. Am J Hyg 1959; 70: 185-196. Available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/142/1/3.full.pdf+html?ijkey=497aeea8bed8d0da92926ff5b3d09891108588ce&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha subscription required).

Following inhalation of infectious aerosols of Mtb, primary pulmonary Mtb infection develops with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs, usually without evoking any symptoms. Activation of latent Mtb infection can occur at a later time, especially if the individual becomes malnourished, develops an immunosuppressive illness such as HIV infection or receives immunosuppressive medication such as a corticosteroid. About 10 percent of people with latent TB will develop active TB at some point in their lives. However, adolescents are more susceptible to develop active TB, and the time between initial infection and development of active TB is shorter (Wilcox W, Laufer S: Tuberculosis in adolescents. Clin Pediatr 1994; 33: 258-62; and Smith MHD: Tuberculosis in adolescents. Clin Pediatr 1967; 6: 9-15). Nevertheless, many adolescents fail to complete a course of therapy for latent TB (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1497389/pdf/12196616.pdf).

In 1965, we described a large outbreak of TB that started in the fall of 1962 among medical students (11 cases) and employees of the medical school (11 cases) and medical college hospital (5 cases) (Alpert ME, Levison ME: An epidemic of tuberculosis in a medical school. N Engl J Med 1965; 272: 7l8-21). In the medical school classes in which cases of TB occurred, the tuberculin skin test reactivity rose from 16 percent on average among medical students at admission to medical school to 69-90 percent among those students that had not been vaccinated with BCG on admission. No one source was identified in this medical school outbreak, but school outbreaks should serve as a reminder that students, especially young children, serve as indicators of recent transmission that warrants prompt investigation for a source with active tuberculosis in their environment so that further transmission can be rapidly interrupted. - Mod.ML
