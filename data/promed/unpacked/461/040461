I receive only the difficult cases here at Onderstepoort, as the
straightforward cases are dealt with by the local authorities and private
practitioners. We regularly use the method of heat treating samples from
soil and carcass remnants as used in Etosha by Pauline Lindeque, and find
it very satisfactory. Fresh cases are cultured directly.
The outbreak is similar to the one in the Kimberly district in 1995/6.
This time the weather pattern was that it rained heavily in the spring, and
then became extremely dry in December [2000 and January [2001. It is
thought that the heavy rain washed spores into the various pans and dams,
and the dry weather concentrated them. I have so far received samples from
26 cases, of which 16 were positive. 5 positive cases were from cattle, and
the others were all from game, which are difficult to vaccinate. They were
eland 4, kudu 3, and one each of buffalo, roan, springbok and an unknown
antelope [too little of the carcass left to be able to identify it properly.
The case from Schmidtsdrift was one of the [5 positive cattle, where the
community ate the carcass, and a number of them [15 became ill, mostly the
cutaneous form. All were treated at the Kimberly hospital. I don't have
exact details, as the State Veterinarian at Kimberly is dealing with it,
together with the doctors at the hospital.

[This report indicates that there were more game affected than listed in
the original report. It is thus not a simple herd-based series of deaths.
My present mental paradigm is that the late spring wet gets one a good crop
of Tabanid flies which then magnify the sporadic cases occurring during the
subsequent hot-dry period when animals' immune systems are depressed by the
heat stress. Kimothy Smith & I have an ongoing bet as to whether there are
multiple minifoci or whether the biting flies can magnify up just one or 2
foci of cases to give the same epidemic result. The recent series last
summer in the US northern central-states should clarify this. I think he is
probably correct in that there are multiple random foci being taken
advantage of. In a normal summer these would be dispersed single random
anthrax deaths, almost certainly never followed up and checked, so the
carcasses are either left or rendered and the ongoing endemic sporadic
situation is unappreciated. "Rains washing spores into pans and sloughs"
has a long and persuasive tradition, which I for one do not dismiss, but
field data on spore recoveries to support it are still sparse,
unfortunately. - Mod.MHJ
