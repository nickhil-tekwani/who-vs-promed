The number of dengue fever cases detected on Madeira Island has diminished to low values, the Director General of Health (DGS) announced today [12 Mar 2013], and the outbreak is considered to be controlled.

The monthly update of the dengue outbreak, available on the DGS website, indicates that the weekly monitoring of dengue virus infections on Madeira Island, permits verification that since mid-November [2012] the number of cases has been falling to residual values, noting that since 4 Feb [2013] there have been "no laboratory confirmed cases".

According to DGS, since the beginning of the outbreak on 3 Oct 2012, 2168 cases of dengue fever were reported on Madeira -- 4 more than the information made available for last month -- "from the records of hospital and primary health care centers."

In the same report the DGS states, relative to the situation on 3 Mar [2013], that "other cases were reported, 11 on the Continent [continental Portugal?] and 70 in 13 European countries, all in returning travelers," from the Island, stressing that "there were no deaths."

"Entomological surveillance using ovitraps and adult traps located in dispersed areas on the Island, with emphasis on the southern slope, continues to show an accentuated and progressive reduction in vector activity," the DGS explained, sustaining [the conclusion] that ,"these data, according to the figures available, and also taking into account current vector activity, leads us to consider that the outbreak is now controlled."

Still, the DGS states that "all measures of surveillance, control, and response considered appropriate" remain in place, as well as "recommendations for personal protection by preventing mosquito bites."

[The number of dengue cases reported is up only 4 since the 14 Feb 2013 report (see ProMED-mail archive no 20130215.154440). It is good to learn that the outbreak appears to have ended and vector mosquito activity is reduced. Vector eradication is probably not feasible since the mosquito is fairly widely disbursed on Madeira Island.
