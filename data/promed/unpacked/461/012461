At least 3 children have been reported to have died of cholera in an outbreak in Ba'adweyne village in the central Somali region of Mudug.

Mohamed Said Ahmed, an official from Ba'adweyne told Bar-kulan that the cholera cases have been reported in the area 3 days ago. He added that there has not been any emergency response to counter the outbreak and appealed for immediate assistance.

Meanwhile, Dr Mohamed Ahmed Shino who is one of the medical practitioners in Galkayo Hospital stated that at least 13 people affected by the cholera outbreak including elderly and children have been admitted to the hospital. Dr Shino believes that the cholera outbreak was caused by contaminated water coupled with a searing heat in the region.

Approximately 1054 cholera cases including 43 deaths have been recorded between November 2013 and April 2014 in the city of Likasi, located 120 km [74.5 mi] north of Lubumbashi (Katanga). The health district of Likasi has delivered this figure on [Wed 23 Apr 2014], during the weekly meeting of epidemiological surveillance.

The doctor inspector of this health district, Dr Gaspard Ilunga Dipata, regretted that the number of sick due to cholera continues to increase in spite of the awareness, the chlorination of water, and disinfection. He has indicated that the cholera treatment center records an average of 3 cases per day, the majority from the commune of Kikula.

The NGO Oxfam is also committed to repairing the leaks of water observed in the Regideso [charged with the production and distribution of water to residential, commercial, and industrial customers] piping system.

Between October 2012 and June 2013, the city of Likasi registered 894 cholera cases including 34 deaths.

[OXFAM and the government should also consider distributing the recipe for home-made oral rehydration solution to households in the hardest hit areas. Cholera can be effectively treated with this http://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm#recipe, but if that does not produce any improvement, the patient should be hospitalized. - Mod.JW ]
