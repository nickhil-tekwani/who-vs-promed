Asian Bird Flu
-------------
In Feb 2004, scientists in Thailand confirmed the 1st cases of Asian Bird
Flu in cats. The H5N1 virus is most famously found in intensively farmed
chickens, but affects other bird species including pigeons and ducks. It
has killed 22 people across several Asian countries. Veterinarian Teeraphon
Sirinauemit announced in Bangkok that H5N1 bird flu had been found in at
least 2 domestic cats and a white tiger. Genetic tests on the virus
detected in all 3 animals confirmed the identity of the virus. The
discovery was significant, because every time the virus jumps species, the
risk of mutation into a human form increases.
Autopsies and virus tests were performed on 3 cats at Kasetsart
University's animal hospital. 2 cats tested positive for the H5N1 virus.
They were among 15 cats owned by a Thai man living near an infected chicken
farm in Nakorn Pathom, 37 miles (60 Km) west of Bangkok. 14 of the 15 cats
had died, but it was unclear whether all had been infected with the H5N1
virus. One cat was still alive, but very sick and was being tested for
H5N1. The white tiger affected by H5N1 was housed at the Khao Khiew private
zoo in Chonburi province near Bangkok. It tested positive for the virus,
but had recovered fully. Tests confirmed that H5N1 had killed a rare Thai
clouded leopard from the same zoo in January 2004. The most probably cause
is raw chicken fed to the big cats.
The occurrence of H5N1 bird flu in the domestic cats is due to eating raw
chicken, proximity to infected farms and/or contact with infected bird
carcasses. All the affected domestic cats would have had a high degree of
exposure to the virus. Almost all cases of H5N1 bird flu in humans are
traceable to infected chickens; though cats are susceptible to it, the
virus does not appear to pose a danger to humans. The scientists' main
concern is the growing number of species into which the virus has jumped.
Health Ministry officials were sent to check on anybody who had been in
contact with the dead cats, while pet owners took immediate precautions,
switching meals from cooked chicken to beef.
Professor Thaneerat Santiwat, dean of Kasetsart University's veterinary
faculty, advised owners not to let their cats eat dead chicken carcasses,
dead birds, or any dead animals found in infected areas. As well as
domestic pets, thousands of stray and semi-feral cats live in close
proximity to humans in rural and urban areas of Thailand, especially around
temples. Cat lovers who feed the strays have been asked not to feed raw
chicken. This aims to prevent H5N1 from jumping to other cats and reduces
the risk of mutation. There is no current evidence of cat-to-cat or
cat-to-human transmission of H5N1 Asian Bird Flu.
