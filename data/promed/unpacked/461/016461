[Note: Now that West Nile virus infection is endemic throughout much of the

infection in year 2002 will be combined and presented as an "update" at
regular, but not more frequent than weekly, intervals determined by the
volume of such reports. As previously, however, reports of human infection,
infection of new hosts, extension of geographical range and events of
special significance will be posted immediately on receipt. - Mod.CP]
