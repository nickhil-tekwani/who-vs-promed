Under the new regulations, a group of _E. coli_ bacteria collectively
dubbed the "the big 6" capable of causing infection and death will be
classified as adulterants on par with the better-known _E. coli_
O157:H7, the bug frequently linked to serious foodborne illness from
tainted ground beef.

Starting next spring in 2012, federal food safety inspectors will test
for those strains of _E. coli_ and it will be illegal to sell meat
contaminated with the pathogens, consumer advocates and meat industry
sources told msnbc.com. US Department of Agriculture officials were
expected to confirm the changes at a press conference scheduled Tue 13
Sep 2011.

The move was hailed as a long-sought victory by food safety advocates,
who said they wondered why it took so long to require testing for
bacteria that in 2010 collectively caused more infections in the USA
than _E. coli_ O157. "I think what consumers can expect is less
contaminated product making it into commerce," said Nancy Donley,
president of the agency STOP Foodborne Illness. "It's fantastic news."
The new move was sharply criticized by meat industry officials, who
had opposed the change, saying that current measures to detect and
eradicate _E. coli_ O157 were adequate to prevent infection from the
other pathogens.

"[The news] that it will soon be 'illegal' to have 6 strains of
naturally occurring non-O157 _E. coli_ in ground beef is premised upon
the notion that the government can make products safe by banning a
pathogen. That view is not supported by science," American Meat
Institute executive vice president James H Hodges said in a
statement.

The rules cover 6 strains of _E. coli_ bacteria that have the ability
to produce the same deadly toxins that can lead to bloody diarrheal
illness, kidney failure, and death as _E. coli_ O157. Known as Shiga
toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, or STECs, the group includes the
strains O26, O111, O103, O121, O45, and O145. In 2010, for the 1st
time, those strains of _E. coli_ were responsible for more infections
in the USA than _E. coli_ O157, according to a June 2011 study
released by the CDC. The non-O157 strains caused 451 confirmed
infections in 2010, including 69 people who were hospitalized and a
death. _E. coli_ O157 caused 442 infections, 184 hospitalizations, and
2 deaths.

However, CDC officials say many infections are never detected. The
agency estimates that overall, as many as 265 000 STEC infections
occur each year in the USA, with the non-O157 strains causing up to
113 000 illnesses and 300 hospitalizations annually.

_E. coli_ O157 was first labeled an adulterant in 1994, after a deadly
outbreak in 'Jack in the Box' restaurant hamburger patties that
sickened more than 700 people and led to 171 hospitalizations and 4
deaths. The move made it illegal to sell raw meat contaminated with
the bacteria. At the time, meat industry officials called the change
an overreaction and sued the federal government over the designation.
Since then, CDC officials say vigilant testing and industry recalls
have helped reduce the rate of _E. coli_ O157 to less than 1 case per
100 000 people, a decline from 2 cases per 100 000 people in 1997.

Agriculture, industry, and consumer groups have fiercely debated the
new rules since at least 2007, during a meeting to assess the impact
of the non-O157 _E. coli_ strains.

[This seems to be progress in the prevention of ground beef-associated
transmission of non-O157 enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). While it
is true that banning a pathogen does not keep it from infecting us per
se, the regulations should set in motion a surveillance testing system
to identify these pathogens in beef. It should be recalled that the
use of sorbitol-MacConkey agar as a screening for O157 strains is not
useful in other EHEC strains and other screening systems such as the
detection of Shiga toxin or its gene will be needed.

Additionally, USDA is responsible for beef but not for a lot of other
potential vehicles of transmission such as fresh produce, which are
under the auspices of the FDA. It would seem that FDA should enact
similar regulations assuming that the politicos will allow this to
occur given the push towards less regulations by 'big government'.

Lastly, these strains were chosen because of their relative frequency
so, I guess, it will be perfectly legal to sell ground beef
contaminated by another strain of _E. coli_, say the recent German
outbreak chimera strain of _E. coli_ O104:H2. There should be a way of
"grandsoning" in additional strains. - Mod.LL]

[While this may be a significant advance for food safety, from the
veterinary health and industry perspective, it may be directed in the
wrong direction. The 'bugs' are naturally occurring and just as many
infections are asymptomatic and go unrecognized in people, the same
holds true for animals. One of the major concerns of the impact of
this policy is the probable ensuing significant increase in the price
of beef and other food items impacted by this policy. - Mod.TG]
