Re: BSE, young bovine - Ireland
-------------------------------
The animal in question is aged 3 years and 9 months. It was a cohort
animal, in a herd in which an older animal was a confirmed clinical case.
The infection was subclinical and would not have become clinical for some
time, most likely when the animal would have reached the age of 4 years
which is the "normal" minimum age for clinical cases.
This animal obviously ate meat and bone meal (MBM): dam reported to be
alive, thus vertical transmission unlikely. The infection source will be
investigated now. There have been reports of a poultry unit on the same
farm and this could be regarded, at this stage, as one possible source of
infection.
While it can be argued that the controls on the said (cross
contamination/incorrect feeding) source of infection indicate a loophole in
1999, the total banning of MBM feeding in all animal rations has now
eliminated this route of infection. The discovery and reporting of this
case, however, highlights the intensity and effectiveness of the system of
identification of all infected animals and their removal from the human
food chain. There exists a series of controls at mills, farms, and
abattoirs that focuses on reducing possible contamination of cattle feed.
All proven positive clinical cases are slaughtered. All animals slaughtered
at over 30 months of age are examined for evidence of the prion, as are all
casualty animals that die on farms. All such animals, and the herds from
which they come, are kept out of the animal and human food chains.
Ireland implemented herd depopulation -- even when only one BSE was
disclosed in the herd -- in 1990, ahead of [most] other countries. Such a
measure, combined with removal of high risk offals at slaughter, is the
surest means of excluding the prion from recycling in animal feeds and
entering the food chain.
Other countries whose detection and reporting systems were less effective
might appear to have better controls. Several of these have only recently
reported their first indigenous infection, indicating the possibility that
earlier cases were not detected while the origin of their infection, and
their own fate, remained unknown.
A recent example of Ireland's intensive monitoring system is the discovery
of MBM in a cargo of animal feed from the USA, some of which had gone to
compounders and so had to be recalled. While such a case is not conclusive
evidence that the USA has undetected BSE, it does highlight how difficult
it is to be sure that regulatory intent is followed in practice.
While there is no room for complacency in Ireland given the failure to
prevent MBM ingestion by this bull, there is more than a little consolation
to be gained from the detection of this sub-clinical case, and its
reporting to the general public.

[David Byrne, EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, said in
his "Speaking Note on BSE" to the Agriculture Council, Luxembourg, 27 June
2002 [see: ProMED-mail. BSE - update (07) July 20020707.4691]:
"The overall level is stable or falling in all member states with the
exceptions of Spain and Ireland. This is clearly a cause of concern,
especially in Ireland where the incidence has risen particularly strongly.
However, the age profile of cases of Ireland and the seasonal pattern in
cases observed in recent years suggests that the incidence should now begin
to fall".
The age of the current case might affect the timetable of optimistic
forecasts. Background to the prevailing Irish situation might be sought in
the official European Union reports of their last 2 veterinary missions to
Ireland. The visits were meant to evaluate the implementation of required
measures, aimed at eradication, control, and prevention of BSE. The overall
conclusions of the first mission, carried out from 28 May to 01 Jun 2001, were:
"a. epidemio-surveillance : the sampling of the healthy bovine aged over 30
months in the slaughterhouses is operating effectively. However the
sampling of emergency slaughter and fallen stock shows some deficiencies.
The level of epidemio-surveillance differs widely between counties without
justification (sampling of fallen stock and level of detection of clinical
suspects). The National Reference Laboratory has not a sufficient mandate
to ensure proper supervision of the laboratory carrying out the rapid tests.
b. feed ban : the licencing system implemented several years ago is a good
basis to control the legal use of processed animal proteins. However the
complete separation of production lines in mixed feed mills has not been
completely assessed. Some other shortcomings in the official controls were
found".

The recent mission related to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
(BSE and scrapie) and was carried out from 17 to 21 Jun 2002. The overall
conclusions, regarding BSE, were:
"a. epidemio-surveillance: Substantial efforts were made to improve the
level of BSE epidemio-surveillance. However, the lack of a reliable figure
for the bovine population aged over 24 months, the problems associated with
putrefied samples and the findings in the main rapid-test laboratory, may
affect the reliability of the overall results of the surveillance programme
and, therefore, the estimated BSE incidence.
b. Feed ban: the feed ban is implemented and under official supervision;
some minor shortcomings were found".

According to the Office International des Epizooties' listing for 2001,
Ireland ranked third re the number of indigenous cases per million bovines
aged over 24 months. The 5 leaders were: Great Britain (258); Portugal
(138); Ireland (62); Belgium (28); Spain (24).

It remains to see when the Irish curve peaks and the incidence begins to
fall. - Mod.AS]
