Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika has ordered the Balinese people to
conduct a mass culling of stray dogs on the island to help the
administration prevent a rabies outbreak.

The order was made Saturday [29 Nov 2008] in response to 4 deaths
believed to be caused by rabies transmitted through dog bites in
Ungasan village, Uluwatu.

As of Friday [28 Nov 2008], 17 wild and domesticated dogs have been
put down using lethal injection by the Yudhistira Swarga foundation
for wild dog welfare, while 76 residents of Ungasan who were bitten
by dogs have been vaccinated by officers of the Badung Health Agency.

"The residents can just go ahead by taking the initiative to kill
stray dogs. If the mass dog culling relied only on administration
officers, it would take too long to get rid of," said Pastika at an
open house session with the Balinese people.

The existence of stray dogs along the streets, he said, had sped up
the spread of the deadly rabies virus.

Laboratory tests showed the 4 [persons] -- 2 elderly and 2 children
-- died because of dog bites, but it was still unclear whether they
died because of rabies.

"But there is an indication the 4 died because of bites by
rabies-infected dogs. So we have to respond to it as quickly as
possible to curb its spread," Pastika said, adding rabies could only
be controlled by killing the stray dogs.

The governor also urged dog owners to pay attention to the health of
their pets and not to let them play with stray dogs.

"Domesticated dogs have also undergone health checks to detect
whether they are healthy or are infected with rabies."

Pastika ordered port officials to strengthen custom checks of goods
entering Bali to prevent the illegal entrance of dogs from outer
islands.

He said he believed the rabies infection was the result of dogs being
smuggled into Bali from other islands.

Aside from dogs, Pastika also demanded the strict supervision of the
entrance of other animals into Bali, like monkeys and cats, which
transmit diseases to human beings.

The Badung regency culled 11 reportedly rabid dogs from the village
of Ungasan in Uluwatu district, Bali on Thursday [27 Nov 2008], after
2 adults and 2 children in the area who were bitten died of
undetermined causes.

Officials from the animal husbandry agency and representatives from
the Yudisthira Swarga Foundation for wild dog welfare captured the
animals, [sampled brain tissue] for testing, then administered lethal
injections to prevent a possible outbreak. The dogs were then buried.

Ungasan village chief and agency official Wayan Suarkana said most of
the dogs culled were wild, though some belonged to villagers who were
willing to hand over their pets.

He said it would take a few days to determine whether the culled dogs
had rabies.

Suarkana said the agency might decide to cull more dogs in the
village before waiting for lab results on the dogs' [CNS samples].

"It's hard to tell whether the disease is actually here or whether
the dogs we culled today have rabies, but we just can't take the
risk," he said.

This is the 1st case of mass culling of reportedly rabid canines.
Bali has been rabies free for several decades, but the number of
deaths forced the agency to act quickly, Suarkana said.

In September this year [2008], dogs bit 2 adults, 32 and 28 years
old. Two months later, they both died, with officials believing the
cause to be rabies. One died on 14 Nov 2008 at Kasih Ibu Hospital in
Badung; the other died on 23 Nov 2008 at Sanglah Hospital in Denpasar.

Suarkana declined to identify the 2 toddlers, though their deaths
were confirmed to have occurred "recently."

"They died of unknown causes, but they may have contracted rabies.
They were bitten before they died," Suarkana said.

16 other villagers have also been bitten, though none of them have
complained of illness. Village records record 170 families living
there.

Balinese tend to let wild dogs roam free and domesticated dogs are
rarely kept on a leash.

In a separate interview, Tinneke Indrajaya, from the Bali Animal
Welfare Association, said it would be a major concern if the dogs
were infected with rabies, because no vaccine for the disease is
stored on the island.

"Bali has been free of rabies for decades; we haven't had any need
for a vaccine in the island. But there's no need for panic; nothing's
been confirmed yet," she said.

Rabies is a disease that causes acute inflammation in the brain. The
disease can be carried by dogs, monkeys and bats, among other mammals.

A bite from an infected animal is fatal for humans if left untreated.
However, immediate immunization is 100 percent effective in
preventing the onset of the disease. There have been 31 000 deaths in
Asia from rabies, according to a 2006 report from the World Health
Organization.

Sanglah Hospital in Bali has prepared a special area to treat people
[suspected of being exposed to] rabies [virus], as officials
announced a state of alert on a rabies outbreak.

The hospital prepared a special room isolated from lights and with
limited ventilation consisting of 6 beds.

Local officials announced the alert status on Tuesday [2 Dec 2008]
after 2 local residents in Badung Regency, aged 28 and 8, died of
rabies. The 2 residents died in September 2008, but test results came
recently. Bali is also conducting vaccination on domestic animals
throughout the province.

[The (Australian) communicator, Krispin Hajkowicz, has added the
following comment: "The Indonesian Island of Jakarta has been "free"
of rabies for decades. I have read with concern reports of the
reemergence of rabies in Bali in the Indonesian press this week.
Australian physicians frequently see patients who have suffered dog
bites in Bali, and the requirement for post exposure prophylaxis is
often debated."

Since domestic dogs may have been exposed to rabid strays in spite of
being held in fenced premises, mass culling may include such dogs as
well. Alternatively, such dogs may be put under strict observation
(preferably caged, but at least leashed and muzzled) for 6 months.
Dogs which are known not to have been exposed should be vaccinated.
Mass vaccination of all domestic animals is to be considered.

Tests for rabies are classically applied to brain tissue, sampled
after death (and not in "brain fluid derived from anaesthetized
suspected animals," as erroneously stated in the Indonesian press!).
The rabies virus is particularly abundant in the thalamus, pons and
medulla. For the prescribed rabies testing technique, please refer to
chapter 2.1.13 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals 2008, available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.01.13_RABIES.pdf>.

A "1st occurrence of a listed disease in a zone or a compartment"
should, according to OIE's International Animal Health Code, be
immediately notified. - Mod.AS]
