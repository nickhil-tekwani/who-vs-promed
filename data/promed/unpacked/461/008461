One-third of New Zealand kiwifruit orchards has vine disease
-------------------------------------------------------------
A bacterial vine disease discovered in 2010 has now infected 1070 orchards representing almost a third of all orchards and just over 40 percent of all New Zealand kiwifruit acreage. It will likely spread to all other orchards in the country.

Of the infected orchards, 38 percent are green kiwifruit orchards, 51 percent gold orchards and the balance new varieties. Green kiwifruit hasn’t been hit as hard by PSA as gold kiwifruit. New Zealand gold production is expected to be down 32 percent this [2012] season, but green production should be down just 10 percent.

The Zespri Gold, also known as Hort16A, the dominant gold kiwifruit variety licensed by Zespri, is highly susceptible to PSA. “It is clear that in the future Hort16A in high-PSA environments is unsustainable,” Michele Hoard, Zespri, said. A new gold variety, the Gold3, which is much more resistant to PSA, is expected to eventually replace much of the lost acreage.

Independent review of kiwifruit imports
----------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has released the Terms of Reference of the independent review of the importation of kiwifruit pollen, plant material, fruit, nursery stock and horticultural equipment.

The review is a response to kiwifruit industry concerns about biosecurity measures and the kiwifruit vine disease _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa) first detected in New Zealand in November 2010.

The report will be provided by the end of April 2012 and its findings will be made public within an appropriate timeframe.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ was originally described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain. Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including animal and human activities), and infected plant material. Spread with infected fruit and/or pollen cannot be excluded until conclusive data become available.

Generally, disease management of bacterial diseases may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread, use of clean planting material and resistant crop varieties, but specific control strategies for kiwi canker are being developed. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used in Japan, but
resistant pathogen strains have emerged.

A recent outbreak in Italy (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207) affecting 25 percent of the Zespri Gold variety vines was found to be due to the emergence of a new, very virulent strain, Psa V. In New Zealand, 2 separate pathogen strains have been identified including the virulent Psa V. A less aggressive strain of Psa has been reported from Australia (ProMED-mail post 20110722.2206), details of strains identified in France, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal and suspected in China and Chile are not yet available.

According to recent research, Psa strains from China and New Zealand appear to be more similar to each other than to strains from Italy suggesting that the source of the NZ outbreak still remains to be clarified. Research at MAF has identified live Psa bacteria associated with pollen from closed kiwifruit flowers which was previously considered pathogen free for quarantine purposes. This has resulted in the review of biosecurity regulations in item 2 above.
