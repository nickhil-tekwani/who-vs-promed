[_P. halstedii_ causes downy mildew of sunflower (_Helianthus annuus_).
The fungus and sunflower are native to North America and a large number of
mildew races have been collected and characterized. The disease is
economically important in the United States and Europe. It was
subsequently reported in South Africa in 1993 and Italy in 1997. According
to Dr. A.P.K. Reddy, Directorate of Rice Research in Hyderabad, its
presence in India was first observed in Maharashtra in 1984 on the cultivar
'Morden' where it caused losses if 5-60% on 10 000 hectares. The pathogen
was introduced, presumably via infested seed. The disease has
subsequently spread to Karnataka and Andra Pradesh. As of 1994, it had not
been reported to occur in Punjab or Uttar Pradesh, but that may not be the
case today. Work is in progress to determine the number of races of the
pathogen; Race 1, the least virulent one, is common but others may be
present because there has been no attempt to prevent introduction of other
races. According to Thomas Gulya, USDA, ARS at North Dakota State
University, Fargo, there are at least 10 downy mildew biotypes or races in
North America, and perhaps the same in Europe. Seed companies treat seed
with fungicides to prevent spread of the disease. - Mod.DH
