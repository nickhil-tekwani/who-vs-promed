South Korea has confirmed the country's 1st outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu virus and has ramped up quarantine measures in response, agriculture ministry officials said on Friday [18 Nov 2016].

The outbreaks occurred at 2 poultry farms in the central and southern parts of the country after the ministry reported last week that the H5N6 strain of the virus had been found in the faeces of migratory birds. Cases of human infection from the H5N6 virus have previously been reported in places including China and Hong Kong, with the virus killing 6 people in China since April 2014, according to data from the South Korean ministry. The discoveries come as cases of the different H5N8 virus have been reported in several European countries including France.

South Korea's ministry said just over 62 000 birds had been culled to prevent the spread of the virus and that it had a issued a "movement control order" within a radius of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) around the farms.

"There are no indications the virus has spread more widely," a ministry official said. "South Korea's last bird flu outbreak occurred in March [2016], when the H5N8 strain was detected at a duck farm, leading to the slaughter of at least 11 000 birds."

South Korea confirmed the outbreak of bird flu cases at 2 poultry farms on Friday [18 Nov 2016] after a 3-month absence of the highly pathogenic aviation influenza (AI).

The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs said the 2 cases occurred at a chicken farm in Haenam, South Jeolla Province, and a duck farm in Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province, noting about 40 000 chickens and 22 000 ducks have been culled. The ministry said it put the farms under quarantine and banned stockbreeders from moving within a radius of 3 kilometers [about 2 miles] to prevent further spread of the virus. The animals were infected with H5N6 AI virus, the same one found in feces of wild migratory birds in the central region, the ministry said. South Korea has reported H5N1 and H5N8 AI viruses in the past, but this is the 1st to confirm H5N6 cases, which have been detected in China, Vietnam, Laos and Hong Kong.

The government said it has beefed up quarantine and disinfection measures and urged livestock raisers to refrain from visiting wintering sites of wild birds. The last bird flu outbreak in the country was detected in March [2016] in south of Seoul, leading to the slaughter of at least 11 000 birds.

[The HPAI (highly pathological avian influenza) H5N6 virus has been detected in poultry in China, Hong Kong, Laos, and Viet Nam since its initial emergence in 2014 as a reassortant of H5N1 and H6N6.

On Fri 11 Nov 2016, South Korea's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry and Food (MAFRA) published a press release, informing that H5N6-type HPAI virus was detected in wild birds' feces collected on 28 Oct 2016. Animal movement restrictions were applied around the site, and poultry farms were requested, nationwide, to raise their awareness to the hazard related to migratory birds (see, in Korean, at http://tinyurl.com/zlugq39).

According to FAO's EMPRES-i (Global Animal Diseases Information system) report, with map, of 16 Nov 2016, the detection of the virus was related to a common goldeneye duck (_Bucephala clangula_), and the location was Iksan, North Jeolla (Chollabuk-do) province. (see at http://empres-i.fao.org/empres-i/2/obd?idOutbreak=218813).

WHO published the following risk assessment in June 2016 (http://www.who.int/csr/don/08-june-2016-ah5n6-china/en/):
"Although influenza A(H5N6) has caused severe infection in humans, until now human infections with the virus seem to be sporadic with no ongoing human to human transmission and close contacts of the case remain healthy. However, the characterization of this virus is ongoing and its implication to the evolution and emergence of a pandemic strain is unknown. The risk of international disease spread is considered to be low at this point in time. WHO continues to assess the epidemiological situation and conduct further risk assessment based on the latest information." - Mod.AS
