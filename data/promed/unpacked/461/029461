Viet Nam: bird flu hits many provinces
--------------------------------------
Bird flu is now spreading rapidly in many provinces after a long
period of containment, the Department of Animal Health (DAH) said on
Mon 8 Feb 2010.

The provinces of Ca Mau, Ha Tinh, Dien Bien, Soc Trang, Kon Tum, and
Quang Tri have all reported cases of bird flu infection in the last 21 days.

Quang Tri is the latest province to confirm a bird flu outbreak in
Trieu Phong district. It has culled 400 birds in a farm and is
carrying out measures to prevent any further spread of the disease.

The DAH asked these provinces to step up their preventive measures
and vaccination campaigns, during the Tet holiday when demand for
poultry products increasing.

The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Cao Duc Phat, has
urged provinces and cities to oversee the slaughtering of cattle and
poultry in certain places and ban the sales of cattle and poultry
products of unknown origins.

In addition, the Ministries of Health, Industry and Trade, Transport
and Public Security will increase food hygiene and safety
inspections, conduct fact-finding tours of localities, especially big
cities, and strictly control transport of animals and animal products.
