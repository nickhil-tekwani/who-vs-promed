Pests and diseases threaten income of local farmers
---------------------------------------------------
Viral infections and pests on crops are threatening food production
and livelihood of farmers in parts of the Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo
regions. Job and crop losses are being recorded because the farmers
are reported to lack knowledge on pest control mechanisms.

The Grains Development Board [GDB] says farmers are recording
reduction in crop yield as result of viral and fungal diseases. The
deployment of specialists in agro-chemical application is critical to
supporting the farmers with disease control.

The Papaya and Mango Producers and Exporters Association is also
worried at the damage inflicted by fruit flies. The pest has caused
European importers banning produce from Ghana. They state the need for
farmers to practice good farm hygiene and invest in control, but an
integrated pest management program for West Africa is critical.

[It is unclear whether the responsibility of the Ghana Grains
Development Board above covers cereal grains only or also includes
legume and/or oil grain crops, and consequently it is unclear which
group of crops are being reported as damaged by diseases. In each
case, there is a large number of viral and fungal pathogens affecting
these important crop groups (see lists via link below). Reliable
diagnosis of any pathogens involved is paramount for designing
specific and effective disease management strategies.
