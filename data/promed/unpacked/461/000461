Good news for elk? Agency finds no further chronic wasting disease in
Star Valley
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This fall's [2008] alarming case of a diseased moose in western
Wyoming remains an "oddball" discovery, a state official said on
Monday [29 Dec 2008]. The oddness of the find could be good news --
at least in the short term -- for elk that congregate on Star Valley
feedgrounds near where the moose was euthanized.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department announced in October [2008] that
a moose was infected with chronic wasting disease when it was killed
just 13 miles from a state-run elk feedground. Before that discovery,
no animal in Wyoming west of the Wind River Mountains had ever tested
positive for chronic wasting disease. A Game and Fish Department
scientist acknowledged this fall that the discovery of the disease in
far western Wyoming was "alarming." But Terry Kreeger, veterinary
services supervisor for the agency, said on Monday that the disease
doesn't appear to be endemic to the area.

Officials have found no evidence the disease is present in other
animals in subsequent testing of deer and elk in that region, Kreeger
said. "It kind of lends credence to the theory that this was a
migratory moose that came from somewhere else," he said. One
possibility, and perhaps the most likely, is the moose was infected
with the disease elsewhere, possibly in Utah, and then wandered into
the valley. Kreeger warned, however, that such a theory is purely
speculation at this point.

Regardless, the apparent absence of the disease in other animals is
good news for western Wyoming elk, he said. But he also acknowledged
the slow but steady movement of the disease in that direction
suggests chronic wasting will probably get to the state's greater
Yellowstone elk and deer herds eventually. Chronic wasting disease
has been endemic to southeastern Wyoming for more than 20 years, and
it has been moving slowly north and west across the state ever since.
Michael Miller, a veterinarian and researcher with the Colorado
Division of Wildlife, describes the disease's movement as something
of a "slow-motion epidemic."

Lloyd Dorsey, a spokesman for the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, said
the fact the disease did not turn up in samples of deer and elk taken
this fall is good news, but he hopes the Game and Fish Department
will continue to augment its testing program in the coming year. "The
bad news is that they appear to expect chronic wasting disease to
move into the wild game populations of western Wyoming sooner or
later," Dorsey said. "We have good information now that should prompt
the phasing out of these artificial feedgrounds in order to protect
these treasured wildlife populations." The general belief among most
conservation groups and many wildlife biologists is that if chronic
wasting disease were to spread to feedground elk, the disease would
be transmitted through the populations at much higher rates than in
normal, "free-ranging" herds, because the animals are artificially
concentrated on feed lines in the winter.

Relatively little is understood about the spread of the disease,
however. In some free-ranging mule deer herds in Wyoming, where the
disease is endemic, nearly 1/3rd of the animals are infected with
chronic wasting disease, Kreeger said. In other herds, where the
disease has also long been present, the infection rates are much lower.

Game and Fish Department officials have repeatedly said it is the
agency's long-term goal to eventually phase out elk feedgrounds, but
that idea faces strong opposition from many ranchers and some
sportsmen's groups. Wintertime elk feedgrounds help reduce the
intermingling of elk and cattle. Elk in the greater Yellowstone
region are known to carry brucellosis, a disease that can infect
domestic cattle

Groups such as Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife oppose the phasing out
of elk feedgrounds because they believe it would lead to mass
starvation in the state's iconic elk herds and ultimately decimate
the animals' numbers [and loss of income from elk hunters - Mod.MHJ].

Kreeger said the Game and Fish Department's long-term research into
chronic wasting disease continues. Other agencies in the USA are
also conducting research on the disease. Until a great deal of data
are compiled and analyzed, however, predictions about the future
spread of the disease are speculative at best, he said.
