Undiagnosed viral disease in Jajpur district of Orissa state
------------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of a mysterious fever in Bari, Korei, Rasulpur and
Dharmasala blocks has led to fear of bird flu here. But district
health authorities say it is not bird flu but some other virus which
is yet to be diagnosed.

"Initially the patients complained to be suffering from high fever
and later severe pain following swelling of all joints of the body.
They [were] initially treated as malaria patients and then
antibiotics meant for typhoid [were] also given to the patients,"
said Mr Surendra Kumar Panda, a social worker of Rasulpur block.
Sources said the fever was 1st reported from Brahmabarada village
under Rasulpur block. Later it spread to residents of many gram
panchayats [an administrative group of villages] in Bari, Korei and
Dharmasala block of the district.

"It is viral fever and not bird flu. Earlier, we had collected blood
slides and serum from many patients and sent them to the state
laboratory for test," said doctors attending to patients at the block
health care centre.

"Medical teams are treating and collecting the blood sample. There is
no need of panic as the fever is a seasonal viral fever," said Mr
Raghunath Padhy, chief district medical officer of Jajpur.

[From the meagre description of the symptoms it is unlikely that this
outbreak is a consequene of avian influenza virus infection. The
symptoms, seasonal nature, and absence of fatalities are features
more compatible with an outbreak of the mosquito-borne chikungunya
virus infection. Further information on the outbreak and the results
of the diagnostic tests would be welcomed. - Mod.CP/MPP]

[There appears to be no connection between this outbreak and another,
which caused some deaths, in a different part of Orissa state in
August 2008 -- see ProMED ref. below.
