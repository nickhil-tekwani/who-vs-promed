Up to 250 000 people are at risk from cholera during Haiti's hurricane season, warns children's charity Plan International. More than 7000 have died since October 2010 after a similar outbreak spread through camps set up after the country's devastating 2010 earthquake.

Aid workers for Plan are launching awareness campaigns in schools and distributing hygiene kits in a bid to stem the number of cases. "With the arrival of the rainy season and contamination of water sources, the number of new cholera cases has more than quadrupled," says Plan's country director in Haiti, John Chalonor.

"Health experts warn that between 200 000 and 250 000 people could contract the disease in 2012, and the majority will be sick during the rainy and hurricane season from April to November [2012]. To reduce the impact and spread of the cholera outbreak, the government and all actors involved in the response should focus their attention on prevention," says Mr Chalonor.

"It's important that a national contingency plan be developed and cholera hotspots in Haiti be mapped."

[2] Cholera - Dominican Republic (Santiago Province)

At least 60 people were hospitalized due to suspected cholera in Tamboril, a town of Santiago de los Caballeros, which required the intervention of the Ministry of Public Health. Deputy Minister of Public Health Jose Rodriguez Aybar revealed that the area was taken over by the health department, which intensified prevention activities and education as well as the delivery of chlorine, since the water there is contaminated.

Many of the cases, according to Listin Diario, are people who were affected by the outbreak that started weeks ago. For his part, Director of Environmental Health Luis Emilio Feliz Roa said the main problem is water-handling in homes. For this reason, they are chlorinating water and distributing it in tankers and plastic tanks to the houses and making efforts with the electrical service company to ensure that the water supply will be available permanently.
