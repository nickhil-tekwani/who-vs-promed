The Pioneer Ridge Long-term Care Home in Thunder Bay has been closed
to all visitors following an outbreak of respiratory illness. So far
the exact nature of the sickness has not been identified but tests
for influenza have come back negative.
Admissions, discharges, and transfers from Pioneer Ridge have been
put on hold until the outbreak is dealt with.
Anyone with family members staying at Pioneer Ridge is urged to
telephone the nursing station and the staff will pass on messages.

[Thunder Bay is located in the province of Ontario on the shore of
Lake Superior. A map can be accessed at
.
After ruling out influenza virus infection, the next most likely
etiologic agent is human respiratory syncytial virus. Further
information and confirmation of diagnosis would be appreciated. -
