AFRICAN SWINE FEVER - NAMIBIA: CORRECTION

African swine fever - Namibia 980408222334
Date: April 13, 1998
From: Dr. R.D. Paskin <paskin@iafrica.com.na>

The African Swine Fever outbreak in Namibia was not in Namaqualand (part of
South Africa!) but on the outskirts of the central town of Otjiwarongo.
The virus is carried in the native warthog (which are not clinically
affected) and transmitted either via tampans or through the feeding of
warthog residues to domestic pigs.

[Thank you very much for this correction. The problem arose in my map (very
recently purchased) which shows Namaqualand still in Namibia. We will post
this correction. - DP
[However, it should be pointed out that our Managing Editor's 1997 American
Heritage College Dictionary (a real gem) says: "Namaqualand...a mostly arid
region of SW Africa divided by the Orange River into Great Namaqualand in
Namibia and Little Namaqualand in South Africa. More to the point we now
know that this outbreak occurred near Otjiwarongo. This thread is cut. -
