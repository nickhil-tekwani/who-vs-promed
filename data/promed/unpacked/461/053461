CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 20 Jul 2020, a total of 125 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Newport have been reported from 15 states.

State / Ill people

California / 3
Illinois / 1
Iowa / 3
Michigan / 12
Minnesota / 3
Missouri / 2
Montana / 11
North Carolina / 3
Ohio / 5
Oregon / 42
Tennessee / 1
Utah / 28
Washington / 1
Wisconsin / 1
Wyoming / 9
-----------------
Total / 125

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 19 Jun 2020 to 7 Jul 2020. Ill people range in age from 2 to 92 years, with a median age of 38. Of the ill people, 56% are female. Of 72 ill people with information available, 24 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2-4 weeks.

Investigation of the outbreak
--------------------------
On 10 Jul 2020, PulseNet identified an outbreak of 13 _Salmonella_ Newport infections in 3 states. Over the next 10 days, the outbreak rapidly grew to 125 infections in 15 states. State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before their illness started.

At this time, the investigation has not identified a specific food, grocery store, or restaurant as the source of this outbreak. CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.
