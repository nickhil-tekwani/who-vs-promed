Rabbit-fever concern has officials hopping
-----------------------------------------
New York City health officials are watching for a recurrence of a
potentially deadly disease transmitted by wild rabbits that hospitalized a
Staten Island resident this summer [2004]. After the 21-year-old woman was
diagnosed with pneumonia in mid-August 2004, Health Department officials
confirmed she had contracted tularemia, a rare disease caused by the
bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, which infects both animals and people.
The woman reportedly contracted the disease -- also known as rabbit fever
-- from her dog, after it captured an infected wild rabbit and then licked
her on the face. The woman survived, and no other cases have since been
reported.
Tularemia is on the list of potential biological agents that can be used by
terrorists. As a biological weapon, tularemia-causing bacteria could be
dispersed through the air and inhaled. Still, health officials say there is
no reason to believe the incident is linked to terrorism.
"This woman had [a] clear risk factor for naturally occurring tularemia,"
said Health Department epidemiologist Annie Fine. "We think it's an
isolated case, but we're keeping our eyes open." Despite the optimism, a
number of rabbits collected for data tested positive. However, health
officials deny there is any evidence of risk to human beings beyond this case.
There are only about 100 cases reported per year in the USA, usually less
than 2 percent of which are fatal. Since 1965, there have been 13 other
cases in the city; the last occurred in 1998. Cases have been reported in
every borough except the Bronx.
Humans can acquire the illness by coming into contact with the blood or
bodily fluids of infected animals, from the bite of a fly or tick that
carries blood from an infected animal, or from contaminated food or water.
Rabbits and rodents are the animals most likely to be infected. Signs and
symptoms vary but include fever, headache, chills, weakness, enlarged lymph
nodes, or, an ulcerated sore if bitten by an infected fly or tick.
Symptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure to the bacteria, but can
take as long as 14 days to manifest. The disease can be effectively treated
with antimicrobial agents.

[Although not thought of in association with an urban environment,
tularemia (a category B bio-terrorism disease) is occasionally acquired
naturally in New York. Primary pneumonia, due to _F. tularensis_, is
usually transmitted by aerosol as shown by the landscaper cases on Martha's
Vineyard, MA, USA. Upper respiratory infection manifesting as a pharyngitis
can occur with inoculation at that site. There is no information regarding
whether this young woman had a pharyngitis as well.
Despite a low inoculum needed to cause pneumonic tularemia, human-to-human
cases are not generally recognized. In pneumonic plague, however, this form
of transmission is of major concern.
The last case of reported infection in New York City was in the borough of
Brooklyn in 1998 (see below), a fatal case of pneumonia diagnosed by
positive blood culture after the person had died. Of note, this case was
reported to ProMED-mail by this moderator, which was his 1st contact with
this often real-time reporting system. - Mod.LL]
