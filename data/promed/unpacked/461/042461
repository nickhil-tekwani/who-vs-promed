The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated June 27, 2018:
- A total of 55 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 15 probable and 2 suspected.
- 2 new suspected cases, including 1 in Bikoro and 1 in Wangata.
- 4 samples were negative.
- 24 people have been cured of Ebola Virus Disease since the beginning of the epidemic.
- The last confirmed case dates back to June 6, 2018.
- All registered contacts are removed from the contact list.

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.
- Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

General Information
Due to the beginning of the final phase of the epidemic, our daily bulletins will be replaced by a weekly bulletin until the official declaration of the end of the Ebola outbreak. The next newsletter will be sent on Fri 6 Jul 2018.
The Press Team remains at your disposal for any questions or interview requests concerning the Ebola outbreak.

Special statement by the Minister of Health on the evolution of the 9th Ebola outbreak in the DRC
This Thu 28 Jun 2018, all people who have been in contact with the last confirmed case of Ebola have completed their 21-day follow-up period without showing signs of contamination. This is an important step in the response to the Ebola outbreak as it marks the beginning of the countdown to the announcement of the end of the 9th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The end of the epidemic will be declared when the country has spent 42 days, 2 incubation periods, without notifying a new confirmed case of Ebola.

This epidemic was the most complex and difficult epidemic the country had to deal with, mainly because it started in 2 rural areas at the same time and quickly reached a city of more than one million people. Inhabitants directly connected to Kinshasa, our capital where more than 12 million Congolese live. However, thanks to rapid national and international mobilization and the Government's leadership in coordinating the response, we managed to control this high-risk epidemic in just 7 weeks.

This is a real achievement of which we must all be proud. The key to our success is, 1st and foremost, the effectiveness of the national and international monitoring teams on the ground who have done, and continue to do, outstanding work. They managed to identify and follow 1706 contacts who were among the 1st to benefit from the new Ebola vaccine.

The use of vaccination in this response to Ebola has undeniably helped to break the chain of transmission and contain the virus faster. Since the start of the immunization microplan on [Mon 21 May 2018] 3330 people have been vaccinated and immunized against the Ebola virus. So far, the results of the vaccination have been conclusive because none of the vaccinated people developed the disease nor experienced major side effects.

Although we are heading towards the end of the epidemic, the work of the Ministry of Health does not stop there. Our priority now is to improve the resilience of the health system by starting with the expansion of our emergency operations centers in Mbandaka and Kinshasa. As Ebola is a virus whose natural reservoir is located in the equatorial forest, we must prepare for the 10th epidemic. In addition, because of the increasing mobility of the population, it is likely that other epidemics will occur in urban areas in the future. Therefore, we need to learn from this response and strengthen our health system so that it can detect and respond even more efficiently to the next epidemic.

[Although 2 or 3 new suspected cases are reported each day, the outbreak does appear to be on the verge of being over. This is a time the health care community and governmental agencies should feel proud of their accomplishment. Having avoided a major outbreak in an urban area in a remote location is a real testimony to their dedication. Application of what was learned in the West African outbreak certainly played an important role. Furthermore, there is now a vaccine available that demonstrated no adverse effects and appears to have been highly effective. Response to the DRC outbreak demonstrates the importance of having experienced personnel at the ready to respond to outbreaks. When an outbreak is over and no emergencies are in view, it is not the time to become complacent and make cuts in support, both of personnel and funding. Now that the health infrastructure in some locations in the DRC is built up, it must be maintained. There is little doubt new outbreaks will occur not only of Ebola but also other unanticipated agents. Ebola outbreaks also have highlighted the need for basic and applied research. The VSV-ZEBOV vaccine would not have been developed without strong research programs. - Mod.LK]

Monitoring ends for remaining contacts of DRC's last confirmed Ebola case
The Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC's) health ministry said today [Thu 28 Jun 2018] that all contacts of the last confirmed case have completed their 21-day monitoring periods with none showing any signs of illness, marking the beginning of the countdown to the end of the nation's 9th Ebola outbreak. The end of the epidemic will be declared if a total of 42 days pass -- 2 incubation periods -- without any new confirmed Ebola cases.

In a statement, health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, said the keys to success have been national and international surveillance teams on the ground, which have identified and tracked 1706 contacts. He also credited the use of the VSV-EBOV vaccine, which has been given to 3330 people.

Meanwhile, outbreak responders continue to look for potential cases, and the ministry today [Thu 28 Jun 2018] reported 2 new suspected cases, one in the remote Bikoro location and one in Wangata health zone, which includes Mbandaka, the provincial capital. Tests on 4 earlier suspected cases were negative, putting the outbreak total at 55 cases, including 38 confirmed, 15 probable, and 2 suspected illnesses. The number of deaths remained at 29.

Officials said with the final phase of the epidemic now under way, it will replace daily updates with weekly updates, with the next one due out on [Fri 6 Jul 2018].

- 29 Jun 2018. Congo completes surveillance of Ebola contacts, no new cases

Congo completes surveillance of Ebola contacts, no new cases.
Democratic Republic of Congo moved closer to declaring its Ebola outbreak over when the health ministry said it had completed surveillance of the last people who came into contact with patients and had not found any new cases.

If no further cases of the deadly disease are confirmed after one more 3-week incubation period, Congo will be able to officially declare an end to the outbreak, which is believed to have killed 29 people since April [2018].

Health officials have traced contacts and deployed an experimental vaccine in northwestern Congo to head off what they feared could have become a wider contagion after the virus spread to Mbandaka, a river port city of more than one million people.

The latest outbreak has been seen as a test of global health authorities' ability to counter Ebola after being criticized for responding too slowly to an epidemic in West Africa from 2013--2016 that killed more than 11 000 people.

More than 3300 people have received Merck's experimental vaccine and health workers kept a watch on 1706 people who came into contact with Ebola patients, officials said.

"The use of vaccination in this Ebola response has been a game-changer as it allowed us to break the chain of transmission and contain the virus more quickly," the health ministry said in a statement on [Thu 28 Jun 2018].

"So far, the results of the vaccination have been promising as none of the individuals who were vaccinated developed the disease nor experienced major side effects," it added.
