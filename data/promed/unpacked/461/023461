6 Canadians infected with malaria after visiting the Dominican Republic
--------------------------------------------------
Canadians travelling to the Dominican Republic will be banned from donating
blood for 6 months after they've returned, Canadian Blood Services said on
Wednesday. The decision comes after 6 Canadians contracted malaria after
going to the Caribbean nation since October 2004, said the organization
that manages the country's blood supply. "Because of recent reports of
malaria cases and the fact that the Dominican Republic is a popular
destination for many vacationing Canadians, we have decided to add this
security measure to help protect the blood supply," said Dr Graham Sher,
chief executive officer of the organization.
Canadian Blood Services also wants any recent blood donors who were in the
Dominican Republic since 1 Oct 2004 to contact them at 1-888-236-6283 so
their files can be updated.
One of the people that contracted the tropical disease is on life support
in a hospital in Toronto, the Toronto Star reported. 3 others from Toronto
have been released from hospital, but 2 travellers from British Columbia
are in serious condition.
US health officials have reported 2 cases of malaria in travellers to the
Dominican Republic, while 8 Europeans have contracted the disease. Take
antimalarial pills, the agency advises. The flu-like illness is most
commonly transmitted to people through infected mosquitoes. In a travel
advisory issued last week, the Public Health Agency of Canada said it is
monitoring the reports. It recommends travellers wear light-coloured,
long-sleeved shirts and pants, and use insect repellent with DEET and take
antimalarial medications while visiting countries where malaria is present.
The advisory says rural areas in the Dominican Republic, especially those
bordering Haiti, are the highest risk for malaria. Resorts on the island
are generally not at risk, it says. Travellers are urged to see their
doctor if they develop a fever within 3 months of returning.

[There is a recommendation of malaria prophylaxis for travelers to La
Altagracia and Duarte provinces of the Dominican Republic. If travelers are
not sure of their precise destination, chloroquine should be prescribed.
Chloroquine has a good safety profile, and in the present situation
travelers needs protection. The fact that malaria has been reported only in
travelers returning from these 2 provinces probably says more about the
destinations visited than about the distribution of risk of malaria in the
Dominican Republic. ProMED would still be happy to post an assessment of
the outbreak by the Dominican health authorities. - Mod.EP]
