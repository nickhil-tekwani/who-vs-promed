The recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Kerala has claimed the lives of 4705 head of cattle across the state and affected 51 581 head since August last year [2013], the Assembly has been informed.

Replying to a submission by M.P. Vincent in the Assembly on Monday [6 Jan 2014], Minister for Animal Husbandry K.P. Mohanan said preventive measures had been stepped up to arrest the spread of the disease.

Claiming that the FMD outbreak was now under control, he said: "Ring vaccination is being carried out in the areas around the affected locations, and diseased animals are being treated free of cost. Adequate funds have been sanctioned for procurement of medicines and disinfectants at the district level. Experts from the Southern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Bangalore and the All India Coordinated Research Project on FMD have confirmed that the O strain of the virus is responsible for the outbreak in Kerala."

The Minister said the importation of cattle from neighbouring states had been temporarily banned to prevent the spread of the disease.

Earlier, moving the submission, Mr. Vincent said the FMD outbreak was threatening to cripple the dairy sector in the state. "The 40 per cent loss in milk production has created a crisis for dairy farmers. The disease has affected animals in the Thrissur zoo and threatens wildlife," he said.

Acknowledging the steps taken by the government to contain the disease, Mr. Vincent called for the introduction of more powerful vaccines and disease-resistant hybrid cows. He also stressed the need for more vigilance at border check posts.

Pointing out that the vaccines used for immunisation of cattle were not effective, former Minister C. Divakaran called for a system to monitor the potency of vaccines.

[The number of clinical FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] cases in Kerala is to be viewed as an estimate; accuracy of death toll is expected to be higher than that of counted diseased animals. Generally, the death rate in FMD-infected adult cattle is up to 2 percent, but in offspring, may reach 50 percent and higher. According to an earlier media report from Kerala, about half of the deaths involved calves (20131215.2117504).

The continuing epizootic in 4 of India's centre-south states (Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh) reportedly started in August 2013. According to media-derived reports and to an FAO/EUFMD assessment, it has been caused by a 2013 strain of the Ind2001 lineage FMD virus. As indicated in earlier ProMED commentaries and now pointed out in Kerala's Assembly discussion ("need for more powerful vaccines"), the efficacy of currently applied vaccines against the said strain is in need of science-based assessment (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.05_FMD.pdf, pp 18-19).

India's FMD situation has been described on page 8 of the EUFMD global monthly report (October 2013), including a map, at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/October_2013_FMD_global_report_DRAFT.pdf.

In case a new FMD virus strain is suspected to be circulating in India, an immediate notification to the OIE is prescribed.

Until India's 2013 annual OIE report with the detailed required information becomes available, an interim official report from India's central authorities would be helpful. Ideally, it would cover disease distribution, number of outbreaks, cases and mortalities, population data (ages, breeds, production lines dairy/beef), control measures applied/planned, vaccination coverage, and vaccine-strains used. - Mod.AS
