FDA warns about lettuce after illness
----------------------
US health officials Monday warned Americans not to eat Spokane Produce brand
romaine lettuce after the product was associated with an _E. coli__ O157:H7
outbreak at a cheerleading camp in Washington state.
In mid-July [2002], 29 people at the camp had confirmed cases of the_E.
coli_ strain, the Food and Drug Administration said. A salad made with the
lettuce is considered a "primary source" of the _E. coli_, FDA spokeswoman
Ruth Welch said.
"Consumers should ask at the place of purchase in order to assure that they
do not consume Spokane Produce brand romaine lettuce until this health
emergency is resolved," the FDA said in a statement.
The lettuce, which is sold under several brand names, was packaged in
5-pound bags and distributed by Food Services of America, the FDA said. It
also may be sold at stores in various-sized packages, the agency said. "FDA
urges consumers to throw out this product," an agency statement said.
Welch said investigations were ongoing and officials were unsure where the
lettuce had been distributed. In the past, Food Services of America had
distributed the product to restaurants and institutions in Idaho, Montana
and Oregon, the FDA said.
Gary Odegard, a spokesman for Food Services of America, said the company had
stopped distributing the lettuce while the investigation continued. "We are
not distributing any more, but we don't know yet if the product is tainted
at all," he said.

[The initial posting of this outbreak in Washington State on ProMED-mail was
on 19 Jul 2002 in the midst of the ConAgra ground beef recall -- see ref.
below. The FDA has found that the source may have been lettuce instead of
ground beef, although the source of the lettuce contamination is at this
point unknown. The contamination could have occurred anywhere in the
distribution process, from the growing field to the site of the picnic
itself. - Mod.LL]
