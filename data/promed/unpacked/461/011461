A colony of monkeys was shot dead at a British zoo after keepers discovered
they carried a virus potentially fatal to humans, zoo staff said on
Saturday. Six marksmen armed with .22 silenced rifles were called in on
Friday to shoot 215 Rhesus Macaque monkeys at Woburn Safari Park in central
England after routine medical tests showed 11 were infected with the Simian
Herpes B virus. Staff at the popular zoo said they learned of the virus in
the monkey population from the results of routine screenings.
"We consulted the authorities including the Health and Safety Executive and
the zoo licensing authority and it was agreed from a public and staff point
of view we had no alternative but to humanely cull the entire population,"
the zoo's chief executive Chris Webster said. Britain's health authorities
said they had upgraded the seriousness of the disease last year to the same
level as hemorrhagic fevers Ebola and Lassa after a boy in the United
States died when an infected monkey spat at him.
"The virus is endemic in monkeys. We are not going to be starting a
witch-hunt at zoos. Our responsibility is to let zoos or laboratories who
find this virus know what steps to take," a Health and Safety Executive
(HSE) spokeswoman told Reuters. Zoos or safari parks known to have infected
monkeys can kill them or keep them in cages with no possibility of human
contact. "There have been no known human cases in the UK in the last 25
years," the HSE spokeswoman said. The virus has caused widespread concern
among health officials in the United States where Macaques continue to be
kept as pets.
The U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says on its
website the B-virus is highly prevalent -- (80-90 percent) -- in adult
Macaques and may be fatal to humans, who usually catch it from Macaque
bites or scratches. But it said the disease is rare in humans, with fewer
than 40 cases reported between 1933 and 1994. "However, the consequences of
symptomatic infection may be severe," it stressed. "Of 24 known symptomatic
patients whose cases were reviewed in 1992, 19 (79 percent) died."

[Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (herpesvirus simiae or B-virus) must be
considered in bites, scratches, and saliva from Asiatic macaques,
especially from the rhesus monkey, _M. mulatta_. Although cercopithecine
herpesvirus 1 is common in all macaque species, in every documented human
infection in which the exposure could be traced to a macaque or to macaque
tissues, patients had exposure to rhesus monkeys, _M. mulatta_. It is
hypothesized that there are distinct genotypes of cercopithecine
herpesvirus 1, and that the isolates from different species vary in their
pathogenicity for humans. It would be interesting to learn whether the
animals killed were exclusively rhesus monkeys or animals exposed to rhesus
monkeys. If not, the risk of transmission to humans would be small. The
species of the primates is not stated in the above news story.
Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 has not been isolated from apes. -Man. Ed. DS
