[Minks are a closely related species to ferrets.
A pet ferret was found to have H1N1 in Oregon
earlier this week. However, in this case we have
a different influenza strain in a commercial
farming operation of minks. H3N2 infections in
minks have been known since at least the mid-1980s.

H3N2 influenza viruses have been played a
prominent role in the panolopy of influenza
viruses in both humans and animals which get hold
of our attention. The 1968 Hong Kong influenza in
humans was an H3N2, swine in Europe have been
infected for decades with an H3N2, and an H3N2
swine strain became a prominent virus in the
North American swine population in 1998. H3N2 has
been isolated from turkeys in USA. An H3N2 strain
is part of the current 2009-2010 vaccine for
seasonal flu in humans, and a new H3N2 variant
not included in the vaccine has emerged about the
same time as the novel, pandemic H1N1 last spring.

As is the case with H1N1, it is critically
important to do surveillance in both the affected
animal population and people to try as best we
can to establish time ordering of events and the
directionality of transmission. The key to this
is comprehensive, integrated outbreak
investigations in geographically co-located animal and human subpopulations.
