--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2017, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reported 2 human _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis infections in persons with exposure to pet guinea pigs. The guinea pigs had been purchased from 2 separate pet stores, belonging to a single chain, and supplied by a common distributor located in California. Clinical isolates were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), suggesting the infections were related. This PFGE pattern was previously seen in a 2010 multistate outbreak linked to contact with pet guinea pigs (1). An investigation was initiated to determine the number of patients affected and to identify the source of human illnesses.

A case was defined as _Salmonella_ Enteritidis infection with a clinical isolate having an identical PFGE pattern to those from the Colorado isolates and closely related to a guinea pig isolate by whole genome sequencing (WGS), and with onset of clinical signs on or after 1 Jan 2015. State health departments were asked to review recent _S._ Enteritidis illness records for patient exposure to guinea pigs. In addition, the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories was queried for isolates from guinea pigs that matched the outbreak strain. All isolates underwent WGS using high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. An isolate from the 2010 outbreak was sequenced for comparison. Guinea pig purchase invoices were used to trace guinea pigs with an epidemiologic link to human illness back to the distributor of origin.

Nine cases in humans were identified from 8 states, including 2 cases in Colorado and one each in Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Vermont, and Virginia. 5 of 8 patients reported exposure to guinea pigs. Onset dates ranged from 15 Jul 2015 to 15 Dec 2017. The median patient age was 12 years (range = 1-70 years). 5 patients were female. One patient was hospitalized, and no deaths were reported. 6 isolates submitted to veterinary diagnostic laboratories from ill guinea pigs and one isolate from a patient's guinea pig were sequenced and found to be closely related to the outbreak strain. Including the 2010 isolate tested for comparison, all isolates were within 38 SNPs by WGS.

Traceback information was available for 4 guinea pigs purchased from 2 large pet store chains (Figure [for figure, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). The 2 distributors supplying guinea pigs to pet stores during this outbreak received guinea pigs from multiple wholesalers; however, a single common wholesaler was mentioned by both. This wholesaler also supplied guinea pigs that were associated with cases during the 2010 outbreak.

Following the 2010 outbreak, recommendations including environmental testing were made to the wholesaler regarding _Salmonella_ prevention; however, the actions were not implemented. Failure to implement recommended prevention measures might have contributed to recurrence of the outbreak. To enhance compliance with recommendations made in this outbreak, CDC developed a document containing prevention measures aimed at reducing the prevalence of _Salmonella_ in guinea pig colonies intended for use in the pet industry. Content was also posted on the CDC website to increase consumer awareness of risk for _Salmonella_ infection linked to pet guinea pigs. Recommendations to pet owners during this outbreak focused on proper hand hygiene. Recommendations to distributors and wholesalers included routine monitoring of guinea pigs for _Salmonella_ through diagnostic testing, recordkeeping to aid in traceback, and evaluating husbandry and environmental sanitation practices of guinea pig breeders to reduce the prevalence of _Salmonella_ and other zoonotic diseases of concern to the pet industry (2).

[The guinea pig, _Cavia porcellus_, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig), also called the cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family _Caviidae_. Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family, nor are they from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggested they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as _C. aperea_, _C. fulgida_, or _C. tschudii_ and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild.

The animals were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cows. Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried, broiled, or roasted, and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume 'sopa' or 'locro de cuy', a soup dish. 'Pachamanca' or 'huatia', a process similar to barbecuing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings.

As early as 1927, if not earlier, salmonellosis has been recognized to cause infection in guinea pigs (1). Although some infections have been related to common serotypes of _S. enterica_ such as Enteritidis and Typhimurium, more unusual serotypes have been described including Amager (2), Narashino (3), and Limete (4). Salmonellosis spread from guinea pigs to humans is certainly recognized (5, 6) but the moderator could not find English language reports of spread from guinea pig as a foodstuff. It is possible that contamination of the rodent occurred during processing and did not originate in the guinea pig(s) in vivo as has occurred with outbreaks of salmonellosis from fish (see ProMED-mail Salmonellosis, serotype Paratyphi B - USA: raw tuna 20100428.1371).

"Abstract
---------
_Salmonella_ outbreaks have been linked to a wide variety of foods, including recent nationwide outbreaks. Guinea pig (_Cavia porcellus_), also known as cuy or cobayo, has long been a popular delicacy and ceremonial food in the Andean region in South America. This case report describes 3 family outbreaks of non-typhoidal salmonellosis, each occurring after a meal of guinea pigs. We believe this case report is the 1st to describe a probable association between the consumption of guinea pig meat and human salmonellosis. Physicians should be aware of the association of _Salmonella_ and the consumption of guinea pigs, given the increasing immigration of people from the Andean region of South America and the increasing travel to this region."
