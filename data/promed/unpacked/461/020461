Re: Anthrax, human, camel - Afghanistan: (Nimroz), conf. 20080113.0166
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This morning (14 Jan 2008), I was able to meet with the General
President of The Directorate of Animal Health & Production
[Afghanistan], Dr Azizullah Osmani.
According to Dr Osmani, 2 veterinarians were sent from the Central
Veterinary Research & Diagnostic Laboratory (CVDRL), Kabul to
investigate the suspected outbreak of anthrax, following the reports
of human deaths, which were suspected to have been linked to the
consumption of meat from a camel that had died suddenly in a village
in Nimroz province.
By the time these veterinarians reached the village where the
suspected anthrax outbreak had occurred the remains of the camel
implicated in this case, had been buried. Some exhumed remains (a
piece of meat and some dried blood) were collected and brought back
to Kabul for laboratory examination. Direct smears were made and
stained with methylene blue; a culture was attempted from a swab
taken from the meat and dried blood (? re-suspended). Some suspected
infected material was injected into 2 mice.
The direct smears made from the meat and dried blood revealed no
evidence of _Bacillus anthracis_. Similarly no _B. anthracis_ was
detected from culture plates. Of the 2 mice, which were injected one
died and one survives to date. A microscopic examination of a direct
smear of blood stained with methylene blue. No evidence of _B.
anthracis_ was found. The dead mouse is suspected to have died from
infection with unknown saprophytes, which may have contaminated the
injected specimen, which was partially decomposed and heavily
contaminated with soil.
Dr Osmani is not certain about the quality of the specimens collected
as the meat specimen, in particular, had already partially decomposed
and was contaminated. However, the laboratory tests that were carried
out failed to reveal any evidence of _B. anthracis_. The
veterinarians who investigated the case reported that the camel had
been suffering from a chronic, deep-seated, pus filled abscess on one
of its hind legs, prior to its death. It seems possible that the
death of the camel was not as "acute" as may have been suggested
initially, but that it had been deteriorating in condition over some
period of time prior to its death. One other camel, which was kept
alongside the camel which died, at the same household, and which has
been grazing and browsing in exactly the same area, remains well and
has shown no signs of illness to date.
Samples, collected by the Ministry of Public Health officials, from
human cases were taken to Kabul for laboratory examination. It has
been said (2nd hand information) that preliminary tests at the MoPH
[Ministry of Public Health] laboratory were thought to have been
positive for a "bacillus like organism." Duplicate samples have been
forwarded to a laboratory in the US [Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention-CDC] for further examination.

[Clearly the ball is now in the CDC court. As a decomposed camel
carcass is unlikely to have any viable and capsulated organisms it is
not altogether surprising that the smears were negative. And
recovering viable spores from a carcass can take a high level of
skill, something I had not appreciated when I was younger. On the
other hand, the mice suggest that _B. anthracis_ was not present.
Plus the history of this dead camel is not typical of anthrax. To
remind readers, 2 men tried to sell a sick camel, and when nobody
bought the camel, the men instead killed it and distributed the meat
to needy families, having kept some back for themselves. The 2 men
died, as did 6 others, and a further 10 "fell sick."
We must contain our impatience and wait to hear what CDC finds.
However I have heard today (Monday, 14th January) from Alex
Hoffmaster, Zoonoses & Select Agent Laboratory, CDC that "we have not
received any Bacillus like organisms from Afghanistan. And I don't
think anyone in our group has been contacted about it."
Our thanks to John for this latest information. Nothing is ever as
simple as it appears at first. - Mod.MHJ]
