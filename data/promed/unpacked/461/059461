An outbreak of legionellosis (with clinical cases
both of Pontiac Fever and full-fledged
Legionnaire's disease) associated with use of a
spa pool (otherwise known as Jacuzzi or
whirlpool) at a local leisure club is being
investigated in northeast England, UK. The
outbreak was initially detected when 2 groups of
2 and 3 patients reported being ill with flu-like
symptoms and a common link to the leisure club to
the local authorities. These initial cases were
reported to the health authorities (Health
Protection Agency, <http://www.hpa.org.uk>) on 21 Aug 2006.
The subsequent investigation and local media
coverage has led to continuing reports of
flu-like illness (including fever, muscle pain,
headaches and nausea) to local public health
authorities from the leisure club, local
authorities and from patients directly. Patients
who had been admitted to hospital with pneumonia have also been identified.
Investigations have so far discovered 2 confirmed
cases of Legionnaires' disease, 3 confirmed cases
of Pontiac fever and a further 113 probable cases
of Pontiac fever in patients who have symptoms
and exposure matching that of the confirmed cases
[for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]. The 2
patients with confirmed Legionnaires' disease
were hospitalized for 4 and 11 days; neither
required intensive care. Patients� ages range
between 18 and 85 years old. All confirmed cases
have been in men. Among the probable cases, there
is an 40:60 male:female ratio. There have been no
fatalities associated with this outbreak.
The incubation period in the Pontiac Fever cases
has been between 24 and 48 hours, with symptoms
lasting 3 to 5 days. Generally, Legionnaire's
disease has a longer incubation period although
for non-pneumonic legionellosis, this is not
thought to be the case. Cases of Legionnaires'
disease involved an incubation period of
approximately 4 days, although exact times are
difficult to determine due to repeated exposures at the spa pool.
A positive urinary antigen test or positive
initial serology for _Legionella_ was required
for confirmation of cases. Typing is available
for 5 patients, all of which were _Legionella
pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Acute and convalescent
serology is being undertaken for a small sample of the probable cases.
Case definitions used
-----------
Legionnaires� disease -- a clinical diagnosis of
pneumonia with laboratory evidence of the
presence of _L. pneumophila_ urinary antigen, or
seroconversion or positive culture within 2-10
days of using the wet side facilities at the
leisure club during a set time period.
Pontiac fever -- A flu-like illness without
evidence of pneumonia within 4 days of using the
wet side facilities at the leisure club during a set time period.
Probable Pontiac fever cases -- a combination of
flu-like symptoms (fever, headache, muscle pain
+/- nausea) plus exposure at the spa pool (which
had tested positive for _Legionella pneumophila_)
over a 12-day period in mid-Aug 2006.
Initial cases were positive for _Legionella_ on
urinary antigen detection and subsequent cases
met the same symptom / exposure criteria as the confirmed cases.
Environmental investigations
--------------------
Investigations revealed that patients with
reported cases had been in the spa pool (or very
close to it) over a period of at least 12 days.
Investigations into exact exposures are ongoing.
There were no reports of illness in members who
had used other facilities in the club.
Water samples from the spa pool, the return flow
from the massage jets and a short section of
segmented pipe connected to mains water used to
fill the pool have all tested positive for
_Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Samples
were also taken from the main swimming pool,
shower in the changing rooms, and the poolside
shower and the condensate from the steam room.
None of these have tested positive.
Control measures
------------
The spa pool was voluntarily closed by the club
when informed of the positive urinary antigen in
one of the initial cases and the increasing
numbers of club members reporting symptoms. Plans
are in place for a cohort study to provide
further epidemiological information on the outbreak.
Spa pools previously associated with
legionellosis in Europe Spa pools have been
associated in legionellosis outbreaks across
Europe [2-6]. Health authorities across Europe
have produced guidelines for the maintenance and
design of spa/whirlpools in order to reduce the
risk of these types of incidents [7,8].
