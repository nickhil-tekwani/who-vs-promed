Rabies Scare Stops PetSmart Adoptions
---------------------------------------------
Pet adoptions at 22 PetSmart stores across Maryland and Virginia have been
suspended after a kitten from the company's Greenbelt store tested positive
for rabies.
The kitten was part of a litter of 6, and all 6 have been euthanized.
Store manager John Marsiglia says the kittens had been examined by a
veterinarian and neutered before they were brought to the store last month
[May 2006]. The kittens were supplied by Last Chance Animal Rescue of
Brandywine.
The director of the pet adoption group, Cindy Sharpley, says it has never
had a similar problem in 23 000 pet adoptions over the past 5 years.
The store learned the kitten was infected last week when the owner asked to
return it because it was lurching and unsteady. Sharpley says the kitten
attacked her hand.
Two people have been treated for rabies from the incident.

[This article does not tell us how old the kittens were or what the
background of the kittens was. Were they raised by an owner or a mill?
Early signs of rabies may not have been recognized in the kittens if they
were very young.
The 2 people that were treated were presumably given post exposure
prophylaxis. - Mod.TG]
