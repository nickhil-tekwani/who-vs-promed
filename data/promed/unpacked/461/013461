Dead squirrel in park tests positive for plague
-----------------------------------------------
There's a serious health warning for those heading outdoors this weekend.
San Luis Obispo County Public Health confirmed that a dead squirrel tested
positive for plague. It's likely others are infected with the potentially
deadly disease.
A plea today to people heading to parks, beaches, or anywhere wild rodents
roam: don't feed the animals. "Just about everybody who comes here, they
feed them peanuts, cat food," says a Morro Bay resident. He's seen people
feeding squirrels here all the time, but San Luis Obispo County health
officers hope that will change now that it could be life threatening.
"That dead rodent could've passed it on via the flea to another rodent,"
says Dr. Frank Mazzoni, a family practitioner. The plague is an infectious
bacterial disease spread by rodents and their fleas. Humans can contract
the disease if exposed to infected fleas or if they handle infected
animals, which includes feeding them.
Other residents know all too well how dangerously close these rodents get.
"I know the bravery of these things; it would be nothing for someone to get
bit," says a resident. "They walk right up to you, no fear of man whatsoever."
Health officers are not releasing the name of the Morro Bay park where the
infected squirrel was found, but they're warning everyone to avoid contact
with wild rodents and walking near their burrows. They also advise leaving
your pets at home during outings and warn that cats are highly susceptible
to plague and can spread the disease to humans.
Dr. Mazzoni adds the discovery is reason for concern, but not panic. "It
can be a relatively serious infection, but the risk of developing it is
relatively low."
Symptoms of plague include high fever, chills, headaches, and swollen
glands. Individuals who develop these symptoms should seek immediate
medical attention. If caught early, plague is treatable with antibiotics;
if untreated, it can be deadly. In the last 36 years, 39 human cases of the
plague have been confirmed in California.
