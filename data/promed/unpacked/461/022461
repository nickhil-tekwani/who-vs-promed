Re: Norovirus outbreak in oysters in Louisiana
---------------------------------------
In this outbreak norovirus was suspected on the basis of incubation period, symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, no fever...) and further confirmed by identification of norovirus in stools of cases. No attempt was made to identify norovirus in oysters. Apparently the process of identifying norovirus in oysters, and food in general is complicated. It was done in the past at a FDA lab on the Gulf coast but it is not done routinely. In such a limited outbreak, the assumption is that the source is an oyster collector or another fisher that relieved himself in the water or dumped the "relief" bucket overboard.

An interesting observation in this outbreak is that those who ate broiled oysters also got sick although the odds ratios were much lower than for those who ate raw oysters. Broiled oyster meat was probably not brought to a sufficient temp to inactivate all viruses

Enjoying raw oysters is well worth the small risk of diarrhea.

[ProMED-mail thanks Raoult Ratard for this prompt and informative response to the 'smoking oyster' query posed in the preceding post. Nonetheless readers should make up their own mind about the extent of culinary preparation of oysters necessary prior to their consumption.- Mod.CP
