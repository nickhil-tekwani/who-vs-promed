----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have just read your recent post regarding theileriosis in Australia. Our current problem is associated with strains of the _Theileria orientalis_ group, in particular _T._ ikeda, and _T._ chitose. In Australia, we do not have _T. parva_ or _T. annulata_.

_T. ikeda_ causes increased RBC [red blood cell] destruction resulting in anaemia in naive animals. Typically the syndromes we see are in cattle introduced to endemic areas, particularly along the NSW north coast, or in endemic herds, where disease in young calves is the primary complaint.
