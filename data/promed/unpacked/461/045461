Pests, diseases wreak havoc on paddy crop
-----------------------------------------
As the farmers in Kalahandi district are readying to harvest winter
paddy, a depleted production haunts them due to diseases and pest
attack. BPH [brown planthopper] and bug pest attack along with
diseases like sheath blight and sheath rot severely damaged paddy
crops during pre-harvesting period. The worst affected blocks are in
Dharamgarh sub-division.

According to report of Agriculture Department, 13 364 hectares [approx
33 000 acres] under paddy crop in the district were affected due to
moisture-stress condition in the initial stages and later during the
pre-harvest period more than 33 633 hectares were affected by diseases
and pests. Besides winter paddy, autumn paddy was also affected due to
pest attack and diseases in some areas. Crop cutting done in different
blocks of Dharamgarh sub-division revealed more than 50 percent crop
loss.

The crop loss due to pest attack and diseases was the main topic of
discussion in the District Natural Calamity Committee meeting.
Expressing concern over the situation, members said farmers need to be
adequately compensated and assisted to overcome the loss. It was
decided to go for extensive crop cutting to ascertain the total crop
loss.

[Sheath blight of rice is caused by the fungus _Thanatephorus
cucumeris_. Symptoms include expanding lesions on sheaths of leaves
near the water line and infection spreads rapidly in the field. Yield
losses of up to 50 percent are reported due to poorly filled grain
heads and reduced plant vigour. Fungal sclerotia survive for long
periods in the soil and float to the surface of flooded rice fields
causing infection in the next crop. Some weed hosts can serve as
pathogen reservoirs. No reliable source of genetic host resistance has
been identified so far. Disease management includes cultural and
phytosanitary techniques and foliar fungicides.

Sheath rot of rice is caused by the fungus _Sarocladium oryzae_, which
can also affect maize, pearl millet, sorghum, and a range of grasses.
It causes reddish-brown discolouration of the flag leaf sheath and
distortion of panicles. Panicles may fail to emerge fully and grain
may not fill. Yield losses of up to 85 percent have been reported.
Disease management as for sheath blight above.

The brown rice planthopper (BPH; _Nilaparvata lugens_) is a vector of
several very rice viruses, including _Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV)
and _Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV), which cause severe yield losses.
The insects are also a serious pest on their own causing yellowing,
browning, and drying of plants ('hopper burn'). Leaves affected by BPH
suffer small injuries exposing the plant to fungal and bacterial
infections.
