Brazil: hantavirus case confirmed in Amazonas
---------------------------------------------
The secretary of health of the state, Leny Passos, received representatives
of the National Epidemiology Center of the National Health Foundation
(Funasa). This group came to Manaus to begin an epidemiological
investigation of the first case of cardiopulmonary syndrome caused by
hantavirus infection in Amazonas, which was reported by the Health
Surveillance Department of the State Health Secretariat (Susam) after the
diagnosis was confirmed by the Evandro Chagas Institute in April 2003.
