A Mililani (Oahu) woman "tested positive" for dengue. The test may be a
false positive. No cases of dengue have originated from Hawaii since
1947(although cases are imported: seven in 1997, none so far this year);
however, the woman had not traveled to areas of dengue-risk outside the
state. Contact listed as Patrick Johnston 808-586-4586.

[Because of the paucity of information, I can't get too excited about this
and I hope no one else does. If anyone has any information about this case
(of what? febrile illness with headache?), please let us know. - Mod.CHC]
