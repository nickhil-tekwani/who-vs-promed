China's Agriculture Ministry confirms new outbreak of bird flu
--------------------------------------------------------------
China's agriculture ministry has confirmed a new outbreak of avian influenza
in the north western Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, according to a
government statement. The outbreak occurred in Zhongwei city in Ningxia, the
ministry stated on its website [on 1 Jul]. The national avian influenza
reference laboratory on 29 Jun 2006 confirmed the H5N1 strain of the virus
in dead birds, it said.
The statement did not say how many birds were involved or whether it was
among farm-raised poultry or wild birds. Ministry officials have been sent
to the region to begin quarantine and disinfection operations, it said.
China has recorded 36 outbreaks of avian flu among birds since last October,
according to Agence France-Presse. China has reported a total of 19 human
cases of H5N1, of which 12 were fatal, according to the World Health
Organization.
Since January, at least 54 people have died from the H5N1 avian influenza
strain in Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China, Djibouti, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq and
Turkey, according to WHO.

involved and the vaccination status of the affected birds would be helpful.

Bird flu spreads to new state in Nigeria
----------------------------------------
The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has appeared in remote Taraba state in
eastern Nigeria, but in most other parts of Africa's most populous country
the spread of the virus is slow, officials said on Friday [30 Jun 2006].
The first African country to be hit by bird flu, Nigeria has not reported
any human cases of the disease although experts warn surveillance may not be
completely effective and cases may have gone undetected.
The detection of the virus in Taraba means bird flu is now present in 14 of
Nigeria's 36 states and in the Federal Capital Territory. The state that had
most recently joined the list was Lagos in April.
"We have identified it in 3 places in Taraba, 1 commercial farm and 2 places
where there are backyard poultry," said Lami Lombin, director of the
National Veterinary Research Institute which tests for bird flu. "There are
a few places in Plateau and Kaduna where we are still getting new outbreaks.
Elsewhere all the samples we're getting are negative," Lombin told Reuters
by telephone.
Plateau and Kaduna, which form a strip of north-central Nigeria, were among
the first 4 states where H5N1 was detected in February. Taraba borders
Plateau to the east [See map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf>].
In the first few weeks after the first cases were found, bird flu spread
rapidly in poultry across the country despite measures to contain it such as
culling and quarantine. Veterinary officials say it would not be safe to
consider the disease contained, but recent evidence suggests measures to
prevent its spread are working better than at the start.
The H5N1 virus can infect people who come into close contact with sick
birds. It has infected 228 people since late 2003 and killed at least 130,
the World Health Organization (WHO) says.
