On 19 Dec [2013], 2 cases of chikungunya were confirmed in Martinique, the 1st 2 cases reported in the department. The ARS [regional health agency] does not want to report which part of Martinique the 2 cases of chikungunya are from but advised people to protect themselves against mosquito bites and consult their doctor if they suffer from severe headaches, fever and joint pains.

On 6 Dec [2013], 115 and 145 cases, both [localities] in St Martin, were suspected [they did not say where in St Martin], of which 38 cases were confirmed.

Health authorities in Puerto Rico are investigating a suspected case or a fever called chikungunya, which has led the WHO to issue an alert for the Caribbean area.

The director of the Epidemiology Division of the Health Department of Puerto Rico, Brenda Rivera Garcia, stated that investigation started a week ago [14 Dec 2013] of a case of a woman who presented with symptoms of this disease, among which were severe joint pain.

According to this official, strict surveillance is maintained in the country for chikungunya fever, due to fear that it could be spread from other countries.

It turns out that population incidence of _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are closely monitored [on Puerto Rico] before the confirmation of the 1st 10 cases of this disease in the French part of the island of St Martin.

Given this situation, the WHO advised that this is the 1st time that local transmission of this virus has been detected in the Americas region since the virus was discovered for the 1st time in 1952. The virus occurs in Asia and Africa and has been expanding subsequently to some European countries including the north of Italy.

According to announcements, in addition to the 10 confirmed cases, authorities in St Martin are investigating 4 other probable cases and 20 suspected ones, although [the number of] affected individuals may climb to some 200.

Rivera Garcia admitted that the agency speculated [concerning the diagnosis of the case], knowing about the situation since last week, when the St Martin health authorities reported about the confirmed cases of the disease and the suspicion about the other ill people.

Chikungunya is a relatively rare type of viral fever caused by an alphavirus and is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes. Although the symptoms are similar to those of dengue, it is [due to] another type of virus and is characterized by severe joint pain. Physicians explain that these general symptoms may last 10 days, but severe joint pain can last months and be incapacitating to the point where the [affected] people can almost not move.

[These reports underscore the serious concern that chikungunya virus could spread to other areas in the Caribbean and generally to the Americas where dengue virus and their mosquito vectors are endemic. The number of suspected cases on St Martin continues to climb. The occurrence of 2 confirmed cases in Martinique indicates that the virus is not confined to St Martin island. If the case in Puerto Rico is confirmed as a chikungunya virus infection, that places the locality of the virus rather far distant from St Martin and Martinique in the Caribbean region. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information about the outcome of the laboratory tests of this Puerto Rico case. With many people in the Caribbean region traveling during this holiday season, the risk of additional spread of the virus is considerable and intensified surveillance is indicated.

ProMED-mail thanks Roland Hubner for sending in the above reports.
