A deer killed in Taney County is the 1st to test positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in that county, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC). The Taney County deer was killed only 2.5 mi [4 km] away from another deer that tested positive for CWD in Stone County, also that county's 1st positive CWD test.

Jasmine Batten, MDC's wildlife disease coordinator, said the positive CWD test in the Taney County deer was confirmed in the past few days. To limit the spread of CWD in wild deer, MDC likely will conduct deer culling operations in the vicinity of the new cases.

"Our CWD surveillance and management plan calls for localized culling in locations roughly 1-2 sq mi [2.6-5.2] from CWD detections," Batten said in an email. "So tentatively, yes, barring any major game changers in the coming weeks as the rest of the results roll in. We will be looking at the remainder of the test results and then discussing boundaries, etc. We would like to start reaching out to landowners later in December [2018] to solicit participation."

According to MDC, 13 new cases of the deadly deer disease have been found so far in 2018 in Missouri: Five cases were found in Franklin County, 3 in Macon County, and one each in Adair, Jefferson, Oregon, Stone, and Taney counties.

The Stone and Taney county deer were killed about 15 mi [24.1 km] north of the Arkansas border. Northwest Arkansas has recorded a significant outbreak of CWD, with more than 400 cases of the disease detected in deer and elk since 2016.

MDC is continuing to process thousands of tissue samples taken from deer killed during the recent hunting seasons.

[It's that time of year when the deer hunting season reveals what has been happening in the past 12 months, and rather depressingly so in this case. But if cervid CWD is ever to be adequately controlled, routine checking of hunter-killed deer is where one starts. - Mod.MHJ
