Fernando Dias de Avila Pires has made some interesting statements; however
he is not completely correct with regard to at least one of them. He said
that George Gaylord Simpson said that it is improbable if not impossible
for life to have developed other than on earth. This statement is
illogical. First of all, it is either improbable or it is impossible,
can't be one or the other. Second, I would just as soon spend a great deal
of money and effort than find out that Simpson was fallible after all. This
geocentrism is creationist nonsense.
However life evolved, it is simply untrue that chance plays a major role in
mutation, selection and survival. Chance does play a major role in
mutation, but not in selection or survival. The supposed effects of chance
is more creationist nonsense.
Darwinian selection is not by chance but by slow, cumulative, non-random
survival of randomly occurred variants. Survival is based on fitness;
something either is or it isn't fit. Every individual is descended from
its successful predecessors.
The probability of "something out there" is high (given the myriad
possibilities) but I agree that the likelihood of finding it is low, and we
might very well not recognize it if we had it in our gloved hands.
Still, it would be an awful thing to wade in and determine, albeit too
late, that we should have done a bit of work beforehand.
As this is not a creationist net site, I suggest we deep-six any more
conversation on this subject. Further provision of logic and facts likely
will not convince anyone of anything they do not already believe.
If you are looking for a book to read, try "Climbing Mount Improbable" by
Richard Dawkins (W.W. Norton Co, NY/London).
