Anthrax outbreak in southern Tajikistan
-------------------------------------------
According to (southern Tajikistan's) Khatlon (Regional) epidemiological
station, 17 people have contracted anthrax in the region. The Asia-Plus
news agency's own correspondent in Qurghonteppa (the administrative centre
of Khatlon Region) has learned from a source in the Regional
epidemiological station that 12 people fell ill in Baljuvon District and
another 3 in Qabodiyon District. Two people contracted anthrax in Danghara
and one in Kulob. According to the source's data, a sick cow was the cause
of the spread of the infection. Three cows died of anthrax in Baljuvon, the
carcasses were burned.
According to the epidemiologist, the reason for the increase of anthrax
among animals is untimely [sic immunization. The animals which contracted
the disease are mainly from the private sector.

[Livestock cases are reported more frequently in the private sector
throughout Central Asia. This reflects under-vaccination -- whether through
high (unsubsidised) costs or limitation on vaccine availability I have not
been able to work out. - MHJ
