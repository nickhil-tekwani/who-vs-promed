The Harrisonburg-Rockingham Health Department continues to investigate an ongoing mumps outbreak at James Madison University (JMU).

To date, mumps infections have been confirmed by lab testing in 5 staff members and 14 students. Lab results are currently pending for 3 additional students. The health department also is investigating several additional cases in the region that are apparently unrelated to JMU.

Mumps is an acute viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through direct contact with respiratory droplets spread by coughing and sneezing, or through contact with saliva from an ill person. Persons with mumps may have body aches, fever and swollen glands in the jaw. Most people recover from the illness in a week, but serious complications are possible.

To protect yourself from diseases like mumps that are spread through droplet contact, wash your hands frequently, cover your nose or mouth when you cough or sneeze and avoid droplet contact with people who are ill. Don't share cups or utensils and avoid close contact with people who are ill.

The health department is advising students and community members to review their immunization status and contact their health care provider to receive vaccine as needed. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) is usually given when a child is 1 year old and again between the ages of 4 and 6 years. The mumps vaccine is 88 per cent effective in people who receive 2 doses, but some fully immunized individuals may still develop mumps. A 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may be recommended for individuals at high risk for infection due to close contact with someone who has mumps.

People exposed to mumps may not show symptoms for 12-25 days, but infected individuals are able to transmit the infection to others up to 2 days before symptoms appear. If you have mumps-like symptoms or questions about your mumps immunizations, contact your health care provider. The health department and JMU will provide additional updates as new information becomes available or recommendations arise.

The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) reports as of [Tue 21 Mar] there are 3 known cases of mumps (1 confirmed and 2 probable cases) with a 4th case being investigated. The 3 cases identified so far are all known to have attended a social dance (Baile Mexicano or Mexican Dance) that took place at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington on 10 Feb 2018.

DPH is advising health providers to offer MMR vaccination to persons who report attending the Baile Mexicano dance as long as there are no contraindications.

Mumps resurgence likely due to waning vaccine-derived immunity
--------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
A resurgence of mumps in the US among vaccinated young adults appears to be due to waning of vaccine-induced immunity, according to a recent analysis. Researchers found vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps lasts about 27 years after the last dose. The findings suggest that, in addition to the currently recommended 2 doses of mumps vaccine in childhood, a 3rd dose at age 18 may help sustain protection among adults. The study [was] published 21 Mar 2018, in Science Translational Medicine [reference and press release cited below].

"This analysis helps address a persistent question surrounding the recent mumps outbreaks, pointing to the key role played by waning vaccine induced immunity, and helps frame the research and policy questions on how best to control mumps," said Yonatan Grad, assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard Chan School, who co-authored the study with Joseph Lewnard, postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Chan School's Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics.

After the mumps vaccine was introduced in the mid-1960s, mumps incidence in the US and other developed countries declined for decades. After recommendations for children to receive a second vaccine dose were issued in 1989, sustained reductions in mumps incidence led to optimism that vaccination could eliminate the disease from the US in the long term.

But recent mumps outbreaks, including on college campuses, began occurring among vaccinated young adults around 2006 and have continued to the present. The resurgence is troubling, the authors wrote, because mumps infections may cause complications such as testicular inflammation (which may result in infertility), meningitis, and deafness. Since cases have predominantly occurred in vaccinated populations, the mumps resurgence has prompted questions about what's to blame -- either waning immune protection from the mumps vaccine or new strains of the mumps that evade vaccine-driven protection.

In the new study, Harvard Chan School researchers pooled and analyzed data from six epidemiological studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness conducted over past decades in the US and Europe. The researchers estimated that 25 per cent of people in the US vaccinated against mumps may lose protection within 7.9 years, 50 per cent within 19 years, and 75 per cent within 38 years. Linking data from these studies to a mathematical model of mumps transmission, the researchers determined that waning immunity has played a central role not only in the recent re-emergence of mumps cases among young adults, but also in outbreaks that occurred in the late 1980s among adolescents who had received only one dose under earlier recommendations.

In contrast, the researchers found no evidence that new strains of mumps virus are contributing to changes in vaccine effectiveness. Moreover, their model suggested that new strains would not be expected to cause cases in age groups affected by recent outbreaks.

"Vaccination is the centerpiece of current public health strategy against mumps," said Lewnard. "Knowing that protection wanes in the long term can help inform how we deploy vaccines to prevent or contain future outbreaks."

Earlier this year [2018] the MMWR published recommendations for a third dose of mumps vaccine for those at particular risk of infection [reference below: subsequent numbered references can be found along with the full report at the URL below]: "A substantial increase in the number of mumps outbreaks and outbreak-associated cases has occurred in the United States since late 2015 (1,2). To address this public health problem, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed the available evidence and determined that a third dose of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and effective at preventing mumps. During its October 2017 meeting, ACIP recommended a 3rd dose of a mumps virus-containing vaccine for persons previously vaccinated with 2 doses who are identified by public health authorities as being part of a group or population at increased risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak. The purpose of the recommendation is to improve protection of persons in outbreak settings against mumps disease and mumps-related complications. This recommendation supplements the existing ACIP recommendations for mumps vaccination (3)."
