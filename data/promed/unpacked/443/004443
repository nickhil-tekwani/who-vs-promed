A new study published in the scientific Journal of Virology [see reference below] examined the combined infection of birds with H9N2 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses. The H7N9 avian influenza virus appeared in China in 2013 as a low-pathogenicity virus, initially being asymptomatic in birds or accompanied by mild disease. In contrast, the virus was zoonotic and presented a respiratory manifestation in humans with a considerable infectivity from bird to human. The subclinical presentation in poultry made it very difficult, for the health authorities, to control the spread of the virus in the human population in China.

The combined infection, carried out by British researchers, produced 2 H9N2 and H9N9 viruses. The H9N9 virus presented high replication in human cells and in ferrets, the human-compatible model for influenza virus research.

The study warns of the possibility of "new" influenza viruses following the endemic status of H9N2 and H7N9 viruses in China: viruses that will be more pathogenic to birds and have a high zoonotic potential.

Bhat S, James J, Sadeyen JR, et al. Co-infection of chickens with H9N2 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses leads to emergence of reassortant H9N9 virus with increased fitness for poultry and a zoonotic potential. J Virol 2022; https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01856-21.

The paper's "Importance" section follows:
"We evaluated the consequences of reassortment between the H7N9 and the contemporary H9N2 viruses of G1 lineage that are enzootic in poultry across the Indian sub-continent and the Middle East. Co-infection of chickens with these viruses resulted in emergence of novel reassortant H9N9 viruses with genes derived from both H9N2 and H7N9 viruses. The '6+2' reassortant H9N9 (having NP and NA from H7N9) virus was shed from contact chickens in a significantly higher proportion compared to most of the reassortant viruses, showed significantly increased replication fitness in human A549 cells, receptor binding towards human (α2,6) and avian (α2,3) sialic acid receptor analogues and the potential to transmit via contact among ferrets. This study demonstrated the ability of viruses that already exist in nature to exchange genetic material, highlighting the potential emergence of viruses from these subtypes with zoonotic potential."

While the world's attention has been paid during the 2 recent years to the COVID-19 pandemic, the experimental results above as well as other viruses with zoonotic potential already afield should be kept in mind. The current panzootic of HPAI H5N1, a virus that managed to spread within 2-3 months by/to wild and domestic birds in 4 continents, including (sporadic) infections in mammals, is an actual reminder. - Mod.AS]
