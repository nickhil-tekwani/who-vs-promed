Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus -- China
-----------------------------------------------------------
On 11 Dec 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus.

Details of the cases
--------------------
The 1st case is a 74-year-old male from Meizhou City, Guangdong Province, with onset date of 19 Nov [2015]. He purchased poultry from a market and raised poultry at home. At the time of report, the case was in severe condition.

The 2nd case is a 60-year-old male from Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, with onset date of 20 Nov [2015]. He has a history of slaughtering domestic poultry. At the time of report, the case was in severe condition.

Public health response
----------------------
The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: strengthening outbreak surveillance and situation analysis; reinforcing all efforts on medical treatment; and conducting risk communication with the public and dissemination of information.

WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Based on the information received thus far, the overall public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed.

If the pattern of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the number of human cases may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza.

A(H7N9) virus are expected in affected and possibly in the neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travels or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus has not demonstrated the ability to transmit easily among humans.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises that travelers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

[This posting provides details of 2 cases that may have been included in the count in the update posted in ProMED-mail, Avian influenza, human (129): China, H7N9 20151212.3857995, where numbers of cases of H7N9 in China were reported by the Macau Health Department without details on each case.

Human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus were first reported in China in March 2013. Most of these infections are believed to result from exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments, as H7N9 viruses have also been found in poultry in China. While some mild illnesses in human H7N9 cases have been seen, most patients have had severe respiratory illness, with about 1/3rd resulting in death. No evidence of sustained person-to-person spread of H7N9 has been found, though some evidence points to limited person-to-person spread in rare circumstances. The 1st case outside of China was in Malaysia and was reported on 12 Feb 2014. The case was detected in a traveler from an H7N9-affected area of China. The new H7N9 virus has not been detected in people or birds in the United States. ...

Studies indicate that avian influenza viruses, like seasonal influenza viruses, have a seasonal pattern: they circulate at higher levels in cold weather and at lower levels in warm weather.

Most of the cases that have been reported had poultry exposure and lived in areas where H7N9 had been found previously. Currently no evidence has been found that indicates sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h7n9-virus.htm).
