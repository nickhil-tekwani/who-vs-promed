A new outbreak of human brucellosis was registered in Aqmola oblast
[region] of Kazakhstan. 19 residents of Zerendinskaya rayon were
diagnosed with brucellosis at once. In all cases, the source of
infection was animals. There were animal brucellosis cases reported
in May 2010 in the same area. Currently the veterinary services are
immunizing the local herd.

[Since 2000 animal immunization against brucellosis is not being
performed in Kazakhstan. Each year, according to the information from
the newspaper "Express K" about 2500 new human brucellosis cases are
being registered, including 600 children
(<http://www.express-k.kz/show_article.php?art_id=24920>). There has
been a stepwise increase in brucellosis incidence in Kazakhstan,
which is due to combination of non-adequate veterinary procedures
during quarantines and the non-regulated trade of animals or animal
products. - Mod.NP]

[Both _Brucella abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are reportedly present
in Kazakhstan. The reservoir of _B. abortus_ is, generally, cattle
and of _B. melitensis_, sheep and goats, though cross infections may
occur. It will be helpful if the identity of the bacterium involved
in the outbreaks described becomes available. Most likely, these are
mainly _B. melitensis_ cases, with sheep and goats being the
reservoirs.

Kazakhstan's policy of brucellosis control in animals is in need of
clarification. - Mod.AS]

[The manifestations of the brucellosis in humans is not stated. - Mod.LL]
