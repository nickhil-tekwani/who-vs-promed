An emaciated cougar, shot and killed 8 Feb 2000, in a ravine, near a
residential neighborhood earlier this month by a state police game officer,
was severely weakened by a deadly feline virus. The cougar was blamed for
killing a small dog in the area 3 days earlier.
A necropsy at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service forensics laboratory in
Ashland revealed the cougar was infected with the enteric coronavirus,
which prevented the animal from absorbing nutrients from the food it ate,
said Merv Wolfer, a game biologist for the Oregon Department of Fish and
Wildlife.
Individual cougars found recently in the Applegate Valley and in Douglas
County also showed the characteristic thickened intestinal wall caused by
the virus.
"It raises a lot of questions to us -- like how many other cougars have
this disease, and is it related to an overpopulation of cougars," said John
Thiebes, a Fish and Wildlife biologist.
Biologists estimate there are more than 4000 cougars statewide, with an
increase occurring since voters imposed a ban on hound hunting for cougars
in 1994.
The cougar could have contracted the disease from another cougar, an
infected house cat, a feral cat or raccoon, Thiebes said. The disease
cannot be passed to humans. Pet cats are typically vaccinated against it.
Although documented cougar attacks on humans have occurred in Washington
and California -- including 2 fatalities in California -- no verified human
attacks have ever been reported in Oregon.
