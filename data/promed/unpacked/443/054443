DDT - REEMERGING DISEASES
The ProMED-mail posting, Leishmaniasis, cutaneous - Peru, draws attention
to the frequent experience of increasing diseases in tropical countries
where public health use of DDT is abandoned. This note is offered as a
brief update and perspective on the DDT controversy, and as a comment on
the cause for increased malaria in Bolivia.
UPDATE: In 1993, Wolff, et. al. (J Natl Cancer Inst;85:648-52), proposed a
link between DDE and breast cancer. Afterwards, this reported association
was widely used as evidence that production, distribution and use of DDT
should be banned. Recent studies, one from the U.S. (Hunter, et. al.,
1997, N Engl J Med;337:1253-8) and one from Europe (van't Veer, et. al.,
1997, British Med J.;315:81-5), show reduced risk of breast cancer with
higher plasma levels of DDE, one study from Mexico (Lopez-Carrillo, et.
al., 1997; Cancer Res 57:3728-32) showed no significant differences. Safe
(1997,N Engl J Med;337) presents an authoritative summation as follows:
"...recent studies should reassure the public that weakly estrogenic
organochlorine compounds such as PCBs, DDT, and DDE are not a cause of
breast cancer. The public has a right to be responsibly informed about
both confirmed and hypothesized threats to health, particularly from
environmental exposure. However, it is incumbent on scientists, the media,
legislators, and regulators to distinguish between scientific evidence and
hypothesis, and not to allow a "paparazzi science" approach to these
problems."
PERSPECTIVE: The last two sentences of Self's summation are equally
applicable to the issue of DDT'S impact on the environment. Dr. Aguilar's
comment (ProMED-mail article: Leishmaniasis, cutaneous - Peru) that "...DDT
is no longer used to destroy the vector since the insecticide damages the
environment." identifies a substantial issue. What environmental damage
results from indoor applications of DDT? The tropical public health
community needs to define this issue, which is not whether DDT is harmful
to the environment; but rather, are public health uses of DDT harmful to
the environment? I know of no documented, meaningful environmental damage
from indoor treatments with DDT. In this context, any references that
promed subscribers can provide that focus on environmental damage as a
direct result of indoor spraying wit>DDT will be greatly appreciated.
CAUSE OF INCREASING MALARIA IN BOLIVIA: As stated in the ProMED-mail
article Malaria - Bolivia, "...cases of malaria were increasing gradually
in Bolivia between 1990 and 1996....and then the incidence tripled in
1996." Roberts, et. al. (1997; accessible by internet:
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol3no3/roberts.htm) employed regression
models to show inverse relationships between numbers of houses sprayed with
DDT and increasing malaria in selected countries of South America. In
Bolivia, no houses were sprayed in 1990 and 1991. Houses were sprayed in
1992, but few houses were sprayed from 1993 to 1995. Then in 1996, no
houses were sprayed with DDT (statistics from Status of Malaria Programs in
the Americas, Reports for 1994 to 1997). I suggest that overall reduced
spraying from 1990 to 1995 set the stage for a ballooning of cases in 1996,
when no houses were sprayed. While this may seem speculative, the
relationships between declining use of DDT and increasing malaria can be
statistically defined for several countries in South America, to include
Bolivia.
Currently, international and national political pressures are succeeding in
rapidly eliminating options for public health uses of DDT. This is
occurring even though there is no persuasive evidence that public health
uses of DDT are harmful to human health or the environment. The continued
use of DDT is an important public health issue and it should be a topic of
open debate. Ultimately, findings of detrimental affects, if any, should
be weighed against the public health benefits of DDT for control of
malaria, leishmaniasis, bartonellosis and, potentially, other
arthropod-borne diseases.
