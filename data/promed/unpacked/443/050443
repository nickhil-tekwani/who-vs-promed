South Dakota is seeing a sharp rise in syphilis cases, the Department of Health [SDDOH] is reporting, with cases spreading across the state. The highest number of infections are occurring in the state's 2 largest counties, Pennington and Minnehaha, along with Oglala and Todd counties.

Other sexually transmitted diseases are also spreading, but the rise in syphilis has been the most dramatic, in part because of the small number of infections that represented the base number. Year to date, the department has reported 257 new infections, up by 1877%. The 5-year median during that period is 13 cases.

Angela Cascio, the infectious disease director and deputy administrator of the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, said risk factors have included intravenous drug use, substance abuse, unstable housing, and a history of incarceration.

"The DOH is also very concerned about pregnant women that have tested positive for syphilis, so we are working closely with healthcare providers for awareness and testing of pregnant women," Cascio said.

Infections have been distributed evenly among women and men, Cascio said.

The increasing cases even have prompted the Union Gospel Mission [UGM] in Sioux Falls to partner with the department to offer testing. "This disease can be heartbreaking for individuals who contract it and are not treated," Union Gospel CEO Eric Weber said in a release. "The homeless we serve are considered at high risk for syphilis. The willingness of the Department of Health to help UGM provide men, women, and their families with this testing will help these vulnerable people feel safe and get treatment if needed."

The department has been working with shelters, correctional facilities, Indian Health Services and others to assist with testing, treatment, and education, Cascio said. They've also been contact tracing those how have had close contact with someone who has been infected.

"The SDDOH has also released health alert messages to health care providers to increase their awareness, encourage testing, and has also provided treatment guidance," she said.

Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also reported an increase in syphilis. Provisional data from 2021 show cases are up 34% among women and 9% among men. Some of that can be attributed, Cascio said, because of disruptions in testing and treatment during the coronavirus pandemic.

[The United States has experienced a rising incidence of syphilis since 2000 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm). In 2000, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most contagious stages of the disease, reached historic lows with fewer than 6000 reported cases and an incidence rate of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people. However, by 2015, 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported with an incidence of 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, the highest rate reported since 1994. Syphilis rates increased in every region of the United States, a majority of age groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity.

During 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the United States was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). In more recent years (2013-2015), P&S syphilis also increased among women, which was associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. During 2014-2015, the rate of reported P&S syphilis increased 18.1% among men and 27.3% among women (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm), and in 2016, the number of congenital syphilis cases was the highest it's been since 1998 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm).

A history of incarceration, illicit drug use, and homelessness have been repeatedly cited in prior ProMED posts on the rising incidence of syphilis in the USA. During 2013-2017, the proportion of primary and secondary syphilis cases that reported illicit drug use within the past 12 months more than doubled among women and men who have sex with women (MSW) (https://www.cdc.gov/std/dstdp/DCL-SyphilisRiskMMWR-feb2019.pdf).

The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially cocaine crack, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification. - Mod.ML
