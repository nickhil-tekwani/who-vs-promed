Presence of dengue announced in the municipality of Havana
----------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities have posted hundreds of printed leaflets in the capital
district of Plaza de la Revolucion, in connection with a new outbreak of
dengue in the area.
According to local sources in the Ministry of Public Health, who prefer to
remain anonymous, the epidemiological alert is due to the presence of more
than 20 cases of dengue in local hospitals.
The text of the leaflets reads "Active search for patients with fever", and
further on, "Any person with fever, even if they have other symptoms, must
immediately notify the closest medical post."
In 2001 there was a large outbreak of this illness, but the government did
not release the number of deaths. Nevertheless, it launched a big
sanitation offensive in the capital, which is in an advanced state of urban
& architectural deterioration, together with its garbage & trash collection
services.
