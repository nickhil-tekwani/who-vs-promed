1st Outbreak of Blackleg Caused by _Phoma lingam_ in Commercial Canola
Fields in Argentina.
S. A. Gaetan, Facultad de Agronomia, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Avda. San
Martin 4453 (1417), Buenos Aires, Argentina. Plant Dis. 89:435, 2005;
published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0435B. Accepted for publication 24
Jan 2005.
Canola (_Brassica napus_) was introduced as an alternative crop to wheat in
Argentina. During 2004, typical symptoms of foliar blackleg disease were
observed on canola plants in commercial and experimental fields in southern
Buenos Aires Province. Average disease incidence was 32 percent on 2- to
4-month-old plants of canola cvs. Impulse, Master, Mistral, and Teddy. The
range of incidence on these cultivars was 21 to 43 percent.
Foliar symptoms were randomly distributed at seedling, rosette, and
flowering stages. Symptoms included necrosis and chlorosis of the affected
leaf tissue and defoliation. Foliar leaf spots were circular to irregularly
oval, 5 to 12 mm in diameter, pale brown in the center, and grayish green
at the margin. Small, black pycnidia formed in the center of the adaxial
surface of diseased foliage. Under favorable temperature and moisture
conditions, lesions enlarged and coalesced. Older lesions appeared
chlorotic and desiccated with shredded tissue at the center. A severe
defoliation of the lower leaves was observed. As the disease developed,
basal stem cankers formed on these plants, although disease incidence in
this phase was low.
Pieces (0.5 cm long) were taken from leaves and stems of diseased plants,
dipped in 70 percent ethanol, surface sterilized with NaOCl (1 percent) for
2 min, and rinsed in sterile water. Each segment was blotted dry and placed
on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Plates were incubated in the dark at 26 deg
C for 4 days, and then plates were incubated under 12 h of NUV light and
12-h dark for 7 days. 4 fungal isolates were obtained. The fungi were
examined microscopically and confirmed as _Phoma lingam_ (Tode:Fr.) Desmaz.
(_Leptosphaeria maculans_ (Desmaz.) Ces. & De Not) (3,4). _P. lingam_ was
the only fungus isolated from the infected tissue. The teleomorph stage was
not observed.
Koch's postulates were completed for 2 isolates by spray-inoculating
foliage of 3-week-old canola plants of cvs. Impulse, Master, Mistral, and
Teddy with a conidial suspension (1 million conidia per ml). The
experiment, which included 4 inoculated plants per isolate and 2
noninoculated control plants for each cultivar, was performed in a
greenhouse at 22 to 24 deg C and maintained at 75 percent relative humidity
with no supplemental light. Inoculated and control plants were covered with
polyethylene bags for 48 h after inoculation.
Plants developed small, pale brown lesions on leaves within 11 days for
both isolates, and the pathogen was reisolated. Control plants, inoculated
only with sterile distilled water, remained symptomless. The experiment was
repeated once with similar results.
Blackleg is the most important fungal disease affecting canola with a
worldwide distribution (1,2). In 1995, the disease was first observed on
canola in Argentina in northern Buenos Aires Province, but only in
experimental field plots with a low disease incidence. Since that time, it
has not been found in other areas where canola is produced. The results
emphasize the importance of this pathogen in Argentina, since at the
current time most commercial cultivars were susceptible to _P. lingam_.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of an outbreak of _P. lingam_
infection in commercial crops in the main canola-production region in
Argentina.

[The source of the infection is likely contaminated canola seed or crop
residue in the field. Disease management of canola requires annual
monitoring of the crop for disease severity, plant the most resistant
cultivars suited to the rainfall and farming system, establish a barrier of
at least 500 meters between the current crop and the previous canola
stubble, and consider using a fungicide and/or destroying last year's
canola stubble if warranted. - Mod.DH]
