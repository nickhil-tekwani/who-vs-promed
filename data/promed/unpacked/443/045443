The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard flock (non-poultry) in Knox County, Maine.

Samples from the flock were tested at the Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.

APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in Maine on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F (74 deg C) kills bacteria and viruses.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a tool kit, available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.

USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to such notifications in non-poultry.

APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for non-commercial backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

Additional background
Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

Indiana's Board of Animal Health [BOAH] has detected avian influenza at another commercial turkey flock in southwest Indiana. The presumptive-positive case is the 4th farm in Indiana and the 2nd in Greene County to be diagnosed with the virus. Samples are being verified at the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa and should indicate if the virus is the same as the farm diagnosed earlier this month [February 2022] and if the virus is highly pathogenic.

Depopulation efforts are underway on the premises. To date, nearly 120 000 commercial turkeys have been depopulated.

The site is approximately 5 mi [8 km] from the 1st positive case in Greene County. All commercial poultry farms within the expanded control area will be quarantined and tested regularly until the control area is lifted.

Late last week, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2 non-commercial backyard flocks, one in Maine and another in New York. Those flocks on the affected [premises] were depopulated.

Testing has confirmed a case of avian influenza on a Delaware poultry farm showing increased mortality over the past few days. Following an investigation by the Delaware Department of Agriculture, the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed that poultry from this farm have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI).

There is no public health concern, and avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat.

"We have taken immediate action to contain this disease and will continue to work with poultry owners, the industry, and our laboratory partners to protect against its spread," said Delaware Secretary of Agriculture Michael T. Scuse. "This appears to be an isolated case, with no reports of disease among our chicken industry. Delmarva poultry is safe to eat, and consumers can be confident in the safety of their food."

The Delaware Department of Agriculture and partner agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture, are working to contain the situation, including sampling and quarantining nearby poultry flocks.

Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.

The farm is under quarantine to stop the spread of avian influenza to other flocks in the state. The birds on the affected farm will be depopulated to prevent the spread of disease and will not enter the food system. Due to the severity of this avian influenza, anyone found trespassing on a quarantined farm will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

The avian influenza detection was the highly pathogenic H5 type, which is more severe and can cause high mortality in poultry flocks. It is the same strain confirmed in other states and wild birds in the Atlantic flyway.

It is not known exactly how the virus was contracted. Scuse encouraged all poultry flock owners to follow the strictest biosecurity on their farms to prevent the spread of the disease. Those steps include the following:
- Limit, monitor, and record any movement of people, vehicles, or animals on or off your farm.
- Permit only essential workers and vehicles to enter the farm to limit the chances of bringing the virus from an outside source.
- Avoid visiting other poultry farms and any unnecessary travel off the farm.
- Disinfect equipment, vehicles, footwear, and other items coming into contact with flocks.
- Keep your flock away from wild or migratory birds, especially waterfowl.
- Isolate any ill animals and contact your veterinarian.

This finding is the 1st case of HPAI in commercial poultry in Delaware since 2004.

Positive test results were confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Service Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. Preliminary testing was performed at the University of Delaware's Allen Laboratory in Newark, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.

[4] Michigan (Kalamazoo County): backyard flock
Date: Thu 24 Feb 2022

https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/about/media/pressreleases/2022/02/24/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-detected-in-michigan-backyard-flock


Following an investigation by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD), the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) has confirmed the discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard flock in Kalamazoo County. This detection shows that the virus is present in the environment and highlights the need for poultry owners to protect their flocks by increasing biosecurity.

After several birds from the affected flock died and others showed signs of illness, samples were sent to the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (MSU VDL) for testing. The results from MSU VDL were then confirmed by NVSL.

"MDARD is always preparing for situations like this when they arise, which is why we were able to take quick action to contain this disease and help protect against its spread," said MDARD Director Gary McDowell. "At this time, this is an isolated case. There is no threat to public health or food safety. We do not anticipate any disruptions to supply chains across our state. As this situation develops, we will continue to work with our partners at local and federal levels to best mitigate spread and provide outreach."

To protect other flocks in Michigan, the premises is currently under quarantine, and the birds have been depopulated to prevent further disease spread.

Fortunately, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. Also, no birds or bird products infected with HPAI will enter the food chain. As a reminder, all poultry and eggs should be handled and cooked properly.

"Now, with HPAI present in Michigan, it is critical for poultry owners to increase biosecurity measures and to keep wild birds out in order to protect their flocks. Increasing those measures will be important to ensure domestic birds are kept healthy and safe," said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland. "Simply put, no matter how many birds or which type of birds someone owns, now is the time to protect them. I'm asking all owners to sign up for our email alerts so we can provide them with critical updates on this developing situation."

Whether you have a few backyard birds or a large commercial flock, following these biosecurity measures can help protect Michigan's domestic birds:
- Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.
- Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.
- Disinfect boots and other gear when moving between coops.
- Don't share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.
- Clean and disinfect equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.
- Use well water or municipal water as drinking water for birds.
- Keep poultry feed secure so there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.

Poultry owners and caretakers should watch for unusual deaths, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected, contact MDARD immediately, even if after regular business hours.

[Avian influenza is on the move. It continues to move across the United States. Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and notice if there are ill birds in flocks you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds. - Mod.TG]
