1661 admitted to hospital with dysentery
----------------------------------------
More than 1600 people, including 1124 children aged 14 years and under,
were in hospitals in southern Russia on Sunday, 10 Nov 2002, in one of the
country's biggest dysentery outbreaks in a decade.
Health officials blamed tainted dairy products from the Kropotkin plant in
the Krasnodar region for the outbreak, which started on Wednesday 6 Nov.
The Health Ministry said on Sunday that it suspected infected dairy workers
had inadvertently contaminated products at the plant. Deputy health
minister Gennady Onishchenko, who visited the plant over the weekend, said
at least 9 workers had been found to be infected with dysentery and
antibodies to the bacteria had been found in the blood of 53 other workers.
"This means that they had a mild form of the disease without telling
anyone," Onishchenko was quoted by Interfax as saying. Production has been
shut down at the plant, which puts out about 90 tons of dairy products per
day. Health officials have carried out an inspection and given the plant a
list of sanitary requirements it must meet to resume operations, the Health
Ministry said.
Kropotkin's deputy director, Vasily Vatulin, confirmed that the plant was
being disinfected but said he has not received any documentation from
health officials showing a link between the dysentery bacteria and the plant.
As of 10 Nov, 1661 people in hospital in 6 regions with symptoms of
dysentery, and 273 have been diagnosed with the disease, Health Ministry
spokeswoman Lyubov Voropayeva said. All of the patients were listed in
satisfactory condition. The Krasnodar region was hit hardest, with 1188
patients, including 802 children, Voropayeva said. In the neighboring
Stavropol region, 63 people were in hospital, 44 of them children, while in
the Rostov region 79 people including 30 children were admitted to hospitals.
People had also been admitted to hospital in North Ossetia, Astrakhan, and
Adygeya. Voropayeva said the last major outbreak of dysentery was
registered in 2000, when 731 people fell ill in the Volga River town of
Tolyatti. "We register these kind of outbreaks almost every year, but not
on a scale as large as this one," she said.
Onishchenko said the outbreak was not caused by contaminated water.
Krasnodar was devastated by floods in July, and health officials at the
time feared outbreaks of infectious diseases. Onishchenko said artesian
waters used by Kropotkin's water system are 400 to 500 meters deep and
could not have been affected by the floods.

[We have yet to see a microbiological report related to this outbreak. We
have speculated that the shigella bacillus is the most likely cause, but
would appreciate confirmation. - Mod.SH]
