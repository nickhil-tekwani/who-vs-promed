At our laboratory, we usually, from late summer to early autumn, detect zero or a few cases of Ockelbo disease caused by Sindbis virus, a mosquito-borne zoonotic alphavirus in the family _Togaviridae_. Outbreaks and epidemics of Sindbis virus occur some years in Sweden with a higher incidence of cases between the 60th and 63rd latitude.

This year [2013], we have detected unusually many cases in the county of Vasterbotten, north of the 63rd latitude. At the same time, very few cases are reported from the endemic region.

Out of so far 57 investigated patients with clinical suspicion of Ockelbo disease, we have detected 26 cases: 15 females and 11 males, of which 21 were from Vasterbotten. With an indirect immuno-fluorescence test detecting specific antibodies against Ockelbo/Sindbis virus, 18 cases were confirmed on IgG-positive convalescence sera. An additional 8 cases were highly probable on IgM-positive acute sera. All cases had disease onset in August 2013 and the median age was 55 years.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Asa Gylfe and Urban Kumlin for responding to our request for information.

Previously, Mod.TY reported that the virus responsible for Ockelbo disease was isolated originally in Sweden in 1982. The virus responsible for Ockelbo disease is antigenically similar to Sindbis virus. The disease in humans is characterized by arthritis, rash, and fever, although many infections are asymptomatic. Antibodies to the virus have been found throughout Sweden with highest prevalence in the central part of the country. The virus is transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes, with transmission to humans occurring from late July until killing frosts in October. Neutralising antibodies have been found in 3 orders of birds in Sweden. Passerine birds are infected most frequently and may be amplifying hosts of the virus.

Drs Gylfe and Kumlin supplement this information by reporting further that outbreaks and epidemics of Sindbis virus occur some years in Sweden with a higher incidence of cases between the 60th and 63rd latitude. In the current year [2013], they have detected unusually many cases in the county of Vasterbotten, north of the 63rd latitude. In contrast, very few cases are reported from the endemic region. Consequently, the occurrence of Ockelbo disease is greatly dependent on environmental and ecological factors.
