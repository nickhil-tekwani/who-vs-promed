Cases of a disease related to dengue fever have made their way to New Zealand along with other serious mosquito-borne illnesses.

The Asian tiger mosquito is one of the vectors responsible for transmitting dengue fever.

Since March this year [2014], there have been 45 cases of Zika [virus infection] reported to Environmental Science and Research [ESR] throughout New Zealand.

Zika symptoms include a rash, mild fever, joint and muscle pain, and headaches.

All but 2 people who caught the disease had been in the Cook Islands.

Since April [2014], there have been a dozen cases of chikungunya, another mosquito-borne disease, all from Tonga.

ESR clinical microbiologist Deborah Williamson said the diseases could not be spread here. "There's always a possibility that the type of mosquitos that spreads these diseases could become established in the warmer parts of New Zealand, but at the moment these mosquitos are not found in New Zealand."

Official advice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Safe Travel government website says there are no vaccines for the virus and is urging people who travel to Pacific Islands to wear insect repellent and protective clothing.

[As of 25 Mar 2014, there were 49 confirmed cases of Zika virus infection in the Cook Islands, the source of the virus in the majority of the cases above. There has been a case in Queensland, Australia ex the Cook Islands reported earlier this year (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140403.2378034). Unlike the Australian case, there is no risk of ongoing transmission because there are no competent vectors for Zika virus in New Zealand. - Mod.TY
