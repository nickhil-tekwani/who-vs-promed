News of the response
Security
--------
- Contrary to what has been reported in some international media, the Ministry of Health has not suspended the Ebola response. Following the attack of a MONUSCO [Mission de l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo] base in the Boikene district, Ruwenzori commune, in the city of Beni, by an armed group on the evening of Fri 16 Nov 2018, the field activities in Beni did not take place normally at the beginning of the day on Sat 17 Nov 2018. After assessing the security situation, all field activities, except vaccination, were able to resume idling [? - Mod.SH] on Sat afternoon. This Sun 18 Nov 2018, the riposte could advance normally to Beni.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 31 953 people have been vaccinated, including 15 901 in Beni.

[It appears that field activities may not have been totally suspended but were disrupted. However, disruption of vaccination did occur and is always problematic, as it leads to spread of the virus through contact infection. - Mod.LK]

[2] Response
- 16 Nov 2018. MSF expands care as Ebola outbreak spreads in DRC
[Médecins sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders) extracted, edited]

In response to the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Médecins sans Frontières (MSF; Doctors without Borders) is stepping up efforts to contain the epidemic. Just over 3 months since the declaration of the latest Ebola epidemic in North Kivu, DRC, the intervention still faces serious challenges.

The epicenter of the Ebola outbreak has moved from the small town of Mangina to the larger city of Beni, where the number of new suspected and confirmed Ebola patients has risen steadily for weeks. MSF teams are increasingly busy with tracing suspected cases, as the epidemic has reached a new level. As many as 30 new suspected cases are identified every day and admitted to the Ebola Treatment Center in Beni.

MSF has opened a new transit center in Beni in response to the growing needs. "The objective of this transit center is to boost the overall capacity for patient care in Beni. Since the city became the new focus of the outbreak in October 2018, new confirmed cases have been frequently appearing in several neighborhoods," says Marie Burton, MSF project coordinator.

The new MSF transit center was built very close to an existing Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) that was operating at capacity. The proximity of the 2 facilities is intended to bring the various components of the Ebola response in Beni closer together. The MSF facility was built on a former football field measuring 8000 square meters and required a week's worth of fast-paced construction work.

Suspected Ebola patients will be admitted to the MSF transit center pending confirmation of their laboratory analyses. MSF medical staff will provide immediate care according to a person's clinical status; once the diagnosis is confirmed, patients who test positive for Ebola will be transferred to the nearby ETC while those who test negative will be transferred to other health facilities where further care will be provided. Until recently, both confirmed and suspected cases were admitted to the ETC, although the 2 wards were isolated.

In the new MSF transit center, individual rooms were constructed to improve patient isolation. Partitions were fitted with large Plexiglass windows to enable medical staff to more closely monitor patients as well as make it easier for patients to see visiting family members and loved ones. The center's initial capacity of 16 beds can be increased to 32, or up to 48 if needed.

Since the start of the Ebola epidemic on 1 Aug 2018, MSF teams have been active in the response in North Kivu and Ituri. MSF opened treatment centers in the cities of Mangina, Butembo, and Tchomia (the latter is now closed), an isolation center in the city of Bunia, and most recently the transit center in Beni. Independent of any political, religious, or military authority, MSF acts with impartiality, according to its evaluation of medical needs. MSF is financially independent, with more than 90 percent of [its] income from private donors.

- 17 Nov 2018. Uganda (Kampala, Wakiso) at Ebola risk- Ministry of Health - PML Daily [extracted, edited]
http://www.pmldaily.com/news/2018/11/kampala-wakiso-at-ebola-risk-ministry-of-health.html

Dr Henry Mwebesa, the director general of the Ministry of Health, has revealed that Uganda is at a very high risk of catching the deadly Ebola virus that is ravaging and has claimed lives in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Mwebesa explained: "The latest information is that we have 344 cases of Ebola in DR Congo, and this is a place that is very close to our borders. Initially, we were talking about 100 km, but of late it has come even closer to 50 km from our border, and, in fact, recently, we had 2 people that died exactly at the landing site of L. Albert on the other side of Congo." He made the remarks today [17 Nov 2018] during the 3rd Grande Annual Doctors Conference held at Imperial Royale Hotel, Kampala.

While detailing the Ebola risk Uganda faces, Mwebesa pointed at Ugandans close to the Congo border, but warned that this shouldn't make those far away from the border relaxed, as experts haven't ruled out the risk those people in Kampala and Wakiso stand at contracting the virus, calling for more vigilant campaigns to avert the risk. "Ebola doesn't know borders, so as a country, we are at a very high risk. We had 202 deaths [in Congo] as of Thu 15 Nov 2018, which is about 59%," Mwebesa noted.

He stated that the ministry has embarked on vigorous preventive measures to ensure Ebola doesn't make its way into Uganda and assured Ugandans that on top of putting up treatment centres, the health teams have the capacity to treat any Ebola case.

- Mon 19 Nov 2018. WHO director-general: Violence in DRC is allowing Ebola to spread - STAT News [extracted, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/19/who-director-general-violence-in-drc-is-allowing-ebola-to-spread/

The public health workers behind the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are struggling to combat an outbreak of the deadly virus in what is effectively a war zone. Repeated rebel attacks on the city of Beni -- the outbreak epicenter and the headquarters of the response operation -- have given the virus an advantage over the humans trying to contain it, acknowledges Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's director-general.

The most recent attack, on Fri 16 Nov 2018, targeted a military encampment close to a hotel in Beni where some Ebola responders are housed. The hotel was hit by a shell that did not detonate. In the aftermath, a decision was made the next day to evacuate 16 personnel experiencing emotional distress and to insist on heightened security from the United Nations peacekeeping force in the area, known as MONUSCO.

STAT caught up over the weekend with the WHO director-general, who traveled to Beni earlier this month [November 2018]. We asked Tedros, as he is known, about WHO's ongoing battle against Ebola in North Kivu province and whether a global health emergency should be declared. As of Sun 18 Nov 2018, there have been 366 confirmed and probable Ebola infections reported in this outbreak; 214 of those people died [only 2 questions from the interview are included here. Go to the URL above for the full interview]:

STAT - "Some people think this outbreak should be declared a PHEIC, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Are you thinking of reconvening the WHO's Ebola Emergency Committee, which met in October [2018], to advise you on whether the outbreak should be declared be a PHEIC?"

Tedros - "That committee met recently. I think things have not really changed significantly from then. I think it's better, based on our discussions with the [UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations], to see how the situation will be handled. We're just starting. And they're giving it their best. And if necessary, they will do even more. If there is a change that needs another convening of the Emergency Committee, of course, I will convene. But at this point, I don't see that it will add any value, because even if they [propose] temporary recommendations, how different will it be from what we have now?"

STAT - "What would be gained from declaring a PHEIC? Is there something that you need that you can't get because it's not a PHEIC?"

Tedros - "To be honest, I'm not missing anything I have asked for. That's why the Emergency Committee also was not convinced we need to call it a PHEIC.

[International] partners, they call me. And they ask if we need anything. The UK, the European Union, Germany, almost everybody. USAID, the same. They want to support if there is a need. The US government. Wellcome Trust. They are ready."

[This interview is recommended reading to see the viewpoint of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general. I have only included his responses to declaration of a PHEIC, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which was not done. This decision has been questioned by others, especially in light of the current spread of the virus. However, the virus apparently is still confined to the DRC. The reader can see his response to this and other issues here. - Mod.LK
