The samples were fine, but the final consignments were flawed. Govind
Sarda's company had used genuine blood-test kits as a decoy to
hoodwink the government into handing it the supply contract, health
officials and police say.
"The samples they sent for testing were cleared by the expert
committee as there was nothing wrong with them. But kits in the final
consignments were past their use-by dates," a police officer said.
Fears have been expressed that thousands of units of contaminated
blood could have been given to recipients as the faulty kits might
have failed to detect infections.
A member of the Sarda family who called up The Telegraph denied the
allegations, but revealed Monozyme India had bagged the contract by
quoting Rs 20 [USD 0.45] for a kit against its rivals' Rs 60-70 [USD
1.35-1.57]. Monozyme had won the contract in December 2004 after the
West Bengal State AIDS Control and Prevention Society (WBSACPS)
floated the tenders. Since then, the company has supplied lakhs [one
lakh is equal to 100 000. - Mod.CP] of kits meant for detecting
infections -- such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
virus or hepatitis C virus -- in collected blood. Up to August 2006,
it had supplied the government over 140 000 kits for testing for
hepatitis B and C virus infections, health officials said.
The Sarda family member, however, claimed that Monozyme got the
contract only in November 2005 and had supplied only about 1000 kits.
"We started supplying in Bengal in January 2006. The order was
renewed a few months later. We have supplied around 1000 kits to
WBSACPS, none of which had passed the expiry date," said the caller
on condition of anonymity.
"We got the licence for the kits in mid-2005, and the first
consignment was imported about 18 months ago. These kits have a shelf
life of 2 years; so the question of supplying kits past their use-by
date doesn't arise." But investigating officers said they had seized
nearly 100 000 kits supplied by Monozyme that had passed their expiry
dates. "Some of the kits were supplied way back in 2005," an officer said.
The police have revealed that the cartons in which the kits came
mention 2007 as the expiry date, but the boxes inside simply state
"005." The use-by date on the test pouches inside the boxes is either
missing or smudged. Investigators are probing how the faulty kits
cleared screenings at the Central Blood Bank in Maniktala and the 6
other centres from where blood is distributed. "Since the WBSACPS had
cleared the kits, we used them in good faith," an official at a
distribution centre said. Health department officials, however, said
checking the use-by date is standard practice.

As he read today about Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's clean chit to the
health department in the blood-test kit scam, a lab technician would
have been reminded of the feeling he had 17 months ago. "This can't
be true," he had then thought, giving the blood test report in his
hand one more perplexed scan at NRS Medical College. It said the
sample had tested negative for hepatitis B and C viruses. Yet the
dark yellow blood serum had clearly pointed to hepatitis. The A and E
forms had already been ruled out and B and C were the remaining
possibilities. But the blood tests, done with a kit supplied by
Govind Sarda's Monozyme India, were negative for both.
Certain that there was something wrong with the kit, the technician
had reported the matter to his senior, who got in touch with the West
Bengal State Aids Prevention and Control Society [WBSAPCS], which had
approved the kits. This was in May 2005, 16 months before the police
recorded the first complaint about the kits, past their expiry dates.
Over the next few months, complaints poured in from other government
hospitals too, sources said. Apart from the WBSAPCS, there were calls
to the state health department and state drug controller.
"An impression has been created as if the health department knew
about the matter and wanted to keep it under wraps," Bhattacharjee
had said yesterday. "This is totally false."
For over a year before the police got on the case, "we had been
receiving complaints from blood banks in city government hospitals,"
admitted a health official.
The complaints were the same. "We told the health department there
was something amiss with the kits," a doctor at SSKM hospital said.
"But they didn't react." Things got moving only on 1 Sep 2006, when 2
Monozyme employees spilled the beans. Why did the health authorities
not react? Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said: "Our department
was the first to lodge a complaint with the police about the
defective kits." The chief minister had echoed this. But the drug
controller lodged the complaint with the police only on 27 Sep 2006,
when the probe was already on.

Police detectives today surprised Ghanshyam Sarda, brother of kit
scam accused Govind Sarda, at the airport, arresting him as he tried
to catch an early morning flight out of town. The police said
Ghanshyam had been managing director of Monozyme India between June
2005 and July 2006 when the faulty blood-test kits were supplied, and
had full knowledge of the company's day-to-day functioning. The
45-year-old had been on the run since elder brother Govind's arrest,
sneaking in and out of the city on short trips from Delhi.
Plainclothes detectives, lying in wait for him, spotted a smartly
dressed Ghanshyam about to walk into the security zone around 5:40
am, boarding pass in hand for a Jet Airways flight to Delhi.
Ghanshyam, too, spotted and recognised one of the officers and
quickly made a U-turn, heading briskly towards the exit. But seeing
the detectives still coming after him, he gave up.
The businessman had turned up early at the airport and bought an
economy-class ticket using his credit card and giving his name as "G.
Shyam," the police said. "That he bought the ticket in a different
name reveals his culpability. He should be able to throw some light
on the pricing of the kits and how they were branded and later
distributed," a senior officer said. Ghanshyam has been charged with
cheating, forgery, activity leading to an epidemic and violating the
Drug and Cosmetics Act. The police said 4 more arrests were likely,
including that of the youngest Sarda brother, Jagdish, also in hiding.
Monozyme's kits, supplied past their expiry date, are feared to have
failed to detect HIV, hepatitis B virus infection or hepatitis C
virus infection in blood-bank samples, possibly infecting thousands
in Bengal. "As a key functionary of the company, Ghanshyam was aware
of everything (including) the decisions regarding kit distribution,"
said city detective chief Gyanwant Singh. The use-by dates on the
cartons and the kit boxes inside did not match; and dates were either
absent or smudged on the pouches. Yet doctors and lab technicians had
apparently failed to notice them.
Singh said the police would try and find out if some health
department staff had been "facilitators." The police will send the
entire lot of 1.10 lakh [110 000 - Mod.JW] kits seized from
hospitals, blood banks and clinics to the National Institute of
Biology, New Delhi, for a report on their condition. A large number
of kits were seized today from 3 private diagnostic centres in
Krishnagar, Malda and Cooch Behar, confirming fears that private
clinics, too, had bought faulty kits from Monozyme.

The Health Department has been struggling to minimise the impact of
the biggest health scam to have struck the State [West Bengal] in
past several decades. The scam is already threatening to extract a
heavy price as far as the health of the citizens is concerned.
Although Health Minister Suryakanto Mishra continued to keep his lips
sewed, reports from his Secretariat said the Government is now trying
to determine the extent of damage that may have been caused due to
transfusion of lakhs [100 000s] of infected units of blood that was
checked for purity with faulty kits over the last one year.
Though Government sources refused to speak on official terms,
unsubstantiated estimates suggested several thousand patients who
have received blood transfusions from elite Government hospitals
including the 4 medical colleges in the city [Kolkata (Calcutta)] and
one postgraduate college as well as the central blood bank, could
have contacted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,
hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection or even
venereal diseases.
In a startling development the State police over the past fortnight
made repeated raids at the Government health facilities to recover
hundreds of faulty 'detection kits' supplied by a well heeled
businessman Govinda Sarda. The imported kits had either passed their
use-by dates or their expiry dates were tampered with, the police
later said adding the kits might well have found their ways into
private health clinics or even smaller towns. The "well connected"
businessman has been arrested.
Though officials in the Health Department refused to specify,
unconfirmed reports say already more than 200 cases of contamination
have been reported. Among them a good 10 per cent is HIV infected,
sources said, hoping the number remains confined to a few hundred only.
Meanwhile, the officials on Saturday said circulars have been issued
to all the Government facilities not to use kits that have been
supplied to them since late in 2005. "We are trying to detect the
Government servants involved in the racket," was all that a senior
health official had to say. At another level the CPM mandarins on
Saturday denied the fact that the Minister's complacency and his poor
record had played a hand in triggering the disaster.
