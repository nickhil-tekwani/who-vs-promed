The mysterious deaths of 11 elephants in Zimbabwe may have been the result of bacterial infection, officials say. Authorities had already ruled out 2 possibilities after the carcasses were discovered on Friday [28 Aug 2020] in Pandamasue Forest, between Hwange National Park and Victoria Falls, in the west of the country.

The dead elephants were found with the tusks still on their bodies, meaning they were not killed by poachers, and cyanide poisoning has also been ruled out as a cause of the deaths.

Today [Tue 1 Sep 2020], Columbus Chaitezvi, principal veterinary officer at the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks), said that following preliminary tests, the agency suspected the elephants could have contracted a deadly bacterial infection while searching for food.

As the country enters the hot summer season, food becomes scarce, and younger elephants tend to eat grass and burrow into the soil, exposing themselves to bacteria, he said. "So far, the laboratory indication is that it's a bacteria infection, but we don't know what kind of bacteria it is," Chaitezvi told Reuters.

Zimparks spokesman Tinashe Farawo said the dead were aged between 5 and 6 years and less than 18 months. "You can see that those young ones can't reach for treetops, so they end up eating anything, which in some cases can be poisonous," said Farawo.

In recent years, hunters in Zimbabwe have poisoned dozens of elephants and taken their ivory tusks to flog to illegal traders.

Blood samples have since been taken to a laboratory to determine the cause of their deaths. Farawo said yesterday [Mon 31 Aug 2020], "We can only ascertain the cause of death after the tests, but we have ruled out cyanide poisoning. Only elephants were affected, no vultures or any other animals were affected. Initial tests show that it is not cyanide. We are also ruling out poachers because the tusks were intact."

Last year [2019] about 200 elephants in Zimbabwe died of starvation as a result of the country's drought. Africa was home to 1.3 million elephants in the 1970s, but today only around 500 000 remain. Zimbabwe has the 2nd-largest [elephant population], estimated at 85 000. Gangs hunted and killed elephants and rhinos to feed an Asian demand for ivory and horns for use in folk medicines.

Government says investigations to establish the exact cause of the mysterious death of 15 elephants in Pandamasue and Woodlands are ongoing with preliminary results showing that the animals could have succumbed to a bacteria.

The Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust, Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority veterinary doctor and other partners have stepped up efforts to zero in on the exact cause of the death of 15 elephants in Pandamasue and Woodlands area as the country seeks to solve the mystery.

Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu said while preliminary results point to a bacteria, _Pasteurella multocida_, there are no conclusive findings as of now of what could have caused the mysterious deaths of the elephants. "So far, the preliminary results are indicating that there is a bacteria known as _Pasteurella multocida_. It is the one they are suspecting and have ruled out anthrax. However, we continue to dig deeper to confirm the actual or definitive cause of deaths. So this is work in progress," he said.

A total of 11 elephants were found dead in Pandamasue Forest, which is under the Forestry Commission, while 4 other carcasses were discovered in Woodlands, which is under Matetsi Environmental Conservation Area Committee.

Meanwhile, the responsible authorities say there is still no evidence linking the mysterious death of elephants in Pandamasue to the recent death of 280 elephants in Botswana's Okavango Delta. "We do not have any conclusive evidence that might be linking these deaths to the Botswana elephant deaths. We are yet to have a link, and we believe that it is possible that the 2 might not be related," he said.

The Zimbabwean government, which has in the past raised concern over the challenges posed by ballooning elephant population, has also commenced aerial searches to establish if there are any other carcasses around the area.

Over the past few days, the responsible authorities have also taken precautionary measures by burning the carcasses of the jumbos to avoid the spread of the disease. Zimbabwe is home to the world's 2nd-largest elephant population, estimated at around 85 000.

[There are 2 relevant maps covering the affected areas: [1] a 2015 map with labels (https://www.jwksafaris.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/matetsi-safari-area-map.jpg), and [2] a newer, cleaner, but unlabeled map (https://www.jwksafaris.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zimbabwe-Updated-Map-2020.jpg). The Woodlands region, located adjacent to and immediately east of Panda Masuie, is an area with subsistence farming communities.

The correct name of the locality is the Panda-Masuie Forest Reserve, formerly classified as a "hunting block" (similar to "US Wildlife Management Area" status), where commercial professional safari hunting was allowed under concession permit status. The habitat type is Kalahari Sands Baikea woodland and _Combretum_ / _Julbernardia_ scrubland, with ecology similar in vegetation and hydrology to the southern half of Hwange National Park where I worked. The horizontal linear features shown in maps and imagery are the troughs (vleis) between the wooded crests of fossil sand dunes. There are likely no natural permanent surface water sources anywhere within the reserve itself, which is why it was allocated to wildlife/forest reserve status in the 1st place (and the last place. . .). (See https://mapcarta.com/14111768 and http://zw.geoview.info/panda_masuie_forest_area,883045).

While _P. multocida_ is currently the possible cause of at least the majority of deaths, there is also a measure of doubt. But anthrax has been ruled out. There are some who are willing to bet on cyanobacterial poisoning from contaminated ponds and water. Hopefully Harare will come up with the answer or answers. - Mod.MHJ
