Turkeys taken to Sofina Foods plant test positive for HPAI
----------------------------------------------------------
Turkeys taken to a processing plant in Perth County, Ontario, tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the Huron Perth Public Health (HPPH) agency reported. The agency issued a statement on the situation on 16 Dec 2022 stating the poultry was delivered by an independent 3rd party to the plant.

"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), along with Huron Perth Public Health (HPPH), the Ministry of Health and Public Health Ontario are working together with the plant operator to respond to the situation. As soon as this was identified, the plant operator took immediate action. The suspected poultry containing HPAI in question is all on hold and not in the public domain. The animal health response is being led by the CFIA, while HPPH is leading human health response by providing guidance to workers, employers and local health care providers," HPPH stated.

The London Free Press identified the plant as one operated by Sofina Foods.

Sofina Foods issued the following statement to the Free Press: "On 13 Dec 2022, a flock of turkeys was delivered to our processing facility in Mitchell. A small number of the turkeys tested positive for avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1. This was an isolated incident based on one delivery of birds from an independent, 3rd-party farm. Sofina took immediate action and has been working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Huron Perth public health to ensure the safety of our people, the public and our products."

WATT Global Media's requests for updates from CFIA and Sofina Foods have yet to receive responses.

Sofina Foods, according to the WATTPoultry.com Top Poultry Companies Database, operates in the chicken and turkey industries. Its poultry-related brands include Cuddy Food Products, Lilydale and Janes Family Foods.

British Columbia avian flu cases continue
-----------------------------------------
Two cases of HPAI were confirmed in Langley Township, British Columbia, on 20 Dec 2022, CFIA reported, bringing the township's total number of cases in 2022 to 9 and British Columbia's case count to 67.

Information concerning the flock sizes and the type of birds affected in these cases has not been disclosed.

Avian flu hits flock of 298 100 Minnesota turkeys
-------------------------------------------------
The latest case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to be confirmed in Minnesota involved a flock of 298 100 commercial meat turkeys. The latest case, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), was confirmed on 12 Dec 2022 and was located in Wadena County.

With this detection, Minnesota has now had 81 commercial poultry flocks affected by HPAI in 2022, resulting in the loss of nearly 4.2 million birds. However, this is the 1st operation to be affected by the virus this year [2022] in Wadena County.

Avian flu hits 7th Iowa turkey flock
------------------------------------
A new case of HPAI was confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in Ida County, Iowa, making it the 7th turkey flock to be affected by the virus so far in December [2022]. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDAL) announced the latest case in a press release, issued on 12 Dec 2022. This is the first case of HPAI to be confirmed in Ida County in 2022.

The other counties to have HPAI cases in December [2022] are Buena Vista, Sac and Cherokee. Each of those counties has had 2 confirmed cases this month [December 2022]. IDAL has not disclosed the size of any of those flocks, but APHIS has released information concerning 3 of those cases. A case confirmed on 5 Dec 2022 in Buena Vista County involved 40 700 turkeys. A case confirmed 7 Dec 2022 in Sac County involved 40 000 turkeys, while a case confirmed that same day [7 Dec 2022] in Cherokee County involved 105 000 turkeys.

Iowa has lost more birds to HPAI in 2022 than any other state. Not including losses from the 4 most recent cases in Iowa, the state has lost 15 682 300 birds to HPAI.

Cases continue in South Dakota
------------------------------
APHIS announced the presence of HPAI was confirmed in a commercial meat turkey flock in Hanson County, South Dakota, on 12 Dec 2022 affecting 23 900 turkeys.

This is the fourth case for Hanson County and the 59th for South Dakota in 2022.

Another potential avian flu case found in Indiana turkeys
---------------------------------------------------------
A commercial turkey flock in Martin County, Indiana, was depopulated after it was determined to be at high risk of exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).

The flock in question involved 27 083 turkeys, according to an email from the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH). The Martin County flock was depopulated because it "is associated with" another commercial turkey flock in Daviess County, which the BOAH reported as a presumptive positive case of HPAI on 11 Dec 2022.

BOAH further stated the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed a diagnosis of the H5N1 virus in the Daviess County flock, which included 11 394 turkeys.

According to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Indiana has had 9 cases of HPAI in commercial poultry flocks so far in 2022, but the figure does not include the Daviess County or Martin County turkey flocks. Of those 9 cases, 6 involved commercial meat turkeys, 2 involved commercial duck breeders and 1 involved commercial meat ducks.

[4] Washington (Franklin County): commercial chicken

Hoar frost collects like icy-armored spikes against the steady trunks of rural poplars. The stout trees define the edges of vast snowy crop fields in Franklin County, in south east Washington, from the white blur of flat land everywhere else.

But this bleak scene is made grimmer when approaching Oakdell Farms off of East Sagemoor Road, where highly pathogenic avian influenza is in a commercial flock of 1 015 500 -- more than a million -- chickens. State and federal officials aren't naming the farm, but there are few egg operations in Franklin County with that many fowl. At the edge of the farm, a man in winter coveralls sits warming from the 20-degree (F [almost -7 Celsius]) temps in a small white pickup with a utility light flashing.

When cars approach from the farm side toward the highway, he scrambles from the truck to stop them. He sprays a pink disinfectant from a large sprayer bottle with a hand wand over the tires. Signs out front -- some handmade on cardboard -- read "Biosecurity Control Area, Authorized Personnel Only," and "Do not enter, call ..."

The state received the USDA's confirmed test results on Wednesday [14 Dec 2022] -- that the chickens here do have highly pathogenic avian influenza, known as H5N1, said Amber Betts, a spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Agriculture.

More than a million birds live in several large long rectangular warehouse-like buildings. The buildings are painted desert tan, aside from one slate blue one, and built-in neat rows with massive air handling units at their ends.

It's going to be a massive job to clean up this property, and sanitize everything, Betts said. "No matter the size of the farm, whether it's a backyard or a commercial, whether it's 5 birds or a million, it's incredibly taxing on everybody that's involved," she said. "In addition to the birds themselves that are suffering this terrible virus, which is just brutal. It's not a good way to go out."

Birds getting sick with avian influenza are often seen with discharge from the eyes or nasal openings, a tilting head and sudden death. This is the first commercial flock ever to be infected in Washington state, although more than 30 backyard flocks have come down with the virus. In Oregon, there have been no commercial flocks infected so far, but more than 20 affected backyard flocks. And it all comes as 694 flocks -- 300 of them commercial -- are infected across the US so far this year [2022]. Bird flu has killed waterfowl and backyard flocks with a vengeance this year [2022], Betts said.

A million birds is a lot to process. Even when a backyard flock gets infected, state government officials treat biosecurity very seriously. But with a million birds -- that's around 6 million pounds [2.72 million kg] of chicken to dispose of if they're all full-grown. State officials said they, federal and county officials are weighing the options on how to safely transport, bury, compost or incinerate all the birds. No decision has been made yet.

Benton-Franklin Health District officials stressed the current risk of avian influenza infecting the general public is extremely low. The type of bird flu that is spreading in wild birds and domestic poultry in the US has only been identified in one person who had close contact with infected birds.

"There have been no cases of avian influenza identified in humans in Washington state," said Hannah Schnitzler, communicable disease epidemiologist with the Washington State Department of Health. That said, health officials advise people not to touch or move dead or sick wild birds and ask people to report such instances to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's online reporting tool.

Having to destroy animals they've taken care of for years and sometimes decades can be very distressing to those who work in these facilities, Betts said. "It's just devastating," she said. "When your chickens are part of your family, it's super difficult to watch them go through this. Or have to euthanize. And then, (at) an operation like this, it's just taxing on everybody. It's a lot of work. There's a lot of emotions from the producers as well as our veterinarians. It's just a very difficult thing to have to go through."

Oakdell is an egg operation that spans the West. According to its website, the company has operations in Lewiston, Utah; Franklin, Idaho; and outside of Pasco, Washington.

[5] Montana (Flathead County): back yard flock
Date: Thu 22 Dec 2022

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/montana-records-16th-case-of-bird-flu-this-year


The number of avian influenza cases in Montana has increased to at least 16 this year [2022], state officials announced. Montana Department of Livestock officials say the highly pathogenic avian influenza was responsible for killing a "small backyard poultry flock" in Flathead County.

"HPAI has impacted over 80 000 domestic birds in Montana," Montana state veterinarian Martin Zaluski said. "The impacts of this year's [2022] disease outbreak are substantial."

The outbreak in Montana began in March [2022], and authorities say the HPAI variant has killed more than 56 million birds in 47 states. Migratory waterfowl are believed to be the main cause for the spread, according to officials. The virus is transferred through feces, saliva, and respiratory secretions.

"Domestic poultry become infected through direct contact with wild birds, or through contact with contaminated objects, equipment, or the environment," MDOL said. MDOL said bird owners can protect flocks by preventing contact between wild or migratory birds and domestic poultry, as well as keeping house birds indoors.

"Sick birds can exhibit numerous signs such as swollen eyes, discolored comb and legs, a significant drop in egg production, or decrease in water and feed consumption," MDOL said. "However, the most common sign has been sudden death of multiple birds within a flock."

More information is available on the Montana Department of Livestock's website [https://liv.mt.gov/Animal-Health/Avian-Influenza-2022] , as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-flu-summary.htm].

[Sadly, the spring of 2022 saw the arrival of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and the virus has plagued the northern hemisphere for the year. The fall migration seems to be dragging this virus with it as the wild avian migrate to a warmer climate for the winter. Hopefully, this virus will die out or our birds will develop immunity to this particular strain. May 2023 be better to all of us, especially the poultry owners and operators, and most especially to our birds. - Mod.TG
