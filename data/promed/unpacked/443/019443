Even as health officials struggle to contain the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) menace through immunisation, early hospitalisation and awareness campaigns, 3 more patients were admitted to the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital (ANMMCH) [in Gaya, Bihar] during the last couple of days.

With this, the number of AES patients admitted to ANMMCH this season has gone up to 82. While 2 AES patients were admitted on [Tue 30 Aug 2016], one more patient was admitted on [Wed 31 Aug 2016].

AES patients are undergoing treatment in the children's ward of the hospital. Hospital superintendent Dr SK Sinha also confirmed that 3 new AES patients have been admitted to the hospital. The patients have undergone tests for Japanese encephalitis.

At this stage, hospital staff are not in a position to say whether the patients admitted are suffering from Japanese encephalitis or some other disease.

Altogether, 32 of the AES patients died in the hospital while another 9 are undergoing treatment, Dr Sinha said. While 40 patients were either discharged or were lured by touts operating in the hospital vicinity promising better treatment in private nursing homes. The mortality rate of the AES patients in Gaya is said to be on the higher side of the acceptable limit. It is well ahead of the average, feel experts.

Asked about the facilities available in the ANMMCH for rehabilitation of AES survivors, hospital superintendent SK Sinha said several facilities including trained physiotherapists are available in the hospital but the survivors rarely avail them. Once discharged, the survivors, despite counselling of the attendants do not come back for follow-up check up, said Dr Sinha.

This monsoon [2016], Japanese encephalitis (JE) has afflicted many in the rural parts of Kheri district [Uttar Pradesh]. So far, as many as 8 cases have already been confirmed by the health officials. Out of these cases, one patient has died while the others are being treated either at the district hospital in Lakhimpur or higher centres in Lucknow.

Health officials suspect that some patients may have succumbed to JE before their samples were sent to Lucknow for tests. There are no facilities to test JE in the district and samples have to be sent elsewhere for diagnosis. Most of the patients of encephalitis are children below 15 years of age. They are being kept under medical observation.

The health officials recently sent 19 samples to Lucknow and 8 tested positive for JE while the results of 2 samples are awaited. After detecting such a high number of JE cases in the district, a separate ward has been set up for JE patients. Those whose condition is critical have been referred to higher centres in Lucknow.

All the hospitals have been alerted in the district to provide details of suspected JE cases so that their samples can be sent to Lucknow for testing.

Dr IB Tripathi, who is in charge of the district hospital of Lakhimpur in the absence of CMS Dr Manoj Kumar, told TOI, "Most of the cases are being reported from rural areas, where there is poor hygiene and sanitation. The vector of this disease among humans is mosquitoes and unhygienic conditions in rural areas is the main reason for such a high number of cases there. We are now sending the samples of all the suspected cases to Lucknow and a separate ward has been set up for the patients."

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) occur frequently each year in this part of north eastern India, including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states.

Unfortunately, AES is an imprecise category and includes JE and other possible but unconfirmed etiologies. Although JE virus is involved as in Kheri district (Uttar Pradesh), the 2 other reports above do not indicate the etiological agent responsible for these encephalitis cases, but JE is likely there as well.

As noted in previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, lychee consumption, sun stroke, and enterovirus infection have been proposed. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts of JE virus and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors.
