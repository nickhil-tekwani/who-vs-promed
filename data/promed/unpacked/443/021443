British Hospitals on Mecca Meningitis Alert
-------------------------------------
British hospitals and doctors were on meningitis alert Saturday after 7
people died of a form of the disease found among Hajj pilgrims.
The Department of Health issued a warning to doctors, saying so far 29 cases
had been confirmed, one third among pilgrims themselves and the rest in
people who had come into contact with them since their return from Mecca.
The W135 strain of meningitis responsible for the outbreak is not [normally
found in Britain, but is prevalent in Saudi Arabia. It is the same strain
responsible for a separate outbreak that caused 4 deaths after last year's
Muslim pilgrimage.
More than 20 000 British Muslims are estimated to have traveled to Mecca in
February and March [2001. Pilgrims had been advised to be immunized with a
vaccine covering the strain, but health officials said the uptake prior to
the event this year had been low. [Does this imply that some pilgrims
traveled without being vaccinated? Saudi Arabia advertises a requirement
that all pilgrims entering the country must be vaccinated against
meningitis, but does not stipulate that the vaccine must contain the W135
strain. - Mod.JW
It is not known where the infected people are located or whether they are
adults or children.
Saudi Arabia said earlier this month [Apr 2001 that an outbreak of
meningitis in France among people returning from the pilgrimage did not
necessarily originate in the kingdom as it enforced strict preventative
measures.
The disease, in which bacteria invade the bloodstream, can kill within hours
unless diagnosed and treated. Symptoms include a purple or red rash, high
fever, a stiff neck, vomiting and an aversion to light.

[Yesterday's posting from Eurosurveillance Weekly (ref. above) mentioned 11
confirmed cases in the UK related to the 2001 Haj. According to this
article there have been 29 confirmed cases with 7 deaths in the UK. While
more detailed information on the age, sex and geographic distribution of the
cases within the UK is not given in this article, there is mention that the
cases have occurred in both returning pilgrims as well as in contacts of
returning pilgrims. The news article mentions that the specific vaccine for
W135 was recommended but "the uptake was low". As this is the second
consecutive year of _neisseria meningitidis_ W135 related to returning
pilgrims from Saudi Arabia with secondary cases in contacts, one wonders
whether compulsory vaccination should be considered.
In an excellent letter to the editor of Emerging Infectious Diseases (ref.
below), laboratory aspects of the strain of W135 associated with the
outbreak following the 2000 haj are presented. In this letter 3 of the 4
cases initially studied were vaccine failures, having received a
quadrivalent vaccine including W135, suggesting that more work on improving
the vaccineÂ´s efficacy was indicated (albeit specific data on the vaccine
efficacy was not presented). The news article above does not mention if the
cases in 2001 had a history of vaccination, just that the overall vaccine
acceptance was low. More information on this outbreak would be
appreciated. - Mod. MPP
