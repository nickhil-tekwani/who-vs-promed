Subject: Complex Vertebral Malformation, bovine

We recently recognized complex vertebral malformation (CVM) as a familial
occurring abnormality in Holstein calves. More than 30 cases have been
necropsied and about 100 reported by breeders during the last year. The
cases occur with only one or a few within each herd and, until now, in a
strict familial pattern in which both the sire and dam are genetically
related to the US Holstein bull "Bell."
We have performed a breeding trial with about 300 cows. If the disease was
inherited autosomal recessively about 30 malformed calves would have been
expected. We only got about 15. The causes of this are at present unknown,
but are currently under investigation. Calves may have been lost due to
abortion, or the rate of embryonic deaths may have increased. The cows were
selected based on a positive pregnancy diagnosis on day 52. The chromosomal
region in which the CVM gene is located has been identified. The region is
present on both chromosomes in affected calves and on one chromosome in the
parents.
Affected calves have been examined for bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV)
and antibodies against BVDV and _Neospora caninum_, in most cases with
negative results. Cases have been examined by necropsy, histopathology and
radiology without any evidence of an infectious etiology.
The skepticism from my point of view is based on 3 points:
1. The Danish breeding associations acted on the likely inheritance of CVM
very early, so the knowledge of CVM was distributed internationally before
we could finish our studies. Therefore, we couldn't provide published
scientific evidence.
2. Details regarding the genetic marker test were not made available due to
a patent application.
3. Cases have not been recorded in the US despite widespread use of sires
related to Bell. However, at least one case has now been diagnosed.

I'm sure you were hoping for rather more than this but, just in case no one
else has sent you anything, I have these rather thin pickings to contribute
to the complex vertebral malformation thread. It certainly doesn't look
like an infectious disease from this stuff. CVM is also called the
Nixon-Defect at least in Denmark -- named after KOL Nixon.
Denmark has developed a DNA test for CVM and is the only county performing
it. It was developed by researchers from Foulum and the Danish agricultural
school. They hope to patent it. After each positive DNA test the owner is
informed and a week later the test result is published on
<http://www.lr.dk>. The bulls will no longer be used for stud.
This is only in Denmark and the other Nordic countries. In other countries
it is up to the farmer what to do, if and when he is informed of the test
result. <http://www.naab-css.org/education/CVMNAAB.html>

[Ask & you shall receive. We are very grateful to Jorgen and Helena for
their excellent brief reports. As Jorgen says, it is strange that if CVM is
a genetic fault that to date there has been only one US report on this
condition, which seemingly is closely related to a US Holstein bull.
However, congenital problems have a bad habit of being hidden from public
view. Trust the Danes to make their reports publicly available. Here such a
public-spirited action would keep lawyers employed. I am surprised that
pregnancy was determined at Day +52; I would have gone for Day +36, but I
am not a theriogenologist. The difference, 15 calves vs 30 expected, might
be explained by early fetal death, as he notes. We will cut the thread at
this point and leave CVM to Jorgen & Helena to keep us informed if any
evidence emerges on an infectious component. - Mod.MHJ
