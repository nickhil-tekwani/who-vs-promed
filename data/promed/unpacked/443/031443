Additional Comment
------------------
I just want to add that at the Austrian experts´ meeting on travel medicine
(April 2000) we also asked the industry to either provide the southern
hemisphere´s vaccine in Austria (or the northern hemisphere´s [in southern
hemisphere countries), or to extend the availability / shelf-life of the
regular vaccine (with the expectation of [providing some cross-immunity),
which actually expires [in June/July with the subsequent vaccine not being
available before September.
As far as I know one of the big hints for a global-acting vaccine is the
composition (derived from highest possible actuality [derived from the
currently circulating strains) which leads to a time gap (northern
hemisphere: September / southern hemisphere: January [according to the
information of Pasteur Merieux MSD).
Hopefully doctors and the (traveling) public will become aware of the
increasing risk of travel-related severe influenza infections with the
age-shift of travelers as a co-factor.

A Problem for Frequent Travellers
---------------------------------
Re the [global flu vaccine: I support you 100 per cent. I've talked about
it with a number of people, and I'm not convinced that the present policy
of vaccinating people at different times in both hemispheres is sound. What
about frequent travellers, airline crews, etc., who cross the Equator every
day and spread viruses everywhere?
