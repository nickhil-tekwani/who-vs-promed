Responsible veterinary authorities imposed restrictions on a farm
after positive serological results in outdoor farmed pigs. The sera
were collected during a voluntary monitoring for this disease.

Further serological and bacteriological examinations confirmed the
diagnosis of brucellosis. Bacteriological differentiation performed
at the National Reference Laboratory at the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut identified the agent as _Brucella suis_
biovar 2. The pigs in question were culled and removed in agreement
with sanitary regulations.

_Brucella suis_ biovar 2 is the cause of porcine brucellosis in
Central Europe. In contrast to _Brucella suis_ biovar 1 and biovar 3,
biovar 2 is assumed to be pathogenic for humans only under certain
circumstances, i.e. long-term immunosuppressive treatment.
Nevertheless, sanitary regulations as outlined in the German animal
disease legislation also apply to pigs infected with _Brucella suis_ biovar 2.

Biovar 2 of _Brucella suis_ is present in wild boars and hares in
Germany as shown by a serological survey (Melzer et al., 2006).
Various isolations of this agent in the last few years from both
animal species confirmed this finding.

How the pathogen was introduced into the farm has not been elucidated
so far. The local state veterinarian acknowledged that this outdoor
farm operates according to the rules. Three brucellosis outbreaks
have been notified up to now in Germany in 2008. All were registered
in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Germany is officially free of
brucellosis in cattle, sheep and goats.

Re: Brucellosis, porcine - Germany: (MV) 20080918.2927
-----------------------------------------------
I would like to make the following comment in relation to the
moderator's statement, "Since _B. suis_ is pathogenic to humans, the
statement "there is no danger to humans" is in need of clarification
or reconsideration."

Yes, brucellosis is a zoonosis, but this does not mean that all
_Brucella_ species or all biovars within a given _Brucella_ species
are pathogens for humans. Indeed, the species _Brucella ovis_,
_Brucella neotomea_ and _Brucella microti_ are not regarded as human
pathogens, and within the _Brucella suis_ species, _B. suis_ biovar 2
has been reported to infect humans only in very rare instances, for
example, if they are immuno-compromised. Recent data suggest that
within the marine mammal brucellae, some isolates are true human
pathogens, whereas others are not able to infect human macrophage
cell lines and thus are very unlikely to be human pathogens.

In the particular case of Germany, _Brucella suis_ biovar 2
infections in wild boars have been known for decades and were
extensively described in the former DDR (Dedek et al., 1986). The
statement: "The Veterinary authorities consider that the most likely
route of transmission was by wildlife, especially wild boar.
Therefore, free-range animals are particularly affected by the
disease" strongly suggests that _B. suis_ biovar 2 is involved in
this outbreak, and, hence, reference made to "data on the disease in
humans are derived from Mod.LL's commentary in ProMED-mail posting
20040401.0883" is out of the context of this particular case.

So, to summarize, my point is that such a case should be used to
highlight that all _Brucella_ species are not equally pathogenic for
humans. By not doing so, we miss a golden opportunity to inform, and,
more importantly, we may mislead ProMED-mail readers.

[The original article in the official regional website of
Mecklenburg/Western Pomerania included the statement "there is no
danger to humans" (in German: "Gefahr fur Menschen bestehe nicht").
The comprehensive response of Prof Godfroid, a world authority on
brucellosis, to our call for clarification is indeed eye-opening and
much appreciated.

See also the following: "The pathogenicity for humans of _B. suis_
biovars 1, 3 and 4 is well established, whereas _B. suis_ biovar 2
seems to be less pathogenic. Indeed, although hunters and pig farmers
have repeatedly experienced infectious contact with _B. suis_ biovar
2 (found in wild boar and outdoor-rearing pigs in Europe), isolation
of _B. suis_ biovar 2 from human samples have only been seldom
reported." (Referenced from the abstract of: Godfroid J, Cloeckaert
A, Liautard JP, Kohler S, Fretin D, Walravens K, Garin-Bastuji B,
Letesson JJ.(2005). From the discovery of the Malta fever's agent to
the discovery of a marine mammal reservoir, brucellosis has
continuously been a re-emerging zoonosis. Vet Res. 36(3):313-26).

Thus, while _B. suis_ serovar 2 is less pathogenic than the other
serovars, the unequivocal statement "no danger to humans" justified
the call for clarification.

The fact that some other brucellae such as _B. ovis_ and _B.
neotomae_ are regarded non-pathogenic for humans has been referred to
in previous postings (e.g. 20020905.5234, 20041222.3371,
20071206.3936). - Mod.AS]
