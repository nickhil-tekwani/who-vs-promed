A teenager who fell ill with leptospirosis after swimming in one of the ponds of the Korsun-Shevchenkivsky district near Cherkasy [Cherkasy province], died in Okhmatdyt Hospital, in Kyiv. He showed the 1st signs of illness less than 2 weeks after swimming in the pond. The teenager was in a serious condition, the disease led to serious complications, and the doctors could no longer save the boy.

Oksana Kolesnik, Acting Director of the Brovary Regional Branch of the State Institution "Kyiv Regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine" said at an operational meeting on July 25 [2022], that the tragedy occurred on 17 Jul 2022].

On 11 Jul 2022, the boy's parents went to a private clinic, where he received outpatient treatment. The parents treated their son at home.

When the schoolboy became worse 4 days later, the parents went to outpatient clinic No. 2 in Brovary, and the teenager was transferred to the infectious diseases department of the children's hospital.

The boy's legs began to fail, and the patient was urgently transported to the specialized children's hospital "Okhmatdyt " in Kyiv. Unfortunately, it was not possible to save him and on 17 Jul 2022, he died.

A dangerous infectious disease, [leptospirosis] is caused by the _Leptospira_ bacterium; if left untreated, it can lead to damage to the kidneys, liver, meningitis, and even death.

Sources of the bacteria are infected animals (sick and carriers of the pathogen) -- mainly small mammals (murine and waterfowl [?] rodents), insectivores, farm animals, dogs, industrial [?] animals (foxes, etc.). The disease is not transmitted from person to person, according to the Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine.

The pathogen enters the water with the urine of infected animals (most often rodents). You can get leptospirosis while swimming, fishing in contaminated water bodies, fish development, haymaking in wet areas, caring for sick and infected animals, etc.

The causative agent of leptospirosis enters the human body: through cuts, skin wounds, through mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth). Infection is also possible after ingestion of contaminated food and water. In Ukraine, leptospirosis is seasonal and increases in spring and summer, when people spend more time near water bodies.

A person can become ill 2 to 4 weeks after infection. Symptoms range from mild (headache, fever, muscle aches, red eyes, diarrhea, rash) to severe (kidney, liver, meningitis) illness and even death (with untimely access to medical care and treatment).

Leptospirosis is often difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other diseases: they can resemble flu, more common in autumn and winter. Sometimes the disease can be asymptomatic.

If you suspect leptospirosis, you should immediately consult a doctor, and treatment should begin as soon as possible.
