In Egypt, a 7th person has died as a result of H5N1 infection,
Cairo's Al-Wafd newspaper reported on its Web site yesterday [Thu 6
Jul 2006]. An 18-year-old woman died at the general hospital of Qena,
in southern Egypt, several days after her hospitalization, the
newspaper said, citing Ahmed Farrag, a regional legal official who
authorized the woman's burial. The report didn't say when the woman died.

[2] Indonesia - suspected 41st death

A 3-year-old Indonesian girl who died this week has tested positive
for bird flu, a Health Ministry official said on Friday [7 Jul 2006],
citing a local test. If confirmed by a World Health Organisation
(WHO) laboratory, the girl from Jakarta's western suburbs will be the
41st bird flu death in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago where the
virus has killed millions of fowl and which has had more human deaths
in 2006 than any other country.
"The child had had contact with sick fowl, the neighbour's chickens,"
Runizar Ruesin, head of the Health Ministry's Bird Flu Information
Centre, told Reuters. Human cases generally stem from contact with
infected birds. "She died on Thursday, 9 hours after being admitted
to hospital," he said.
According to the WHO, the H5N1 avian flu virus has killed 131 people
across the globe since 2003. In Indonesia, 40 people are confirmed by
WHO tests to have died from the virus, endemic in poultry in nearly
all the country's 33 provinces. On Thursday a senior Indonesian
government official said the country's poultry death rate from bird
flu was worsening, possibly due to poor vaccination coverage. Mathur
Riyadi, director general of livestock production at the agriculture
ministry, said one million fowl, half of them quail, died of bird flu
in the first 3 months of 2006. In 2005, deaths for the year as a
whole were 1.2 million. The government has so far shied away from
mass culling, citing lack of funds and impracticality, with
vaccination a preferred method to prevent the spread of bird flu among poultry.
Animal health experts say a large numbers of backyard farms and a
lack of resources are a major impediment for effective vaccination in
Indonesia, a sprawling country of 17 000 islands stretching across
5000 km (3100 miles). It is common for Indonesian households to keep
a handful of chicken for personal consumption or gaining extra
revenue. The National Commission of Avian Flu Control and
Preparedness estimates there are around 300 million such backyard chickens.
