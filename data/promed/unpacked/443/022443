The number of people infected by [a] hantavirus in the Araucanía region climbed to 14, after the report of a case in a 41-year-old man from Villarrica who presented with symptoms; after he was examined it was confirmed he had the virus. He is hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Hernan Henriquez Aravena Hospital in Temuco.

Given this case, the Health SEREMI [regional ministerial unit] Carlos Gonzalez issued a call to take preventive measures to avoid possible infections.

So far this year [2017], there have been 3 deaths due to hantavirus [infections], so that the main recommendations proposed by the Health SEREMI are to maintain food stuff protected from contact by rodents, air out for 30 min storage areas that have been closed for a long period of time, and keep garbage in closed recipients, among others.

[The numbers of hantavirus infection cases in the Araucanía region continues to increase this year (2017). Although the report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the individual might have acquired his hantavirus infection, investigations in the locality of his likely exposure could provide additional information. His infection may have been acquired by exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in this cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Araucania region and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://tinyurl.com/y7c7tnhg.
