Iron and heavy metals in forage have been implicated in a British
study as a cause of equine grass sickness [EGS].

Research conducted by a team from the School of Pharmacy at the
University of London found significantly higher levels of iron and
heavy metals in herbage growing in sites prone to equine grass
sickness, as well as an abundance of toxic buttercups.

Their findings, published in the journal, Frontiers in Pharmacology,
also indicated that cyanobacteria in drinking water are unlikely to
be a factor as they were absent in the samples analysed.

The findings suggest that the presence of 2 or more causative factors
could be the trigger for an outbreak of the disease, and the
combination of both seems to be a key predictor.

Equine grass sickness, not to be confused with ryegrass staggers, is
a dangerous disease of horses, ponies, and donkeys. With a mortality
rate of more than 90 per cent, researchers are desperate to find a
way of stopping the illness, first identified in Scotland more than
100 years ago. The disease, also known as equine dysautonomia, occurs
throughout northern Europe, but particularly in Great Britain. It
primarily affects animals between the age of 2 and 7 years who are
pasture-grazed.

Visible signs include colic, difficulty in swallowing, drooling,
muscle tremors, rapid weight loss, and behavioral abnormalities. The
disease causes impaired intestinal activity as a result of damage to
the autonomic nervous system.

While there have been several scientific studies investigating the
disease, the causative agents have remained speculative, hindering
efforts to develop diagnostic testing and treatment.

It is likely that the disease is linked to elements of the animals'
diet, either in the food or the drinking water.

"Previous studies have implicated anaerobic bacteria, notably
_Clostridium botulinum_, but what triggers the severe bacterial
infestations remains enigmatic," the London researchers noted.

"We hypothesized that a detailed comparison of soil mineral and
botanical composition of equine grass sickness and control sites
would yield new insights into the causation of the disease."

The research team analyzed soil, plant, and water samples from a
total of 23 sites where horses were prone to equine grass sickness
and 11 control sites.

"Significantly, equine grass sickness sites had higher levels of soil
nitrogen, and significantly higher levels of iron, lead, arsenic, and
chromium in the herbage," the researchers said.

"Toxic _Ranunculus_ spp. (buttercups) were found in abundance at
every EGS site, making ingestion plausible.

"Conversely, neurotoxin-producing cyanobacteria were not found in any
of the water samples analyzed.

The significantly higher levels of iron and heavy metals found in
herbage growing at the grass sickness sites, in addition to toxic
buttercups, suggested previously unknown triggers were involved,"
they said.

Britain has had a national surveillance scheme in place for the
disease since 2006.

April to June is predominantly the time when the number of equine
grass sickness cases peak in Britain.

[Toxicities of individual heavy metals are well documented, as are
the effects of _Ranunculus_ spp. on horses. However, different levels
of the metals and the combination and concentration of the metals has
likely not been studied nearly as thoroughly.

Grass sickness is a seasonal disease and generally affects horses
predominately on pasture. Few to no cases occur in North America. In
2004 it was linked to low antibodies to _Clostridium botulinum_.

The other name for the disease -- equine dysautonomia -- implies a
neurological component. Indeed, a polyneuritis syndrome affecting
peripheral and enteric nervous system components. Colic and weight
loss are 2 of the most common signs associated with this disease. It
generally has an acute presentation.

If indeed these metals are the cause, then using chelators or finding
how to drop the heavy metals content in the grasses would be very
beneficial. Mod.TG]
