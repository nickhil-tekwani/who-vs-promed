Twenty-one students living in the girls' hostel of Government Post-Graduate College, Dharamshala, were rushed to the hospital on Wednesday [16 Feb 2022] morning after they complained of vomiting and diarrhea, which doctors said could be due to food poisoning. Kanika, the hostel warden, said a few students complained of nausea on Tuesday [15 Feb 2022] night, and their numbers increased by the next morning. Some of them also complained of stomachache, after which they were rushed to the Zonal Hospital in Dharamshala and discharged after being treated.

Senior medical officer Dr Ajay Dutta said a total of 21 girls were brought to the hospital in the morning and had a common complaint of vomiting and stomachache. They live in the same hostel and had taken their meals in the hostel mess, so there is possibility of food poisoning, he said, adding that most cases of water-borne diseases start with vomiting. He said that hospital authorities have informed the district administration and district health officer so that they may carry out a proper investigation. Besides, samples have been taken randomly from among the sick students to ascertain the reason, he said.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for this post.

It is not stated how long after the meal (the incubation period) the symptoms began. Foodborne illnesses with primarily nausea and vomiting tend to occur without fever (i.e., staphylococcal enterotoxin induced). ProMED would appreciate more information about this outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.LL
