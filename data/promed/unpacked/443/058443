[3] China (Chongqing): imported case, details
Source: Caixin Global [edited]
https://www.caixinglobal.com/2022-09-21/chongqing-monkeypox-patient-caught-the-disease-in-berlin-china-cdc-says-101942916.html


The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has disclosed details of the mainland's 1st monkeypox case, saying the patient was a 29-year-old salesman who had recently visited Germany, where he had sex with men.

The man said he had sexual contact with men in Berlin on 2 Sep 2022, according to a weekly report published by the China CDC on Monday [19 Sep 2022]. He subsequently traveled to Spain and developed symptoms including an itchy throat, fever, and rashes. On 14 Sep 2022, he returned to the southwestern Chinese municipality of Chongqing and was isolated in a local COVID-19 quarantine facility, according to the report.

Gene sequencing suggests that the virus strain of the imported case, which was confirmed in Chongqing on Friday [16 Sep 2022], belongs to the B.1 branch of the West African lineage of the disease, and is "highly" similar to strains from Germany collected on 21 Jun [2022], the report said.

[4] Sudan: 5 new cases
Date: Tue 20 Sep 2022 1:55 PM EET
Source: Journal-Courier, Associated Press (AP) report [abridged, edited]
https://www.myjournalcourier.com/news/article/Sudan-detects-5-more-cases-of-monkeypox-amid-17454703.php


Sudan on Tuesday [20 Sep 2022] announced 5 more cases of the monkeypox virus, bringing the tally up to 7 patients.

The Health Ministry said in a statement the new cases were detected in the capital of Khartoum and the provinces of West Darfur, North Darfur, and Kassala. The statement did not provide further details.

Of the 7 cases, 4 were detected so far in the county were in West Darfur, including the 1st patient of the virus.

Sudan's healthcare system has been the victim of long-running domestic conflicts and recent political upheaval, as well as international isolation. It would be hard pressed to handle a large outbreak of the new disease.

[5] Democratic Republic of the Congo: tecovirimat treatment trial
Date: October 2022
Source: The Lancet Infectious Diseases [edited]
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00604-1/fulltext


ref: Nakkazi E. Monkeypox trial to begin in DR Congo. Lancet Infect Dis. 2022; 22(10): 1425
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As The Lancet Infectious Diseases went to press, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had plans to begin a large clinical trial of tecovirimat for the treatment of monkeypox. Tecovirimat first received regulatory approval for this indication, as well as for infections caused by other orthopoxviruses, from the European Medicines Agency in 2021, largely based on efficacy data from animal models. It was originally approved in 2018 for the treatment of smallpox.

DR Congo reported the 1st case of human monkeypox in 1970 and has had recurrent outbreaks since. In spite of this, "this will be the 1st clinical trial [of a monkeypox therapeutic] in Africa and only after the disease is a global problem", said Daniel Mukadi, the Regional Director of the National Institute of Biomedical Research in eastern DR Congo. "We are supportive of clinical trials being done here on the continent. The need for Africa to participate in the development of vaccines and therapeutics is one of our priorities. We encourage developers to come work with us in Africa", said Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, Acting Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

DR Congo officials say they have completed training of staff who will implement the trial, but the remoteness of some of the sites and the ongoing pandemic will require special community engagement and communication strategies. "Communication and social mobilisation will be key tools to help us succeed with community engagement. We have to ensure that messages passed to the communities are correct and very clear", said Mukadi.

Although DR Congo has done many similar studies for different diseases, including Ebola, the environment for monkeypox is different in the same part of eastern DR Congo. For instance, one of the sites has active monkeypox cases in a very remote setting where the only source of power is solar, there is no infrastructure, and the virus has never been isolated before.

"It's a new challenge for us -- for example, we don't have the same setting as we did for Ebola. The platforms look different, but the context is still the same. We are in the eastern DRC in a remote area and we do have a background of COVID-19 ongoing and people know more about Ebola from the past 3 years in the same area", said Mukadi.

Between 1 Jan and 1 Sep 2022, 51 163 laboratory-confirmed cases and 302 probable cases of monkeypox, including 17 deaths, had been reported to WHO from 102 Member States across all 6 WHO regions. Since May [2022], a high proportion of these cases have been reported from non-endemic countries. The WHO African Region reported 521 cases in the year up to 1 Sep 2022, including 195 in DR Congo and 220 in Nigeria. Case numbers could be higher but underreported. Researchers in Africa are trying to increase genomic surveillance in the region. Ifedayo Adetifa, Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, said that they are sequencing prospective samples and already catching up with historical cases.

DR Congo has a monkeypox programme with survivors, but it is poorly funded. "Monkeypox was of less interest for most people and not funded...it was thought to be African and only for Africans. Once we have cases out of Africa, so it becomes now a public health emergency, which is the same for Ebola", said Makadi.

But even as cases are rising, and the disease is ranked 3rd in Africa in terms of burden, Africa has no access to monkeypox therapeutics and vaccines. WHO has recommended that vaccines, once available, target only the most at-risk populations, including health workers. WHO officials say they are engaging with manufacturers and some of the countries that have access to them. "At this moment, we do not recommend mass vaccination, but targeted vaccination in the context of pre and post exposure prophylaxis for contacts", said Otim Patrick Ramadan, Health Emergency Officer at the WHO Regional Office for Africa. "We are also working with countries to prepare to develop the necessary regulatory approvals in the event that the vaccines become available so they can be used for the higher risk groups and contacts."

Monkeypox transmission in Africa still varies from elsewhere, mostly manifested at the household level, presenting a picture that has not changed much from what has been seen there before. WHO officials said they have not seen evidence or reports of transmission related to sexual activity in Africa. "Of course, we understand that in our region, the issue around sexuality is very sensitive and most times people will not be forthcoming", said Ramadan.

As the trial in DR Congo unfolds, a more coordinated monkeypox international response is expected, with further research into the disease and the ramping up of therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccine production.

"We hope that manufacturers will agree to produce more therapeutics because of the world emergency. We have no idea about the costs for the therapeutics so far, but hopefully development partners will step in to purchase them and make them widely available", said Mukadi.

[6] Portugal: vaccination
Date: Wed 21 Sep 2022 1:14 PM GMT+2

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/portugal-approves-preventive-monkeypox-vaccination-risk-groups-2022-09-21/


Portugal's health authority widened its monkeypox vaccination strategy to include preventive shots for groups most at risk and approved the use of smaller doses, an approach known as "dose-sparing", due to limited supplies, it said on Wednesday [21 Sep 2022].

The country has been one of the hotspots of monkeypox infections in Europe, with 908 confirmed cases, most of them men under the age of 40. No deaths have been reported so far.

The health authority DGS [Directorate-General of Health] said priority groups include people who are at increased risk of contracting the virus, such as "men who have sex with other men", as well as health professionals.

The preventive vaccination logistics strategy will be managed at a regional level, after identifying eligible citizens in a specialist consultation.

With the new strategy, Portugal follows in the footsteps neighbouring Spain or Britain, which also approved the use of smaller doses of the monkeypox vaccine following a European Medicines Agency decision.

Portugal received 2700 doses of the Bavarian Nordic's (BAVA.CO) Imvanex vaccine in July [2022] and has started vaccinating close contacts.

[7] USA (Utah): Latino and Pacific Islanders disproportionate
Date: Tue 20 Sep 2022
Source: KSLTV [edited]
https://ksltv.com/506383/monkeypox-affecting-latino-and-pacific-islander-utahns-disproportionately/


[This report has a graph that shows that a higher proportion of the Hispanic and Pacific Islander populations have monkeypox than does the Non-Hispanic white population. - Mod.TY]

Monkeypox is impacting Latino and Pacific Islander Utahns at a disproportionate rate.

Although Latinos make up just 15% of the state's population, they make up 34% of cases. Likewise, Pacific Islanders, who are 1% of the population, make up 4% of cases. White individuals make up 77% of Utah but are only 50% of cases.

The Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported 142 cases of monkeypox as of Monday evening [19 Sep 2022]: 71 among white individuals, 48 among Hispanic individuals, and 6 among Pacific Islander individuals. The department did not release data for races that have had fewer than 5 cases due to privacy concerns.

"We continue to engage a variety of community partners to connect with people from different racial and ethnic groups," [Utah Health] department spokeswoman Charla Haley said when asked what the department is doing to target the disparities.

Haley said the department is not participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Monkeypox Vaccine Equity Pilot Program. The program is intended to help local, state, and tribal governments reach underserved populations.

"The program only provides extra vaccine. We currently have sufficient vaccine," Haley said. "If the program provided additional resources, such as funding to host specific outreach programs, we would apply. We reached out to CDC about this, but congressional funding has not been allocated for this action."

The state health department reported that 3745 individuals had received a monkeypox vaccine as of Monday afternoon [19 Sep 2022]. Unlike case counts, vaccinations have been more equitably spread out across race and ethnicity.

Utah's data mirrors national monkeypox trends, with Black and Hispanic individuals accounting for 54% of cases despite representing only 1/3 of the general population.

"The percentage of vaccines administered to Latino or Hispanic men and non-Hispanic Black men are disproportionately lower than we are seeing represented in cases," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told Reuters last week [week of 12 Sep 2022].

It's not yet clear what factors are driving the disparities, but it's a similar pattern to the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit communities of color disproportionately.
