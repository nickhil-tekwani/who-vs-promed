Abstract
Living in groups provides benefits but incurs costs such as attracting disease vectors. For example, synanthropic flies associate with human settlements, and higher fly densities increase pathogen transmission. We investigated whether such associations also exist in highly mobile non‐human primate groups (NHP). We studied flies in a group of wild sooty mangabeys (_Cercocebus atys atys_) and 3 communities of wild chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes verus_) in Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We observed markedly higher fly densities within both mangabey and chimpanzee groups. Using a mark‐recapture experiment, we showed that flies stayed with the sooty mangabey group for up to 12 days and for up to 1.3 km (0.8 mi). We also tested mangabey-associated flies for pathogens infecting mangabeys in this ecosystem, _Bacillus cereus_ biovar _anthracis_ (Bcbva), causing sylvatic anthrax, and _Treponema pallidum pertenue_, causing yaws. Flies contained treponemal (6/103) and Bcbva (7/103) DNA. We cultured Bcbva from all PCR‐positive flies, confirming bacterial viability and suggesting that this bacterium might be transmitted and disseminated by flies. Whole genome sequences of Bcbva isolates revealed a diversity of Bcbva, likely derived from several sources. We conclude that flies actively track mangabeys and carry infectious bacterial pathogens; these associations represent an understudied cost of sociality and potentially expose many social animals to a diversity of pathogens.

Humans aren't the only primates flies follow around. The insects tail monkeys, too, according to a new study, and they can carry deadly pathogens such as anthrax.

Researchers followed a group of approximately 60 wild sooty mangabeys (their relative, the gray mangabey, is pictured), small furry monkeys with light-colored eyelids and long slender arms and legs, in the tropical rainforest of Tai National Park in Ivory Coast. They caught flies within the group of mangabeys and at distances up to 1 km (0.6 mi) away. The researchers found about 8 to 11 times more flies inside the group than in the rest of the forest. The same was true for 3 different groups of chimps.

Next, the team gently dabbed nail polish on nearly 1600 flies to find out whether the same group of insects followed the mangabeys, or whether the primates attracted different flies as they moved through the trees. The marked flies kept turning up around the mangabeys, even 12 days later when the group had moved more than 1 km away, the team reports in Molecular Ecology.

Nearly 12% of the flies carried sylvatic anthrax, which causes more than 38% of wildlife deaths in rainforest ecosystems. The researchers hypothesize that flies could be at least partially responsible for the persistent spread of the disease, which is transmitted by a different microbe from the type of anthrax that infects people. A few flies also carried the bacterium that causes yaws, a disfiguring skin disease that affects both humans and animals.

Next, the team will explore whether flies follow groups of hunter-gatherer humans around, and whether these fly behaviors have caused primates to change their own behavior over time. Although mangabeys are known to use tools, researchers have not yet observed them wielding fly swatters.

[This team reported a 3-decade study of the flies in this national park and the apparent involvement also of chimpanzees in sylvatic anthrax. This was published in Nature; see Anthrax, chimpanzee - Cote d'Ivoire (Tai National Park): 2017 20170803.5225673. The current study expands the part played by sooty mangabeys and their associated flies. All in all, a fascinating volume of research in a form of anthrax that few of us witness. The team is to be congratulated. And thanks to Michael for forwarding the links.

For a description of this Ivory Coast national park and a map showing its location, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%AF_National_Park. There were more than 2000 West African chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes verus_) in the 1980s. In 1995, Marchesi et al. estimated the total number of chimpanzees in Tai to be 4507, with perhaps 292 in N'Zo and nearby reserves (however, there is no doubt that such numbers have declined in the past 15 years). Further information on the current status of great apes within this park is available at the following link http://apes.eva.mpg.de/apeswiki/index.php/Ta%C3%AF_National_Park. - Mod.MHJ
