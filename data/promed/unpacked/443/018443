During the 1st half of 2010, 10 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) were recorded in the Moscow Oblast. This is 3 times
more than during the same period in the preceding year. In 7 of these
10 cases, rodents were confirmed as the source of the infection.
Concern has been expressed by some medical authorities about the
possibility of an epidemic in the oblast.

[HFRS is caused by the hantavirus species _Puumala virus_, carried by
the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_). This virus is widespread across
most of Europe, except for the UK, the Mediterranean coastal regions
and the northernmost areas. Other hantaviruses occur in Europe, but
have lesser public health importance. The clinical features in
patients with hantavirus infection are variable, from asymptomatic to
severe. The incubation period is relatively long, mostly 2-3 weeks,
but may be up to 6 weeks.

In endemic areas, hantavirus infection should be suspected if acute
fever is accompanied by thrombocytopenia, headache, often very
severe, and abdominal and back pains without clear respiratory tract
symptoms. The case fatality rate due to _Puumala virus_ infection
ranges between less than 0.1 and 0.4 percent. Recovery usually begins
during the 2nd week, but full recovery may, however, take weeks.
Longer-lasting complications are rare, and include
glomerulonephritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hypopituitarism, and
hypertension. [For further information see:
<http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/hantavirus/basic_facts/pages/factsheet_health_professionals.aspx>.]

Infected rodents excrete hantaviruses in the urine, faeces and
saliva, and human infection takes place mostly via inhalation of
aerosolised virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Therefore,
rodent-infested dusty places are risk sites. No human-to-human
transmission is known for European hantaviruses. No arthropod vectors
are known for hantaviruses. Occupations such as forestry workers and
farmers have an increased risk of exposure. Since _Puumala virus_
remains infective outside the host for a long period (for 2 weeks at
room temperature), the risk of infection can persist after rodents
have been removed.

The Capital city of Moscow is at the centre of the Moscow Oblast,
which is one of the most densely populated areas of Russia. A map of
