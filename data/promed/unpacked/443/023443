The North Dakota Department of Health said one person has died from
hantavirus infection.

Health officials are saying very little about the case, but the
person who died is from the western part of the state, according to
WDAY AM Radio. More information is expected to be released Wednesday
[3 Sep 2008].

Hantavirus causes a deadly disease, and humans contract the disease
when they come into contact with infected rodents or their urine and
droppings. The Centers for Disease Control said the virus was 1st
recognized in 1993, and about 35 percent of reported cases result in death.

[The hantavirus involved in this case is not stated but probably is
Sin Nombre virus, harbored by the deer mouse (_Peromyscus
maniculatus_), a very widely distributed mammal in North America.
