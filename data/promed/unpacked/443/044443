9 cases of anthrax seen in Ilococ Norte
---------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DoH) today disclosed that 9 human cases of
anthrax, associated with 2 separate incidents, were being monitored in
Barangay Matibag Banna, Ilocos Norte. A surveillance report gathered by the
National Epidemiology Center and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine
revealed that the cases became ill on 2 October and 7 November [2001.
On 2 October, after a dead carabao was butchered and eaten by townsfolk, 6
people developed signs consistent with cutaneous anthrax. On 7 November,
when another carabao died and was butchered and eaten, 3 people developed
skin lesions. A third carabao died on 19 November. The animal was not
butchered but was dehorned.
Epidemiologists swabbed the carabao's horns for culture. A preliminary
laboratory report revealed the presence of _Bacillus anthracis_ in the
animal's horns. According to the report, all 9 patients self-medicated with
various antibiotics. At the time of investigation, the skin lesions had
already healed.
"These incidents should not, in any way, be construed as a form of
bioterrorist attack," Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit said. On the contrary,
it illustrates the fact that anthrax occurs naturally as a disease of
cattle. Moreover, the health chief assured the public that human-to-human
transmission of anthrax is very unlikely and that antibiotics are available
locally. He warned that people should always consult a doctor before taking
antibiotics. He also assured the public that government facilities are
prepared to deal with anthrax cases.

[This pattern of human cases following exposure to dead carabao is typical.
