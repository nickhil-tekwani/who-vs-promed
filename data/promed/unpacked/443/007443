An outbreak of potentially deadly flesh-eating disease erupted among
Winnipeg's homeless last year [2008], infecting 12 people with an invasive
bacteria that spreads rapidly and causes severe pain and disfiguration.
Winnipeg health officials did not publicly disclose that a cluster of cases
was reported in the city area between April and October 2008 until
questioned by the Winnipeg Free Press this week.

Dr Pierre Plourde, a Winnipeg medical officer of health, said inner-city
shelters were alerted about the spike in cases and told to watch for anyone
with wounds or sore throats who may be at an increased risk of developing
the infection. He said there were 4 or 5 strains of flesh-eating disease
that were reported, and there was no evidence that anyone infected
transmitted the disease to another person.

Nine of the 12 people infected had recently suffered a major injury,
including one person who was severely burned in a fire. Plourde said no one
infected died of flesh-eating disease. Manitoba's chief medical examiner Dr
Thambirajah Balachandra confirmed a total of 5 people died from
flesh-eating disease in 2008, including one death [each] in August, October
and November 2008, the same time the outbreak occurred in downtown
Winnipeg. Plourde could not confirm whether any patients had limbs amputated.

Plourde said the bacteria can infect anyone, but people who have weakened
immune systems or open wounds or who have recently undergone surgery are
more at risk. He said the city's homeless population tends to delay seeking
medical treatment until they're in dire need.

Flesh-eating disease is a bacteria[l infection] that quickly destroys
tissue and muscles, and originates from the same bacteria that causes strep
throat [_Streptococcus pyogenes_, also called group A streptococcus or
GAS]. It can cause death in as little as 12 to 24 hours but can be treated
with heavy doses of antibiotics and with surgery to remove diseased tissue.
Often, afflicted limbs are amputated to save someone's life.

There are typically less than 4 cases of flesh-eating disease in Manitoba a
year, and Plourde said health officials 1st noticed a pattern among the
cluster of cases in September 2008. He said no new cases have been reported
since October 2008 and that the public wasn't notified of the outbreak
since it was concentrated among a small number of inner-city residents. "We
have no evidence the general public was at risk during the cluster of cases
in 2008, therefore (there was) no need to notify or alarm the general
public. It was a very focused cluster in a relatively small population
group," Plourde said. "It can happen in a nursing home; it can happen in a
group home, shelter, and, again, the public doesn't need to know about it
if the public isn't at risk."

Although flesh-eating disease is considered rare, Plourde said the province
recorded 16 cases in 2008, 4 times the number that is typically reported.
Manitoba Health disease statistics show the number of flesh-eating cases
has skyrocketed in the past 3 years: 56 cases were reported between 2006
and October 2008, compared to only 12 total cases in 2005 and 2004. At
least 7 Manitobans infected with the invasive bacteria have died since
2006. Officials are still reviewing one suspected death from 2008. Plourde
said it's difficult to explain the recent outbreak but emphasized that
diseases tend to come in waves, and more people may be carrying strep
throat bacteria. He said shelter overcrowding and lack of proper hygiene
among inner-city homeless could explain the rash of cases. He said the best
way to avoid becoming sick is to practice proper hand washing and wound
care and report to a physician if you experience a skin rash at the same
time as sore throat. "Everybody can potentially get this disease, so that's
what unnerving about this bacteria," Plourde said. "Fortunately, it's still
a very rare thing to see."

[Necrotizing fasciitis, also called "flesh-eating disease" as in the above
news release, is a rapidly progressive bacterial infection that destroys
the soft tissues covering muscle (fascia). Patients usually complain of
intense pain in the involved region that initially may seem out of
proportion to the external appearance of the overlying skin. Although the
bacterial etiology of the Winnipeg, Manitoba outbreak is not specified in
the above news release, the commonest type of bacteria causing necrotizing
fasciitis is _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A streptococcus or GAS), but
other bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis include _Staphylococcus
aureus_, _Vibro vulnificus_ and mixtures of multiple intestinal bacterial
species.

GAS infections can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal
hygiene, and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to
facilitate its spread from person to person.

M protein is the major somatic virulence factor of GAS, which has been
divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein
molecule. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of
the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm>).

Genotyping is reported to have identified the genotype emm-59 in half of
the cases in an outbreak of GAS disease among the homeless and intravenous
drug users in Thunder Bay, Ontario and also identified this same genotype
in an outbreak of GAS disease that started in Western Canada more than a
year ago (ProMED-mail: Streptococcus, group A, emm-59, fatal - Canada:
(ON). 20081011.3219). Molecular analysis of the Winnipeg isolates may aid
in documenting whether the Winnipeg outbreak is part of the outbreak in
other parts of Canada.

Winnipeg is the capital of Manitoba, the province immediately to the west
of Ontario, and about 450 miles from Thunder Bay, Ontario. The
