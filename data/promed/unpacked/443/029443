The following background data on gonorrhea and gonococcal conjunctivitis
(ophthalmia) in Australia were extracted from the GIDEON software program:
- 10,000 to 20,000 cases of gonorrhea were reported yearly during 1917 to
1929, with 126 cases of gonococcal ophthalmia during this 13-year period.
Over 50 cases of gonococcal ophthalmia were reported most years during 1950
to 1969. 432 cases of epidemic nonvenereal gonococcal conjunctivitis were
reported among Central Australian Aboriginals in 1991. 13 cases were
confirmed in the Northern Territory and Western Australia during January to
March 1998.

1982 to 1983 6,599
1984 8,894

were quinolone-resistant. In 1996, 16%
were penicillin-resistant, 5.8% PPNG and 2.6% quinolone-resistant.
