The number of cases of cattle liver fluke has doubled on the New South
Wales North Coast this season [2009] because of wet weather. It's
estimated to be the highest number of cases in a decade, with numerous
cattle deaths already.

DPI [Department for Planning and Infrastructure] Regional Animal
Health Leader Paul Freeman says the past decade of drier weather has
kept the number of cases down. "The last couple of years, we've had
good seasons and plenty of wet days," he says. "Those soaks and
springs are running again, so liver fluke is present on a lot more
farms or farms where it used to be and hadn't been seen
for a while."

[Liver fluke (_Fasciola hepatica_) is a parasite affecting a range of
livestock and other species. Final hosts in which it can develop to
sexual maturity include livestock such as sheep, cattle, horses,
pigs, goats, alpacas and deer. Other species include kangaroos,
wallabies, rabbits, and humans. People can be infected by eating
water cress from creeks in fluke-infested country.

Places is Australia seem to have quite a problem with liver flukes.
But last month [February 2009], a new injectable treatment was
unveiled for all the stages of liver flukes. Perhaps it will be a
breakthrough in control.

Liver flukes result in a decrease in growth, a decrease in weight
gain, and severe infestations can cause death. Typically, the fluke
locates in the animal's bile duct and lays its eggs about 3 months
after arriving. These eggs pass through the animals, contaminate the
pasture, and the process continues to re-infect other animals.

To have the incidence double is significant. This represents a
substantial loss of weight and body condition of the animals and
financial loss to the producer. - Mod.TG]
