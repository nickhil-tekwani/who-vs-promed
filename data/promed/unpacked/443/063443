A man has died after an outbreak of rabies in Qxulu near Umtata, Eastern
Cape health officials said on Wed 1 Mar 2006. Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo
said a 42 year old man died at Nelson Mandela Hospital on Tue 28 Feb 2006.
He had been bitten by a dog late in February 2006.
"Villagers say that there are many other dogs infected with rabies in that
area. We sent environmental health inspectors to the area this morning,"
Kupelo said.
