Viral Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreaks in Gabon and Congo D.R.
----------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization has said that 10 people have now died from
the Ebola virus in Gabon. WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said that a second
team of specialists would fly to Gabon on Monday evening. This is the first
known outbreak of the disease since 224 people died of it in Uganda last
year. WHO officials have said that one of the dead was a health-worker who
had contracted the disease from a patient. The outbreak is in the remote
northeastern province of Ogooue Ivindo, where Ebola killed 45 people in
1996-97. The Ebola alarm was raised after medical teams discovered an
unusually large number of dead primates in the region.
There have also been unconfirmed reports of a separate outbreak in the
nearby Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A total of 28 people have died
in this outbreak, although DRC health officials say the fever is unlikely
to be Ebola, as had been earlier feared, but a similar haemorrhagic fever.
The cases in DRC have been reported in a remote village 500 kilometres east
of the capital, Kinshasa. A team of epidemiologists and doctors is on its
way to carry out further tests and treat the sufferers. The village in West
Kasai province, Mbisangandu, is accessible only by an aeroplane flight, a
journey by dugout canoe, and then a 15km walk through thick forest. In
addition 5 people in a village some 90km away are also feared to have been
affected. Dr Mapunza Mamieza, chairman of the Ministry of Health's
emergency committee, said the Ebola fever could almost certainly be ruled
out, and several patients had responded well to treatment with antibiotics.
The challenge now is to establish what the virus is, which means sending
samples to a laboratory in South Africa, isolating the affected
communities, and getting treatment for the patients. Rebels controlling the
eastern half of the country are being asked to allow movement of sufferers
and doctors across the front line which runs close to the affected area.
Officials reported that the nearest hospital is in rebel hands.

[The situation remains confused. The basis for the diagnosis of Ebola fever
in Gabon is unknown. The reported favorable response of some patients to
antibiotic treatment in the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is
at variance with the provisional diagnosis of a viral haemorrhagic fever.
As yet there is no confirmation of the diagnosis of Ebola Fever in Gabon on
the WHO CSR website. - Mod.CP
