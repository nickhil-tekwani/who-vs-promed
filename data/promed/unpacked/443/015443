3 more kindergartens and childcare centres were ordered to close
on Friday [25 Apr 2008] by the Ministry of Health, bringing the total
number of mandatory closures due to outbreaks of Hand, Foot and Mouth
Disease (HFMD) to 11 as of Friday afternoon [25 Apr 2008].

One of the schools forced to close, Kinderland Preschool at Yio Chu
Kang, had been put on the list as having been recommended to close
voluntarily before it was upgraded to the list of mandatory closures;
11 more kindergartens and childcare centres were added to the
list of voluntary closures, bringing the total number of closures to
26 as of 3:00 pm on Friday [25 Apr 2008].

While some parents have opted to take their children out of
preschools for fear they might be infected, several preschools
contacted by Today said they have not observed a trend in falling
attendance. A teacher from PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Ayer Rajah
West -- which was added to the voluntary closure list on Thursday [24
Apr 2008] -- said attendance was good, with no absentees except for
those who were sick. Ms. Choy Mei Har, supervisor at Raffles
Montessori Kindergarten (Aljunied), said there had been "one or 2"
cases in the nursery classes where concerned parents initially kept
their children at home but have since allowed them to return to
school. They were a little worried, but they found that there was
nothing to be worried about," said Ms Choy. "I think parents are
definitely concerned, but they are also more aware about HFMD now.
They are careful to keep their children at home if they are sick, and
they also know that it's not something that can't be cured."

Still, Ms Lee Geok Moy, a 33-year-old administrator, intends to keep
her daughter at home until the number of cases subsides. "I think
it's better to be on the safe side for now," she said, adding that
the childcare centres she checked near her home had all reported
cases of HFMD. Meanwhile, Care Corner Child Development Centre, which
was added on Thursday [24 Apr 2008] to the list of preschools advised
to close voluntarily, clarified that only its centre at Woodlands
Crescent was affected.

Another 78 cases of HFMD were reported as of 3:00 pm on Friday [25
Apr 2008], bringing the week's total so far to 1162.

Several parents have expressed their concern over the Hand, Foot and
Mouth Disease (HFMD) outbreak which has been reported in Singapore,
where 880 new cases were reported in 4 days. This is especially so for
those who travelled to the neighbouring country [Malaysia]. The DPA
[German Press Agency] news service reported yesterday [25 Apr 2008]
that teachers, administrative staff and cleaners scrubbed Singapore
preschools and childcare centres Friday [25 Apr 2008] to curb the HFMD
outbreak. DPA added, with the latest Health Ministry of Singapore data
showing this year's [2008] total infections at 8400, officials are now
providing daily updates instead of weekly ones.

At least 16 schools have been closed because of the outbreak. Another
9 have been urged to voluntarily shut down for 10 days. The
disinfection is aimed at halting the transmission of the disease,
which is spread through saliva, blister fluid, feces and droplets in
the air. Professionals have been called to service air conditioners
and fumigate.

Brunei
------
Sources said such HFMD cases have also occurred in Brunei but have
been on the decline lately. From early to the end of August 2007,
about 90 HFMD cases were recorded in Brunei, the Ministry of Health
said, while from early March to mid April 2006, some 580 cases were
recorded, the majority of which were outpatient cases.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common illness of infants
and children, which has tended to be more severe and to occur in more
pronounced outbreaks in South Asia. HFMD is a consequence of
infection by an enterovirus and is particularly associated with
infection by human coxsackievirus A16 (and less commonly A4, A5, A9,
A10, B2, or B5). Beginning in the 1970s human enterovirus 71 has been
associated with outbreaks exhibiting some neural involvement
(meningitis and encephalitis). Cases of fatal encephalitis occurred
during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997 and in Taiwan in 1998.
Despite their distinctive names, human coxsackievirus A16 and human
enterovirus 71 are similar viruses now classified together as members
of the same virus species _Human enterovirus A_.

The almost universal sign of the disease is enanthem [rash on a mucous
membrane], most commonly on the buccal mucosa [inside the mouth].
Exanthema [skin rashes] soon follow, most frequently on hands and
feet. The internal lesions are ulcerative and on the hands and on the
feet usually vesicular [blisters]. The virus is present in vesicular
fluid, pharyngeal [throat] secretions and feces. Consequently, HFMD is
a highly contagious infection but one usually with a benign outcome.

Last year [2007], there were 688 cases of HFMD recorded in Singapore
between 15-21 Apr 2007, a number which was 70 percent higher compared
to the 398 cases recorded in the same period of the previous year
[2006]. The 2007 outbreak was attributed to human coxsackievirus A16
infection, and, in the absence of information to the contrary, it
must be presumed that the same virus is responsible for the 2008
outbreak.
