All the 4000 pigs at a farm in Seelong, near Senai [in the southernmost
Johor state - Mod. CYC, will be culled after blood samples taken from the
farm tested positive for the Nipah virus. State Environment and Consumer
Affaiirs Committee chairman Dr Chua Soi Lek said today the cull would be
carried out by Monday at the latest and was expected to take two to three
days.
The decision was taken after more than 3 [sic of the 22 blood samples taken
tested positive for the virus and the authorities were convinced that the
animals were infected, he told reporters.
A total of 1800 blood samples of pigs from farms all over Johor would be
sent to the laboratory in Ipoh in stages for testing and the results would
be known in two weeks.
Dr Chua said the pigs at the farm were believed to have been infected by
pigs brought in from Melaka and Negri Sembilan six months ago.
Meanwhile, Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman said the state government
was taking precautionary measures and making logistics preparations to
prevent the disease from spreading to other farms. "We will investigate how
the virus came into the state and whether the infected pigs were smuggled in
from other infected states," he said.

[According to earlier reports (see refs. above), a blood sample taken from a
pig in an abattoir in Johor tested positive for Nipah virus. (It was not
known if the pig was subsequently slaughtered.) Health Minister Dr Chua Jui
Meng explained that the blood sample was an old one which was taken some
time ago to test for Japanese encephalitis virus antibody, and it was not
known if there have been a mix-up in the blood samples. The present report
describes results of additional tests on blood samples taken from pigs from
the same farm. - Mod.CYC
["Tested positive" is presumed to mean here "was tested & gave a positive
result for antibody using Nipah reagents," and not that Nipah virus was
recovered from the blood. The report does not say that pig deaths with
Nipah virus symptoms are occurring on this farm, so the pigs may no longer
be infectious, only carrying antibody as a result of an earlier infection.
Nevertheless, it is better to be safe than sorry - Mod.JW
