The NJ DEP's Division Fish and Wildlife has been receiving reports of
dead and dying deer since early August 2011, presumptively due to
epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD). Field investigations have yielded
usable samples from 7 deer so far, and EHD has been found in 5
counties. EHD is a viral disease spread by biting insects known as
midges, which inhabit mud flats along waterways. As such, outbreaks
are generally confined to specific drainages which contain the
midges.

Fish and Wildlife is aware that EHD is present in the Millstone River
and Passaic River drainage systems, and reports of dead and/or dying
deer have been received from East and West Amwell in Hunterdon County;
Hillsborough and Montgomery in Somerset County; Hopewell, Princeton
and Hamilton in Mercer County; Madison, East Hanover, Harding, Florham
Park and the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge in Morris County;
and Berkeley Heights in Union County.

There is no need for the public to report additional sick or dead deer
from these locations. However, sick deer or deer found dead in or near
water in locations other than those listed above should be immediately
reported to Carole Stanko at 908-735-7040 or Bill Stansley at
908-236-2118.

It is important to immediately report sightings from potentially new
outbreak areas since EHD can only be isolated from animals that have
been dead for less than 24 hours.

[EHD can be an elusive disease to get laboratory confirmation of.
There is a PCR test for it, and this article does not indicate what
type of test the laboratory is using for confirmation.

The New Jersey area probably hopes for an early autumn, as these
biting midges die out when the frost arrives. - Mod.TG]
