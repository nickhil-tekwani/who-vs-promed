Federal advisers decided Monday which influenza strains were likely to
threaten the U.S. next winter and directed vaccine makers to include
protection against those strains in shots for 1988-99. Every fall, federal
officials encourage Americans, especially the elderly, to get vaccinated.
The flu kills about 20,000 people in the United States each year and causes
thousands of hospitalizations. The flu shot given to Americans usually
contains protection against three viruses.
The advisers said the 1998-99 flu vaccine should include components to ward
off a Chinese strain, A/Beijing, an Australian strain, A/Sydney, and a
Chinese B strain. In February, the World Health Organization (WHO) made
similar recommendations.
According to Nancy Cox of the CDC, globally the proportion of
Sydney-like strains has increased dramatically since September 1997.
There has been no sign in the United States of the deadly flu strain that
began in chickens in Hong Kong this winter which killed six people -- a
third of those infected -- flu expert Robert Webster of the St. Jude's
Children's Research Hospital told Reuters. A massive slaughter of chickens
headed off a major epidemic, Webster said, adding that he does not expect
any more illness in Hong Kong this year. Even so, health officials
worldwide are concerned that the strain may be the cause of the next flu
pandemic. WHO and CDC officials are testing samples from the 18 people
infected in Hong Kong to see whether their infections were freak
occurrences, or an indication that the [H5N1 virus is mutating [in its
ability to infect humans. Two companies, Aviron and Protein Sciences
Corp., are working with the CDC and the National Institutes of
Health on vaccines against the virus. Human testing began in February.
CDPC Note: The massive slaughter of chickens in Hong Kong was needed to
control the spread of the chicken flu virus (H5N1) to other chickens. It is
doubtful that this measure "headed off a major epidemic" in the human
population in Hong Kong!

[Doubtful, yes, but put enough infected chickens in close quarters with
enough susceptible humans, add the virus' remarkable adaptive abilities and
who knows? If nothing else, at least the chickens in Hong Kong are cleaner
than before this experience. As for the 1998 vaccine, I recommend it. I
received the 1997 vaccine (sans A/Sydney) and was infected with A/Sydney; I
do not recommend that to anyone save those who believe that suffering is
good for the character. - Mod.CHC
