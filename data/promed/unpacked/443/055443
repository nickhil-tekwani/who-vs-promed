Bird flu outbreak intensifies in Russia's Tuva Republic
-----------------------------------------------
The Siberian office of the Russian emergencies ministry said on Tuesday [27
Jun 2006] that the outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in the
constituent Tuva Republic was intensifying.
The emergencies ministry first reported on 23 Jun 2006 that 169 dead wild
birds had been collected from the Ubsu-Nur Lake in the Ovyursky district of
the Tuva Republic, and the presence of H5N1 in their blood samples had been
confirmed by the Kemerovo veterinary laboratory.
Tuesday's [27 Jun 2006] statement said wild bird deaths were continuing,
with 371 new deaths reported by Sunday [25 Jun 2006] afternoon. A total 1622
birds have died since the 1st dead birds were found on the lake 15 Jun 2006.
The emergencies ministry warned further outbreaks were likely towards the
end of July 2006 among young wild birds, as their immunity to the disease
was weak.

Expert doubts bird flu pandemic in East Siberia
-----------------------------------------------
A leading ornithologist in Siberia cast doubt Monday [26 Jun 2006] over a
possible bird flu pandemic in the region, after hundreds of wild fowl
carcasses were destroyed.
A total of 1622 bodies of wild geese, as well as more than 50 dead fish,
found on the shores of Lake Ubsu-Nur in the Republic of Tuva on the
Russian-Mongolian border had been incinerated by Monday [26 Jun 2006].
After preliminary tests, local virologists suggested bird flu had caused the
mass bird deaths in the last week, but Vladimir Zabelin, a leading local
ornithologist, said contamination of a river flowing into the lake could
have been to blame. "[The deaths] could have been the result of toxic waste
being dumped into the Tes-Khem River," he said. The expert said the fish
started dying first, apparently contaminating the birds through the food
chain.
The final results will be known by 29 Jun 2006, when a Vladimir-based
research institute in central Russia finalizes the analysis of blood samples
from dead birds.

[Results from the All-Russian reference laboratory at Vladimir, Moscow
(expected tomorrow [29 Jun 2006]?) and formal notification to the OIE will
enable verifying -- or otherwise -- the information included in these
newswires.
The Republic of Tuva (170 500 sq km: north to south 420 km, west to east 630

New bird flu outbreak hits Siberia
----------------------------------
A new outbreak of bird flu has hit the West Siberian region of Tomsk, the
local administration said Tuesday [27 Jun 2006]. A representative said a
laboratory analysis of fancy pigeons that died in a village last week
revealed the deadly virus. "All the pigeons and chickens from the courtyard
have been culled," the representative said. "The owner, who had refused to
vaccinate poultry, will receive no compensation."
Governor Viktor Kress ordered vaccination as a preventive measure against an
epidemic of the disease, which claimed over a million birds in Russia in
February-April 2006.
According to the Agriculture Ministry, bird flu was registered in 10
villages in 3 West Siberian regions in late May 2006.

[An official confirmation from the reference laboratory is anticipated in
this case as well. Russia's last avian influenza reports to the OIE on avian
influenza in domestic fowl was sent on 16 Feb 2006; see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_30.HTM#Sec2>. On the same day, a
notification on infection in wild birds was sent as well; see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_30.HTM#Sec12>. An update might be
helpful. - Mod.AS]
