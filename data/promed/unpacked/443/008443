A total of 10 new Ebola cases with 7 deaths were reported on Friday [28 Mar 2014] in Guinea, bringing the total number of cases to 112 and 70 deaths since the declaration of this deadly epidemic, a source from the health ministry has said.

To develop a harmonized fight against the disease, the health ministry organized a forum bringing together all senior officials of health institutions, to provide them with necessary tools to report any relevant information in real time for a quick response. The head of disease prevention unit Sakoba Keita said a vast census operation had been launched targeting all those who had come into contact with any Ebola patient in hospital or at home. The health authorities have equally decided to set up commissions in all communal health centers to examine the development of the situation with regard to Ebola virus.

Keita urged families of those who had died from Ebola to avoid taking part in the burial ceremonies.

8 cases of Ebola reported in capital of Guinea as fears rise over outbreak of deadly virus
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials in the West African nation of Guinea say they're now treating 8 cases of Ebola in the capital [Conakry]. Dr. Sakoba Keita, a spokesman for the health ministry, announced on national television the virus had reached the city of 3 million.

Keita said Friday [28 Mar 2014] at least 70 people have died in the country's south since the Ebola outbreak began last week. The highly infectious virus causes hemorrhagic fever in its victims, with a fatality rate of up to 90 percent. Keita said the new cases involved patients who had been in contact with the body of one of the earlier victims. He said health officials were seeking to quarantine anyone who took part in the burials.

Authorities in neighboring Liberia are also investigating several suspected cases.
