An explosion of rats in Los Angeles (LA) has [led] to a surge in cases of typhus and could pave the way for a public health crisis. According to Reform California, there have been 124 confirmed cases of typhus in LA County this year [2019]. On top of the increase in typhus cases, experts fear the return of a disease that wiped out one-third of Europe in the 12th century, the bubonic plague.

The increase in trash on the streets of LA is largely blamed on the increasing homeless population, which rocketed 16% between 2018 [and] 2019 according to Reform California. Rats eat, live and breed in the garbage-filled areas, creating a perfect breeding ground for rat-borne diseases, including typhus and bubonic plague.

Though the city has had only 3 confirmed cases of the plague in the past 40 years, the conditions on the streets of LA make it a perfect breeding ground for plague-carrying rats. The reason for such a large influx of rats is largely attributed to the city's increasing homeless population. They added that the amount of people without somewhere to live has caused sanitation in problem areas to fall short with trash and feces piling up on the street. These conditions can attract rodents and cause a perfect breeding ground for rat-borne diseases. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, acknowledged the city's severe sanitation problem, astonished that a medieval disease could be making its rounds in a modern city like LA.

Fleas carry typhus from infected stray animals. Though rats are most often attributed with the disease, any stray animal like cats or opossums can also be carriers. Typhus is most likely to be found in people in close proximity to rodents, but other stray animals like cats and opossums also carry the disease.

Symptoms typically begin within 2 weeks of exposure and can include chills, nausea, vomiting, body aches, loss of appetite, stomach pain and rashes. Without treatment, typhus can eventually lead to organ failure and death.

Plague, though not as deadly as it was 600 years ago, can still be fatal if left untreated. The most famous symptom is a large pus-filled swelling or "bubo", which grows in the groin or under the armpit. This is usually accompanied by seizures, muscle cramps, fever and chills.

[Flea-borne typhus (also known as murine or endemic typhus) is caused by the bacteria _Rickettsia typhi_ and _Rickettsia felis_. Rats are the primary animal reservoir of _R. typhi_; however, other mammals, such as free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums, and their fleas, can maintain this microorganism in areas where rats and rat fleas are absent (Azad AF, Radulovic S, Higgins JA, et al. Flea-borne rickettsioses: ecologic considerations. Emerg Infect Dis. 1997;3(3):319-27; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627639/). Infected humans often have contact with animals that can carry these fleas. Fleas defecate when they feed. Humans become infected when the feces from infected fleas are rubbed into the excoriated bite wound or other wounds in the skin or rubbed into the eyes. These bacteria are not spread from person to person.

According to the Los Angeles (LA) County health department, the numbers of typhus cases that have occurred each year since 2010 in LA County are 31 in 2010; 38 in 2011; 49 in 2012; 68 in 2013; 44 in 2014; 54 in 2015; 47 in 2016; 67 in 2017; 109 in 2018; and 41 in 2019 as of 16 Aug 2019 (http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/VectorTyphus.htm). These numbers exclude data from the LA County cities of Pasadena and Long Beach, which are reported separately by their own departments of health.

The homeless in LA County live mainly in downtown LA. However, the cases reported in downtown LA made up only 19 of the 109 cases (17.4%) in 2018 and only 1 of 41 cases (2.4%) so far in 2019 (http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/VectorTyphus.htm). Of the 19 cases that occurred in downtown LA in 2018, only 8 actually occurred in homeless individuals (http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=1987).

In regard to Pasadena and Long Beach, the 2 LA county cities that operate their own health departments, Pasadena reported 22 typhus cases in 2018 (https://laist.com/2019/02/12/rats_infestation_at_la_city_hall_typhus_outbreak_downtown.php); none of the cases in Pasadena involved homeless individuals (https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/typhus-los-angeles-homeless/). Long Beach reported 20 cases in 2018 and 8 cases in 2019 as of 15 Aug 2019; cases were said to be scattered all over the city (https://lbpost.com/news/fleas-typhus-long-beach-la-county/).

Thus, in 2018 over 85% of murine typhus cases in LA County occurred outside of the downtown area and about 95% occurred in non-homeless individuals. - Mod.ML
