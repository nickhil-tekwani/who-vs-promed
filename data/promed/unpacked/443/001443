Horse herd quarantined because of equine strangles disease
-----------------------------------------------
A horse herd on a west Georgia farm has been placed under quarantine after
the discovery of the contagious disease equine strangles, state agriculture
officials said.
Under an order by Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin dated 1 Apr 2004, no
horses from the herd (numbering around 115 animals) can be removed, nor any
new animals brought to the farm in Talbot County, just east of Waverly Hall
off Georgia Highway 208.
The quarantine is effective until a veterinarian certifies that the horses
have shown no signs of the disease for 30 days.
Linda Crowley -- who owns the farm -- said on Thu 15 Apr that she knows of
just one horse that still has the disease. "We've had a few problems with
it. It's something common. What we have is about cleaned up," Crowley said.
Strangles is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Streptococcus
equi_. It is not passed to humans.
Signs include yellow discharge from nostrils and eyes, swollen lymph nodes
of the head and neck, difficulty in swallowing, and fever up to 106 degrees
F. While usually seen in young horses, those of any age lacking immunity
from prior infection or vaccination may contract it, according to an
Agriculture Department bulletin.

[According to the Office of the State Veterinarian in Georgia, this is a
reportable disease, and it is recommended that owners practice
self-quarantine. As this is a large barn with several owners, and because
some owners may want to move their animals, a quarantine becomes necessary.
There have been a number of recent cases of equine strangles. The Georgia
Equine Association has asked the state to declare equine strangles a
reportable disease, which was done in early 2002. This designation
facilitates the tracking of the disease and aides in the education of owners.
Special thanks to Dr. Stone of Georgia for her information which aided in
the preparation of this comment. - Mod.TG]
