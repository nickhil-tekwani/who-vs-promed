Update on children with acute hepatitis of unknown cause
----------------------------------------------------
CDC continues to work with health departments and clinicians [throughout the USA] to identify and investigate hepatitis of unknown cause affecting children. As of today, 18 May 2022, 36 states and territories have reported 180 pediatric patients under investigation over the past 7 months, which is an increase of 71 from the 109 publicly reported on 5 May 2022.

While this may appear to be a large increase in patients under investigation over the last 2 weeks, it is important to understand that the vast majority of these are what we consider 'retrospective' patients. Since CDC's investigation looks at patients reported back to October 2021, most of these numbers involve patients that are just now being reported, rather than new cases of hepatitis -- so, not all are recent, and some may ultimately wind up not being linked to this current investigation. In addition, there have been no reported deaths since February 2022, and the proportion of patients requiring liver transplants has gone down from 15 per cent to 9 per cent since 5 May 2022.

CDC continues to examine possible causes, including testing for and ruling out some of the viruses that commonly cause hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E). Adenovirus has been detected in nearly half of the children and continues to be a strong lead. Further laboratory tests are being conducted to look more closely at the virus genome and other potential pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. In addition, CDC is communicating with key medical groups and continues to provide updated reporting and laboratory guidance for clinicians who may identify hepatitis of unknown cause in children. A Community Outreach and Clinician Activity (COCA) call is scheduled for Thursday 19 May 2022, where CDC will provide key updates and experts in treating hepatitis will answer clinical questions.

It is important to note that severe hepatitis in children remains rare. However, we encourage parents and caregivers to be aware of the symptoms of hepatitis -- particularly jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin or eyes -- and to contact their child's healthcare provider with any concerns.

CDC will begin posting regular online updates specific to the number of patients under investigation on a weekly basis. As we learn more, we will share additional information and updates.

[Among the new states with potential cases include New Jersey (https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2022/05/mysterious-hepatitis-outbreak-in-kids-reaches-nj.html) and Rhode Island (https://turnto10.com/news/local/pediatric-hepatitis-case-in-rhode-island-included-in-cdc-investigation). As stated, many of the cases were identified by "look back" and were not new cases since the initial alerts. This did not seem to be the case from recent WHO data whose (https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/hepatitis/news/news/2022/5/hepatitis-of-unknown-origin-in-children-whoeurope-and-ecdc-launch-the-first-joint-surveillance-bulletin) epicurve, although showing a handful of cases reported with a date of onset of illness in late 2021, began to spike upward at epidemiological week 9 of 2022 [week of 1 Mar 2022] (6 cases/week) peaked at week 15 [week of 11 Apr 2022] (44 cases) and then dropped sharply. As noted in the summary, "As severe hepatitis can take some time to develop after the onset of the 1st symptoms and as investigations take time, there may be a delay in the reporting of cases. The recent decrease in cases is therefore challenging to interpret." - Mod.LL]

Acute, severe hepatitis of unknown origin in children
-----------------------------------------------------
This technical note follows the previous reports regarding the event of acute, severe hepatitis of unknown origin in children disseminated by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) on 23 Apr 2022 (2 reports), 25 Apr 20222, 29 Apr 2022, and 10 May 2022.

As of 15 May 2022, a total of 429 probable cases have been reported from 22 countries, including 26 cases who have required liver transplantation. In the Region of the Americas to date, a total of 33 probable cases in 6 countries have been reported to PAHO/WHO.
Although several research studies are ongoing, the epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical information currently available to WHO regarding this event remains limited. To date, no etiological agent has been identified. Several hypotheses are being investigated, including those that indicate adenovirus (primarily type F41) as one of the agents involved, along with other concomitant causes. The role of SARS-CoV-2, either as a co-infection or as a previous infection, in patients who acquire adenovirus infection, is being investigated.

To support ongoing research, PAHO/WHO, together with the affected countries, is collecting standardized data and conducting various studies to determine the etiology. As the investigation continues, recommendations for prevention, treatment, and control will be issued and updated.

PAHO/WHO recommends Member States focus efforts on investigating cases potentially meeting the current WHO working case definition1 rather than implementing universal surveillance. To this end, PAHO/WHO proposes the use of a standardized data collection form5 to help guide investigation and report to PAHO/WHO. The form can be completed online and is available at https://files.pahobra.org/limesurvey/index.php/781192.

[To date, few peer-reviewed studies on this growing outbreak have been published. ProMED awaits more information from Europe and the USA regarding blood and liver metagenomics, evidence for past COVID-19 infection, and screening of asymptomatic household contacts for elevated aminotransferases.

The leading candidates to be involved are adenovirus serotype 41 and SARS-CoV-2 perhaps working together to produce an immunologically mediated hepatocyte injury as presented in: ProMED. Hepatitis, undefined, global (14): children, poss. mechanisms, 2021-22 20220514.8703250 - Mod.LL]
