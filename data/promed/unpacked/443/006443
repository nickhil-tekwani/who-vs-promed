[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam are increasing rapidly at several locations in this state. In less than 3 weeks, the number of deaths has increased to 35, with 3 more on 20 Jul 2022. The number of JE cases has risen rapidly from 183 reported on Tuesday (19 Jul 2022) to 226 cases yesterday (Wed 20 Jul 2022]. Interestingly, none of these 226 cases was classified as JE and not acute encephalitis syndrome, as was the situation for those 48 cases in a previous ProMED post (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20220707.8704289). There is still no mention of a vaccination campaign in the state. - Mod.TY
