Rabies vaccine supply is limited -- CDC health update as of 22 Aug 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The CDC has been notified that the supply of human rabies vaccine is
being used at a higher rate than expected, which may affect the
near-term availability of vaccine for rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis (PEP).

Because of limited existing supplies, the CDC strongly recommends
that health care providers, state and local public health
authorities, animal control officials, and the public take immediate
steps to ensure appropriate use of human rabies biologics. Judicious
and appropriate use of rabies vaccines is crucial to avert a
situation in which persons exposed to rabies are put at increased
risk due to depleted vaccine supplies.

To ensure that thorough risk assessments are conducted, Novartis
[maker of a rabies vaccine] is now requiring that health care
providers confer with public health officials, and obtain a
confirmation code from a state health department before ordering
vaccine doses for post-exposure prophylaxis.
