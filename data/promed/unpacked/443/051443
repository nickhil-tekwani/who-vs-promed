Experiments with scrapie in mice reveal sub-clinical infection
--------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists investigating bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are warning
that the disease may infect animals other than cattle without showing any
symptoms. In a paper [about to be published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Science, scientists led by Professor John Collinge say
their findings could have "important public health implications". Not only
cattle, but sheep, pigs and poultry exposed to BSE via animal feed may have
developed a "subclinical" form of the disease which remained symptom-free
and hidden. Animals thought to be healthy and incapable of acquiring BSE
could theoretically pass the disease on to humans.
The possibility of further action to protect public health is to be
examined by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) at
their next meeting on 29 Sep 2000. Professor Peter Smith, acting chairman
of SEAC, said: "It is not clear [at this stage that these findings
indicate that additional controls should be considered with respect to
protecting human or animal health."
Prof Collinge's team, at the Medical Research Council Prion Unit based in
St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, [are investigating the extent of
the "species barrier" which most experts believe makes it difficult for
BSE-type diseases to spread between different species of animal. The MRC
scientists infected laboratory mice with a form of hamster scrapie called
Sc237. Ordinary mice have always been thought to put up an effective
barrier against this disease. As expected, the mice showed no apparent
signs of illness. On closer [analysis, however, the researchers found that
these animals had high levels of potentially lethal abnormal prions in
their brains. [It was also demonstrated that this subclinical infection
could easily be passed on when injected into healthy mice and hamsters. The
fear is that what is true for hamsters and mice may also be true for cattle
and other animals with BSE, and humans with CJD. The results also raised
another fear, of CJD being transmitted from seemingly healthy hospital
patients via surgical instruments.
Prof Collinge said: "These results suggest that we should re-think how we
measure species barriers in the laboratory, and that we should not assume
that just because one species appears resistant to a strain of prions they
have been exposed to, that they do not silently carry the infection." This
research raises the possibility that apparently healthy cattle could
harbor, but never show signs of, BSE.

[BSE belongs to a family of "prion" diseases which also include scrapie of
sheep, transmissible mink encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease of elk,
both "classical" and "variant" CJD in humans, and several other conditions
These diseases are thought to be caused by the accumulation of an aberrant
form of a normal protein which results in the formation of plaques in the
brain. Variant CJD, which first emerged in 1996, is now known to be BSE in
a human guise. It is thought to have spread to the human population through
people eating contaminated beef products in the 1980s. A total of 79 cases
of variant CJD have been recorded so far in the U.K.. Although the results
obtained by Professor Colling's group are disquieting in respect of the
absence of a rigid species barrier, a more reassuring conclusion might be
that since animals can apparently harbor high concentrations of both
aberrant and normal prion proteins without developing clinical signs, it
may be that abnormal prions are not neurotoxic per se. Further comment must
await the appearance of Professor Collinge's paper, which should be
accessible at <http://www.pnas.org/papbyrecent.shtml> within the next few
days. -Mod.CP
