At least 532 people have died since a cholera epidemic broke out in war-torn Yemen in April 2017, according to WHO. In a Twitter post on [Wed 31 May 2017], WHO said more than 65 300 suspected cases of cholera have been recorded in 253 districts in the country.

International organizations -- including the WHO, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross -- have recently stepped up the delivery of medical supplies to Yemen, where local health authorities are struggling to cope with the outbreak. Yemen fell into civil war in 2014 after Houthi rebels overran capital Sanaa and other provinces. In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign aimed at reversing Houthi gains and shoring up Yemen's pro-Saudi government.

According to UN officials, more than 10 000 Yemenis have been killed in the conflict to date, while more than 11 per cent of the country's total population has been displaced from their homes.

11 May / 2752 / 51
13 May / 8595 / 115
14 May / 11 000 / 180

21 May / 29 300 / 315
22 May / 35 217 / 361
24 May / 42 207 / 420
27 May / 51 832 / 471
30 May / 65 300 / 532

Aggressive interventions to stem this substantial outbreak in Yemen including a vaccination campaign are problematic because of the ongoing conflict going on in the country. An intervention with vaccine, if possible, could potentially stem the tide of the ongoing event. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61)."
