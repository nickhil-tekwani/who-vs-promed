A roll-out has been launched to vaccinate thousands of cattle in Isiolo County following reported cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) disease outbreak.

The vaccination, which will be carried for the next 21 days in Meri and Garbatula sub-counties of Isiolo, will target animals in hot spot areas where cases have been reported recently. Seven people and over 100 heads of cattle succumbed to the disease recently in Erisaboru Biliki and Sericho areas of Isiolo County.

Speaking during the launch, Dr. Lawrence Mwongela, the Isiolo County Executive Committee in the ministry of agriculture, said that 150 000 doses of vaccine have been donated by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and at the same time thanked other implementing partners who are working together with the county government to facilitate the success of the program.
