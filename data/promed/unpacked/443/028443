Authorities report that 2 more so-called foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) "hot
suspects" are being investigated in County Tyrone. The suspect animals are
in the Ardboe area where the disease was confirmed in a herd of dairy
cattle on Friday. More than 4000 animals are being slaughtered in the
vicinity of the farm. Another case of the disease was confirmed in County
Antrim on Sunday.
The virus has now spread through 3 counties, affecting the northeast,
southeast and the middle of the province.
The Ardboe case has already led to the reimposition of the European ban on
meat and dairy exports from Northern Ireland.

The Northern Ireland Executive will hold an emergency meeting on Monday to
discuss the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) crisis following confirmation of
the third outbreak of the disease at a farm in Cushendall, County Antrim.
A 3 km exclusion zone has been put in place around the farm and a cull of
animals in the area is under way. The area around the infected farm remains
cordoned off by police. Cushendall is in the Glens of Antrim, an area well
known for hill farming. It is thought thousands of sheep will now have to
be culled in the area as attempts continue to contain the disease.
Department of Agriculture officials are trying to establish how the disease
got onto the farm.
Speaking on Sunday, Agriculture Minister Brid Rodgers said: "The source of
the outbreak has not yet been established so I want to appeal to all
farmers in County Antrim to ensure that absolutely no livestock movements
take place. . . Can I make it absolutely clear that the situation is now
extremely serious."
Some farmers in the area are fearful that the virus could have traveled in
the wind across the Irish Sea from southwest Scotland, which has had severe
problems with FMD. Cushendall is about 50 miles from the second outbreak at
Ardboe, County Tyrone and there is nothing to suggest a link at this stage.
But Northern Ireland's Chief Veterinary Officer Bob McCracken said that
none of the cases to date had been wind-borne, but said the source was
still being investigated.
"The virus has got onto these 3 premises though the gate or over the
hedge." Mr McCracken said controlling it would be "through the sealing-off
of every farm in Northern Ireland if we are to stop similar cases".
The Irish Republic's Agriculture Minister, Joe Walsh has ordered stricter
border controls in a bid to prevent the disease spreading. "This fresh
outbreak means that there is a geographic spread of the disease, and not
alone is it active on the island of Ireland, but it is actually rampant,"
he said.
"So we have to literally redouble our efforts. We have to remain vigilant,
to have each farmer to have their farm as a fortress, as a self-contained
unit."
