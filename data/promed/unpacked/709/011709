A new report discusses how rates of whooping cough can be reduced by immunizing women during pregnancy and improving education about the illness. The report Mortality and morbidity of pertussis in children and young people in New Zealand: Special Report 2002-2014, was released today by the Child and Youth Mortality Review Committee (CYMRC). It shows rates of whooping cough (also known as pertussis) in New Zealand using data from 2002-2014, for children and young people under the age of 25.

Pertussis is a contagious disease, characterised by long coughing episodes. It can be very serious and in some cases fatal. Nearly 13 000 cases of whooping cough were recorded, an average of 992 cases per year, including 8 deaths. 7 deaths were in infants under 3 months old. There were 1515 hospital admissions and more than 75 percent were for infants under 6 months old.

Dr Felicity Dumble, CYMRC chair, says that among the easiest and safest ways to prevent or reduce the severity of the illness is to immunize mothers during pregnancy. "All pregnant women should receive a booster shot in their 3rd trimester and should be given information by their GP or lead maternity carer about where and how to get one. Many women don't know a booster shot is required," says Dr Dumble.

Immunization during pregnancy is safe for mothers and babies and is now funded during the 3rd trimester.

"GPs and midwives play an important part in education about whooping cough, so it is crucial they take the lead in informing pregnant women about the need for immunization."

The Committee endorses the work the Ministry of Health is doing in this area, including the release of new 'let's talk about immunisation' resources and a focus on whooping cough and influenza immunisation during 2016's National Immunisation Week.

The report also makes a number of other recommendations to reduce the rates and impact of whooping cough.

Recommendations include:
- giving pregnant women whooping cough booster shots should be a quality improvement measure or target for DHBs [district health boards]
- booster shots given to pregnant women should be captured in the National Immunization Register and recorded as part of a baby's immunization record
- the Ministry of Health should develop education resources for pregnant women, lead maternity carers and other health care providers on the benefits of immunization against whooping cough during pregnancy (work on this is already underway)
- DHB-funded community antenatal education classes should include information about the need for a whooping cough booster shot in the 3rd trimester
- when confirming a woman is pregnant, their GP or other provider should put in place a plan to ensure they are recalled for a pertussis booster shot in their 3rd trimester
- a national system should be developed that enables general practices, lead maternity carers and other immunization providers to communicate with each other on whooping cough booster shots given to pregnant women
- lead maternity carers and other health care providers should ensure pregnant women are aware that they need a whooping cough booster in their 3rd trimester and they know where to go to get it
- pregnant women should be offered whooping cough booster shots in a wide range of settings, including general practice, secondary care and outreach community settings, to reduce access barriers for hard-to-reach groups.

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea (breathing arrest), with seizures induced by hypoxia (low oxygen) usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis -- particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 -- and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs of mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital, and accounted for most of the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

A 2014 publication confirms the safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes.
