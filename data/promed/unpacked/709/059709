The importing of Chilean turkey meat has been restricted in Argentina, Peru, and Hong Kong due to an outbreak of bird flu in central Chile. The outbreak, of a low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus, is under control, the Chilean State Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) reported on Wednesday [11 Sep 2019].

"Regarding shipments of poultry and its products from Chile to various markets, the SAG has been notified of restrictions only on the part of Argentina, Peru, and Hong Kong," the SAG said in a statement.

The 3 nations made the determination after an outbreak was detected on 27 Aug 2019 in a turkey pen at the Sopraval company, located in the Los Nogales commune, Valparaiso, 120 km [about 75 mi] west of Santiago [Chile]. Some 65 000 animals were slaughtered as the authorities took control.

"From the point of view of the population's health, this event does not represent a risk, given that the consumption of meat and poultry byproducts does not pose any danger of transmission to humans," added the SAG.

Chilean officials will now conduct an investigation to determine the causes of the occurrence of bird flu in Chile. Surveillance will also be carried out within a radius of 2 km [1.2 mi] from the area where the outbreak occurred.

Samples have been taken from more than 1.5 million birds, "and all the results have been negative for the disease," the SAG added.

In 2017, 35 000 turkeys were slaughtered after bird flu was detected in 2 bird farms in the Valparaiso region, which led Bolivia, Peru, and Uruguay to suspend the importation of turkeys from Chile.

[Avian influenza can spread quickly and can be damaging to devastating to poultry industries. Nations affected by the disease previously are likely to be more cautious. When a sector of the animal industry is devastated by a disease, that same sector becomes overly cautious and protective, and rightly so.

According to OIE, "A 1 km [0.6 mi] restriction zone was established around the affected farm as well as a 2 km [1.2 mi] surveillance zone, around the 1st one, within which active surveillance and epidemiological investigation are ongoing, in accordance with the provisions of the OIE Code" (see ProMED-mail post archive no. 20190906.6659277).

We hope the situation is quickly resolved without further losses. - Mod.TG
