Indonesia reported 20 023 new cases of leprosy in the country by the end of 2012, the Health Ministry confirmed today [20 Feb 2013]. This nation should implement preventive measures to stop the increase of that endemic illness, Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi asserted in statements published by Antara News. The country needs to develop an early-detection policy, with the objective of speeding up the recovery or prevention of that disease, he said.

The minister clarified that the Health Community Centers (Puskesmas) are working for early detection of leprosy, a disease that can be prevented with a healthy and hygienic behavior. Nafsiah specified that 14 of the 33 provinces and 150 out of the 479 districts have new cases of leprosy.

Leprosy is not very contagious because its incubation period is more than 20 years and a person can contract the disease if in direct and repeated contact with the drops of fluid from the nostrils and the mouth of non-treated lepers.

The main symptoms of leprosy are sores on the skin and protuberances that disappear after several weeks or months.

However, without treatment, the disease could lead to permanent damage of the nerves, skin, limbs, and eyes and also muscular paralysis.

[According to the WHO, in official reports received from 105 countries and territories, the registered prevalence of leprosy globally at the beginning of 2012 was 181 941 cases and the number of new cases detected during 2011 was 219 075 compared with 228 474 in 2010 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/index.html).

Globally, the WHO has reported that elimination of leprosy as a public health problem, defined by the WHO as a prevalence rate of less than 1 case per 10 000 persons, had been achieved by 2000 by the widespread use of multidrug therapy. Once the disease has been treated, a person becomes no longer contagious within a short period of time. So far, there has been no antimicrobial resistance to multidrug treatment.

Elimination of leprosy as a public health problem was achieved in Indonesia in 2000, although pockets of high endemicity (that is, 3 or more cases per 10 000) persisted in some areas of country (see http://www.who.int/lep/situation/Indonesia2005-WM2.pdf). In 2006, there were 22 175 cases of leprosy reported in Indonesia with a population of almost 229 million population (prevalence of 0.97 cases per 10 000), of which 17 682 were new cases (http://www.who.int/lep/situation/SEAROStatsEnd2006.pdf). About 80 percent of new cases had multibacillary leprosy, a contagious form of the disease when untreated; almost 8 percent of new cases had significant disability, which suggests there has been delayed diagnosis and/or reporting of the disease in Indonesia; and 10 percent of new cases occurred in children, which suggests that there has been ongoing disease transmission in the community (http://www.who.int/lep/situation/SEAROStatsEnd2006.pdf).
