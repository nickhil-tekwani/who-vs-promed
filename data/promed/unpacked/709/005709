EU veterinary experts on Wednesday [3 Oct 2007] approved the
extension of a restricted zone around outbreaks of the bluetongue
livestock disease, including an area of Britain for the 1st time.
The EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health
(SCFCAH) voted to broaden the bluetongue restriction zones to cover
parts of southeast England and more areas in the Czech Republic,
Denmark, France, and Portugal where outbreaks of the disease have
been reported.
The 1st case of bluetongue ever recorded in Britain was confirmed in
a cow near Ipswich in southeastern England last week [24 Sep 2007].
The bluetongue problem within the European Union has increased
swiftly since the 1st outbreak of the BTV-8 strain, for which there
is no vaccination, in northern Europe last year [2006]. There have
been over 23 500 outbreaks of bluetongue so far this year [2007].
The disease is difficult to control once it takes hold as it is
passed mainly by tiny flying midges. It is not a risk to humans, but
in animals it causes high fevers, mouth ulcers, and swollen heads.
[Strangely, this newswire neglects the fact that BTV "also" kills;
the case fatality rate in susceptible sheep breeds may exceed 50
percent! - Mod.AS]
In the past, bluetongue tended to occur further south in Spain and
Italy as well as in northern Africa, and some experts blame climate
change for its northward progress.
Given the size of the problem in Europe now, the European Commission
has also decided to beef up control measures "to make them more
sustainable, proportionate, and science-based," and bring them more
in line with international standards. [A most commendable though
somewhat belated step, which will spare unnecessary cullings. - Mod.AS]
Under the draft legislation, approved by the EU experts, monitoring
for bluetongue will be compulsory in all infected countries, while
other EU member states will have to carry out surveillance measures.
The Commission hopes that a vaccination for the strain hitting
northern Europe will become available next year [2008].

[In the absence of a commercially available (inactivated) BTV-8
vaccine, susceptible livestock, and particularly sheep, may suffer
serious losses during the rest of this year's (2007) disease period,
which may last for 2-3 remaining months. The disease demonstrates a
clear potential for further spread, particularly in the UK, where the
entire ruminant population is devoid of antibodies.
Though -- for reasons that are in need of scientific explanation --
the use of live-attenuated BTV vaccines has not been sanctioned by
the EU, this issue seems to deserve reconsideration if there is a
genuine wish to diminish this year's (2007) losses. From a reliable
source we noted that the availability of a live-attenuated BTV-8
vaccine, tested for its safety, has been recently mentioned and
remains a subject for discussion. - Mod.AS]
