[The number of reported Zika virus infections in the Americas has declined substantially over the past 6 months. It seems unlikely that this decline in reports is entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic preempting public health resources and the public's attention. The 2015-2015 Zika outbreak in the Americas has doubtlessly left many individuals immune that may be slowing transmission. The virus has not disappeared from the Americas so continued surveillance is necessary. - Mod.TY]

Domesticating Zika virus
------------------------
Why hasn't Zika virus (ZIKV) disease caused as much devastation in Africa, its continent of origin, as it has in the Americas? Outside of Africa, this flavivirus is transmitted by a ubiquitous mosquito subspecies, _Aedes aegypti aegypti_, which emerged from the African forerunner subspecies _Aedes aegypti formosus_ and acquired a preference for human blood and a peridomestic lifestyle. Now, this subspecies colonizes many intertropical cities, aided by climate change and human trash. Aubry et al tested 14 laboratory mosquito colonies for their relative susceptibility to ZIKV. Quantitative trait locus mapping showed differences on chromosome 2 between mosquitoes from Gabon and Guadeloupe. Mouse infection experiments revealed that African mosquitoes transmitted a smaller virus inoculum than the South American insects. Increased susceptibility coupled with the ability of _Ae. aegypti aegypti_ to breed in any discarded object containing water has amplified the problematic nature of this virus as it has circumnavigated the world.

Abstract
--------
The drivers and patterns of zoonotic virus emergence in the human population are poorly understood. The mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ is a major arbovirus vector native to Africa that invaded most of the world's tropical belt over the past 4 centuries, after the evolution of a "domestic" form that specialized in biting humans and breeding in water storage containers. Here, we show that human specialization and subsequent spread of _Ae. aegypti_ out of Africa were accompanied by an increase in its intrinsic ability to acquire and transmit the emerging human pathogen Zika virus. Thus, the recent evolution and global expansion of _Ae. aegypti_ promoted arbovirus emergence not solely through increased vector-host contact but also as a result of enhanced vector susceptibility.

[Finding the genetic differences that make __Ae. aegypti aegypti_ a more efficient transmitter of Zika virus than its forerunner species _Ae. aegypti formosus_ is fascinating and may account for why the Zika virus outbreaks that have occurred in the Americas and elsewhere have not been reported from Africa. It would be interesting to know if the same difference in vector efficiency would occur for dengue and chikungunya viruses. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Originating from African forests, Zika virus (ZIKV) has now emerged worldwide in urbanized areas, mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. Although _Aedes albopictus_ can transmit ZIKV experimentally and was suspected to be a ZIKV vector in Central Africa, the potential of this species to sustain virus transmission was yet to be uncovered until the end of 2019, when several autochthonous transmissions of the virus vectored by _Ae. albopictus_ occurred in France. Aside from these few locally acquired ZIKV infections, most territories colonized by _Ae. albopictus_ have been spared so far. The risk level of ZIKV emergence in these areas remains however an open question. To assess _Ae. albopictus_ vector potential for ZIKV and identify key virus outbreak predictors, we built a complete framework using the complementary combination of (i) dose-dependent experimental _Ae. albopictus_ exposure to ZIKV followed by time-dependent assessment of infection and systemic infection rates, (ii) modeling of intra-human ZIKV viremia dynamics, and (iii) in silico epidemiological simulations using an Agent-Based Model. The highest risk of transmission occurred during the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease, at the peak of viremia. At this dose, mosquito infection probability was estimated to be 20%, and 21 days were required to reach the median systemic infection rates. Mosquito population origin, either temperate or tropical, had no impact on infection rates or intra-host virus dynamic. Despite these unfavorable characteristics for transmission, _Ae. albopictus_ was still able to trigger and yield large outbreaks in a simulated environment in the presence of sufficiently high mosquito biting rates. Our results reveal a low but existing epidemic potential of _Ae. albopictus_ for ZIKV, that might explain the absence of large scale ZIKV epidemics so far in territories occupied only by _Ae. albopictus_. They nevertheless support active surveillance and eradication programs in these territories to maintain the risk of emergence to a low level.

Author summary
--------------
Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged worldwide and triggered large outbreaks in human populations. While the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_ is considered the primary vector of ZIKV, the Asian tiger mosquito _Ae. albopictus_ has been shown experimentally to transmit the virus and has been involved in a few autochthonous transmissions in France in 2019. Here, we provide a comprehensive study on the ability of _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes to transmit ZIKV by considering the within-host dynamics of ZIKV infection in humans and its impact on both mosquito infection probability and time to mosquito infectiousness. These empirical data were then leveraged by in silico simulations to embed them into their epidemiological context. Our study reveals a low but existing epidemic potential of _Ae. albopictus_ for ZIKV, whatever their tropical or temperate origins. We identified mosquito density as a predictor for ZIKV outbreak occurrence when vectored by _Ae. albopictus_. Our findings help to explain the absence of large scale ZIKV epidemics in territories occupied by _Ae. albopictus_ but call for active surveillance and eradication programs to maintain the risk of emergence to a low level.

[In localities in Africa where dengue and chikungunya viruses occur and cause diseases similar to Zika virus infections, one wonders if cases of Zika virus infection are underreported and mistaken for other common febrile diseases. Unlike _Ae. aegypti_, a more strict human feeder, _Ae. albopictus_ has a broad range of host species on which it feeds, many of which are not susceptible to Zika virus and, thus, are dead end hosts further reducing its low epidemic potential. However, including _Ae. albopictus_ in active surveillance for Zika virus as the authors above recommend is prudent, recognizing that this mosquito species has vector capacity having been the vector responsible for outbreaks of chikungunya virus infection. - Mod.TY]

Significance
------------
Infection with Zika virus can cause severe consequences in a subset of the patient population. When infection occurs during pregnancy, congenital abnormalities can occur. Additionally, the onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalitis, and myelitis are associated with Zika virus infection. We have identified several small molecules with favorable clinical profiles, including the five-lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor, MK-591, and the tetracycline antibiotic, methacycline, as inhibitors of Zika virus infection, the latter of which reduced neurological deficits in a Zika virus mouse model. These compounds have the potential to be used as prophylactics or for the treatment of the neurological complications of Zika virus infection.

Abstract
--------
When Zika virus emerged as a public health emergency there were no drugs or vaccines approved for its prevention or treatment. We used a high-throughput screen for Zika virus protease inhibitors to identify several inhibitors of Zika virus infection. We expressed the NS2B-NS3 Zika virus protease and conducted a biochemical screen for small-molecule inhibitors. A quantitative structure-activity relationship model was employed to virtually screen approximately 138 000 compounds, which increased the identification of active compounds, while decreasing screening time and resources. Candidate inhibitors were validated in several viral infection assays. Small molecules with favorable clinical profiles, especially the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor, MK-591, inhibited the Zika virus protease and infection in neural stem cells. Members of the tetracycline family of antibiotics were more potent inhibitors of Zika virus infection than the protease, suggesting they may have multiple mechanisms of action. The most potent tetracycline, methacycline, reduced the amount of Zika virus present in the brain and the severity of Zika virus-induced motor deficits in an immunocompetent mouse model. As Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, the tetracyclines could be quickly translated to the clinic. The compounds identified through our screening paradigm have the potential to be used as prophylactics for patients traveling to endemic regions or for the treatment of the neurological complications of Zika virus infection.

[The study above illustrates the power of high throughput screening to identify compounds that could have value as therapeutics for Zika virus infections. The results in the mouse model are promising. One hopes that the effects will be equally effective in primate models and eventually in humans as prophylactic drugs or treatment of pregnant women to prevent fetal infection with teratogenic effects. The point in pregnancy when the drugs need to be administered to prevent damage will have to be determined. - Mod.TY]

[5] Virus persistence in the placenta
Date: Fri 18 Dec 2020

https://portal.fiocruz.br/en/news/study-suggests-persistent-infection-Zika-virus-placenta


Most times a pregnant woman goes through a viral infection, such as a common cold, the baby remains protected in the womb. This protection is provided by the placenta, the organ that connects mother and baby and works as a barrier against microorganisms. However, there are pathogens that can overcome this barrier. One example is the Zika virus. In 2015 and 2016, it caused a public health emergency of international relevance due to its association with microcephaly.

In the search for answers about the disease, research led by the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (IOC/Fiocruz) and by the University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) is now focusing on this key organ. Published in Frontiers in Immunology, the study analyzed samples of the placentas of 10 patients who got the disease during pregnancy. The researchers observed that the virus causes a persistent infection in the organ, leading to inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and severe tissue damage. In cases of microcephaly, the study also found a significant reduction of a substance produced in the placenta, called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), essential for the development of the fetal nervous system.

"We confirmed the presence and replication of the Zika virus in various placental cells and proved a robust inflammatory environment that may remain for months, as the virus continues to replicate in the organ. The infection leads to pathological changes in the tissue, and in some cases, they can make it hard to maintain the pregnancy and hamper fetal development", states Marciano Viana Paes, researcher of the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Research of the IOC and coordinator of the study. "The persistent infection also increases the chances of having the virus get to the fetus, and may regulate neurotrophic factors produced in the placenta, related to damages in the development of the fetal brain", completes the 1st author of the study, Kissila Rabelo, who developed the research during a doctorate in Clinical and Experimental Physiopathology at UERJ, under the guidance of UERJ professor Jorge José de Carvalho and co-tutored by Paes.

Various research groups and maternal-infant assistance units in Rio de Janeiro collaborated with this work. The study was coordinated by the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Research of the IOC and by the Laboratory of Ultrastructure and Tissue Biology of UERJ. Other participants were: IOC Viral Immunology Laboratory, National Institute of Women, Children and Adolescents Health Fernandes Figueira (IFF/Fiocruz), Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS/Fiocruz), Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Uni-Rio), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Medical School of Campos, and Reference Center for Immuno-Infectious Diseases (CRDI), in addition to units of the IMNE group in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes, the Dr Beda General Hospital, Ceplin, and Nicola Albano Neonatal ICU. The project relied on funding by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and by the Carlos Chagas Foundation for Research in Rio de Janeiro (Faperj).

Infection and inflammation
--------------------------
The research analyzed different samples from 10 cases of Zika in pregnant women, reported in 2015 and 2016, at the peak of the outbreak of Zika. Of these, 5 patients gave birth to microcephalic babies and 5 had children with normal head size. The placenta samples were collected after labor and were compared to those of 5 pregnant women who had not been infected (control group).

The study shows ample evidence that the Zika virus remains in the placenta and replicates in the organ, months after contagion. Signs of the presence of the virus were found in all the samples, including the cases in which the patients had shown symptoms of the disease, such as fever and skin rash, during the 1st trimester. In addition, clusters of viral particles were detected inside placental cells. Damages in cell organelles were also observed for the very 1st time.

The study provides details on the inflammatory process triggered by the Zika virus in the placenta. The work also shows an increase in inflammatory substances that activate the immune response and in defense cells that fight the infection. However, the immune reaction cannot eliminate the Zika [virus], and the excessive inflammation generates a toxic environment for placental cells.

"We observed that some patients show a persistent infection in the placenta, and even then they do not develop antibodies that neutralize the Zika virus. The immune response against the infection includes various cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and T CD8+ lymphocytes, and has a more cytotoxic profile, with the involvement of cytokines [molecules that provide signaling between cells] that lead to tissue damage and increased vascular permeability", says Rabelo.

Zika proteins and genetic material were found in six different cell types, as well as in placental defense cells. The findings strengthen the conclusions of previous studies, pointing to 2 possible infection pathways in babies. On the one hand, the progressive transmission of the virus between placental cells until it reaches the amniotic fluid and then the fetus. On the other hand, the transportation of viral particles by immune cells, which are passed from mother to baby.

Neurotrophic factor
-------------------
By comparing the samples, researchers found that the BDNF substance showed a statistically significant reduction in the cases of microcephaly. Produced in the placenta, this molecule promotes neuron growth and differentiation during fetal development and is fundamental for the formation of the brain. According to the scientists, although it does not work alone, it may be one of the determining proteins for the severity of the lesions, and BDNF levels in the placenta may serve as a predictive marker of damage extension.

"BDNF is a neurotrophic factor normally produced in the placenta to maintain placental cells, but it is also essential for the development of the fetal nervous system. This is why we investigated its presence in the different samples. We observed a reduced expression of BDNF in the infected tissues and almost no expression in the placentas that generated babies with microcephaly. This shows that in addition to the direct infection of the fetus, the Zika virus can also affect proteins produced in the placenta, leading to damages on the development of the fetal nervous system", explains Paes.

Response to society
-------------------
Between 2015 and 2016, the Zika virus caused almost 3000 cases of the congenital syndrome, including microcephaly and other malformations, in addition to fetal and newborn deaths. The public health emergency had its end declared as the number of cases progressively declined, but the disease has not gone away. According to the Ministry of Health, new cases continue to occur systematically in the country. Specialists also say that new outbreaks can occur in the future.

"In 2015 we saw the rapid dissemination of the Zika virus in Brazil and the situation of pregnant women who were informed on congenital syndrome and had to take care of babies with severe disabilities. This was very shocking and made us think about how the scientific community could know so little about this disease. As a research group that already works with arboviruses, we dedicated our efforts to understanding the pathogenesis of this disease, which was little known until then," states Rabelo.

"Establishing the profile of the infection and of the immune response caused by the Zika virus in the placenta is an important foundation to detect plasmatic markers and for the development of drugs and vaccines, as well as for other studies that hope to clarify how the disease occurs. We, therefore, hope to contribute, together with the entire scientific community, to minimize the harm to the population that still suffers from the disease", concludes Paes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Whether prolonged maternal viremia after Zika virus infection represents a risk factor for maternal-fetal transmission and subsequent adverse outcomes remains unclear. In this prospective cohort study in French Guiana, we enrolled Zika virus-infected pregnant women with a positive PCR result at inclusion and noninfected pregnant women; both groups underwent serologic testing in each trimester and at delivery during January-July 2016. Prolonged viremia was defined as ongoing virus detection more than 30 days postinfection. Adverse outcomes (fetal loss or neurologic anomalies) were more common in fetuses and neonates from mothers with prolonged viremia (40.0%) compared with those from infected mothers without prolonged viremia (5.3%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] 7.2 [95% CI 0.9-57.6]) or those from noninfected mothers (6.6%, aRR 6.7 [95% CI 3.0-15.1]). Congenital infections were confirmed more often in fetuses and neonates from mothers with prolonged viremia compared with the other 2 groups (60.0% vs. 26.3% vs. 0.0%, aRR 2.3 [95% CI 0.9-5.5]).

[7] Birth defect cause
Date: Thu 28 Jan 2021

https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/cc-src012721.php


Cleveland Clinic researchers have described for the 1st time how Zika virus (ZIKV) causes one of the most common birth defects associated with prenatal infection, called brain calcification, according to new study findings published in Nature Microbiology [see reference below].

The findings may reveal novel strategies to prevent prenatal ZIKV brain calcification and offer important insights into how calcifications form in other congenital infections.

"Brain calcification has been linked to several developmental defects in infants, including motor disorders, cognitive disability, eye abnormalities, hearing deficits, and seizures, so it's important to better understand the mechanisms of how they develop," said Jae Jung, PhD, director of Cleveland Clinic's Global Center for Pathogen Research & Human Health and lead author on the study. Dr Jung, who is also chair of the Department of Cancer Biology, joined Cleveland Clinic from the University of Southern California in July.

Utilizing ZIKV-positive fetal brain specimens and preclinical disease models, the research team identified the protein BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) and the protease NS3 (nonstructural protein 3) as central players in ZIKV brain calcification.

Scans of ZIKV-positive brains collected and donated from Brazil during the 2015-2016 Zika outbreak revealed that cells called pericytes, which wrap around blood capillaries in the brain, collect around calcified lesions and have high concentrations of viral genetic material, suggesting a key role in infection-induced calcification.

"Several cell types have been explored for their involvement in ZIKV infection and pathology, but to our knowledge, this is the 1st study to investigate the role of pericytes," said Weiqiang Chen, PhD, a research associate in Dr. Jung's lab and the 1st author on the study.

The researchers infected fetal-derived pericytes with ZIKV and found that the BMP2 gene, which encodes the BMP2 protein, and several downstream osteogenic genes (related to bone formation) were expressed at higher levels and resulted in calcification. "We discovered that during ZIKV infection, some of the BMP family of genes and associated proteins function differently than during normal development," commented Dr. Chen.

Normally, BMPs activate specific proteins (the SMAD protein family) to modulate expression of osteogenic genes. Dr. Jung and his team showed in the study, however, that during ZIKV infection, a viral enzyme called NS3 transforms the BMP2 protein into a mature and biologically active form that enhances osteogenic gene expression. Effectively, NS3 activates BMP2 signaling pathways to trigger calcification and faulty brain development.

More research will be critical, but the study findings suggest that perhaps targeting NS3, either by preventing its expression or its binding with BMP2, may help to prevent ZIKV brain calcification in utero.

Abstract
--------
The resurgence of arbovirus outbreaks across the globe, including the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in 2015-2016, emphasizes the need for innovative vector control methods. In this study, we investigated ZIKV susceptibility to transgenic _Aedes aegypti_ engineered to target the virus by means of the antiviral small-interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway. The robustness of antiviral effector expression in transgenic mosquitoes is strongly influenced by the genomic insertion locus and transgene copy number; we therefore used CRISPR/Cas9 to re-target a previously characterized locus (Chr2:321382225) and engineered mosquitoes expressing an inverted repeat (IR) dsRNA against the NS3/4A region of the ZIKV genome. Small RNA analysis revealed that the IR effector triggered the mosquito's siRNA antiviral pathway in bloodfed females. Nearly complete (90%) inhibition of ZIKV replication was found in vivo in both midguts and carcasses at 7 or 14 days post-infection (dpi). Furthermore, significantly fewer transgenic mosquitoes contained ZIKV in their salivary glands (p = 0.001), which led to a reduction in the number of ZIKV-containing saliva samples as measured by transmission assay. Our work shows that _Ae. aegypti_ innate immunity can be co-opted to engineer mosquitoes resistant to ZIKV.

[These promising results merit further exploration of this approach to determine the feasibility of introducing these transgenic, Zika virus resistant mosquitoes into the field in numbers adequate to reduce virus transmission in the field. The results of follow up research are awaited with interest. - Mod.TY ]
