Start date: 25 Sep 2009
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 29 Sep 2009
Date submitted to OIE: 29 Sep 2009
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 1.3 per cent
Mortality: 0 per cent
Zoonotic impact: refer to OIE guidance/opinion
Causal agent: pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus
Serotype: other
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (1/2009): Kilworth, Cork
Date of start of the outbreak: 25 Sep 2009
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species: swine
Susceptible: 3050
Cases: 40
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: breeding unit containing 650 sows and 2400 piglets and
weaners. 40 dry sows in 2 of 3 sow houses affected.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics
Species: swine
Apparent morbidity rate: 1.31 per cent
Apparent mortality rate: 0.00 per cent
Apparent case fatality rate: 0.00 per cent
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: 0.00 per cent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: infected farm worker

Epidemiological comments
The pigs were being monitored as high-risk following confirmation of the
virus in a worker on 22 Sep 2009. The worker tended the pigs from 15-18 Sep
2009 whilst sick. Clinical signs appeared in the pigs on 25 Sep 2009 with
sows off feed and laboured breathing. Movements of pigs off farm have been
stopped voluntarily since 18 Sep 2009 in accordance with a Code of Practice
previously agreed between Department of Agriculture and stakeholders.

Control measures
Measures applied
- no vaccination;
- no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied
- no other measures

Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Research Laboratory,
Backweston, County Kildare (National laboratory)
Species: swine
Test: real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR)
Test: date 29 Sep 2009
Result: positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The "one medicine" approach taken here is an excellent example of getting
the most out of our disease investigations by helping to develop an idea of
the incubation period for the pigs when exposed to humans with the pandemic
strain of H1N1 influenza A virus. The incubation period seems to be 7-10
days, as pigs were exposed between 15-18 Sep 2009, and on farm surveillance
1st identified sick pigs on 25 Sep 2009.

It is also a good example of the efficiencies in a "one medicine"
perspective, because the occurrence of disease in humans led to a stop
movement order on the swine farm starting a week before the pigs got sick,
thereby minimizing spread to other farms. It will be interesting to see if
there are any trace outs -- that is, other farms to which pigs moved prior
to 18 Sep 2009 that subsequently become sick.

Finally, disease is occurring in Cork at the southern part of Ireland, a
great distance away from the location of the recent outbreak in Northern
Ireland. The location can be seen on the map attached to the OIE report or
by checking HealthMaps. - Mod.PC]
