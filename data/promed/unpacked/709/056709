scientists in this field and who is (among other activities) member of the
US Presidential Information Technology Advisory Committee and the
Advisory Committee on Internet-2 (University Consortium for
Advanced Internet Development), will give a keynote speech on the

medicine?
Interesting panel discussions will be held such as "quality of Internet
information" and impact of the Internet on consumer health.
