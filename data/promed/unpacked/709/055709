[1] Pan-beta CoV vaccine
Date: Mon 10 May 2021

A study reports the creation of the 1st "pan-betaCoV" vaccine, which can protect against coronaviruses responsible for COVID and other related viral infections such as SARS and MERS. The vaccine is a nanoparticle made with fragments of SARS-CoV-2. When tested in monkeys, the vaccine also protected against B.1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351 (variants first identified in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa, respectively).

Abstract: Betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (1-4 [see pdf download at source URL for complete references]). Vaccines that elicit protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs circulating in animals have the potential to prevent future betaCoV pandemics. Here, we show that macaque immunization with a multimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) nanoparticle adjuvanted with 3M-052/Alum elicited cross-neutralizing antibody (cross-nAb) responses against batCoVs, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351. Nanoparticle vaccination resulted in a SARS-CoV-2 reciprocal geometric mean neutralization ID50 titer of 47 216, and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaque upper and lower respiratory tracts. Importantly, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric RBD also induced SARS-CoV-1 and batCoV cross-nAbs, albeit at lower titers. These results demonstrate current mRNA vaccines may provide some protection from future zoonotic betaCoV outbreaks and provide a platform for further development of pan-betaCoV vaccines.

Discussion: The RBD-scNP [RBD sortase A conjugated nanoparticle] vaccine is a promising platform for pancoronavirus vaccine development for the following reasons. The RBD-scNP vaccine induced apparent sterilizing immunity in the upper respiratory tract, which has not been routinely achieved with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in macaques (50,51). Additionally, the extraordinarily high neutralization titers achieved by RBD-scNP vaccination bode well for an extended duration of protection. Despite the induction of high levels of antibody, we observed no evidence of increased immunopathology inflammatory cytokines or virus replication indicative [of] vaccine-elicited antibody-dependent enhancement. Lack of in vivo infection enhancement is consistent with studies using SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal Abs (15). 3M-052 adsorbed to Alum is in clinical testing (NCT04177355) generating a potential translational pathway for RBD-scNP adjuvanted with 3M-052. The RBD-scNP/3M-052 vaccine represents a platform for producing pancoronavirus vaccines that could prevent, rapidly temper, or extinguish the next spillover of a coronavirus into humans.

[2] COVID vaccination global database
Date: Mon 10 May 2021

Researchers have created a COVID vaccination global database (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) that tracks the scale and rate of vaccine rollout around the world. This online tool will help policymakers understand challenges and inequalities in vaccine access, the impact of vaccinations on transmission, and the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions as vaccinations continue.

Citation: Mathieu E, Ritchie H, Ortiz-Ospina E, et al. A global database of COVID-19 vaccinations. Nat Hum Behav. Epub 10 May 2021. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01122-8

Abstract: An effective rollout of vaccinations against COVID-19 offers the most promising prospect of bringing the pandemic to an end. We present the Our World in Data COVID-19 vaccination dataset, a global public dataset that tracks the scale and rate of the vaccine rollout across the world. This dataset is updated regularly and includes data on the total number of vaccinations administered, 1st and 2nd doses administered, daily vaccination rates and population-adjusted coverage for all countries for which data are available (169 countries as of 7 Apr 2021). It will be maintained as the global vaccination campaign continues to progress. This resource aids policymakers and researchers in understanding the rate of current and potential vaccine rollout; the interactions with non-vaccination policy responses; the potential impact of vaccinations on pandemic outcomes such as transmission, morbidity and mortality; and global inequalities in vaccine access.

[3] Variant B.1.617.2: UK updates
Date: Wed 12 May 2021 01:00 EDT
Source: The Guardian [abridged, edited]
https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/12/indian-covid-variant-calls-in-question-17-may-reopening-in-uk-say-experts?__twitter_impression=true


The dramatic rise in UK cases of a variant first discovered in India could undermine the country's roadmap for reopening, scientists are cautioning.

The variant, called B.1.617.2, is one of 3 closely related variants that were initially detected in India. Public Health England designated it a "variant of concern" on Friday [7 May 2021], acknowledging it appears to be at least as transmissible as the dominant so-called Kent variant in the UK. It is unclear if and to what extent B.1.617.2 can reduce vaccine effectiveness.

Prof Christina Pagel, director of the clinical operational research unit at University College London and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, speaking in a personal capacity said the rise in B.1.617.2 cases was concerning enough to delay the next stage of the roadmap scheduled for Monday [10 May 2021], when a range of restrictions are to be lifted.

According to the COVID-19 genomics UK consortium database -- which may include duplicates and does not record whether sequences of the variants are linked to travel -- for sequences up to 7 May [2021], there have so far been 1393 instances of B.1.617.2, making it the 2nd most common variant in the UK.

Meanwhile, Wellcome Sanger Institute's COVID-19 genomic surveillance data -- which excludes recent travellers and surge testing specimens -- suggests that about 6.1% of COVID genomes in England sequenced in the 4 weeks to 24 Apr [2021] can be attributed to B.1.617.2.

While the Kent variant is decreasing or stabilising, B.1.617.2 is flourishing. In some parts of the country, such as Bolton and Blackburn, the variant accounts for over 50% of cases. Andy Burnham, the mayor for Greater Manchester, has said the Joint Committee for Vaccines and Immunisations is considering a request to vaccinate all over-16s in Bolton in response to the rising infection rate.

Pagel pointed out that, while B.1.617.2 numbers are not currently that big, they are doubling every week -- and this is all within the space of 3 weeks. "We've done this so many times -- waited until things got really bad before we realised we should have acted several weeks ago," she said. "So why don't we actually act several weeks ago -- which is now!"

On Thursday [6 May 2021], leaked Public Health England documents seen by the Guardian showed that 48 clusters of B.1.617.2 had been identified, including those linked to secondary schools, care homes and religious gatherings.

Recent meeting minutes from the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) showed the scientists expected that a variant that substantially escapes immunity or is highly transmissible (more so than the Kent variant) could lead to a wave of infections potentially larger than that seen in January 2021 in the absence of interventions.

"Given that so much of our plans for unlocking rely on the protection afforded by vaccination, my main concern is that we do not yet know the extent to which many variants escape either naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity," said Andrew Hayward, Sage member and director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care.

"We know that the vaccine is very effective against the B.1.1.7 [Kent] strain...but we also know that the vaccine is less effective at protecting against the variant originating in South Africa. For the variants arising in India...we have no real-world data and relatively little laboratory data to assess whether it is likely to evade immunity."

Early data suggested there might be a slight decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against B.1.617.2 -- but not as much as against the variant discovered in South Africa, said Deborah Dunn-Walters, professor of immunology at the University of Surrey and chair of the British Society for Immunology's COVID-19 and immunology taskforce, adding that she was feeling very cautious.

Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said he and his colleagues are very worried. "There are still many people, especially the young, those in disadvantaged areas, and those from ethnic minorities that are still unvaccinated. I am less concerned about meetings out of doors, as the risks there are low, but I will personally continue to avoid indoor meetings, such as restaurants, even though I am fully vaccinated."

[4] Canada (Ontario)
Date: Wed 12 May 2021 00:47 MSK

https://www.rt.com/news/523544-ontario-halts-astrazeneca-vaccine/


Health officials in Canada's Ontario province have suspended use of the AstraZeneca/Vaxzevria COVID-19 vaccine, saying that escalating concerns over risks of blood clots merited a review amid increasing supplies of competing jabs.

The indefinite suspension takes effect immediately, Dr. David Williams, the province's chief medical officer, told reporters on Tuesday [11 May 2021]. Public health officials are reviewing whether to allow residents who are awaiting their 2nd AstraZeneca dose to complete their vaccination as planned.

Williams noted that data from the UK indicated far lower risk of blood clots for a person receiving a 2nd AstraZeneca shot after tolerating the 1st dose safely. More than 650 000 doses of the vaccine had been administered in Ontario as of 8 May [2021].

Concerns over the vaccine stem from increasing incidence of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). The province has seen 0.9 such cases per 100 000 doses of the AstraZeneca shot overall, but the rate has been around 1.7 in recent weeks.

Dr. Jessica Hopkins, Ontario's chief health protection and emergency preparedness officer, said VITT risk was expected to be in a range of 1 in 125 000 to 1 in 1 million, but recent monitoring shows the rate with AstraZeneca's vaccine to be around 1 in 60 000. "We've seen a safety signal and picked it up," she said.

A changing COVID-19 landscape in Ontario was another component of the suspension decision. In mid-April [2021], the rate of new cases was so high and supplies of vaccines were so low that Ontario Premier [Doug] Ford banned non-essential travel. He went so far as to set up checkpoints at borders with neighboring provinces to turn away travelers and said Ontario was "losing the battle" between new COVID-19 variants and its vaccine supplies.

However, Williams said new infections have dropped dramatically since then, and supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have become more abundant and more reliable.

Health officials made a similar decision in Alberta province on Tuesday [11 May 2021], also halting the AstraZeneca rollout, though they said the move was prompted by uncertainty over the supply of the immunization, rather than concern about side effects.

"Based on global supply challenges, we do not know when we will get additional supply," Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said in a lengthy Twitter thread explaining the decision, adding: "That's why we are making the prudent move."

More than a dozen EU nations halted use of the AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this year [2021] on VITT concerns. The European Medicines Agency ruled in March that the Anglo-Swedish vaccine was safe and effective, and that its benefits outweighed the risks of side effects.

Slovakia's Health Ministry last week halted its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine for 1st doses after a woman who received the shot developed blood clots and died. It's still being offered for 2nd doses. The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo on Monday [10 May 2021] halted use of the AstraZeneca shots in pregnant women while authorities are investigating the death of an expectant mother.

The death of a 47-year-old woman was likely connected to her receiving the Anglo-Swedish vaccine, due to a medical predisposition she had for blood clotting disorders, the country's regulator, the State Institute for Drug Control (SUKL) said last week."

Ford also extended a stay-at-home order for Ontario residents to 6 weeks from 4 weeks and gave police new powers to ramp up enforcement of his pandemic restrictions." - Mod.LK]

[5] EpiCore responses: COVID-19-associated mucormycosis RFI 20210510.8354377

In India, steroids are greatly misused in COVID. Recovery trial showed their benefit in only a small subset of the total patient population, but doctors seem to have inappropriately caught their use in virtually all patients.

While steroids improve symptoms and even the need for critical care in the short term if used thus, many patients come back not only with symptoms like fever but also hypoxia a few days after steroids are stopped. In fact, patients who become hypoxic after having earlier been on steroids prematurely or inappropriately are almost impossible to salvage.

Thus, apart from the issue of mucormycosis, clinicians should be made aware of the risks of inappropriate steroid use for COVID-19.

It may not be just an issue of numbers in India as you mention. It may be more to do with rampant misuse of steroids that may not be happening elsewhere.
