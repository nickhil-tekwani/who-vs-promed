A new outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been discovered in
western South Korea despite efforts to contain the deadly epidemic,
officials said. Three of the 21 cattle on one farm were found to be
infected Thursday and authorities quarantined the area surrounding the farm
in Hongsong, 60 miles south of Seoul, the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry
said. All 21 cattle were slaughtered and buried. Three days earlier, 6
cattle at a farm in Chungju, 50 miles east of Hongsong, were found to be
infected. The latest discovery brought the number of infected areas to 14
farms in 2 western and 1 central province since symptoms of the disease
were first reported in Paju, 30 miles north of Seoul, around March 20.
Police and soldiers set up road barriers to block the movement of all
animals and were inoculating all cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, pigs
and goats within a 6-mile radius of infected farms. South Korea has
slaughtered about 900 cattle and pigs and inoculated 200,000 others. It
plans to inoculate all 11 million cloven-hoofed animals in the nation. Most
livestock markets were closed to prevent the further spread of the disease.
It was the first confirmed outbreak of FMD disease in Asia since the
disease virtually wiped out Taiwan's hog herd 3 years ago. Japan,
Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and China have banned imports of
beef and pork from South Korea. Infected cattle and pigs show a decline of
appetite with blisters on their hooves and mouths. The disease can kill
entire herds but cannot be passed on to people. [It is rare, but FMD can be
passed on to people. It is not an extremely serious disease in people, but
it is inaccurate to say people cannot get the disease. - Mod. TG
