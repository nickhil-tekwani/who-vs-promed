Hospitals fail to report deaths
---------------------------------
China's medical institutions failed to report 1/3rd of deaths to the
national health surveillance network, the country's top health
authority said on Tuesday [15 Aug 2006].
Furthermore, an estimated 20 percent of hospitals failed to report any deaths.
"Lack of attention and understanding of the importance of death
reporting has resulted in missing reports by local authorities," said
Mao Qun'an, spokesman of the Ministry of Health (MOH).
"It causes a lot of difficulties for the country's control and
prevention of infectious diseases."
The MOH carried out an investigation into the operation of a death
reporting system among 130 medical institutions at and above county
level in 29 provinces and municipalities at the end of last year
[2005]. The reporting system was introduced in April 2004.
In one province, which the MOH did not name, more than 86 percent of
deaths had not been reported, and across the country, almost 30
percent of deaths were not reported in a timely manner. The MOH
pointed out that the hospitals at the provincial level usually
delayed reports for longer than those at lower levels.
The investigation found that about 25 percent of death causes had
been misreported. More than 60 percent of reported deaths had been
attributed to symptoms instead of causes, including failures of the
heart, respiratory system, kidneys or lungs.
The investigation revealed poor management and supervision of the
reporting system, the ministry admitted. The ministry urged local
medical institutions to report fatalities in a more direct, timely
and concise manner and instructed health authorities to improve staff
training, especially on how to fill in the reporting form and
pinpoint the exact cause of death.
"The importance of such reporting needs to be stressed," Mao said.
"It is very wrong for medical staff to only report deaths of SARS
(severe acute respiratory syndrome) and bird flu, but neglect other
fatalities from unknown reasons."

[The above newswire is interesting, as it points out the challenges
faced by China in compliance with disease surveillance mandates from
the central level. The world has been quick to criticize and blame
China for not reporting human cases of diseases of interest in a
timely and complete manner. In earlier postings on ProMED-mail, there
have been reports in which there have been similar statements that
the central level has not been receiving information from the
reporting units in a timely and complete fashion. What is different
about the above report from earlier reports is that actual data on
the reporting completeness of the reporting units is given. What this
suggests is that the Ministry of Health is seriously looking into the
disease surveillance system and evaluating its efficacy.
Given the size of the country, with large geographic areas that would
be classified as rural along with limited access to hospital care, a
reliance upon hospital-based mortality alone would most likely be
markedly misleading. Yet, it might very well serve as a good "tip of
the iceberg" indicator to health authorities identifying geographic
areas where a closer look at non-hospital-based mortality might be in
order. - Mod.MPP]
