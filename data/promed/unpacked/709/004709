I was interested by the note about bed and room sharing as a risk
factor in the transmission of _Clostridium difficile_.
About 12 years ago, I noted an increase in the number of new cases of
_C. difficile_ in the hospital where I worked at the time. Intrigued,
I entered the newly identified patients on a grid I had previously
designed to trace nosocomial transmission of organisms over time in
the course of an outbreak.
Sure enough, over 30 percent of the newly acquired _C. difficile_
cases occurred either in rooms from which a patient with _C.
difficile_ was just discharged, or to the roommate of a recently
diagnosed _C. difficile_ patient.
