[1] European Commission, vaccination

[On 16 Jan 2008, the European Commission hosted in Brussels a
conference on bluetongue in Europe. More than 350 experts met to
discuss the best ways of tackling this disease, with a particular
focus on vaccination as a prevention and control measure.

Conference participants included representatives from the Commission,
Member States, 3rd countries, international organisations and
stakeholder groups. Discussions also centered on technical and
economic aspects related to carrying out vaccination against
bluetongue, including trade considerations. Following presentations
on successful vaccination experiences in Member States and 3rd
countries, there was wide consensus that a mass vaccination strategy
in the affected Member States should be facilitated and that all
available vaccines should be used. We introduce the conclusions of
the conference, as published on the website of the European
Commission. - Mod.AS]

Conclusions: Conference on "Vaccination strategy against bluetongue",
Brussels, 16 Jan 2008
-----------------------------------------------------

1. General
- The Commission's political line, with regards to bluetongue has
been outlined today and is now clear: mass vaccination with all
available vaccines.
- Estimating the actual losses due to bluetongue is difficult, but
the figures already provided suggest that they are substantial.
- We now realise and acknowledge the very valuable expertise
gathered in the southern Member States previously affected by
bluetongue, and especially as regards the successful use of
vaccination using the 2 different types of vaccines.
- It is clear that the use of both types of vaccines is better than
developing the disease.
- We need to strike a balance between harmonisation and flexibility.
- The OIE Code confirms that vaccination is the best solution for safe trade.
- Solid and accurate standards for trade are provided in the OIE
Code but efforts should still be made as regards the OIE Manual.
- Some stakeholders have suggested that the authorities should
consider the possibility that farmers administer the vaccine.
- The local epidemiological situation largely influences the choice
of the most adequate type of vaccine and vaccination strategy.
- It would be hard to justify adopting the same approach in
controlling the disease in 2008 as in 2007, given that vaccines
against BTV-1 and BTV-8 are now available.

2. The Disease and Its Control
- We have gained a lot of expertise and knowledge of the disease in
recent years.
- A particular European characteristic is the unprecedented waves of
bluetongue epidemics affecting in some cases high production areas.
- We have learned that emergency mass vaccination is the most
efficient strategy, taking into account the current EU situation.
- In principle, there is no scientific, economic or management
justification to exclude the use of any of the existing vaccines for
emergency vaccination.
- This should be done within the existing EU legal framework for
bluetongue control and eradication, as is the case for any other
former list A diseases of the OIE.

3. The Vaccine
- Sufficient and timely availability of vaccines for rapid
vaccination remains a concern. Vaccine supplies can now be ensured
taking into account all types of vaccines.
- Control and direct supervision of the official veterinary services
should ensure correct vaccine administration.
- Adequate surveillance and control mechanisms should be put in place.

4. Financial Aspects
- The Community's co-financing for 2008 is covered in the framework
of emergency veterinary measures at the rate of 100 percent of the
costs of the purchase of the vaccine and 50 percent of the costs of
the administration, subject to certain ceilings.
- The rest of the involved parties, and especially the Competent
Authorities of Member States, should immediately deploy the necessary
resources, including human resources.

5. Next Steps
- Vaccination plans fulfilling all the necessary requirements should
be swiftly submitted by Member States.
- The follow-up and evaluation of the results of this emergency
vaccination approach will be carried out in 2009.

January 2008: Questions and Answers on bluetongue vaccination
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is bluetongue?
Bluetongue is a non-contagious, insect-transmitted, viral disease of
domestic and wild ruminants. At present 24 serotypes of the virus are
recognised. The virulence and mortality rate of the different virus
strains vary considerably depending also on the infected species.

2. What are the advantages of vaccinating against bluetongue?
Vaccination is regarded as one of the most effective ways of
controlling and eventually eradicating bluetongue disease in affected
areas. It reduces clinical signs in affected animals resulting in
lower mortality and reduced economical losses, and it prevents the
spread of the disease amongst livestock.

3. What are the different vaccine options?
Vaccines against bluetongue can either be inactivated vaccines or
modified live virus (MLV) vaccines. Inactivated vaccines, when
administered in 2 separate doses, are able to fully protect animals
for a long period. Modified live vaccines generate protective
immunity after a single inoculation, and they have been proven
effective in preventing clinical BT in the areas where they are used.

4. Can Member States use vaccination against bluetongue?
Under EU legislation, Member States can apply vaccination as a
control measure against bluetongue. Member States that wish to carry
out a bluetongue vaccination campaign must inform the Commission.

5. What measures are set out for bluetongue vaccination in EU legislation?
In October 2007, Regulation (EC) No. 1266/2007 was adopted, setting
out more harmonised measures for the monitoring and control of
bluetongue. Under this Regulation, clear conditions are set out for
the movement of animals from bluetongue infected areas, including
those which have been vaccinated against the disease. The Regulation
clarifies the requirements for vaccinated animals and therefore makes
intra-community trade of vaccinated animals more feasible. Animals
vaccinated against bluetongue can only be moved if they meet certain
conditions established in Annex III of Regulation (EC) No. 1266/2007.
These conditions ensure that vaccinated animals are not viraemic
(i.e., that there is no virus in the bloodstream) and have already
developed a sufficient immune protection before being moved outside
the protection zone.

6. Is there financial support for bluetongue vaccination?
EU co-funding may be provided to cover certain costs of vaccination,
not only in emergency situations but also for long-term surveillance
and control activities and when vaccination is used with to eradicate
bluetongue.

7. Has vaccination against bluetongue already been carried out in
the EU, and what were the results?
Bluetongue vaccination has been successfully used in a number of
European countries which have been affected by the disease. Italy,
Spain, France and Portugal have all used vaccination as a means of
controlling and eradicating outbreaks of the bluetongue virus.

8. Why has vaccination not been carried out in all affected Member
States so far?
For certain strains of the bluetongue virus, including BTV8 which has
caused the outbreaks in Northern Europe, no vaccine has been
available up to now. However, the Commission has had close contacts
with the industry on this issue, and several producers have developed
or are currently developing a vaccine which could be used against BTV8.

9. Can vaccinated animals still carry the bluetongue virus?
Vaccination does not immediately protect the animal from infection if
there is a virus circulating. When the vaccines are administered to
uninfected animals, the onset of a protection is observed only after
a certain period, depending on the biological properties of the
vaccines. For this reason, EU legislation lays down movement
restrictions and/or controls for vaccinated animals to ensure that
they do not contribute to the spread of the disease.

10. Can vaccinated animals be distinguished from naturally infected animals?
No strategy is currently available to distinguish vaccinated from
infected animals on the basis of serology. However, PCR techniques
which can distinguish vaccines from field viruses have been
established and successfully used.

11. Are meat and milk products from infected or vaccinated animals
safe to eat, and do they have to be labelled as such?
Bluetongue does not affect humans, and there is no risk of the
disease being contracted or spread through meat or milk. The
vaccination of animals against bluetongue has no impact on their
products. Therefore, there is no reason why labelling requirements
should be introduced for meat and milk from bluetongue-vaccinated animals.

12. What are the trade implications (both intra-EU and vis-a-vis 3d
countries) of vaccination?
Regulation (EC) No. 1266/2007 brings EU rules with regard to the
movement of animals vaccinated against bluetongue more into line with
those of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Both the EU
and OIE accept vaccination as an effective way of controlling
bluetongue and vaccinated animals are considered safe for trade if
certain provisions (see above) are complied with.

Vaccination the only defence against bluetongue, says IAH
---------------------------------------------------------
Bluetongue disease could have a disastrous effect on the livestock
sector in Great Britain if it re-emerges with the same virulence
witnessed in northern Europe last year [2007]. The stark message on
the threat posed by bluetongue was issued by experts from the
Institute for Animal Health at a joint NFU (National Farmers
Union)/IAH (Institute of Animal Health) conference on the disease
held on Thursday (17 Jan 2008).

The message was clear: vaccination is the only protection and unless
a minimum of 80 percent country's ruminant livestock are vaccinated
then the economic consequences would be severe.

IAH bluetongue research leader Chris Oura was unequivocal in his
message. "I want to get the message across: This is a really serious
disease. 2007 is no reflection of what might happen in 2008."

He told the 85 NFU members attending that a relatively small outbreak
in Germany during 2006, although considered bad at the time, was
trivial compared to the 300 premises a day being infected at the peak
of the 2007 outbreak.

"We were lucky in 2007 we got it late so it didn't take hold. 2008
may be very different," said Dr Oura.

Belgium
----------
In Belgium last year [2007] the disease led to 41.9 percent mortality
in sheep, meaning that many producers there have now withdrawn from
sheep production. And in cattle many producers reported re-absorption
of foetuses, abortion, a general decline in animal health and
sterility of sires.

As it became apparent to those producers attending that vaccination
was the only real defence against this debilitating disease and its
severe economic consequences, focus turned to what shape a
vaccination strategy might take and whether a vaccine would be
available in sufficient quantities.

The DEFRA observer present confirmed that the department is
formulating a suitable strategy in conjunction with stakeholders and
experts at the IAH, but its direction would continue to be influenced
by the emergence of new cases unturned by the department's
surveillance work and the results of any pre-movement tests performed
for producers.

Vaccination
----------
However, vaccination will, almost certainly, be on a voluntary,
rather than compulsory, basis and producers inside the protection
zone would be the 1st to be offered the chance to protect stock.

Then, livestock in a "buffer zone" outside the protection zone
(probably about 20km [12.4-mile] wide) would be treated next and the
buffer zone would gradually edge west until England is covered.

However, no one in attendance could estimate how long it would take
to cover England or that the minimum 80 percent coverage needed to
ensure success would be achieved. Peer pressure and the role of the
media in conveying this important message was the put forward as the
only means of encouraging participation.

[In the meantime, a 9th European country has reported the
identification of BTV-8, namely Spain; its official OIE notification
is being posted by ProMED-mail separately. The other affected
countries are: Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Luxembourg,
Denmark, the Czech Republic and Switzerland.

Switzerland, where 12 animals have been found infected in 2007, has
also decided to apply vaccination. The details are being discussed
between the federal authorities, the kantons and the animal breeders. - Mod.AS]
