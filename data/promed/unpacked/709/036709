The Director of Health of the Federal District, Jose Leon Uzcategui,
indicated that in the last three days there has been a decrease in the
number of cases of dengue reported per day from 67 to 53. But he
emphasized it would be a week before anyone could can say whether the
disease is controlled, because in this time the number of adult mosquitoes
is increasing.
For the year, there have been 2,452 cases reported in the capital. Of
these cases, 1,636 cases [33% are hemorrhagic. [The percentage is almost
twice the national average. - DMC
The program of spraying in and around houses continues. Where mosquitoes
have been detected in a residence, the interior of the house and a
perimeter area 55-Km [kilometers or meters? - Mod.CHC wide are sprayed.
The areas [of the capital receiving the most attention are those that have
been affected most by the disease. These include: Catia,Valle-Coche, La
Pastora, Antimano, and the 23rd of January.
In addition there is a program of education in schools and clinics to help
identify and [then treat cases of dengue.
As part of the "war" unleashed on the mosquito, health authorities ordered
the removal of all [water-containing flower vases that sit on graves in
cemeteries in the city and the Central Littoral region. As a substitute,
relatives are permitted to place flowers in vases filled with sand that can
be watered with only 3 cups of water per week.
The department has made available 230 million Bolivares [US$460,000 until
January for the purchase of blood. Also, soldiers in the garrisons of the
Federal District and the State of Miranda have been ordered to act as
blood donors if the need arises. [Wow! - Mod.CHC
Ana Carvajal, President of the Subcommittee of the AIDS Clinic of the
University Hospital remarked that transfusions should be given only to
[dengue patients who present with bleeding and platelet counts below
30,000. But, she observed, the patient runs the risk of HIV exposure if
transfusions persist for 6 weeks. [I have no idea where this observations
comes from. - Mod.CHC
