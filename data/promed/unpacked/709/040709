Congo fever has been reported in the state for the 2nd time causing concern. A man from Malappuram [Kerala], who had come home from UAE [United Arab Emirates] for holidays has been tested positive for Congo fever. His condition was reported as stable.

Currently, the man is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Thrissur. His bodily fluids have been sent for specialized tests. The health department has directed hospital staff to exercise caution as the disease can spread through bodily fluids.

Congo fever or Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), is caused by a tick-borne virus. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

Symptoms include sudden fever with muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes, and sensitivity to light. There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable liver enlargement.

The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness.

[It is not clear from the report above whether the case had any history of tick bite or contact with livestock. The interval between travel from UAE and appearance of disease symptoms is also not mentioned. The incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus: from 1-3 days (maximum 9 days) following tick bite and from 5-6 days (maximum 13 days) after contact with infected blood or tissues (http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever).

Sporadic human cases and outbreaks of CCHF have been reported from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and the UAE in the eastern Mediterranean region (https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(17)30065-6/pdf).

CCHF was first reported in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 1979, when 6 cases were reported among the staff of a hospital in Dubai. An outbreak of CCHF occurred during 1994-1995 with 35 human infections. A molecular investigation showed that this outbreak was multisource from Pakistan, Madagascar, and Somalia, possibly due to the importation of infected livestock from these areas. Subsequently, 35 clinical CCHF cases were reported in 1994, and between January 1998 and October 2013, another 5 cases and 2 deaths were reported from the UAE.

Based on an analysis of complete or partial sequences of the viral S-segment of CCHFV, 3 virus lineages/clades have been identified to be circulating in UAE: Africa 1 (clade III) and Asia 1 and Asia 2 (clade IV) along with circulation in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Oman, and Iraq.

A better understanding of CCHF epidemiology is needed for a comprehensive prevention and control program, encompassing human as well as animal and tick populations. Measures to reduce tick-to-human infection, animal-to-human transmission, and human-to-human transmission are recommended to reduce the risk of infection in people. - Mod.UBA
