[1] Netherlands: update
Date: Tue 11 May 2010

Minister Gerda Verburg (LNV/Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food
Quality) has called upon dairy goat and sheep farmers to vaccinate
their animals against Q fever the soonest. Only when vaccination is
completed in a timely fashion on all farms, would the breeding ban and
the supply ban be lifted [a complete vaccination means 2 primary
vaccinations or revaccination following a primary vaccination round].
Lifting the ban will also depend upon the continued support for this
step by the expert advisory panel led by Mr Coutinho (director of the
National Centre for the control of infectious diseases, CIB), without
reconsideration.

Vaccination
-----------
Dairy goat and sheep farmers are obliged to vaccinate their animals
before 1 Jun [2010]. Up to now, only 383 out of the 426 dairy goat and
sheep farms have been registered for vaccination at the AH [animal
health] Service (GD). Based on the numbers given, the vaccine doses
are distributed to the veterinary practitioners. 455 000 vaccine doses
have so far been delivered. A sufficient quantity of vaccine is kept
available for the remaining, not-yet-registered farms.

_Coxiella burnetii_ in secreted milk
------------------------------------
A possible reason for farmers to postpone vaccination, has been the
recent publication of a study, carried out by the Jeroen Bosch
Hospital, suspecting that _C. burnetii_ DNA could be demonstrated in
the milk of post-vaccinated animals. The status of such farms being "Q
fever free" had to be discussed, including the judgment of the results
of their bulk milk tests.

Subsequently, ministers Verburg (LNV) and Klink (VWS/Ministry of
Health, Welfare and Sport) asked the Central Veterinary Institute
(CVI) and the AH Service (GD) to perform some additional research.
Preliminary results demonstrate that the tests up to 8 days after
vaccination show no increase of excretion of the _C. burnetii_ DNA in
the milk. This information might be an important incentive for the
farmers to push on with vaccination after all (The final research
results will be known at the beginning of June [2010]).

[2] EFSA scientific advice
Date: Wed 12 May 2010

EFSA issues scientific advice on Q fever
----------------------------------------
Following a significant increase of human cases of Q fever in the
Netherlands, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has provided
scientific advice on this animal disease which can also be transmitted
to humans. The opinion addresses the significance of Q fever in
animals and humans, different risk factors involved in the occurrence
and spread of the disease, and the effectiveness of possible control
measures at the EU level.

EFSA's advice states that infection with _Coxiella burnetii_, the
bacterium which causes Q fever, is widespread in cattle, sheep, and
goats in the EU. Several factors can affect the spread of the
infection between these animals, but the overall impact on their
health is limited as they rarely develop the disease itself. When it
occurs, notably in sheep and goats, it may cause reproductive
disorders, including abortion. The opinion suggests that a combination
of measures could be used to control Q fever in the long-term and
short-term, with preventive vaccination of animals considered to be
the most effective long-term option.

The available information indicates that Q fever also has a limited
impact on public health, although it can be significant for some risk
groups. Humans generally become infected through air-borne
transmission of the bacterium. There is no evidence that people can
become ill by consuming contaminated milk or meat.

The Chair of EFSA's expert Panel on Animal Health and Welfare,
Philippe Vannier, said: "Cooperation across animal and public health
disciplines is key in addressing the risks and challenges posed by a
disease such as Q fever. EFSA has therefore worked in close
collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control to provide decision-makers with integrated European-level
advice on Q fever covering both human and animal health, as well as
the transmission of the disease from animals to humans.

"We need early exchange of information between veterinarians and human
health practitioners to better identify the origin of outbreaks in
humans and to implement preventive measures when possible.
Importantly, we need to all speak the same language and record data in
the same way. Harmonisation of data collection is critical in order to
define a more accurate picture of the situation in Europe and how it
is evolving over time."

Infection with _C. burnetii_ can be present in a wide range of
different farming systems. A number of factors -- including proximity
to sheep and goats (especially when giving birth) and dry, windy
weather -- can affect the risk of human infection. However, there is
considerable uncertainty about the relative importance of these risk
factors, and it is likely that there is often more than one factor
involved. No clear link was demonstrated between the spillover of
infection from farms to humans and either the size of the farms
involved or the virulence of different strains of infection.

The opinion identified a number of measures which could be used to
control _C. burnetii_ infection in sheep and goats, but stressed that
a combination of measures may be needed to deal with both farm-based
and environmental routes of infection. Some options, including the
culling of pregnant animals, were not considered suitable for
long-term control but may have a role in the face of an outbreak.
Antibiotic treatment of infected animals was not recommended.

The EFSA opinion included a number of recommendations, including the
harmonisation of data collection on Q fever in animals so as to enable
comparisons over time and between countries. It also stressed the
importance of the rapid identification and reporting of Q fever cases
in animals, as well as the early exchange of information between
veterinarians and public health practitioners.

EFSA has also published today [12 May 2010] a separate report which
includes proposals for the development of a harmonised monitoring and
reporting scheme for Q fever in animals in the EU Member States and
which was referred to extensively in the EFSA opinion. The report was
funded by EFSA, in line with Article 36 of its founding regulation,
and was prepared by a consortium of scientific institutions from
different Member States, led by the French Agence Francaise de
Securite Sanitaire des Aliments (AFSSA).

[According to a letter to the Dutch Parliament from the Minister of
Agriculture, dated 11 May 2010, the number of pregnant goats and
sheep, culled on the 88 infected commercial farms (of which 2 were
dairy sheep, the others dairy goat farms), is about 62 500. One
additional goat farm is currently regarded suspected; future addition
of others cannot yet be excluded.

We are unofficially told that the goat sector in the Netherlands is,
not surprisingly, seriously concerned about the situation,
particularly after experiencing the negative impact of the media
publications, 2 months ago, of the preliminary results of the Jeroen
Bosch Hospital milk study. There are doubts about the odds to timely
alleviate/mitigate, as planned, the current measures of breeding and
transportation bans. Final decision will become feasible when the
complementary study in Lelystad is completed and summarised, namely
early June 2010. - Mod.AS]
