In 2021, cucumber crops were affected by _Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus_ (CABYV) in several areas of the Netherlands. Recently, the virus was found again in glasshouse crops at several companies. Sometimes, there were hardly any aphids in the crop. The virus can be transmitted by a single aphid, possibly picked up from infected weeds outside.

Preventive spraying against aphids is of little use. Controlling aphids as soon as they are detected can prevent new winged aphids from spreading in the crop. Releasing biocontrol agents that parasitise aphids contributes to reducing the aphid population. If CABY-affected plants are present, there is zero tolerance for aphids in a glasshouse. Keeping out aphids is the best solution; CABY did not or hardly occur in screened glasshouses.

[_Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus_ (CABYV; genus _Polerovirus_, Luteoviridae) affects primarily cucurbit crops (such as cucumber, zucchini, melons, pumpkins, squashes) but has also been reported from lettuce, beet, and some legumes (chickpea, broad bean). Symptoms may be confused with nutritional problems and vary with crops, cultivars and environmental conditions. They may include interveinal yellowing, thickening and brittleness of leaves, complete yellowing of whole plants and loss of plant vigour leading to reduced flowering and fruit production. Yield losses of up to 50% for cucumbers and 15% for melons have been reported. Similar symptoms in cucurbits can also be caused by some other _Polerovirus_ or _Crinivirus_ species (e.g., see ProMED post 20220318.8702057).

The virus resides in phloem tissue and can be spread by several aphid species in a persistent manner. Different aphid species vary in their efficiency of CABYV transmission, with _Aphis gossypii_ being one of the most efficient. Infectious insects can be spread with plant material or carried on air currents for long distances. The virus cannot be transmitted mechanically or by seed. Weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management of aphid-transmitted viruses is difficult and may include vector control, removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitation, cultural measures (such as barrier plantings) and use of resistant crop cultivars, if available.

A novel severe strain of CABYV has recently been identified in Spain in watermelon and squash (see link below). In watermelon, yellowing symptoms were much enhanced and often accompanied by considerable fruit abortion.

The currently known luteoviruses are mostly important crop pathogens and include _Potato leafroll virus_, _Turnip yellows virus_, _Maize yellow mosaic virus_ and several barley yellow dwarf viruses (see previous ProMED posts in the archives).
