TYPHOID FEVER UPDATE 2012 (10): COMMENTARY

Frequent reports of "typhoid fever" outbreaks from Africa and Asia almost never are associated with quality laboratory confirmation other than the Widal test. Western insurance and medical assistance firms, for example, receive frequent reports from tourists particularly in Africa that they had a febrile illness, were seen at a local clinics or hospitals, and received a diagnosis of malaria plus typhoid fever and treated for both. When the physician was called, the report was that a blood test had confirmed malaria and a Widal-slide test was "positive".

Some of these folks, on returning to the US and consulting their own doctor, had antibody testing performed for both malaria and typhoid fever with negative results. This is only one point of evidence of gross overdiagnosis of both infectious diseases in many countries. The unreliability of the Widal test is well established.

Another point that needs to be publicized is that _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A is a rapidly emerging cause of enteric fever in much of Asia; particularly Indonesia, India, and China where it may represent up to 50 per cent of enteric fever cases. We have seen several tourists evacuated to Bangkok from Nepal and India with the enteric fever syndrome due to culturally confirmed _S._ Paratyphi A. 2 had a reliable history of current subunit typhoid vaccine. Perhaps it is time for ProMED-mail to report these cases as enteric fever (_S._ Typhi) or enteric fever (_S._ Paratyphi A) whenever possible. It would be valuable if this subject is publicized and we make efforts to obtain reliable laboratory confirmation of "typhoid" fever outbreaks.

The pharmaceutical industry should also be encouraged to manufacture and distribute widely a combined Typhi/Paratyphi vaccine, which should certainly be technically possible today.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Wilde for his comments and regrets the delay in posting of this communication.

It is absolutely true that the diagnostic tests used, if any, in the developing world for enteric fever and malaria are inadequate in any cases. Many febrile diseases are therefore treated empirically for malaria or enteric fever, or both. When ProMED-mail reports typhoid, we understand that in many, perhaps almost or all, of the cases, the diagnoses are unconfirmed. - Mod.LL]
