Mutation increases risk of infections
-------------------------------------
A pattern of genetic mutation has been found in avian flu [viruses] that leads to a higher possibility of infections and diseases in humans. A University of Hong Kong medical team has discovered a genetic adaptation marker, known as 526R, in the enzyme PB2, which is found in all influenza A viruses.

The 526R pattern was found in samples of avian influenza A H5N1 and H7N9, and seasonal influenza H3N2, and enables those viruses to replicate in mammal and human cells. "We believe that it is because of such a pattern of genetic mutation that certain types of avian flu virus can be adopted in humans more easily," said Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, the microbiologist leading the research team.

The team attributed a severe increase of H3N2 cases in humans since 1968 to the existence of the 526R adaptation marker. Among the 200 types of avian flu, only a limited number can infect humans due to host barriers, which restrict the replication of viruses in human cells. However, an adaptive mutation virus can replicate in human cells and cause diseases in humans. Humans contracting avian flu might develop symptoms similar to those of other flu viruses, including fever, headache and sore throat. However, it is more likely to result in multiple organ failure or even death. Since 2003, the H5N1 strain of bird flu has infected more than 650 people worldwide, with a mortality rate of more than 50 per cent. The 1st H5N1 bird flu outbreak locally was in 1997, which resulted in 18 infections and 6 deaths that year.

Through the 2-year study, researchers aimed to find out viral elements that cause cross-species transmissions. The study, a partnership with mainland researchers, was published on 20 Nov 2014 in Nature Communications [see below].

"Abstract
---------
Host-adaptive strategies, such as the E627K substitution in the PB2 protein, are critical for replication of avian influenza A viruses in mammalian hosts. Here we show that mutation PB2-K526R is present in some human H7N9 influenza isolates, in nearly 80 percent of H5N1 human isolates from Indonesia and, in conjunction with E627K, in almost all seasonal H3N2 viruses since 1970. Polymerase complexes containing PB2-526R derived from H7N9, H5N1 or H3N2 viruses exhibit increased polymerase activity. PB2-526R also enhances viral transcription and replication in cells. In comparison with viruses carrying 627K, H7N9 viruses carrying both 526R and 627K replicate more efficiently in mammalian (but not avian) cells and in mouse lung tissues, and cause greater body weight loss and mortality in infected mice. PB2-K526R interacts with nuclear export protein and our results suggest that it contributes to enhance replication for certain influenza virus subtypes, particularly in combination with 627K."

It is important to remember that this mutation affects the ability of avian viruses to replicate in mammalian cells only. It does not facilitate the entry of the avian virus into mammal tissue. Avian H5N1 virus, for instance, frequently replicates in humans with serious consequences, but does not facilitate its spread from person to person. - Mod.CP]
