An undiagnosed disease has been reported from West Darfur. Symptoms are swelling of the abdomen and tumours on the legs. The unidentified disease has broken out among the elderly of Kendebe camp for the displaced in Sirba locality, West Darfur.

The disease has already led to 2 deaths. Several more have been infected. They have been transferred to a hospital in El Geneina for treatment. The coordinator of the Sirba camps told Radio Dabanga that DI (60) and SKM (65) have died.

The displaced are especially vulnerable because of the humanitarian situation and malnutrition. The coordinator called on the health authorities to move to diagnose the disease and find a fast and efficient cure for it.

[With such sparse information, it is hard to make an educated guess as to what the diagnosis could be. Assuming that the 2 cases represent the same disease, an intestinal infection resulting in erythema nodosum could be an explanation. ProMED will be happy to post any further information if available. - Mod.EP
