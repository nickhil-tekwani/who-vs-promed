Suspected Ebola Fever Cases in Tanzania Remain Unconfirmed
----------------------------------------------------------
DAR ES SALAAM: A 47-year old Dar Es Salaam resident suspected of suffering
from Ebola hemorrhagic fever and admitted to Muhimbili National Hospital
(MNH) is now recovering. The patient is a businessman who travels between
Tanzania and Uganda. He was admitted to the MNH on Fri 17 Nov 2000 on
suspicion of having contracted Ebola fever. According to the MNH public
relations officer, the patient had all the symptoms of Ebola fever,
including high fever, bleeding from nose, ears and other openings in the
body. He did not explain how the patient had been treated, but [simply
indicated that the condition of the patient was improving.
The suspected victim, who is also believed to be a lorry driver traveling
frequently in East Africa, was being kept in isolation. The hospital
spokesman said doctors had yet to confirm whether he was an Ebola fever
victim. He could not say whether members of his family were also under
observation. A taxi driver had picked him up at the central bus stand and
brought him to hospital. It is suspected that he had come from a
neighboring country. [Another suspected Ebola case [had been identified
in northern Tanzania, at Kanyigo ward in Bukoba Rural district in Kagera
Region. The Ministry of Health had sent the sample from this second
possible case for analysis in South Africa.
These incidents increased [the fear of the Ebola outbreak in Uganda
spreading to northern Tanzania in Dar Es Salaam. In Kilimanjaro police
have recently arrested 12 Ethiopians who were attempting to cross into
Tanzania through unofficial routes along the Tanzania-Kenya border. The
arrest of these aliens is part of the government strategy to [prevent
spread of Ebola virus into the country. The 12 illegal immigrants were
immediately repatriated to their home country.

[This report provides no confirmation that Ebola hemorrhagic fever may have
spread from Uganda into northern Tanzania. The details of the report are
too vague and imprecise even to hazard a guess. - Mod.CP
