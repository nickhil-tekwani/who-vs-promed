Re: "...as a result of no new infected properties being detected since
Christmas Day [25 Dec] 2007"

The comment that followed "[sic, must be typo, Australia has only been
free of this disease since July 2008 -- see ProMED archive (04) below.
- Mod.JW]."

is incorrect. I should have read that archive first. Although posted
in July 2008, it actually reports that Australia became free of equine
flu in December 2007. I regret the error.
