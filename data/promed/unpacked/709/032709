DUBAI: Saudi Arabia said on Sat 30 Sep 2000 that 5 more people have died
from Rift Valley Fever, raising to 74 the official toll from the disease in
the Kingdom and in neighboring Yemen. A Saudi Health Ministry statement,
quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency, said a total of 43 people there
had died among the 201 who contracted the viral disease which broke out
around 3 weeks ago. It is thought to be the first outbreak of the disease
outside Africa, where it originates. It is transmitted by mosquitoes or by
human contact with infected animals.
Yemeni Health Minister Abdullah Abdul Wali Nasher said on Friday night [29
Sep 2000 that there had been no new deaths in his country since Wednesday,
when he put the official toll at 31. Some 117 others had also contracted
the disease.
The 2 Arab states, which are working together and with the help of
international experts and organizations to fight the disease, had earlier
said the disease had claimed 69 lives. On 2 Oct 2000, the U.N.'s Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) confirmed that it had reports of at least 74
deaths in both countries, while newspapers and local medical sources had
said that more than 200 people have died.

Africa in 1997-1998 many thousands of camels, sheep and goats died.

additional cause for concern. -Mod.CP
