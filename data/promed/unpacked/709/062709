Re. the Tanzanian hippopotamus mortality paper (ref: Stears K, Schmitt MH, Turner WC, et al. Hippopotamus movements structure the spatiotemporal dynamics of an active anthrax outbreak. Ecosphere. 2021; 12(6); e03540) [Anthrax - Tanzania: hippopotamus movements & outbreaks 20210616.8452912]:

On page 6, column 2, paragraph 1, they state "A total of 60 _H. amphibius_ carcasses were located at the watershed scale, which represents approximately 12% of the total _H. amphibius_ population in the Great Ruaha River (TANAPA 2017 wildlife census)." The text is interesting, because the aggregate estimated mortality was 60 hippos, 12% of total population.

This corresponds closely to estimated cumulative population level mortality rates reported for mass hippo anthrax outbreaks in Luangwa Valley, Zambia, 1987, 10.4%, and the Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, in 2004-2005, 11.6%.

By the way, the total mortality in the QENP quoted in this article is significantly larger than total mortality of 45 hippos reported to OIE (cf Archive numbers: 20170922.5334849, 20171014.5380017).

[This mortality clustering around 10%-12% is interesting. It reminds me of the 10% mortality among wood bison in the Mackenzie National Park, NWT, Canada, in 1993. These data are anecdotal, but it is a mortality range we might keep in mind in relation to future wildlife outbreaks. Joe has a wealth of African wildlife experience. - Mod.MHJ
