[_Austropotamobius pallipes_, the white-clawed crayfish of Western European streams, has become restricted in distribution over the past century.

Crayfish fungal plague, fatal to white-clawed crayfish, has affected many European countries. It is caused by a fungus _Aphanomyces astaci_ that was brought into Europe by the introduction of _Procambarus clarkii_, a freshwater crayfish species of Lousiana, USA, which is naturally infected by this pathogen, although it does not develop clinical disease.
