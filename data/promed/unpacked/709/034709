_Culex pipiens_ and _Culex molestus_ hybrids in the USA
---------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has set up housekeeping in the United States so readily
because of a hybrid mosquito species (_Culex pipiens_ s.s. X _Culex pipiens_
form _molestus_) that transmits the disease by biting both people and birds.

But the disease has not taken hold in northern Europe, where the infection
is limited mainly to bird-biters (_Cx. pipiens_), a new study suggests.

The first case of West Nile virus detected in the Western Hemisphere was in
the New York City area, in 1999. Since then, the virus has spread to infect
humans in 45 states, although 4 of 5 people who become infected have no
symptoms. But for the rest, the virus dishes out a flu-like illness that can
spread to the brain, with fatal effects.

The virus is not typically transmitted between humans, although the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a single case of
mother-to-infant infection and a second transmission to a breastfed child.

Most of the time, "you must have a mosquito that bites a bird today and a
human tomorrow for transmission to occur," said Dina Fonseca, a genetic
researcher with the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural History.
She is the lead author of the new study, published Friday in the journal
Science.

Humans and other mammals don't seem to carry enough of the virus in their
blood to pass it along to birds or other animals through mosquitoes, "so if
you have a mosquito that only bites mammals, there is no transmission to
humans," Fonseca said.

Fonseca and Richard Wilkinson, of the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in
Silver Spring, MD, collaborated with other scientists around the world to
study the genetic makeup of the _Cx. pipiens_ complex of mosquitoes, which
is strongly linked to the West Nile outbreak in the United States.

The scientists analyzed mosquito samples from 33 locations in various
countries, including Australia, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, Jordan
and the United States. The researchers found that there are 2 different
forms of the same species residing in northern Europe that tend to bite
either birds or humans but not both. The people-biting form lives
underground, in places such as subways and basements, while the form that
bites birds lives in the open.

Although the 2 groups live in the same areas and appear morphologically
identical, the analysis showed that the northern European _Culex pipiens_
s.s. mosquitoes are not swapping with the closely related _Culex pipiens_
form _molestus_ DNA in some key regions.

But among the US samples, 40 per cent of the _Culex_ mosquitoes were
hybrids. In southern Europe, where outbreaks of West Nile are somewhat more
common, about 10 per cent of the mosquitoes were hybrids.

Among _Culex_ mosquitoes in Japan, Australia, and the Middle East, the
distinction between above- and below-ground populations doesn't appear to
exist, the researchers said. The findings make sense to other scientists who
have tried to understand how _Culex pipiens_ that had long been considered
a bird-biter seemed to be a key factor in spreading the disease to humans in
many places.

"It appears that what we've been calling pipiens are hybrids," Larry Kramer,
Director of the insect virus lab at the New York state Department of Health,
told _Science_. "It fits with what we've been seeing."

But the CDC reports that at least 43 species of mosquitoes around the United
States are infected with West Nile, including several others known to bite
humans.

Many other public health experts think West Nile spread so rapidly across
the United States, and also much of Canada, because the virus is new to the
Americas and neither birds nor other animals, including humans, had any
immunity to it, while Europeans have been exposed to it for centuries.

But Fonseca said it's clear that the existence of so many infected hybrid
mosquitoes in the United States points to a different pattern of natural
hosts and a difference in infection rates. "It's not the only reason, but it
could be a component of this difference," Fonseca said.

[West Nile virus is unusual in seeming to be transmitted by so many
different mosquito species; at least 43 species in 10 genera have been found
positive for WN virus in the USA since 1999. The virus can also infect
ornithophagic ticks (_Argas hermanni_ and _Hyalomma asiaticum_ ), but their
role in the epidemiology of WN remains unclear. Nevertheless it appears that
_Culex_ species, in particular _Cx. pipiens_, are the principal vectors in
the USA. Elsewhere, such as in Europe and Africa, _Culex_ mosquitoes are the
main vectors, including some species that provide a bridge by biting both
birds and humans.

The publication by Dina M Fonseca,_et al, Emerging vectors in the _Culex
pipiens_ complex (Science 2004; 303: 15535-8, on which the above news report
is based, will undoubtedly generate much interest amongst virologists, and
I would guess also considerable controversy as to whether hybridization in
the _Cx. pipiens_ complex explains, or helps explain, how WN has spread so
rapidly in the USA.

Another recent and relevant publication is by S Higgs, K Snow, and EA Gould,
"The potential for West Nile virus to establish outside of its natural
range: a consideration of potential mosquito vectors in the United Kingdom"
(Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 2004;
98; 82-7. - Mod.MS]
