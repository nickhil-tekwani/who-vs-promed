At least one person died of anthrax, and several others continue to
suffer from the disease at the Community Health Centre (CHC) of Kutra
block in Sundargarh district.

Sources said [an adult male] (35) being treated at the CHC with
symptoms of anthrax was declared dead on Wednesday [4 Jun 2008]; 4 of
the 11 persons being treated for the disease have been shifted to
Sundargarh Government Hospital on Thursday [5 Jun 2008] after marked
deterioration in their health.

Sources at CHC said the symptoms of the disease were similar to those
of anthrax.

The victim and the other patients had consumed beef on 25 May 2008
night during a community feast at Jhirpani village of Kiringsira
grampanchayat of Kutra block. The next day, one among them died of a
mysterious disease. However, nobody then had taken note of it, and
the reason of death could not be confirmed.

Subsequently, others who consumed the meat began to fall sick with
symptoms of swelling stomach and high fever. They were rushed to the
CHC and treated for anthrax.

Village sources claimed some cattle are also suffering from the
disease, but no veterinary or medical team visited the village.
Repeated efforts to contact Sundargarh District Medical Officer Dr.
D. Muduli failed, as his mobile phone was switched off.
