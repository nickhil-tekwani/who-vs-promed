[From the previous posting in this thread, referenced below:
"On April 1, USDA informed the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) of
the complete eradication of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in
Gonzales County, Texas. All States, Territories, and regions in the United
States are free of HPAI; the Incident Command Post in Gonzales, Texas,
closed on March 30".]
Indeed, Texas has completed the eradication of HPAI and fulfilled the
requirement of OIE's Article 2.1.14.3., "HPAI infected zone", namely: "A
zone shall be considered as infected with HPAI until at least 21 days have
elapsed after the confirmation of the last case and the completion of a
stamping-out policy and disinfection procedures".
