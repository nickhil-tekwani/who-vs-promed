[1] WHO: Ebola toll rises to more than 6800

More than 6800 people have now died from the Ebola virus, almost all of them in west Africa, the World Health Organization said Monday [15 Dec 2014].

The UN health agency reported that as of 13 Dec 2014, there had been 18 464 cases of infection from the deadly virus in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and 6841 people had died. [346 new cases and 308 deaths in 4 days. - Mod.JW]

WHO did not provide an update of cases in other countries, but last week said the death toll remained the same: 6 in Mali, one in the United States, and 8 in Nigeria, which was declared Ebola free in October. Spain and Senegal, which have both been declared free from Ebola, meanwhile counted one case each, but no deaths....

As of the latest figures up to 7 Dec 2014, a total of 639 healthcare workers were known to have contracted the virus, and 349 of them had died, WHO said.... -- more

[2] Sierra Leone: UN envoy calls for "big surge"

UN envoy calls for "big surge" in efforts to reduce transmission rates in Sierra Leone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amid a spike in Ebola transmission rates in Sierra Leone, the United Nations envoy coordinating the massive global crisis response has travelled to the West African nation to help implement a surge in efforts to contain the outbreak. "We need to put in place a big surge to get those case numbers down, and we've been working on implementing that surge in the last week," Anthony Banbury, head of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), said in a press release following his 2-day visit to the country's capital, Freetown, from Thu 11 Dec to Fri 12 Dec 2014. "I came to see how that's going, how the preparations are and to see what more UNMEER can do," he added.

Increasingly high transmission rates in Sierra Leone were reported in recent weeks, leading the Government of Sierra Leone and UNMEER to mount a surge response. Earlier in the week, the UN Special Envoy on Ebola, Dr. David Nabarro, also noted that Sierra Leone had become an "area of concern" due to the high levels of viral transmission and urged "a much more intense response." He pointed out that some of the most experienced Ebola responders in the world were currently working in that area, together with UNMEER's "Western Area Surge team," the Government, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) and partners to ensure there were enough beds and burial teams. In addition, the UN envoy explained the logistical difficulty of staffing the Ebola treatment units....

During his trip to Freetown, Mr. Banbury visited an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) being run by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and the Sierra Leone armed forces and praised the work being done on the ground. "It's one of the few ETUs anywhere in the region that is run by the people [of] the country," said Banbury. "They have very good outcomes, good survival rates; it's working very well. It's impressive." ... -- more

[3] Sierra Leone: Shock treatment missing from Ebola response

Shock treatment: what's missing from Sierra Leone's Ebola response
------------------------------------------------------------------
The failure of Sierra Leone's strategy for fighting Ebola may be down to a missing ingredient: a big shock that changes people's behavior and prevents further infections. "Every new place that gets infected goes through that learning curve, where a lot of people die before those behaviors [which are associated with transmission of infection] start to change," Bruce Aylward, the head of Ebola response at the World Health Organisation said.

While neighbouring Liberia has turned the tide of Ebola, and both Mali and Nigeria quickly smothered outbreaks, Sierra Leone [now] has more than 70 percent of cases reported in the past 3 weeks and more than half the 18 000 confirmed [sic: in fact, many fewer confirmed] cases in the 9-month-old outbreak.

The flare-up in Sierra Leone capital Freetown and the country's more heavily populated western areas resemble the massive infections suffered in August [2014] by Liberian capital Monrovia. Scenes of people dying in the street raised alarm across that country and prompted a military deployment by the United States to build treatment centers. "In Monrovia you had bodies on the streets, and then awareness went through the roof in a very, very short time as a result," said Aylward.

Mali also learned through a shock. Just as it seemed nobody had been infected by its 1st Ebola patient in October [2014], another cluster of deaths sprang up the following month [September 2014]. Aylward said he told Malian officials that the only way to stop the outbreak was to trace anyone who may be at risk. "That's when the contact tracing took a jump from around 60-70 percent completion to 98 percent," he said.

In Sierra Leone, where as many as 365 Ebola deaths may have been linked to a single traditional funeral [of a traditional healer] early in the epidemic, Sierra Leone's Health Minister Abu Bakarr Fofanah said the government was considering banning some unsafe practices. He recognized however that it would be difficult to police such a law. Fofanah noted that some areas of eastern Sierra Leone that were hit hardest early in the epidemic -- around the towns of Kenema and Kailahun -- have seen a massive reduction in case numbers as people change behavior. "The areas that are now doing badly are the areas that were affected last. They are still on the learning curve." ... -- more

[4] Nigeria: Ebola virus: Catholic Church rites back to normal
Date: Mon 15 Dec 2014

http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/ebola-virus-catholic-church-reverses-orders-on-holy-communion-handshakes/196744


Following the declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO) last October [2014] that Nigeria is an Ebola-free nation, the Catholic Bishops Conference at the weekend ordered all its priests and the lay faithful to revert to the normal practices of receiving Holy Communion on the tongue. The church also ordered its members to resume the observance of handshake as a sign of peace during masses. The Catholic Bishop Conference also directed that holy water founts at the entrance of churches be filled again with holy water and never to be allowed to go dry any more.

All these were duly observed at all masses prior to the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in July [2014], when the same Catholic Bishop Conference met and issued a circular that put a stop to the initial practice, for fear of spreading the deadly virus through the Catholic Church.... -- more

Rwanda operators start Ebola SMS fundraiser

Minister of Health Dr. Agnes Binagwaho said: "The campaign being launched in Rwanda today [14 Dec 2014] is an important milestone toward mobilising resources to help our sister African countries devastated by the Ebola outbreak. It is great to see telecom companies come together in efforts to avert the spread of the virus." He was addressing the media at a joint telecom press conference in Kigali last week. These telecommunication companies join the rest across the continent under an initiative dubbed "The Ebola Solidarity Campaign" which will use a SMS dedicated platform to raise funds from citizens for the deployment of African health workers to affected countries.... -- more
