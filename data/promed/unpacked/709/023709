Suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Baluchistan Province of Pakistan
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least 8 people have died after a highly contagious disease, which
causes internal bleeding, broke out in the south-western Pakistani province
of Baluchistan. The victims included 5 members of the same family and two
paramedical staff attending the patients.
At least 10 people have been admitted to a government hospital since the
disease broke out last week, and their condition is described as critical.
The disease, which is called Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever and resembles
Ebola, was first detected in Crimea in 1944 and again in Congo in 1956.
Health officials say symptoms of the disease include headache, fever and
vomiting, and at its worst, it led to internal bleeding, as well as vomiting
and defecating blood. Medical experts say the disease is often carried by
ticks and is highly contagious through contact with infected animals and
humans.
A team of health officials visited the area on Wednesday and collected blood
samples for laboratory tests in Islamabad and officials say the tests may be
sent on to South Africa and the United States for further testing. World
Health Organisation officials have also collected samples for testing in
Vienna.

[The details of this report differ substantially from the initial report on
the outbreak of hemorrhagic disease in Baluchistan. In this new report it
is clear that the diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, and laboratory
confirmation of infection by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus has still
to be obtained. The other new piece of information is that 7 of the 8
deaths involved members of the same family and their attending paramedical
staff. The reference to Ebola virus is gratuitous. - Mod.CP
