Leptospirosis in Krasnogvardeysk, Stavropol region
---------------------------------------------
With the return of hot summer days, the infectious disease department of
Krasnogvardeysk Central Hospital is receiving more and more patients with a
primary diagnosis of leptospirosis.
These patients have fever, muscular pain, and other symptoms of acute water-
borne fever. All of them had been swimming in local reservoirs where
shepherds watered cows and sheep, which are possible transmitters of
leptospirosis. 20 people have already been treated since the beginning of
summer. According to a local newspaper, Sanitary Epidemiologic Service
workers are investigating all reservoirs in Krasnogvardeysk.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonosis that has often been considered an occupational
disease of sewer or abbattoir workers, farmers, and other individuals with
direct animal contact. It is, however, not uncommonly described throughout
the world, related to exposure from contaminated water or pets, 2 other
categories which are not always considered.
Animals that may chronically excrete leptospires in urine include rodents
such as mice and rats, pigs, cows, horses, dogs, and cats. Clusters that have
been reported include suburban children in St. Louis, MO, USA who were
exposed to their immunized dogs (1), kayakers exposed to creek water (2), and
servicemen in Vietnam (3) [and extreme sports athletes in Borneo -- see
ProMED ref. for 2001 below].
The mode of diagnosis in this posting is not stated, but it is generally
serologic. The illness can be quite severe, as exemplified by Weil's disease
(liver and kidney involvement), but ranges from a febrile illness with
myalgias, headache, and conjunctival suffusions to complete absence of
symptoms. Classically the illness is biphasic, with the second stage
following a defervescence and manifesting as a febrile aseptic meningitis
and/or uveitis and rash. This second stage has been considered to be at
least partly immunologic in origin.
