There is a factual error in the distemper post. Ridgecrest is not in the
San Diego area. It is farther north of Los Angeles than San Diego is
south of Los Angeles.

In 1992, we investigated a similar outbreak of distemper in pet dogs. The
initial speculation was, as suggested by the ProMED-mail moderator with
respect to the California outbreak, that this was either a naive population
or it was caused by a new and more virulent strain of the distemper virus.
We conducted a case-control study using dogs from private veterinary
practice in the affected areas. Cases were dogs diagnosed with distemper
while a control was the next dog in the hospital record from the same
practice as the case, which did not have distemper. We found the risk of
distemper for purebred dogs was 85% lower than the risk of disease for
mixed-breed dogs. Lack of vaccination was associated with a 350-fold
increase in the risk of canine distemper, and 94% of all cases could be
attributed to the lack of vaccination.
For many owners, the cost of medical treatment exceeded the lifetime cost of
vaccination. (Reference: Patronek GJ, Glickman, LT, et al, Canine distemper
infection in pet dogs: II. A case-control study of risk factors during a
suspected outbreak in Indiana, J Am Anim Hosp Assoc., 1995:230-235).
In my experience, most outbreaks of distemper and parvovirus in pet dogs can
be attributed to inadequate vaccination rather than to new strains of virus.
The risk of disease is always higher when the density of animals increases
(e.g. pet shops, kennels, and shelters) and for younger animals. Current
vaccines appear to protect well against all of the circulating strains of
parvovirus and distemper and they are highly immunogenic. Outbreaks like
this can almost always be attributed to irresponsible pet ownership. Herd
immunity only works when the critical mass of owners who
vaccinate their dogs is sufficient to protect the dogs of owners who do not
vaccinate them. As with the preventable childhood infectious diseases,
education is crucial.

I guess it is real sign of progress that a (seemingly) relatively small
outbreak of canine distemper is seen as so serious. Distemper is still a
real scourge, perhaps the worst, of dogs in many parts of the world. I have
seen it in Zimbabwe, Mexico and Nepal at high endemic levels in the last 10
years, killing many pups and adults. I guess I will now see it in
Bangladesh. In inner cities of the UK it is by no means unheard of, often
seen at charity clinics, hardly ever in private practices.
So far as I can see it is only in relatively wealthy communities in
developed countries distemper is a disease now considered rare, and this is
because of vaccine coverage, not because the virus is rarely present. Even
this is a recent development, as many vets still in practice can confirm.
The vaccine has been an enormous success, and my father, a now retired
veterinarian, remembers the queues of people for the original measles
vaccine, comparable to the same response to the early use of feline
panleucopaenia virus against "parvo" in dogs.
As for death in the face of treatment, distemper is a viral disease which
kills all on its own and there is no real treatment, early or otherwise,
although antibiotics (particularly oxytetracyclines) will decrease problems
due to bacterial secondary infections. Even then, you have to wait about 7
weeks to be sure that the neurological signs don't set in. Then there is
"old dog distemper" with neurological signs later in life. It is fortunate
indeed that so may people can now regard this disease as epidemic rather
than endemic.
