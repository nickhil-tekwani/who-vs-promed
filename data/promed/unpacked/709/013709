Frogeye leaf spot confirmed resistant to fungicide
---------------------------------------------------
Frogeye leaf spot from a single west Tennessee soybean field has been
confirmed as resistant to strobilurin fungicides. In tests, spores
from isolates of _Cercospora sojina_ germinated in the presence of
high concentrations of azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin.

Carl Bradley, University of Illinois, said that strobilurin
fungicides have been deemed high risk for fungal pathogens developing
resistance to them. Resistance "has already occurred in potatoes and
other crop and disease systems where multiple fungicide applications
occur during the growing season," Bradley said. "Currently, Tennessee
is the only state in which we have documented isolates like these,
but we are continuing to perform tests on isolates collected from
fields in Illinois and other states."

The best option for managing resistance to fungicides is to use a
resistant or highly tolerant soybean variety. Often susceptible
varieties are preferred by growers over resistant varieties if they
yield well, and the disease can be controlled with fungicides.
Rotation and tank-mixing a triazole with a strobilurin are also
recommended. Another option is to get out of soybeans for a couple of
years if resistance [has been noticed].

[Frogeye leaf spot is caused by the fungus _Cercospora sojina_, which
can infect leaves, stems, and seeds of soybean. The pathogen is found
worldwide but is only problematic under warm, humid conditions.
Significant yield losses of 10 to 50 percent are commonly associated
with frogeye epidemics.

The fungus is spread via infected plant material and can also be seed
borne leading to inferior seed quality. It is most likely to become a
problem if infected seed is planted or if infected residue of a
previous soybean crop serves as a source of inoculum (thus the
disease may be more difficult to control in 2nd crops). Disease
management includes use of disease-free seed, planting of resistant
varieties, crop rotation, tillage, and fungicide applications.

Strobilurins are strongly antifungal agents produced by fungi. Being
derived from natural products, they are considered environmentally
safe and are used worldwide as protectants against most major fungal
plant pathogens. However, like several other fungicide classes, they
have single-site activity and therefore pathogens must be expected to
develop resistance or tolerance over time. For example, strobilurin
resistant strains of potato early blight (_Alternaria solani_;
ProMED-mail post 20090325.1163) and grapevine powdery (_Erysiphe
necator_) and downy (_Plasmopara viticola_) mildews (ProMED-mail post
20080327.1152) have emerged.

Strobilurin resistance is of major concern to primary industries
worldwide and highlights the importance of rotating or mixing
chemical classes for management of all fungal pathogens, as suggested
above, to extend the useful life of the compounds.
