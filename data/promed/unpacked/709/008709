The U.K. Department of Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is ...
[giving sugar beet experts and interested parties an opportunity to give
their views about future policy on the control of the rhizomania disease
[in the U.K.. ... This year, 68 new outbreaks were found during the
official survey, ... the highest annual total since the disease was first
discovered in the UK in 1987.
Of 211 farms now known to be infected, 201 are in Norfolk or Suffolk.
[Consequently it will not be possible to retain protected zone status for
the whole of the UK when it is reviewed by the EC next January.
DEFRA is inviting views from all interested organisations. ... Options will
range from removing statutory controls from this disease altogether, to
negotiating within the EC for continuation of a reduced protected zone
excluding Norfolk and Suffolk.
Rhizomania is a disease caused by Beet necrotic yellow vein [benyvirus,
and spread by a soil-borne fungus. In susceptible sugar beet varieties it
causes reductions in gross yield and sugar levels. Once established in a
field it persists for many years.
The first case in the UK was found in Suffolk in 1987. [Subsequent annual
surveys by Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) show that 210 farms
have been [infected. ... 201 of the 211 infected farms are in Norfolk and
Suffolk. Outlying cases have in recent years been found in Nottinghamshire,
Northamptonshire, Staffordshire and Essex, and this year for the first time
in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Rutland and Yorkshire.
A policy of statutory containment measures was adopted in 1987 in order to
provide some protection for UK growers while the industry developed
varieties of beet tolerant to the disease. When the Single Market was
established in 1993, 'protected zone' status was negotiated for a limited
period for the UK, and for some other Member States.
This enabled continued measures aimed at restricting new entries of the
virus. Imports to and movements within the zone of beet, beet seed, and
root crops are controlled, for example, by restricting the level of soil
present to 1%, or specifying that the seed must be from an area free from
the disease.
Measures are also taken on infected farms to restrict further spread of the
disease; these measures include destruction of infected crops, strict
hygiene requirements, a ban on the production of beet in infected fields,
and restrictions on the production of plants for transplanting.

[Rhizomania, (a.k.a. crazy root or root madness,) is one of the most
serious diseases of sugar beet. Rhizomania can greatly reduce sugar yield
by reducing either the tonnage or sugar content, or both tonnage and sugar
content, of harvested roots. Further losses to producers in infested areas
can result when movement of agricultural products is restricted by
quarantine laws.
The disease was first described in Italy in 1952. The causal agent
apparently was spread by movement of infested soil. Rhizomania subsequently
was reported in Japan (1969), California (1983), Texas (1986), and Idaho
and Nebraska in 1992. The causal agent was identified as a virus by
Japanese plant pathologists in 1973 and shown to be transmitted by the
soilborne fungus _Polymyxa betae_. Major hosts of the virus are _Beta
vulgaris_ (sugar beet), _B. macrocarpa_ (wild beet) and _Spinacia oleracea_
(spinach).
