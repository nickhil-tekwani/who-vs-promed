MYCOBACTERIAL KERATITIS / M. CHELONIAE (4)
==========================================
Re: M. chelonei
We had an epidemic of this organism associated with injections from a
contaminated bottle of saline. The bottle was at a school for medical office
workers. They were using it to practice giving injections to one another.
At least a dozen students developed abscesses. I suggest you look into any
fluids that come in multi-dose vials. The literature records several
outbreaks of other organisms associated with multi-dose vials most
prominently on anesthesia carts. The organism can grow in simple fluids that
do not contain glucose.
