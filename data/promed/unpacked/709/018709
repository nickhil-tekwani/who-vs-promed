As _Pasteurella_ can survive for days in moist secretions or water,
close contact is not required for the infection to pass from goats to
big horn sheep; they merely have to graze the same area within a few
days of each other. It may be seem convenient to blame the goats,
but that may be because the connection is obvious, and this doesn't
make it any less likely.

[The organism and disease remain the same, but the name of the
organism has been changed and is correctly _Mannheimia haemolytica_.
Thanks go to the readers who reminded me of the change. - Mod.TG]
