One of 2 potentially deadly mosquitoes -- neither native to California -- has spread to 10 counties with the recent addition of Riverside and San Bernardino.

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is warning residents to be wary of mosquitoes that bite in the middle of the day or comfortably fly around the interior of a home. That's not normal behavior for most mosquitoes, but these infectious pests are special -- they can transmit yellow fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya [viruses].

The yellow fever mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, was spotted for the 1st time last month [September 2015] in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. It was first discovered in California in the counties of Madera, Fresno, and San Mateo in 2013, before turning up later in Tulare, Kern, Los Angeles, San Diego, Imperial, Orange, and Alameda counties.

The other pest, _A. albopictus_, is known as the Asian tiger mosquito. It also showed up in September [2015] in Kern and San Diego counties before appearing in Los Angeles County. _A. albopictus_ can transmit dengue fever and chikungunya [viruses]. CDPH Director Karen Smith recommends that people report any black-and-white striped mosquitoes they spot.

"There is no vaccine or treatment for chikungunya or dengue fever [infections]," Smith said in a CDPH release. This year [2015], 69 cases of dengue fever have been reported in California. Of the 120 people who contracted chikungunya, 91 percent got it in Latin America. One-third picked it up in Mexico.

The CDPH issued the standard recommendations for avoiding mosquito bites. Spray on lot of DEET and other repellants, wear long sleeves and pants, put your shoes on, don't let mosquitoes in your home, turn on the air-conditioning, and don't have pools of water lying about.

That last one could be the toughest of a tough lot. "_A. aegypti_ mosquitoes can lay eggs in containers holding as little as a teaspoon of water, and eggs, which are laid just above the water line, can survive dry conditions for months," the CDPH says.

[Appearance of these 2 _Aedes_ species in several locations is of concern, should they become established in these foci and then spread. A 19 Oct 2015 report stated that these mosquitoes have been found in 10 of California's 58 counties -- in East Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley, Anaheim, and parts of San Bernardino, Riverside, and San Diego counties (http://www.christiantoday.com/article/californias.new.winged.killers.2.species.of.disease.carrying.mosquitoes.pose.threats/67834.htm). Vector control officials found _A. aegypti_ in 13 of 18 residences in a single neighborhood in the Mision Viejo municipality in Orange county, reported on 16 Oct 2015 (http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mosquitoes-687982-county-yellow.html), which underscores the need for rapid application of control measures.

Travelers who have been infected with dengue and chikungunya viruses arrive in California with some frequency. Should _A. albopictus_ and _A. aegypti_ populations become established, there is a real risk of ongoing transmission initiated by an incoming viremic individual. However, these viruses may not become endemic in California because of screens and air conditioning, and especially because of effective vector control that most areas in California have. However, the risk remains for sporadic introduction of these viruses with limited outbreaks.

As noted in previous comments, the counties in California where these mosquitoes have been found over the past 3 years illustrate 2 critical points; (1) the importance of ongoing surveillance to detect their presence very early on while they are still geographically limited, and (2) rapid response by vector control officials and the public. One hopes that the eradication efforts are successful.
