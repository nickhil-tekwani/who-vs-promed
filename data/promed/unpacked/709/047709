An anthrax disease outbreak has been detected in a farm of Bayantsogt sum of Tuv [Tov] aimag [administrative division] on [20-26 Sep 2015]. A sample tested in the laboratory has confirmed the case and relevant specialists from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), General Agency for Specialized Inspection (GASI), and the Ministry of Food & Agriculture were dispatched to the scene to prevent further spread.

According to officials, the cause of the outbreak is natural. They have provided vaccination of 4747 livestock -- 1881 cattle and 2866 sheep and goats -- of 34 households in 3 locations. In addition, 6 facilities [not otherwise specified, probably farms. - Mod.MHJ] and 130 vehicles were disinfected. Even though a team of 12 specialists with resources of 4 vehicles, 75 kg [165.3 lb] chalk [presumably lime] and 2.5 kg [5.5 lb] ecocide [presumably disinfectant] are working to stop the outbreak from spreading further, they still need to vaccinate 6000 more livestock. The disinfection team has requested assistance from the government as the present resources are not enough for the work.

The chief veterinarian of the Ministry of Food & Agriculture, Ms N Enkhtuya said that the anthrax outbreak did not occur in the past 20 years in the region of Tov aimag.

[That may be, but the OIE report for Mongolia for 2014 has 3 outbreaks in Tov, 1 involving a cow and 2 outbreaks involving 4 goats. Tov has also suffered singular cattle outbreaks in 2011, 2012, and 2013. From the response, I think we can presume that this current outbreak involves a significant number of animals on possibly more than one farm and possibly also involving horses.

This news report includes a map of Tov, which includes the capital of the country, Ulaanbaatar. Bayantsogt is a district in the province of Tov; see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MG/18/DundUrt.html. - Mod.MHJ
