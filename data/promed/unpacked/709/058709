The Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives has warned about a
rabies outbreak in Nhlangano and surrounding areas. Already 7 dogs
were found to have been infected but it was not immediately gathered
whether they had already [bitten] someone.
According to the SBIS radio, Dr. Bheki Simelane from the ministry's
veterinary department confirmed the outbreak. He said at least 4
areas were found to have been affected by the rabies: Mahamba,
Mahlalini, Mashekesheni and Nhlangano itself.
Simelane advised people from the surrounding and other areas to bring
their dogs for vaccination against rabies either at their respective
dip tanks or designated areas.
A schedule of vaccination of dogs against rabies is as follows: on 12
Sep 2006, the ministry officers will be at Mahlalini and the
following day at Mashekesheni area. Meanwhile on 16 Sep, the
veterinary officers will be in Nhlangano.
He urged dog owners to bring forth their animals for vaccination.

[Vaccination programs in dogs are critical to controlling rabies in
canine populations and preventing spread to humans. Because of the
dire consequences to people, these programs in Africa have generally
had enough resources to be successful and have good cooperation from
the local population. Occasionally, there are breaks in the
vaccination campaigns and outbreaks like the one described here
occur. Unless there is something unusual in the epidemiology of the
outbreak or a previous vaccination failure, extra efforts should
bring the outbreak under control.
By the specificity of dates and locations, it looks like the Swazi
Animal Health Authorities have organized an effective vaccination
campaign. Since word of rabies will travel fast among people in the
affected areas, dogs will likely get vaccinated. We will keep you
posted. - Mod.PC]
