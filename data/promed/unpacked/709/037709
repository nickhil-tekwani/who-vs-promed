Apple sessile leaf: a new disease associated with a _'Candidatus
Phytoplasma asteris'_ subgroup 16SrI-B phytoplasma in Lithuania

A new disease of apple (_Malus domestica_) has been found in the
Kaisiadorys region of Lithuania, with symptoms of leaf yellowing,
shoot proliferation and a previously un-described symptom: "sessile
leaf," in which "golden" leaves are directly attached to the trunk.
These symptoms differ from those of apple proliferation (AP), with
enlarged stipulae, witches' broom and bronze-reddish discoloration of
leaves.
DNA extracted from leaves, with and without symptoms, was used as template
in PCR with phytoplasma rDNA universal primers P1/P7 as previously described
by Valiunas. Phytoplasma infection was confirmed by amplification of 1.8 kbp
rDNA fragments from all trees with [symptoms](3/3), but not from symptomless
trees (0/6). RFLP and nucleotide sequence (GenBank accession no. AY734454)
analysis of a 1.2 kbp DNA fragment, amplified by nested PCR using primers
16SF2n/16SR2, revealed that the phytoplasma, termed apple sessile leaf
(ApSL) phytoplasma, is a member of the 16SrI-B (_'Candidatus Phytoplasma
asteris'_) subgroup.
The results of this study clearly distinguish ApSL from AP phytoplasma,
_'Ca. Phytoplasma mali'_, a member of group 16SrX. 5 subgroups of
phytoplasma group 16SrI have now been identified in Lithuania:
- subgroup 16SrI-A in vegetables, ornamentals, and oats;
- subgroup 16SrI-B in ornamentals and woody plants including apple;
- subgroup16SrI-C in clover and _Poa pratensis_ [Kentucky bluegrass]; and
- subgroups 16SrI-M and 16Sr-L in ornamentals, cereals and woody plants.
This 1st report of ApSL infecting apple in Lithuania has considerable
significance for fruit production, since apple is widely cultivated
throughout Europe.

[Considering the fact that apple is a very popular fruit cultivated
in many countries worldwide, the most significant aspect of this
report is that ApSL may become a threat to apple production in states
of the European Union. ApSL obviously occurs in Lithuania, and I
would suspect that it occurs in other areas in Europe, but there are
no other reports of its occurrence to my knowledge. Phytoplasmas are
transmitted by leafhoppers, planthoppers and psyllids. Development of
PCR for detection of ApSL is a major step forward in detecting the
phytoplasma in the food crops featured in this piece and will
certainly facilitate its detection in budwood and propagation
nurseries.
