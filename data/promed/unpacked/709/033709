Some comments related to the questions raised by Prof. Dr. Slenczka and the
ProMED-mail moderator about chronic wasting disease in elk.
The origin of chronic wasting disease (CWD) is not known. It was first
recognized in captive mule deer and probably was transmitted from deer to
elk within the same facilities in Colorado and Wyoming. These animals were
not fed British meat and bone meal and strain typing has shown that CWD is
NOT BSE. CWD occurs in free-ranging mule deer, white-tailed deer, and elk
in a geographically limited area of southeastern Wyoming and northeastern
Colorado. The origin of CWD in farmed elk has not been determined. CWD
affected farmed elk herds have been identified in 5 western states and 1
Canadian province.
Information on the history of CWD may be found in: Williams, E. S. and S.
Young. 1992. Spongiform encephalopathies in Cervidae. Rev. sci. tech. Off.
int. Epiz. 11: 551-567. Information on CWD may also be found at:
