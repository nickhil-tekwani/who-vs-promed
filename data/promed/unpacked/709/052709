Elk near Clark, Wyoming, test positive for exposure to brucellosis
------------------------------------------------------------------
Six of 16 cow elk captured just north of the Wyoming border along the Beartooth Front have tested positive for exposure to brucellosis.

The elk were captured on Forest Service land in Montana where there are no cattle grazing allotments.

The results came from the sampling of 94 elk captured south of Big Timber [Montana] by Fish, Wildlife and Parks [FWP] crews between 19-25 Jan 2016.

The brucellosis-positive elk spend most of the year in Wyoming, according to Shawn Stewart, an FWP wildlife biologist based in Red Lodge. It is believed they do not interact with cow elk from nearby Montana herds.

Animals that test positive for brucellosis exposure do not necessarily carry or spread the disease, but at one time were exposed to brucellosis and have developed antibodies that can be measured with blood tests.

Most of the elk were fitted with radio collars that will allow biologists to track their movement for the next year.

The capture and testing are part of a multi-year collaboration between Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the Montana Department of Livestock to learn more about elk movement and the extent of brucellosis infection in elk across parts of southwest and south-central Montana.

All 94 elk were captured, one at a time, in nets shot from a helicopter. Technicians drew blood samples from the elk, fitted a sampling of them with tracking collars and then released them. The blood samples were sent to the Montana Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for testing.

Biologists also tested blood samples from 3 elk that were harvested by hunters in the same region.

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that infects cattle, bison and elk and can result in abortion or the birth of weak calves. The disease is primarily transmitted through contact with infected birth tissues and fluids.

[The most important part of this article is: "Animals that test positive for brucellosis exposure do not necessarily carry or spread the disease, but at one time were exposed to brucellosis and have developed antibodies that can be measured with blood tests." In other words, these animals do not have active disease, but have been exposed and now have antibodies against the disease.

Tracking these animals and learning more about their movements, where they may have contacted the disease, can be important.

The only known focus of _Brucella abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock.

Elk, also known as wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_), are a reservoir of the disease, originally acquired from cattle. - Mod.TG
