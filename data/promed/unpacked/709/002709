[Note: while Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is the techically correct name
for this disease, ProMED has standardized in the past on the slightly shorter
version, Eastern equine *encephalitis* (or even East. equine encephalitis to
fit in the Subject line), so for reasons of indexing
consistency, "encephalitis" has been retained for the Subject/Title here.

encephalomyelitis on IgM capture ELISA.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

B. To be undertaken:
- vaccination.
Treatment of affected animal: no.
Other details/comments:

[Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis (EEE)can cause disease in humans, having a
33 percent mortality rate in affected individuals. [There is no publicly
available human vaccine.] Infection in horses usually precedes infection in
humans, and the number of horse cases will likely be greater than human cases
in a given area. EEE virus can also produce severe disease in young dogs,
cervids, and some birds such as pheasants, quail, ostriches & emus.
Infection is by the bite of mosquitoes, some species of which serve as bridge
vectors between the disease cycle among wild birds and horses in swampy
areas. Human cases follow if mosquito control measures are not instituted.
For the techically inclined, Charlie Calisher provides a short treatise on the
4 South American subtypes of the virus: see Eastern equine encephalitis,
