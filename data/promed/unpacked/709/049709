USDA says the diseased animal came from Southeast Texas [edited]
------------------------------------------------------------
The cow that tested positive for mad cow disease came from Southeast
Texas, the owner of a pet-food company that took delivery of the
animal said Thursday.

"The USDA told me it's from somewhere in the southeast part of the
state," said Benjy Bauer, owner of Waco-based Champion Pet Foods.
"That's all they would say, and believe me, I've asked them several
times. I want to know, too."

Bauer said that a livestock hauler, whom he declined to identify,
brought in the cow, which was dead when it arrived at Champion. The
company normally buys "downers," cows that cannot stand up and are
therefore barred from human consumption, and animals a few hours dead.

The 5-employee company produces pet food for racing greyhounds from a
small tan-and-brown building in an industrial section on the north
side of town. Across Industrial Boulevard, dwarfing Champion, sit 2
large chicken-processing plants.

Clint Moran, who works as a Waco livestock hauler, said many of the
cows Champion buys are from the area. "For maybe $75, it isn't worth
your while to haul a downed cow too far," said Moran, who added he
has sold the company downed cows.

Long-distance haulers who deliver healthy cows in the region can be
left at the end of the line with a downer that fell ill during the
trip, he said. "They'd know to drop it off at Champion and recover a
few bucks," he said. The company buys cows "from all over,"
administrative assistant Melissa Fulton said. She said it has a
contract with the USDA to test all downed and dead cows more than 30
months old for bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

In a release issued Wednesday, the company said it sent a sample of
the brain from the infected cow to a laboratory at Texas A&M
University, where a test for BSE was inconclusive.

No part of the animal made it into the company's products, Bauer said.

The Texas Animal Health Commission, the state agency responsible for
monitoring diseased livestock, referred all requests for information
about the cow to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A "hold order"
was issued by the commission to the owner of the cow, to prevent any
other cattle from moving from the immediate premises, according to a
woman in the agency's public information office, who would only give
her first name.

The USDA would not release the location of the ranch the animal came
from. Government officials stressed that the cow, likely infected
from feed containing cow parts that were banned years after the cow
was born, never made it into animal or food supply. Now they're
testing the herd and tracing back the feed supply the cow ate.

[Logically, the ranch is within some 45 minutes pick-up drive of
Champion, TX. Presumably we will see the implementation of a local
surveillance programme for herds that received feed from the same
feed company 9 to 15 years ago. - Mod.MHJ]

U.S. years away from mad cow trace-back system [edited]
-----------------------------------------------------
The government is years away from fielding a system to track down
herdmates of cattle diagnosed with mad cow disease, making the United
States "a food safety laggard" in the eyes of a consumer group.

The Bush administration embraced the trace-back system as a vital
part of mad cow control but now expects a January 2009 operational
date despite pledging to speed up action. Industry sources say
questions about privacy and equipment have slowed work.

The government last Friday confirmed the 2nd case of U.S. mad cow
disease, and the U.S. Agriculture Department is investigating the
herd of the infected beef cow, which some published reports have said
was from Texas. [It should be noted that this cow went straight from
the farm of origin to the pet food company. - Mod.MHJ]

Within days of reporting the 1st U.S. case of mad cow in late 2003,
the Bush administration said it would speed up creation of the
trace-back system as part of tougher safeguards against the
brain-destroying disease. It is a daunting task, involving a million
livestock producers and tens of millions of animals, and has moved
slower than expected partly due to objections by producers. The goal
of the national animal identification system is to find the home farm
and herdmates of ailing cattle, hogs, and poultry within 48 hours of
a disease outbreak.

Meanwhile, the largest U.S. cattle group says it will launch a
nationwide registry in October 2005, a point when the government
would still be mulling the design of its system. The chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee suggested the government ought to let the
private sector take the lead. "The system could be under way in a
matter of months, rather than years (and) dictates it is a better
course to follow," said Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican.

Some industry observers say the latest U.S. mad cow case underscores
the urgency of the task. "With this particular cow, we are seeing the
strong impact of the gaps in our firewall, which includes the lack of
a national ID system," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety
director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. With no
trace-back system until 2009, says CSPI, "the United States is
lagging even farther behind many of our trading partners on food
safety issues."

Canada adopted mandatory cattle ID early this decade. CSPI counts
Australia, Japan, and Europe with mandatory ID programs. [Though not
without problems, these programmes work. - Mod.MHJ]

Confidentiality concerns
------------------
Besides the cost of running a livestock identification program,
estimated around $100 million a year, and the additional work of
reporting every time animals leave the farm or change ownership, some
producers worry they will lose control of information about their
animals and operations.

Questions about confidentiality are among the reasons that progress
is lagging on a government-run trace-back system, said 2 livestock
industry sources. Funding has not been large enough, they said, and
there are ever-changing ideas over features of the system and the
equipment to use.

By contrast, said Jay Truitt of the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association, the livestock industry can assemble a less expensive and
more flexible system faster than the government. NCBA is spearheading
a private-sector database.

"It's not as complex as everybody wants to make it," said Truitt.
"The private sector has much more incentive to meet the marketplace."
A privately run database could also be used by producers as a place
to store information that could help them win a premium price when
they send livestock to market. The data could include feed records,
breed lineage, and health care. That "value-added" information could
defray the cost of the system.

But just as some producers doubted the government could keep their
records confidential, there was skepticism about trusting a private
database with the information. "We need to take the profit incentive
out of animal ID," said president Dave Frederickson of the 300
000-member National Farmers Union. Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson said
the government should stay in charge even if it out-sourced some of
the work.

[There have been cattle identification programmes in place for
decades, starting with ranch/farm branding; government ear tags in
disease control programmes; some 30 years ago Australia had a cheap
and effective ranch/station identification system based on numbered
plastic tail-tags for all animals leaving the station/farm; and
dairies have had microchips for some time tied to milk production and
individual feeding.

Identifying the cow, pig, or sheep is really the easy part. Catching
errors, updating records promptly, data transmission and security,
and sheer volume are what bring you to your knees. If the individual
owner does not get a benefit or perceive the potential for it in such
a programme, "confidentiality" will be trotted around the ring
snorting and kicking to distract planners and politicians.

Where the industry has supported such a programme or been persuaded
by the threat of withholding of subsidies, their implementation has
been rapid and fairly effective. When you get down to details,
nightmares are soon uncovered, such as some records being 3 months or
longer out of date. However, systems eventually settle down and
function well. - Mod.MHJ]
