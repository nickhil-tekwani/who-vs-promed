A Minnesota woman who died from a hantavirus infection may have
contracted the rodent-linked [virus] during a trip through the Grand
Canyon, authorities said.

The woman, whose name and hometown were not released, died 12 Jun
[2009] at a hospital outside Arizona, said Trish Lees, a spokeswoman
for the Coconino County Arizona Health Department.

The woman, in her early 50s, may have contracted the disease during a
family boating trip on the Colorado River in mid- to late-May 2009,
Lees told the Arizona Daily Sun, Flagstaff in a story published Tue 23
Jun 2009.

It was the 1st hantavirus infection case linked to Arizona this year
[2009]. One case was reported last year [2008] in the state, Lees said.

Hantavirus infections are contracted by inhaling infected particles
from mouse droppings and urine. The woman told health officials she
wasn't aware of any recent contact with mice.

[A report in NAZ Today of 22 Jun 2009
<http://www.naztoday.com/news/top-stories/2009/06/fatal-hantavirus-infection-confirmed-in-coconino-county-visitor/>
indicated that this was a case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).
Several hantaviruses in the western hemisphere can cause hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome. Although this report does not indicate which
hantavirus is involved in this case, or in the one reported from New
Mexico below, most likely they are due to infection by Sin Nombre
virus. Its rodent host is _Peromyscus maniculatus_ (deer mouse, see
<http://www.wle.umaine.edu/faculty/Burns/burnsphoto6.jpg>).

The state health department reports that a 65-year-old San Miguel
County man has contracted a hantavirus infection, the 2nd confirmed
case of the year [2009]. The man has been hospitalized at the
University of New Mexico Hospital. The state health department is
conducting an environmental investigation to try to determine where
the man contracted the virus and whether people may be at risk.
Hantavirus infections can cause a potentially fatal disease that is
transmitted to humans by infected rodents through their urine,
droppings and saliva [which dry out and turn to dust, which can be
stirred up and inhaled - Mod.JW].

The deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] is the primary carrier of
the virus. Symptoms of hantavirus infection include fever, muscle
aches, chills, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
and coughing. Chances of recovery are better if treatment is sought
promptly, according to the health department.
