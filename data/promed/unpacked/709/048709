A spokeswoman for the Ovosibirsk [Novosibirsk? - Mod.CHC] regional
sanitary-epidemiological inspection agency, Galina Belyayeva, told
Itar-Tass on 15 Nov 1998 that there has been an outbreak of hemorrhagic
fever in the Ust-Tarka district. A total of eight local residents were
taken to hospital with a diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever, and one of them, a
23-years-old shepherd, died.
In the words of Belyayeva, the people contracted the disease from
musquashes they hunted.

[I cannot locate an "Ovosibirsk" on the CIA maps at the University of Texas
and am assuming this is Novosibirsk. If someone knows better, please let us
know. Insofar as "musquashes" is concerned, that may be "muskrats", but I
never heard "Musquash Ramble". Omsk hemorrhagic fever, caused by a
flavivirus of the same name, has been associated with muskrats (_Ondatra_
sp., I can't recall which). Perhaps someone knowledgeable about this
cluster of cases will be kind enough to send us further details, in
English. - Mod.CHC]
