Two physicians and an assistant paramedic at the Diyarbakir Dicle
University School of Medicine Research Hospital were quarantined on
Sunday [15 Jun 2008] for probable contraction of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a disease carried by certain tick species
[classified in the genus _Hyalomma_].

The university said the 3 were quarantined as a precaution after
treating a CCHF patient who later died at the hospital. The
quarantine follows an official announcement last week from Ankara
Numune Hospital saying that 2 of its doctors who had treated a CCHF
patient had contracted the infection [see: Crimean-Congo hem. fever -
Turkey (06) 20080615.1888].

The disease can be transmitted through direct contact with the blood
or secretions of an infected person. The doctors were most likely
infected by direct contact with the patient's blood when it splashed
into their eyes as they tried to stop the patient's nose from
bleeding, the Ankara hospital said. The doctors were already
displaying symptoms of the disease. The hospital's health staff said
on Friday [13 Jun 2008] about 20 people suspected of having
contracted CCHF were under observation at the hospital.

Last Friday, news reports said yet another patient had died of CCHF
in the central Anatolian province of Yozgat. So far, 500 people in
the province have visited area hospitals this year [2008] complaining
of tick bites.

Since 1st observed in Turkey in 2002, 114 people have died of CCHF in
the country, including 22 so far this year [2008]. The fever is
particularly common in the central Anatolian and eastern Anatolian
provinces, especially Tokat, Corum, Sivas, Amasya, Yozgat, Gumushane,
Bayburt, Erzurum and Erzincan. Last year [2007], 717 people were
diagnosed with the disease, claiming 33 lives.

Experts say people who have come into contact with a tick should be
monitored for 10 days following contact and seek professional medical
care if symptoms of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
present themselves.

[This is the 2nd report from Turkey in the past few days of suspected
or confirmed diagnosis of CCHF in healthcare workers. Healthcare
workers in CCHF endemic areas should be aware of the illness and the
correct infection control procedures to protect themselves and their
patients from the risk of nosocomial infection.

WHO advises that healthcare workers in endemic areas should adopt
correct infection control procedures to protect themselves and their
patients from the risk of nosocomial infection. Healthcare workers
are at risk of acquiring infection from sharps, injuries during
surgical procedures and, in the past, infection has been transmitted
to surgeons operating on patients to determine the cause of the
abdominal symptoms in the early stages of (at that moment
undiagnosed) infection. Healthcare workers who have had contact with
tissue or blood from patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF should
be followed up with daily temperature and symptom monitoring for at
least 14 days after the putative exposure. When patients with CCHF
are admitted to hospital, there is a risk of nosocomial spread of
infection. In the past, serious outbreaks have occurred in this way,
and it is imperative that adequate infection control measures be
observed to prevent this disastrous outcome.

WHO advises also that patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF
should be isolated and cared for using barrier nursing techniques.
Specimens of blood or tissues taken for diagnostic purposes should be
collected and handled using universal precautions. Sharps (needles
and other penetrating surgical instruments) and body wastes should be
safely disposed of using appropriate decontamination procedures.

The prevalence of CCHF is more or less coincident with the
distribution of _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks, the vector of the disease. A
