A 22 year old Minnesota man is recovering from a rare form of meningitis he believes he contracted by eating unwashed fruit in Hawaii. In October [2011], he was working on an organic farm on the Big Island when he ate fruit growing wild. He was hospitalized on 10 Nov 2011 for 7 weeks in Hilo.

The Honolulu Star-Advertiser (http://bit.ly/znWVbc) reported Mon 13 Feb 2012 that the patient said from his Watertown, Minnesota home that he wants to urge people in Hawaii to carefully wash produce to avoid ingesting slugs or snails that can spread rat lungworm disease.

The present patient is one of 37 cases confirmed or tested probable for the disease in Hawaii from 2005 to 2011. A Big Island baby is the only fatality since 2005, when the state Department of Health began collecting data.
