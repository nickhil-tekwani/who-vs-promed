[Though the serotyping of the reported outbreak in Setif province is pending, it will be surprising if the Algerian foot-and-mouth disease virus will become to be different from the one circulating in Algeria's eastern neighbor, Tunisia, reportedly since 25 Apr 2014, namely serotype O.

For subscribers' convenience, some data about the latter:

So far, 114 outbreaks have been registered throughout the northern half and the south-east region of Tunisia, affecting cattle, sheep and goats in spite of the country's preventive mass vaccination policy applied for several years. The causative agent has been genotyped as topotype ME-SA, genotype/strain Ind-2001d. The most closely related reference strain was found to be O/BHU/3/2009 (identity rate 96.15 per cent). Hopefully, this or a similar vaccine strain is currently applied "in response to the outbreak(s)," as well as preventively in the other 2 Maghreb countries.

On 20 May 2014, ProMED-mail published a request for information (RFI) in view of a media report informing "livestock affected in the eastern part of Algeria"; no response has become available. The likelihood of the disease spreading west into Algeria has been discussed repeatedly (see also the commentary by Prof Bernkirane in posting 20140522.2491636). It is illustrated in the OIE map available at http://tinyurl.com/nf4y2sy (click on the Tunisian cluster, zoom in, and see the numerous outbreaks in Tunisia located close to the Algerian border).

The new outbreak in Algeria, currently reported to the OIE, can be seen in the said map; it is located about 200 km (about 124 miles) west of the Tunisian border. Serotyping is urgently needed. If confirmed as serotype O and genotyped as similar to the Tunisian strain, this will mean a spread from Tunisia. - Mods.AS/CRD]

[The original comment erroneously referred to Algeria as to the "east" of Tunisia, this has been corrected to reflect Algeria is to the "west" of Tunisia. - Mods.AS/MPP]
