The Government has ordered nationwide health tests on milk after scientists
found bacteria that may cause Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory
condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Unconfirmed tests had shown that
_Mycobacterium paratuberculosis_ was surviving pasteurisation. The
bacterium is unconnected with tuberculosis in man or animals. But it does
cause Johne's disease - a chronic infection of cattle, sheep, goats and
deer - which in turn has been linked with Crohn's disease, or colitis, in
people. Crohn's disease causes chronic inflammation throughout the gut,
including colon and bowel. Steroids are used to treat the symptoms in
severe cases.
Ministry of Agriculture officials said last night: "The survey will include
the main types of milk, including whole milk, semi-skimmed, skimmed and
UHT, with over 1,000 samples being examined for a range of bacteria." The
survey would cost BPS 200,000 and take place over a period of 18 months.
The samples will be scrutinised for the presence of _Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis_, an organism that is thought to be one of the causes of
Crohn's disease. The tests, to be carried out by Queen's University in
Belfast and ADAS, the farm advisory agency, will take 18 months to
complete. Ministry of Agriculture research has been under way for some time
to confirm the link after claims that milk was one route of transmission
from infected animals to humans.
Agriculture Ministry scientists last week discovered strains of the
bacterium in milk samples collected from dairies in Northern Ireland.
Provisional results showed the organism was present in ten of 31 raw milk
samples and in six of 31 pasteurised samples. Research conducted in
Britain, Australia and the United States had indicated that the bacterium
was destroyed by pasteurisation.
Officials at both the Department of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture
insisted there was no need for public concern. The Department of Health
advised in a statement that, "on the basis of what is currently known about
_Mycobacterium paratuberculosis_, there is no need for anyone to change
dietary habits". It said the tests in Northern Ireland were in preparation
for a national survey of milk that had already been planned.
An official at the Ministry of Agriculture said: "The results are
provisional, unconfirmed and from a very small number of samples, and we
need to investigate in more depth. We do not want to start a big scare
about milk because it is a part of any balanced diet and millions of people
drink it." About five billion litres of milk are drunk each year in the
United Kingdom.
Norman Simmons, a member of the Government's Advisory Committee for the
Microbiological Safety of Food, which had requested the milk test, said:
"It does appear now that the organism can survive pasteurisation, but many
scientists dispute whether the organism causes Crohn's disease. If there is
any risk at all, which there may well not be, I estimate that any
individual's chance of getting the disease from milk is no more than one in
five million."
