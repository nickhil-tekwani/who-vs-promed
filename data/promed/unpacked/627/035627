New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 12
Outbreak locations: Jozini [Umkhanyakude district], KwaZulu-Natal
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 473 / 224 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: no clinical signs of disease. Sero-positive
results counted as cases. Number of animals sampled was used as the
number of susceptible animals.
Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate /
Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 47.36 percent / 0.00 percent / 0.00 percent / 0.00 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: the affected area is partially situated in
the FMD Free Zone of South Africa, and all exports of cloven hoofed
animals and animal products will be suspended with immediate effect,
except for products that have been fully processed to inactivate FMD
virus. No clinical signs of disease were observed; therefore,
seropositive results were counted as cases of infection. The number of
animals sampled was used as the number of susceptible animals.
Vaccination by State Veterinary Services will be allowed only in the
affected areas of KwaZulu Natal. The epidemiological units (village =
diptank) in the Northern part of KwaZulu Natal are dip tanks used for
FMD inspection. Liquid-phase blocking ELISA and non-structural protein
(NSP) ELISA tests are done on all samples. All the NSP ELISA tests
were negative.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country;
screening; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: zoning; vaccination in response to the
outbreak(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Transboundary Animal Diseases Programme,
ARC-OVI (OIE's reference laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / liquid-phase blocking ELISA / 11 Feb 2011 / Positive Cattle
/ Non-structural protein ELISA / 11 Feb 2011 / Negative

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral vesicular
disease of cloven-hoofed animals. Although seldom lethal in adult
animals, it causes serious production losses and is a major constraint
to international trade in livestock products. Severe mortality may
occur in young stock, particularly lambs and piglets. FMD is a
Transboundary Animal Disease endemic and at a high prevalence in many
countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia and is also present in
parts of South America, Europe, North, and Central America; the
Pacific nations and the Caribbean are free from the disease (see
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/disease_fmd.asp>).

The basic disease control policy is the slaughter of all susceptible
animals on premises infected with foot-and-mouth disease and dangerous
contacts. This is in keeping with EU legislation and OIE guidelines.
Movement restrictions are also put in place to help contain the
disease. There is an EU-wide ban on the use of prophylactic (routine)
vaccination, which has been in place since 1992. This allows EU Member
States to retain the highest foot-and-mouth disease status under
international rules of "countries free from foot-and-mouth disease
without vaccination."

However, the new EU Directive gives greater prominence to the
potential use of emergency vaccination in the event of an outbreak as
an adjunct to the basic slaughter policy. The government accepts that
emergency vaccination should be considered as a disease control option
from the start of any outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (see
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/fmd/control/index.htm>).

[2] Independent Online follow up story
Date: Tue 1 Mar 2011

The cost of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in northern
KwaZulu-Natal and the immediate ban on all exports of cloven-hoof
animal products from South Africa could run into billions of rand
unless the disease is brought under control swiftly, experts warned on
Monday [28 Feb 2011].

Department of Agriculture spokesman Bothle Modisane said it was
difficult to put an accurate figure on the possible impact of the
export ban, although some economists had suggested the costs could run
as high as Rand 2 billion [USD 287 million].

Modisane said South Africa exported raw hides and skins worth between
R300 million [USD 43 million] and Rand 500 million [USD 72 million] a
year to countries such as Turkey.

The country exported more than 500 tons of venison a year to the EU,
and further losses from exports of red meat and live animals to
foreign markets and neighbouring countries would have an impact. Wool
exports to China could also be hit.

"We don't know yet how other countries will respond to the
announcement," he said, noting that some countries could take a very
strict, precautionary approach to a wide variety of products.

At this stage, the Department of Agriculture has placed an immediate
ban on the export of all cloven-hoofed animals (including cattle,
goats, and sheep) and their products, with the exception of those
products that have been fully processed to inactivate the virus.

Modisane said treated products could include canned and cooked meats,
chemically treated hides, and pasteurised dairy products.

Averting major financial losses would depend largely on how quickly
South Africa could regain its disease-free status, he said.

So far, the problem is restricted to the remote Ingwavuma
[Umkhanyakude district] in northern KwaZulu-Natal on the border of
Swaziland and Mozambique, where recent "routine tests" on more than
600 animals showed that about 50 percent of the animals had developed
antibodies and tested positive for the disease.

The department said no clinical symptoms had been seen so far, and
officials were monitoring the situation closely.

However, foot-and-mouth disease is highly infectious and sometimes
fatal in animals. The virus causes a high fever for 2 or 3 days,
followed by blisters inside the mouth and on the feet. The blisters
may rupture and cause lameness. The disease has an incubation period
of 2 to 12 days, and infected animals often drool or secrete foamy
saliva.

The last major outbreak in South Africa began on a pig farm in
KwaZulu-Natal in September 2000. Modisane said it took almost 5 years
before South Africa fully regained its FMD-free status.

Although the government has already declared Ingwavuma to be a
disease control area and banned the movement of animals from this
area, the exact boundary lines of the control area and control
measures were still causing confusion and anxiety last night [28 Feb
2011].

Robin Barnsley, the president of the KwaZulu-Natal Agricultural
Union, said: "We are very concerned because the announcements made so
far have not adequately defined the boundaries, nor has there been
adequate communication about protocols that will be put in place such
as vehicle decontamination measures."

The commercial sector was "still basically in the dark. We were
notified on Friday [25 Feb 2011] that there had been some positive
test results, but we have not been briefed formally."

Fortunately, he said, the affected district was not a large-scale
beef ranching area, but the national ban on red meat exports could
have a "devastating impact" on major export operations.

He noted that the last outbreak had been dealt with very swiftly
through the slaughter of sick animals and rigid movement controls.

"It is still very early days, but we have heard that the 1st cases
were detected in mid-February [2011]. If that is so, movement
protocols should be put in place immediately." The KwaZulu-Natal
Agriculture Department said late yesterday [28 Feb 2011] that
officials were meeting to "assess the situation and to formulate a
control strategy."

[Foot-and-mouth disease is a transmissible animal disease of great
socio-economic cost to nations and financial cost to individual dairy
cattle producers. The disease is characterized by fever and
blister-like lesions followed by erosions on the tongue and lips, in
the mouth, on the teats, and between the hooves. Most affected animals
recover, but the disease leaves them debilitated. It causes severe
losses in the production of meat and milk. Since it spreads widely and
rapidly and because it has grave economic as well as clinical
consequences, FMD is one of the animal diseases that livestock owners
dread most (see
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/fs_foot_mouth_disease07.pdf>).

[Areas which are "Foot and Mouth Disease Free where Vaccination is
not Practiced" in Southern Africa are extremely valuable economically.
Since South Africa has banned exports of animals and animal products,
countries in the region may have to start looking for alternative
sources of livestock for their internal markets. Also, this may
provide a temporary boost in the export market for Botswana. Both
Botswana (2009) and South Africa (2005) have established zones which
are Free where Vaccination is Not Practiced, according to OIE.
However, exports from this zone in South Africa have been banned until
the FMD situation can be brought under control. - Mod.PC]
