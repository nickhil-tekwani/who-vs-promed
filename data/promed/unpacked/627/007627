[There is an outbreak of undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever occurring in this area, but there is no information indicating if some of them are cases of DHF. - Mod.TY

The report says:
"15/22 blood samples tested positive for dengue fever. The results of re-confirmation tests by the WHO are expected to be released soon, the humanitarian office writes" -- but no confirmation has been reported in the 2 weeks since then. Serological tests for dengue may cross-react with yellow fever antibodies. It is urgent to exclude YF, which was reported from South Kordofan last year.
