Health officials in the Philippines have seen a significant, in fact a 3-fold increase in the number of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) cases reported during the 1st half of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014.

The Epidemiology Bureau of the Department of Health reported 563 HFMD cases through the end of June 2015, while only reporting 180 in the corresponding period in 2014.

The regions reporting the largest increases include the Cordillera Administrative Region (2) with it's regional center in Baguio (5 cases in 2014 vs 141 in 2015), Calabarzon Region (4A) with it's regional center in Calamba (2014: 23 cases vs 2015: 116), and Northern Mindanao Region (10) with its regional center in Cagayan de Oro (2014: 21 cases vs 2015: 94).

HFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease. Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions, and rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate, and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers and soles, which generally persist for 7 to 10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the _Enterovirus_ genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.

Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of hand-foot-mouth disease in the USA, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness.

Enterovirus 71 [EV-71] has also been associated with hand-foot-mouth disease and outbreaks of this disease. EV-71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over several years. EV-71 is a non-polio enterovirus. Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic [than coxsackieviruses] EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema, or hemorrhage and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is no vaccine to protect against the viruses that cause hand-foot-mouth disease.

A person can lower their risk of being infected by:
- washing hands often with soap and water, especially after changing diapers and using the toilet;
- cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and soiled items, including toys;
- avoiding close contact such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with people with hand-foot-mouth disease.

[Unfortunately no attempts appear to have been made to identify the specific virus responsible for this enhanced outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in the Philippines.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is usually caused by a group of RNA viruses called enteroviruses. The most commonly implicated enterovirus is coxsackievirus A16. However, coxsackieviruses A5, A9, A10, A16, B1, and B3 and human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) may be involved. Rarely a DNA virus such as herpes simplex viruses can cause the illness. Herpes simplex virus is often also over-looked as a potential cause of HFMD. The specific pathogen is rarely identified as a consequence of the mildness of the illness.

Cases are commonly spread via the faecal-oral route. Respiratory droplet transmission also may occur but is less likely. Typically, the virus enters the gastrointestinal tract via the buccal mucosa (lining of the mouth) or the ileum (part of the small intestine). Over the next 72 hours (accounting for the incubation period), a viremia is established via spread through nearby lymph nodes. The outcome of infection is generally benign and identification of the specific pathogen is rarely undertaken.
