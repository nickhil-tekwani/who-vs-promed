The death toll from cholera in war-torn Yemen has increased to 1054 since 27 Apr 2017, with the total suspected cases reaching 151 000, the Yemeni health authorities said on Sat 17 Jun 2017 in a statement published by Saba news agency.

Earlier in June 2017, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) expected suspected cases could hit 130 000 in 2 weeks, while last month [May 2017], WHO expected they could reach 300 000 in the next 6 months. The outbreak has spread fast in 20 out of 22 Yemeni governorates in just 7 weeks, since 27 Apr 2017.

Yemen is facing total collapse as the war continues. 2/3rds of the total population, around 19 million, need humanitarian and protection aid. About 10.3 million people are close to famine, and 14.5 million lack access to safe drinking water. Less than 45 percent of the country's hospitals are operational at the moment, but even the operational ones are coping with huge challenges, on top of which is a lack of medications, medical equipment and staffs.

The blockade on Yemen, part of a Saudi-led bombing campaign launched in March 2015, has deepened the crisis in the country, which used to import most of its basic needs.

Yemeni authorities have accused insurgents of causing an increase in the number of cases of cholera infections in Taiz because of the siege in the city. They also held them responsible for blocking efforts to counter the spread of the disease in the provinces under the control of their militias.

In a report issued Fri 16 Jun 2017 by the Ministry of Health in Yemen, the ministry said that its medical and epidemiological and preventive monitoring teams are facing huge difficulties to reach Sana'a, Hodeidah and Hajjah governorates where cases of illness were recently detected as a result of the control of the coup militias over these provinces. The report, published by SPA, pointed out the decline in the number of cholera cases in Dhamar, Dhale, Mahwit and Ibb governorates, noting that there are 11 provinces where cases have not been diagnosed accurately yet, whereas the number of cases has increased in Taiz, which suffers a suffocating siege by Houthi militias that hinders the work of medical teams and worsens the situation.
