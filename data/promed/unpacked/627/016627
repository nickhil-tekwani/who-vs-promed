Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The 1st reported case involved wild boar mortality. Following the death of wild boar in Kinabatangan (which tested negative with conventional PCR by Sabah Department of Veterinary Services Laboratory), the disease investigation was extended to the neighboring district, where the 1st case of mortality involving backyard pigs in Pitas was reported. After the laboratory confirmation, the surveillance is intensified and extended to other districts encompassing the 50-km (about 31 mi) radius from the index case. Sabah Wildlife Department reported on the wild boar mortality in Beluran district, where samples were taken and found positive for African swine fever. Surveillance then expanded outside the containment zone to cover the whole Sabah State. Currently, surveillance is conducted and intensified in the whole country.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; screening; quarantine; ante- and post-mortem inspections; stamping out; official destruction of animals products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; control of wildlife reservoirs; disinfection
Measures to be applied: Control of vectors, vector surveillance
