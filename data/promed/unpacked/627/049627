People across Somerset and Bath have been urged to be aware of the symptoms of scarlet fever after a huge outbreak of the illness across the county over the Christmas period. A total of 25 cases were confirmed across the county in the final 2 weeks of December [2019], according to figures released by Public Health England.

It represents a huge rise in the number of cases seen across Somerset -- which had seen 14 people diagnosed with the bacterial infection in the previous 2 weeks. 10 people caught the infection in Bath and North East Somerset alone over Christmas, with a further 5 cases being reported in North Somerset and 5 in Mendip. There were 2 cases in South Somerset and Taunton Deane, with a single case of scarlet fever reported in Sedgemoor.

During the festive period, 6 people caught scarlet fever in Wiltshire while there were 4 fresh confirmed cases in Dorset. A further 7 people have been diagnosed with the illness in Bristol.

Somerset is a county in South West England, which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the southwest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset). A map showing the location of these counties can be found at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_counties_of_England). The city of Bath (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset), North East Somerset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Somerset_(UK_Parliament_constituency)), North Somerset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Somerset), Mendip (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendip_District), Sedgemoor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgemoor), and Taunton Deane (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taunton_Deane) are located in Somerset County.

ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports since 2013 on outbreaks of scarlet fever, a noninvasive form of group A streptococcus (GAS) disease, throughout England and Wales (see list below). ProMED-mail also posted reports of an outbreak of invasive GAS infection since February 2019 that is occurring in Essex, a county in southeast England (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex). See ProMED-mail posts Streptococcus, group A, invasive - UK (02): (England) fatal, WGS 20190807.6611267 and Streptococcus, group A, invasive - UK: (England) fatal, RFI 20190628.6542184.

One particular _emm_ type of GAS, _emm_1, has become increasingly common among isolates from both noninvasive and invasive GAS disease in England and Wales over the past several years. Whole genome sequencing of _emm_1 identified an outbreak strain, called M1UK, that by 2016 accounted for about 84% of _emm_1 strains. M1UK was also found to produce 9 times more toxin responsible for the characteristic rash in scarlet fever (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext). - Mod.ML]
