Another Chinese city hit by toxic flow from river
-----------------------------------------------
A Chinese city of 480 000 people has become the latest community to
shut down a water plant, as river-borne toxins from an industrial
accident flowed toward it, an official said yesterday [3 Dec 2005].
The shutdown Friday [2 Dec 2005] in Jiamusi came as China's chief
environmental regulator resigned, taking the blame for the 13 Nov
2005 spill of benzene in the Songhua River in China's northeast.
In Russia, China delivered a shipment of carbon yesterday [3 Dec
2005] for use in filtering water in Khabarovsk, a border city of 580
000 people that is bracing for the spill to arrive next Sunday [11 Dec 2005].
The spill has disrupted water supplies to millions of people in China
and strained Beijing's relations with Russia.
The benzene is due to reach Jiamusi on Tuesday [6 Dec 2005],
according to the government.
The city's No. 7 Water Plant "has been closed due to the possible
contamination of the water supplies," said an official at the Jiamusi
city government headquarters.
The official wouldn't say how many people were affected, but the
official Xinhua News Agency said the plant supplies 70 to 80 percent
of the city's drinking water.
Jiamusi is the 2nd-largest Chinese city affected, after the major
industrial center of Harbin suspended running water for 3.8 million
people for 5 days as the benzene spill passed.
Jiamusi should be able to continue supplying running water because it
has access to deep wells that won't be affected by the contamination,
said an employee at its water company.
Hundreds of villagers near Jiamusi have been ordered to stop using
shallow wells on the river bank, the official said.

More cities avoid Songhua water
-------------------------------------
5 more Chinese cities prepared to stop drawing water from the
benzene-laden Songhua River yesterday [2 Dec 2005], as the country's
top work safety official warned of long-term dangers from the toxin.
In Russia, residents stocked up on bottled water, and an official
warned that a lack of running water could threaten heat supplies in
the dead of winter, as the spill of benzene into the river from a 13
Nov 2005 chemical plant explosion slowly moved toward the border.
Beijing has sought to ease strains with Moscow, a key diplomatic
partner and source of much-needed oil, promising to send filtering
materials to help reduce the impact from the spill.
Li Yizhong, minister of China's State Administration of Work Safety,
said measures taken so far to protect the millions living along the
river were only a "partial victory," the local Communist Party
newspaper Harbin Daily reported yesterday [2 Dec 2005].
Li, visiting the city of Jiamusi, where the pollution is expected to
arrive in the next few days, warned that the slick was getting longer
as it flowed downstream through the iced-over Songhua, affecting an
ever growing area.
There was no obvious drop in the concentration of pollutants, up to
21 times the allowable standard, the newspaper quoted Li and other
officials as saying.
"Cities on the Songhua River need to stay at a high level of alert," Li said.
On Thursday [1 Dec 2005], China's Foreign Ministry announced it was
sending to Russia pollution monitoring devices and 150 tons of
activated charcoal to help filter drinking water. Beijing also
offered to send experts to help install it.
The disaster has prompted a massive relief effort at home by China's
communist government, which is trying to repair its image after
complaints that officials concealed the spill and lied to the public.
Officials have sent millions of bottles of drinking water and fleets
of water trucks to communities on the Songhua that have cut off
running water as the benzene passed. The largest was the industrial
center of Harbin, where 3.8 million people went without water last week.
Downstream, Dalianhe shut down running water to 26 000 residents on
Wednesday [30 Nov 2005].
The cities of Jiamusi, Tangyuan, Huachuan, Fujin and Tongjiang were
preparing to stop drawing river water as the slick approached,
according to provincial and local officials.
It wasn't immediately clear how many people would be affected or
whether those communities could draw on wells or other sources to
continue supplying running water.
On Thursday [1 Dec 2005], residents of Dalianhe lined up with jugs
and buckets to get drinking water delivered by fire trucks after the
government shut down drinking water to its 26 000 people.

Environmental chief sacked over river spill
-----------------------------------------------
China's top environmental regulator was fired on Friday [2 Dec 2005]
after widespread criticism of the government's initial cover-up of a
chemical spill into the Songhua River that forced the shutdown of the
water supply in Harbin.
The removal of Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA), was the 1st move to assign blame
for the accident, which brought domestic and international
condemnation on the government.
After an explosion on 13 Nov 2005 at a petrochemical plant in Jilin
City, officials tried to hide the fact that tons of benzene and
nitrobenzene had been dumped into the river.
"After this major water pollution incident occurred, the SEPA has
failed to pay sufficient attention to the incident and has
underestimated its possible serious impact," according to a joint
statement issued by the state council and the Chinese Communist
Party's Central Committee, and quoted by the official New China News
Agency. "It should bear due responsibility for the losses caused by
this incident."
Xie, who offered his resignation, is the highest-ranking official
ever removed from his position for an environmental accident.
State media emphasized that his firing reflected rising governmental
concerns about environmental degradation and the need to improve
official accountability.
But the question is whether other officials will be fired, including
those at the factory, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National
Petroleum Corp.
In addition, officials in Jilin Province initially lied about the
chemical spill and the dangers it presented to cities and rural
communities downstream on the Songhua.
The government's joint circular ordered that an investigation
continue into the causes of the explosion and the spill, and vowed to
"seriously punish those responsible."
Xie's replacement is Zhou Shengxian, the former director of the State
Forestry Administration.
Meanwhile, Jiamusi city shut down its No. 7 Water Plant on the
Songhua River on Friday [2 Dec 2005], fearing contamination from
approaching toxic chemicals, a city official said yesterday [3 Dec 2005].
The benzene is expected to reach Jiamusi, a city of about 480 000
people, on Tuesday [6 Dec 2005], according to the government.
The Xinhua news agency said the plant supplies 70-80 percent of the
city's drinking water.
Jiamusi is the 2nd-largest Chinese city to have been affected by the spill.
Jiamusi also has access to deep wells that won't be affected by the
contamination and so should be able to continue to supply drinking
water, said a woman who answered the phone at its water company. She
wouldn't give her name.
Xie was the 1st official to lose his job over the spill, which
resulted from an explosion on 13 Nov 2005 at a chemical plant. The
blast sent tons of cancer-causing benzene into the Songhua River in
northeastern China and cut off water supplies to millions of Chinese.

[Benzene is a colorless, odorless, monocyclic, aromatic hydrocarbon
liquid, often used in various industries. It could be difficult or
impossible to see the spill approaching on the river. If officials
are willing to loose jobs over the spill, then the people may be
justified in their fear.
Benzene exposure increases the risk of leukemia. Toxic metabolites
may also play a role in affecting bone marrow. Consequently,
hematopoiesis is affected and aplastic anemia is very likely.
Inhalation of benzene vapors has been linked to lung cancer.
Clinical signs associated with ingestion of benzene, short term
exposure, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, difficulty
breathing, irregular heartbeat, headache, drowsiness, symptoms of
drunkenness, disorientation, visual disturbances, bluish skin color,
lung congestion, lung damage, liver damage, paralysis, convulsions,
and coma. However, long term ingestion of benzene has resulted in
impotence and cancer.
Gastric lavage may be the best means of evacuating the gastric track
in the event of benzene ingestion. However, the residences in the
affected towns may not know when or if they have consumed benzene in the water.
Although there is a large risk of exposure, we know nothing about the
actual dose that these people may be exposed to. Non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma is associated with chronic high-dose benzene exposure, with
a latency period of approximately 5-6 years. Although the latency
period for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for chronic, low dose exposure is
not established, it appears to be approximately 15-20 years. Benzene
has been known as a carcinogen for a number of years. - Mod.TG]
