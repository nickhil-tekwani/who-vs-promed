Rare British coral struck by disease
---------------------------------------
British scientists have recorded the 1st incidence of a coldwater
coral disease in a species on an international list of threatened
species. Experts from the Marine Institute at the University of
Plymouth recorded the disease in the pink sea fan, _Eunicella
verrucosa_, in a marine protected area in southwest England.
The pink sea fan, which is a type of gorgonian, is protected under
Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act and is listed as
vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of threatened species.
According to the study, which is published in the latest volume of
the journal Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, video surveys of 634
colonies at 13 sites have suggested that the disease has been
widespread across southwest England between 2003 and 2006.
The authors said that affected corals had necrotic coenchyme, which
led to them sloughing tissue and exposing their skeletal gorgonin,
which became fouled by other marine organisms.
"Sites where necrosis was found had significantly higher incidences
of fouling. No fungi were isolated from diseased or healthy tissue,
but significantly higher concentrations of bacteria occurred in
diseased specimens.
"Of 21 distinct bacteria isolated from diseased tissues, 19 were
Vibrionaceae, 15 were strains of _Vibrio splendidus_ and 2 others
closely matched _Vibrio tasmaniensis_.
"Vibrios isolated from _E. verrucosa_ did not induce disease at 15
degrees C [59 degrees F], but, at 20 degrees C [68 degrees F],
controls remained healthy and test gorgonians became diseased,
regardless of whether vibrios were isolated from diseased or healthy colonies.
"Bacteria associated with diseased tissue produced proteolytic and
cytolytic enzymes that damaged _E. verrucosa_ tissue and may be
responsible for the necrosis observed.
"Monitoring at the site where the disease was first noted showed new
gorgonian recruitment from 2003 to 2006; some individuals had died
and become completely overgrown, whereas others had continued to grow
around a dead coral area."
The species became threatened by collection for the souvenir trade
during the 1960s. Fishing nets and potting, scuba diver damage and
smothering by other organisms are also believed to have played a part
in the decline of the species.

Gorgonin is a complex protein frequently containing appreciable
quantities of iodine and bromine that makes up the horny skeleton.
Although the article uses coenchyme this moderator believe it should
have been coenenchyme, which is the extremely porous crusty layer of
fan coral composed of calcium and is living tissue.
The article implies that warmer waters have given the various
bacteria an edge for destroying the fragile, beautiful and rare
coral. - Mod.TG]
