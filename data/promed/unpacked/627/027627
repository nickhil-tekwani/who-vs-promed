A 10-year-old boy from U Minh District in the Mekong Delta province of Ca Mau has been hospitalised after contracting meningitis from eating snails infected with the roundworm _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_.

Last [Sat 11 Jul 2015], the boy was brought to HCM [Ho Chi Minh] City Paediatrics Hospital No. 1's neurology and infectious disease ward, suffering from a high fever, severe headache, nausea, and myalgia.

Laboratory tests, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, blood tests, and an MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] showed that he had meningitis.

The boy's mother said that he had eaten baked snail with 2 other children. The 2 children vomited immediately but recovered within 2 days. "My son's health had been good. But a week ago he said that he felt pain in his neck and he vomited. His health became worse although he had been treated at the district's hospital," she said.

As of yesterday [Tue 14 Jul 2015], he still was being treating at the ward, where he is recovering.

"We are not aware of the danger of eating snails. Residents here often catch snails and eat them because the rumour is that snails help treat aches and pains," she said.

Truong Huu Khanh, head of the hospital's neurology and infectious disease ward, said that 3 or 4 children this year [2015] had been hospitalised at the ward for treatment of meningitis due to _A. cantonensis_ roundworms.

Last year [2014], the ward admitted as many as 30 children, most of whom were from rural areas.

In 2009, the city's Hospital for Tropical Disease treated 2 young people from Go Vap District [suburb of Ho Chi Minh City] who had become ill after eating baked snails. One of them died, and the other is in a "vegetable state," according to hospital authorities.

Wild snails move on land and are often infected with parasitic worms, including _A. cantonensis_. "It is dangerous if they are not cooked well," Khanh said.

According to the [US] Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), _Angiostrongylus_ is a parasitic roundworm that can cause severe gastrointestinal or central nervous system disease in humans, depending on the species.

"_A. cantonensis_ roundworms cause meningitis and are prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands. The recognised distribution of the parasite has been increasing over time and infections have been identified in other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean, and the US", the CDC's website said.

In summer, children in rural areas often imitate adults and catch snails to eat, Khanh said.

Communication about this issue should be improved in rural areas because residents' awareness about it remains low, he added.

The Ministry of Health's Preventive Health Department said that people should eat well-cooked food and clean vegetables thoroughly before eating them.

If they have a headache, nausea, and high fever, they should visit a health facility as soon as possible.

[Angiostrongyliasis is caused by _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_, a nematode parasite. Transmission occurs by ingestion of 3rd-stage larvae in raw or undercooked snails or slugs. It can also result from ingestion of raw or undercooked transport hosts such as freshwater shrimp or prawns, crabs, and frogs. Ingested larvae can migrate to the central nervous system and cause eosinophilic meningitis.

This disease occurs predominantly in Asia and the Pacific, but has also been reported in the Caribbean. Geographical expansion may be facilitated by infected ship-borne rats and the diversity of snail species that can serve as intermediate hosts.

As precaution, avoid eating raw/undercooked snails and slugs, or raw produce such as lettuce. No vaccine is available (http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/angiostrongyliasis/en/).

The incubation period of _A. cantonensis_ averages 1 to 3 weeks, but has ranged from 1 day to greater than 6 weeks. Illness from _A. cantonensis_ usually lasts between 2-8 weeks but can last longer. People present with symptoms of bacterial meningitis, such as nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, and headaches that are often global and severe. Additionally, abnormal sensations of the arms and legs can occur. Sometimes the eyes can be affected. When patients are tested for bacterial meningitis by taking a sample of the fluid that surrounds the brain, the fluid does not show high levels of the cells that help fight off bacterial infections (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) as one might expect. Instead, another cell type called eosinophils are found (this is called eosinophilic meningitis), though these cells may be absent early and late in the course of disease. Most infections with _A. cantonensis_ resolve spontaneously over time without specific treatment because the parasite cannot survive for long in the human body. However, serious complications can rarely occur, leading to neurologic dysfunction or death (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/angiostrongylus/disease.html).

[Angylostrongylus is an important infection in communities outside southeast Asia, where the infection is seen transmitted from imported snails. Eosinophilia will usually be detected in the differential count of peripheral white blood cells and this should lead to the question of whether the patient has been eating snails. - Mod.EP
