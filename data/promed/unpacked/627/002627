Kalumbi Shangula, permanent secretary for the Ministry of Health and
Social Service in Namibia said 5 of the 6 cases were believed to have
been contracted in Angola. "It seems that the epicentre is situated
in Angola spreading from there to Congo, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe
and now Namibia.
Zambia has registered 5500 cases of cholera and the disease has
claimed about 90 lives in Congo, with 2700 others infected.
Mozambique's capital city, Maputo, has had over 700 cases so far.

[2] Cholera - Sierra Leone

From 20 Jan to 5 Feb 2007, cases of severe diarrhea and vomiting
have been reported in several parts of Sierra Leone, including the
capital (Freetown). Initial laboratory tests conducted on a series of
specimens collected showed presence of _Vibrio cholerae_ amongst
other pathogens that cause diarrhoea.
Prior to this latest epidemic, the country was just recovering from
another cholera outbreak, which mostly affected Kambia District and
Freetown town. This earlier outbreak was confirmed by the government
on 11 Oct 2006, after cases that had begun being reported in August
2006 escalated.
The Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoH&S) has informed the Sierra
Leone Red Cross Society (SLRCS) of the new cholera outbreak in
Tonkolili District, located in the center of Sierra Leone. So far, 90
cases (with 2 deaths) have been reported, translating to a case
fatality rate of 1.8 percent [sic: actually 2.2 percent - Mod.JW].
The worst hit areas include Magbass and Magburaka townships. Other
affected villages include Maborie, Mamunta, Mabum, Robol, Rogberay,
Mafomba, Mamunabana, Manewa, and Mayoro. This situation has been
confirmed by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Holland and the SLRCS
Tonkolili branch.

[3] Cholera - Namibia (Omusati, Kunene)

Health authorities are getting ready to tackle a cholera outbreak in
the Outapi area [in the Omusati region], where 50 cases of the
water-borne disease have been reported. The Health Ministry has
activated its Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Committee, a
senior official said yesterday, 12 Feb 2007.
Since November 2006, some 250 cholera cases have been reported in the
country. The 1st outbreak was reported in the Opuwo area of the
Kunene Region in November 2006 and 5 people died from the disease.
The disease reportedly came from Angola.
"Two new cholera deaths were reported to date, bringing the total to
7," Dr. Norbert Forster, Undersecretary in the Health Ministry, told
The Namibian. "These occurred at Outapi. About 50 new cases of
cholera have occurred in that area," Forster added.
"Especially informal settlement areas are affected where water
supply, sanitation and hygiene need much improvement. Given this, the
cholera situation in Opuwo district (Kunene region) and now also in
Outapi district (Omusati region) needs to be regarded with great
concern," Forster said.

More than 200 people have been killed by cholera in Angola since the
start of 2007, according to figures released by the health ministry
on Mon 12 Feb 2007. Of the overall total of 208 fatalities, 42 died
in the capital Luanda. The total number of recorded cases of cholera
was put at 6051, about a third of which were in Luanda, the figures showed.
About 3000 died of cholera in Angola in 2006, but health officials
had been confident that the epidemic, one of Africa's worst, was
gradually abating.
Heavy rains in January 2007, however, exacerbated the situation,
particularly in the southern province of Benguela, where there have
been 1245 cholera cases since 1 Jan 2007, and 27 people have died.
The deadly but easily treatable waterborne disease broke out in
Luanda's northern slum of Boa Vista in February 2006. It then spread
across a country whose infrastructure has been ravaged by a 27-year
civil war and where [clean] drinking water and proper sanitation are luxuries.

Health workers in Somalia's capital Mogadishu have launched a
campaign to educate residents about the growing danger of an outbreak
of acute diarrhea.
Officials say 121 people were killed in a suspected cholera outbreak
in south-central regions in January 2007, and more than 200 are now
admitted in hospitals suffering from acute diarrhea.
"The acute watery diarrhea is spreading," Mohamed Fuje, head of the
WHO in Mogadishu, told Reuters late on Sun 11 Feb 2007. "But we are
not yet sure if it is cholera."
Late in 2006, the Horn of Africa nation was ravaged by the worst
floods in decades. Insecurity following a war between Islamists and
government troops backed by Ethiopian forces has made humanitarian
operations all but impossible.

[6] Cholera - Somalia (Middle Shabelle, Lower Shabelle, Middle Jubba)

At least 10 children have died of watery diarrhea in the Lower
Shabelle provincial settlements, southern Somalia, where residents
also suffer from difficulties in their livelihood following the
torrential rains and floods, which hard hit southern and central
regions of the country late in 2006.
In the past 24 hours [12 Feb 2007], 8 children passed away in
Awdhegle district southern Somalia, as confirmed to Shabelle by
Mohamoud Ali, a resident in the area.
At least 16 children, most of them under the age of 5, died of watery
diarrhea in settlements and tiny villages in Jilib district of Middle
Jubba province, southern Somalia, on 11 Feb 2007.
On 8 Feb 2007, 30 children also died of the disease in settlements
around Jawhar, 90 km. (55 miles) north of the capital Mogadishu, the
main town of Middle Shabelle province, southern Somalia.
More than 350 cholera patients have been placed in the Inter-SOS
hospital in Jawhar in the past weeks. Doctors in Somalia say the
number of water diarrhea-related deaths is looming over 200. People
use contaminated water from the flood swamps and river, as they have
no access to clean water.
Dr. Abdullahi Hussein Moalim, the director of Jawhar hospital, said
many more children were gravely sick from the disease, calling on the
international relief agencies to bring medical supplies to the area
immediately.

[7] Cholera - Congo (Kouilou, Pool)

In late December 2006, several cases of diarrhea were reported in
Pointe Noire, the port city of the Republic of Congo. Initially it
was thought that they were caused by food poisoning but authorities
at divisional and national levels later confirmed them to be cholera,
following clinical observations and laboratory tests in Brazzaville.
Towards the end of December 2006, 60 cases had been registered
(including 7 deaths) and on 27 Jan 2007, the Ministry of Health (MoH)
officially declared a cholera outbreak. Since then, the epidemic has
spread rapidly, affecting several families at the same time. By 30
Jan 2007, the figures rose to 3030 (with 50 fatalities).
Pointe-Noire is the economic hub of the country and is located in a
semi swampy area south east of the country, along the Atlantic Ocean.
Some surroundings of Pointe Noire are named Ndjindji, a local word
for swampy area. This geographical position exposes the town to the
risks of waterborne diseases. The majority of the Congolese
populations migrated to Pointe Noire, which is 500 km. (about 310
miles) south of the capital Brazzaville, in the 1990s because of
conflicts that prevailed at the time. The migration resulted in an
increase in the number of inhabitants from 300 000 then to
approximately 1 million today.
Several surroundings of Pointe Noire have been affected and there are
fears that the situation might deteriorate as the rainy season
continues. Currently, cholera patients are being taken care of in 4
cholera treatment centres (CTCs); Adolfe Scice, Tsie Tsie, Loandjili,
and the Army's Central Hospital. However, the teams on duty in these
centers are facing a shortage of beds and a limited number of skilled
staff. The Pointe Noire Central Prison has also been affected, but
sick inmates have not yet received medical attention. As of now, the
epidemic has already spread to Brazzaville where 38 cases have been
registered, including 4 deaths.

The Department of Health (DOH) is monitoring the health and
sanitation conditions in a municipality in Camarines Sur province in
the Bicol Region after more than 100 people have suffered from
diarrhea recently. Dr. Eric Tayag, head of the DOH National
Epidemiology Center (NEC) said they are looking at dysentery as the
cause of 102 diarrhea cases in Ocampo town in Camarines Sur. Tayag
said they have already taken stool samples from the victims, which
were sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for analysis.
Twenty-two barangays in the town of Ocampo are under watch by health
authorities after the number of diarrhea cases there had been rising
since last 1 Jan 2007. Initial investigation showed that residents in
the affected area get their water supply from shallow wells, which
Tayag believes, are contaminated.
