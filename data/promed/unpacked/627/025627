The Department of Health is working with public swimming pool operators in Melbourne to try to prevent a [gastroenteritis] outbreak from spreading. The department received 155 notifications of people suffering gastro last month [February 2013], which is 3 times the monthly average.

The Victorian Chief Health Officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, says some of those cases have been linked to swimming pools. She says pool operators have been instructed to clean pools and increase the amount of chlorine in the water. "We've been working with pool owners to make sure that happens," she said. "We're also making sure they have appropriate signage for their patrons about pool hygiene.

"That's making sure patrons shower before swimming and that they don't swim if they have diarrhoea or for 14 days afterward." The bug is caused by the cryptosporidium parasite, which is found in the human and animal faeces.

[Sporadic cases of cryptosporidiosis are common in Australia. A large outbreak of _Cryptosporidium_ in pools is unusual as the source of infection is individuals -- often children -- using the pools. This outbreak points to a general lack of proper cleaning procedures. - Mod.EP
