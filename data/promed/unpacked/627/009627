Italian police on Tuesday [19 Jan 2021] shut down a dog breeding farm near Ancona in [the region] Marche.

Around 850 small dogs were sequestered at Trecastelli near the Marche port city. Five people were placed under investigation.

As well as being packed into tight, poorly aired pens, around half the dogs were found to be infected with _Brucella canis_, a very infectious dog bug transmissible to man.

Although it held almost 900 animals, the facility was only authorised for a maximum of 61.

Brucellosis [in man] is also known as undulant fever, Malta fever, and Mediterranean fever.

[_Brucella canis_ is a Gram-negative coccobacillus in the family Brucellaceae (class Alphaproteobacteria). Other _Brucella_ species occasionally associated with disease in dogs include _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_.

_B. canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in bitches, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis, and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.

The importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult. One clinical case was caused by the M-strain of _B. canis_, a laboratory strain that has reduced virulence and is used as an antigen for serological testing.

Dogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals. Antibodies to this organism have been detected in cats in South America, but bacteria were not recovered. Antibodies to _B canis_ have also been reported occasionally in wild canids.

_B. canis_ appears to be widely distributed. It has been reported in North, Central, and South America and parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. New Zealand and Australia appear to be free of _B. canis_; however, Australia has reported some _B. suis_ infections in dogs, mainly in animals used to hunt feral pigs.

The above, and additional exhaustive information, is available in the 2018 fact sheet 'Brucellosis: Canine' by Anna Rovid Spickler, at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf.

According to information published in the journal of the Dutch Veterinary Society in January 2019, several dogs originating in east Europe had been found there infected by _B. canis_ since 2016. "This bacterium had never before been recorded in the Nertherlands." (In Dutch, at https://www.knmvd.nl/tijdschriften/jaargang-144-aflevering-1-januari-2019/).

The results of the epidemiological investigation into the source of infection into the affected facility in Italy are expected with interest. - Mod.AS
