Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: fishing gear is being suspected to be one of the major routes of transmission from one water body to the other. _Clarias gariepinus_ species is the most affected. Awareness campaigns are on-going to educate the farmers on the disease and its routes of transmission. Farmers are being advised to disinfect their fishing gear.

Control measures
Measures applied: official disposal of carcasses, by- products and waste; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
University of Zambia (foreign laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Mozambique tilapia (_Oreochromis mossambicus__) / histopathological examination / - / Pending
Blue tilapia (_Oreochromis rendali_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / - / Pending
Catfish (_Clarias gariepinu_) / histopathological examination / - / Pending
Straightfin fish [barb] (_Barbus paludinosus_) / histopathological examination / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual, chapter 2.3.2, Infection with _Aphanomyces invadans_ (epizootic ulcerative syndrome), from which the following commentary is quoted: http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_aphanomyces_invadans.htm:

" Infection with _A. invadans_ is a seasonal epizootic condition of great importance in wild and farmed freshwater and estuarine fish. It has a complex infectious aetiology and is clinically characterised by the presence of invasive _A. invadans_ infection and necrotising ulcerative lesions, typically leading to a granulomatous response. Infection with _A. invadans_ is most commonly known as epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS). It is also known as red spot disease (RSD), mycotic granulomatosis (MG) and ulcerative mycosis (UM). In 2005, scientists proposed that the disease should be named epizootic granulomatous aphanomycosis; however, the term EUS continues to be used by most scientists. The disease is caused by the oomycete fungus _A. invadans_. Infection with _A. invadans_ has spread widely since the first outbreak in 1971 in Japan and to date only one genotype has been recorded. Parasites and rhabdoviruses have also been associated with particular outbreaks, and secondary Gram-negative bacteria invariably infect lesions caused by _A. invadans_.

Infection with _A. invadans_ was first reported in farmed freshwater ayu (_Plecoglossus altivelis_) in Oita Prefecture, Kyushu Island, Japan in 1971. It was later reported in estuarine fish, particularly grey mullet (_Mugil cephalus_) in eastern Australia in 1972. Infection with _A. invadans_ has extended its range through Papua New Guinea into South-East and South Asia, and into West Asia, where it has reached Pakistan. Outbreaks of ulcerative disease in menhaden (_Brevoortia tyrannus_) in the United States of America (USA) had the same aetiological agent as the disease observed in Asia. The 1st confirmed outbreaks of infection with _ A. invadans_ on the African continent occurred in 2007 in Botswana, Namibia and Zambia, and were connected to the Zambezi-Chobe river system. In 2010 and 2011, infection with _A. invadans_ appeared in wild freshwater fish in Western Cape Province, South Africa and in wild brown bullhead fish in Lake Ontario in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Infection with _A. invadans_ has been reported from more than 20 countries in 4 continents: North America, Southern Africa, Asia, and Australia.

There is no protective vaccine available. However, snakehead fish that had been immunised with a crude extract of the _A. invadans_ elicited humoral immune response as detected by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and Western blot analysis." - Mod.CRD
