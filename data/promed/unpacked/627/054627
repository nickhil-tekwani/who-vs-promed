4 more outbreaks of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) have been detected in
Spain, one of them in Castellon, (Valencia) more than 400 km away from the
first infected farm. Another 3 outbreaks in Lerida (Catalunya) have also
been confirmed by the Ministry of Agriculture, including one in Golmes
about 40 km from the original one in Soses.

On Thursday [14 Jun 2001, the European Commission said it banned live pig
exports from Spain's Catalonia region due to an outbreak of classical swine
fever (CSF) there. The Commission said it was informed earlier on Thursday
of the outbreak and the Spanish authorities had imposed a 3km protection
zone and a 10km surveillance zone around one infected farm.
"The Commission services are in close and permanent contact with the
Spanish authorities and have been kept fully informed of developments," it
said in a statement.
CSF is a highly infectious pig virus and although nearly always fatal to
the animals it is not harmful to people.
It said the ban would last until 30 Jun and a special meeting of the EU's
Standing Veterinary Committee would review the situation further at a
meeting on 22 Jun.
The Commission said, according to information provided by Spain, no animals
had left the holding, except for slaughter, since 14 May and a census of
all holdings in both zones would be carried out.
Spain's Ministry of Agriculture has also said the 2053 pigs on the farm in
the province of Llieda would be killed.
Spain had its last major outbreak of CSF in 1998 when hundreds of thousands
of pigs were slaughtered to prevent the disease from spreading.

France, Holland and Japan have ceased their importations of Spanish pork
eat a day after the confirmation of the classical swine fever (CSF)
outbreak in Lerida (Catalunya, Northeast Spain) made by Carlos Escribano
head of the livestock department of the Ministry of Agriculture.
So far 2035 pigs have been slaughtered in the town of Soses, where the farm
is located and 40 pig farms are under movement restrictions. Additionally,
5% of the animals will be sampled. Tracing of animals moved away from the
area has already started and in the Castilla-Leon region 36 suspected herds
are currently been tested. Spanish pork meat exportations represent 10% of
the national production, estimated in 400 000 tm. 60% of them originated in
Catalunya.

[Classical swine fever, swine fever or hog cholera is a contagious febrile
disease or pigs. The disease is caused by a small, enveloped RNA virus in
the pestivirus group of the family Flaviviridae. CSF is antigenically
related to the other pestiviruses, especially bovine viral diarrhea virus
of cattle and border disease virus of sheep. These latter 2 are widespread
in ruminants and can occasionally pigs. Laboratory testing, usually using
monoclonal antibody reagents, differentiate CSF from ruminant pestiviruses.
The virus is moderately fragile and does not persist in the environment or
spread long distances by the airborne route. It can survive for prolonged
periods in a moist, protein-rich medium, such as meat, other tissues, and
body fluids, particularly if kept cold or frozen. Virus survival times of
several years in frozen pig meant, or months in chilled or cured meat, have
been reported.
The main source of infection is the pig -- either the live animals or
uncooked pig products. The major concern is spread of disease by movement
of infected pigs. The wild pig and wild boar may harbor the virus.
The disease occurs in acute and chronic forms and the virulence varies from
severe, with high mortality to mild, or even subclinical. Those strains
with low virulence are difficult to diagnose. The more severe form is
characterized by fever, inappetence, and depression. The incubation period
is typically 2-6 days with death at 10-20 days after infection. The
differential diagnosis includes other febrile hemorrhagic disease of pigs
such as African Swine fever, bacterial septicemia, and anticoagulant poisoning.
There is no treatment and confirmed cases and in-contact animals should be
terminated, and measures taken to protect other pigs. Control measures may
include area restrictions on pig movements or vaccination.
Current vaccines are live attenuated type, either derivatives of the
lapinized "C" strain or strains adapted from cell cultures.
This disease does not affect people, other than the economic impact
producers and countries suffer from this disease. - Mod.TG
