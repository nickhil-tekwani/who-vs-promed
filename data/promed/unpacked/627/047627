Newly discovered coronavirus may cause childhood diseases
-----------------------------------------------
A newly discovered virus related to the SARS virus may cause several
mysterious childhood ailments, including Kawasaki disease, U.S. researchers
reported on Tue 18 Jan 2004. The new virus is a coronavirus, [a member of]
a family of viruses that cause common colds, animal diseases and severe
acute respiratory syndrome, a new disease that emerged in China in 2003,
killing 800 people globally and causing a worldwide panic before it was
contained. 2 studies in the Journal of Infectious Diseases link this new
virus to Kawasaki disease, the most common cause of acquired heart disease
in children in developed countries. Jeffrey Kahn and colleagues at Yale
University in Connecticut identified what they have named the New Haven
coronavirus. They tested 895 ill children under age 5 who had tested
negative for other viral infections. They found 79 of them, or 9 percent,
had the New Haven coronavirus. Symptoms included fever, cough, runny nose,
rapid breathing, abnormal breath sounds, and low blood oxygen levels.
Additionally, 11 babies infected with the new coronavirus were newborns in
intensive care units.
The Yale team found genetic evidence of the virus in respiratory secretions
taken from an infant with classic signs of Kawasaki disease. They analyzed
respiratory secretions from 11 children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease and
22 children without the disease. 8 of the 11 Kawasaki patients tested
positive for the New Haven coronavirus, but just one child without Kawasaki
symptoms tested positive. Kawasaki disease can be marked by an eye
infection, redness of the mouth or throat, rash, redness or swelling of the
hands or feet, and swollen lymph nodes. In some cases, the heart is
damaged, causing heart disease.
Coronaviruses were known to be common, but, until recently, tests have not
been available to diagnose and identify them.

Newly discovered virus linked to childhood lung disorders and Kawasaki disease
-----------------------------------------------
[The following more detailed account of the characteristics of the New
Haven coronavirus is taken from an article authored by Steve Baragona of
the Infectious Diseases Society of America. - Mod.CP]
A newly discovered virus may be responsible for many respiratory tract
illnesses in infants and children, and may be associated with an important
multi-organ disease whose cause has remained a mystery for decades,
according to articles in the 15 Feb 2005 issue of The Journal of Infectious
Diseases, now available online: <http://www.idsociety.org>.
The virus is one of the numerous coronaviruses, most of which infect
animals. In humans, coronaviruses have been known primarily for causing
colds or, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Genetic
evidence now suggests that a previously unknown coronavirus may account for
some of the many respiratory diseases for which a causative agent is
unidentified, and may have a role in Kawasaki disease, the most common
cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries.
In the 1st of 2 studies, Jeffrey S. Kahn and co-workers at Yale University
used molecular probes targeting a gene that is common in human and animal
coronaviruses to screen hundreds of specimens for coronavirus genetic
material. Ultimately, 2 specimens were identified in which the sequence of
chemical building blocks of the gene differed from that of known human
coronaviruses. The Yale investigators, named the novel virus indicated by
their findings the New Haven coronavirus, then used probes specific for
this virus to screen respiratory specimens from 895 symptomatic children
under age 5 who had tested negative for other viral infections. They found
79 (9 percent) who were positive for the new virus, 9 of whom were
subsequently found to have evidence of recent infection with another virus
as well. Of the remaining 67 patients for whom clinical data were
available, signs and symptoms of infection with the new virus included
fever, cough, runny nose, rapid breathing, abnormal breath sounds, and
hypoxia; 35 had an underlying condition, such as prematurity (19 patients).
Indeed, 11 of those infected with the new coronavirus were newborns
hospitalized in intensive care. Analysis of the New Haven coronavirus's
genetic structure showed many similarities to that of a [new] coronavirus
[previously] identified by 2 groups in the Netherlands [see ProMED-mail
reference below - Mod.CP], suggesting that the virus may have worldwide
distribution.
That Kawasaki disease may be associated with infection by the newly
identified New Haven coronavirus was suggested by findings in the Yale
group's 2nd study, which was initiated when they found evidence of the
virus's genetic structure in respiratory secretions from an infant with
classic signs of Kawasaki disease. In addition to heart disease, the signs
can include conjunctivitis, redness of the mouth or throat, rash, redness
or swelling of the hands or feet, and swollen cervical lymph nodes. The
investigators then analyzed respiratory secretions from 11 children
diagnosed with Kawasaki disease and 22 children without the disease. 8 (73
percent) of the Kawasaki patients, but only one (5 percent) of the
comparison group, tested positive for the New Haven coronavirus.
In an accompanying editorial, Kenneth McIntosh of Harvard University
commented that discovery of a new human respiratory coronavirus would not
be surprising, since studies in the 1960s and 1970s had pointed to a number
of novel coronavirus strains, but the findings were not adequately followed
up, because methods to do so were unavailable at the time. The
statistically strong association with Kawasaki disease, however, was "quite
surprising." Noting that previous attempts to link Kawasaki disease to
bacteria or other viruses had failed, and thus justified healthy skepticism
about the present findings, Dr. McIntosh pointed out some "tantalizing
facts:" onset of Kawasaki disease is often preceded by a respiratory
syndrome; both the disease and respiratory coronavirus infections are
seasonal, peaking in the winter and spring; recent studies have described a
powerful immune response in the respiratory tract and other organs in acute
cases of Kawasaki disease suggesting the involvement of a specific microbe,
which may enter the body through the respiratory tract; finally, as the
emergence of SARS illustrates, coronaviruses "are capable of enormously
varied pathogenicity." Despite these encouraging preliminary observations,
Dr. McIntosh noted that the association between this novel coronavirus and
Kawasaki disease will require confirmation by others in larger future
investigations.
