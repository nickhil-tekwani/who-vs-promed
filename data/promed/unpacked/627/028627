Butterball, LLC, a Mount Olive, North Carolina establishment, is recalling approximately 78 164 pounds [about 35 530 kilograms] of raw ground turkey products that may be contaminated with _Salmonella_ Schwartzengrund, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, [Wed 13 Mar 2019].

The products subject to recall bear establishment number "EST. P-7345" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to institutional and retail locations nationwide.

FSIS and public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, have been investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Schwartzengrund illnesses involving 5 case patients from 2 states. Wisconsin collected 3 intact Butterball brand ground turkey samples from a residence where 4 of the case patients live. The case patients and ground turkey _Salmonella_ Schwartzengrund isolates are closely related, genetically.

Consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the commonest bacterial foodborne illnesses. The commonest symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some people, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at <www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls>.
