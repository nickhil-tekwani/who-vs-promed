The strain of virus that caused the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in
Camperdown has been identified as being of foreign origin, occurring for
the first time in South Africa, and may well spread via other port towns.
Fred Visser, president of the KwaZulu-Natal Agricultural Union, said
yesterday: "The coming weeks will tell whether this is an actual or a
potential national crisis", as results of efforts to stop the disease
at its point of inception come to light.
The type-O virus had apparently emanated from a ship berthed at Durban
and was contained in kitchen effluent that was bought for resale as
swill to piggeries in the province. Visser said all 670 livestock on the
affected farm had been incinerated. "The complete destruction of the
livestock also served to ensure it was not consumed by humans."
