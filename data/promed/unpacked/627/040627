For the 1st time since 1959, there's a human case of a rabies in Indiana. A
10-year-old in Marshall County was bitten by a bat in June 2006 and just
recently started showing symptoms that led to encephalitis. The child is
now in the hospital and doctors hope they've caught this case in time.
"Historically it's a near fatal disease and so it's always touch and go,
but given treatment today we're hopeful that this individual is going to
survive this case," said Dr. Judith Monroe, Indiana State Department of Health.
The health department says if you've been bitten by a bat or other wild
animal you should go to the doctor and report it to the health department.
The CDC has set up a phone line to answer questions about rabies, that
number is 1-800-CDC-INFO.

[It is not clear from the above report whether this patient received
post-exposure immunisation at an early enough stage to abort rabies virus
infection, or whether the child's doctors are relying on the treatment
protocol which led to the recovery of a 15-year-old girl who developed
symptoms of rabies following a bat bite in Fonddu-Lac Wisconsin in 2004
(see: ProMED-mail references below and MMWR Weekly, 24 Dec 2004 /
53(50);1171-1173; <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a1.htm>.
The recent development of symptom of encephalitis in the patient after a
delay of more than 3 months is not a welcome development. Only 5 people in
the world besides the Fond du Lac girl are known to have survived rabies
virus infection after the onset of symptoms, but they had received standard
treatment, a series of rabies vaccine shots, or vaccine ahead of time. -
