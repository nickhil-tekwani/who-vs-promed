Avian Flu Wanes in Asian Nations It 1st Hit Hard
-----------------------------------------------
Even as it crops up in the far corners of Europe and Africa, the
virulent bird flu that raised fears of a human pandemic has been
largely snuffed out in the parts of Southeast Asia where it claimed
its 1st and most numerous victims.
Health officials are pleased and excited. "In Thailand and Viet Nam,
we've had the most fabulous success stories," said Dr. David Nabarro,
chief pandemic flu coordinator for the United Nations.
Viet Nam, which has had almost half of the human cases of A (H5N1)
flu in the world, has not seen a single case in humans or a single
outbreak in poultry this year (2006) [excluding several
cases/outbreaks along the Chinese border; see further. - Mod.AS].
Thailand, the 2nd-hardest-hit nation, until Indonesia recently passed
it, has not had a human case in nearly a year or one in poultry in 6
months.
Encouraging signs have also come from China, though they are harder
to interpret.
These are the 2nd positive signals that officials have seen recently
in their struggle to prevent avian flu from igniting a human
pandemic. Confounding expectations, birds making the spring migration
north from Africa have not carried the virus into Europe.
Dr. Nabarro and other officials warn that it would be highly
premature to declare any sort of victory. The virus has moved rapidly
across continents and is still rampaging in Myanmar, Indonesia and
other countries nearby. It could still hitchhike back in the illegal
trade in chicks, fighting cocks or tropical pets, or in migrating
birds.
But this sudden success in the former epicenter of the epidemic is
proof that aggressive measures like killing infected chickens,
inoculating healthy ones, protecting domestic flocks and educating
farmers can work, even in very poor countries.
Dr. Nabarro said he was "cautious in interpreting these shifts in
patterns" because too little is known about how the disease spreads.
Other officials agreed. "To say the disease is 'wiped out' there is
probably too strong, too positive," said Dr. Wantanee Kalpravidh,
chief of flu surveillance in Southeast Asia for the United Nations
Food and Agricultural Organization, which fights animal diseases. The
governments of Thailand and Viet Nam "believe they got rid of it,"
she said, "but they also believe that it might be coming back at any
time."
Very different tactics led to success in the 2 countries. While Viet
Nam began vaccinating all its 220 million chickens last summer
(2005), Thailand did not because it has a large poultry export
industry, and other nations would have banned its birds indefinitely.
(Vaccines can mask the virus instead of killing it.) Instead,
Thailand culled wide areas around infected flocks, compensated
farmers generously and deputized a volunteer in every village to
report sick chickens. It vaccinates fighting cocks, which can be
worth thousands of dollars, and even issues them passports with their
vaccination records so they can travel, Dr. Nabarro said.
Government inspectors sample birds everywhere; in February 2006,
Thailand reported that samples from 57 000 birds had come back
negative.
According to Dr. Klaus Stohr, a flu specialist at the World Health
Organization, Thailand and Viet Nam also delivered the antiviral drug
Tamiflu to even the smallest regional hospitals and told doctors to
treat all flu patients even before laboratory diagnoses could be made.
Dr. Nabarro particularly praised the leaders of the 2 countries for
ordering high-level officials -- deputy prime ministers -- to fight
the disease and for making sure that enough cash to entice farmers to
hand over their birds for culling flowed down official channels
without being siphoned off.
Hints suggest that the disease is also being beaten back in China,
the country where it is assumed to have begun. International
officials tend to greet official public health reports from China
skeptically, in part because it concealed the outbreak of the SARS
virus there for months. It did not officially report any bird cases
for years, even though many scientists contend the virus incubated
there between its 1st appearance in humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and
the current human outbreak, which began in Viet Nam in 2003.
Some top Chinese officials have blamed the reluctance of local
officials to report bad news to Beijing. Dr. Nabarro said he recently
met a vice premier "who made it clear that they are absolutely
determined to get the fullest possible cooperation from provincial
authorities."
China's reported human cases have remained low: 8 last year and 10
this year [2006].
Perhaps more importantly, its poultry cases -- which lead to human
cases and increase the risk of a mutant pandemic strain -- seem to be
dropping.
According to the World Health Organization, China said it had
outbreaks in 16 provinces in 2004. In 2005, it reported outbreaks in
only 12 provinces, but one in November was so large that 2.5 million
birds were culled to contain it.
After that, the Agriculture Ministry announced that it would
vaccinate every domestic bird in China, which raises and consumes 14
billion chickens, ducks and geese each year. The official news agency
reported about the same time that a fake flu vaccine, possibly with
live virus in it, might have spread the disease.
Dr. Stohr, who is in charge of WHO flu vaccine efforts, said he was
told by Chinese agriculture officials that the country was now
producing 46 billion doses of poultry vaccine a year and was
supplying vaccines to Viet Nam [see comment].
China's most recent monthly reports describe much smaller outbreaks
than were previously common: findings of a few dead wild birds and
culls of 126 000 birds in one spot and 16 000 in another, for example.
"We are hopeful that China has turned the corner," Dr. Nabarro said.
In Cambodia and Laos, which separate Thailand and Viet Nam, the
situation is vague.
Laos has reported no human cases and last reported poultry outbreaks
2 years ago. Cambodia's reported human cases dropped to 2 this year
[2006], from 4 last year. No poultry outbreaks were reported, but
surveillance is so spotty that some must have occurred and gone
unnoticed, Dr. Kalpravidh said, because the country's 6 human victims
were infected by poultry.
Cambodia was slow to compensate farmers for their birds because of
problems with corruption in a previous cash-for-guns program.
Health specialists generally agree that there is little clear chance
of infected birds landing in the United States.
Where the Southeast Asian governments have taken action, however, the
risk of the virus returning is ever present, Dr. Nabarro said.
For example, he said, it probably exists in Viet Nam in Muscovy
ducks, which can harbor the virus but do not get sick, and it has
turned up in isolated birds in open-air markets near the Chinese
border. (Single birds do not constitute an outbreak). Since Chinese
farmers can get 3 times as much for a chicken in Viet Nam as they can
at home, the temptation to smuggle persists [see 20060408.1060].
"Tomorrow, the whole thing could change again," Dr. Nabarro said. "We
need to be on the alert at all times."

[While the situation in Thailand, and also to some extent in Viet
Nam, is indeed promising, the battle is far from being won (see also
next item). One should also keep in mind the seasonality of avian
influenza, peaking during the period January - March, as observed in
2004, 2005 and also (elsewhere) during the current year 2006.
Regarding vaccines, subscribers are referred to the updated
FAO/EMPRES international list of avian influenza vaccine producers
(from 8 countries, China included), which may be found at

Romania detects more deadly bird flu in poultry
-----------------------------------------------
Romania detected a new outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in
poultry on Saturday [13 May 2006], just a month after the strain was
said to have been eradicated there, authorities said.
The discovery of the infected birds in Transylvania prompted
authorities to cull hundreds of domestic fowl.
The Black Sea state has culled nearly half a million fowl and
gradually stopped around 60 bird flu outbreaks across its territory
since the 1st avian flu case was detected in the Danube delta last
October 2005.
"Lab tests detected the (highly pathogenic) H5N1 strain in dead
poultry from several locations in Transylvania," Romania's chief
veterinarian Ion Agafitei told Reuters. He said around 2200 birds
were culled and quarantine was imposed as a precaution. The outbreaks
occurred in the villages of Hurez and Codlea and in the outskirts of
the small town of Fagaras, in the county of Brasov, some 170 km (106
miles) north of Bucharest, Agafitei said [map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?action=showmap&country=240_0_4&language=1>].
The virus has spread in birds at an alarming rate in recent months,
sweeping through parts of Europe, down into Africa and flaring anew
in Asia.

[A summary of the number of outbreaks in Europe since the beginning
of 2006 and the date of the last outbreak notified to the Community
by countries -- Romania included -- is given in a table of EU's
Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS). The table includes 2
columns on HPAI, one on the disease in poultry, the other one for
reported cases in wild birds. The table, updated weekly (last update
5 May 2006), is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/comm/food/animal/diseases/adns/table_11_2006/adns_050506_en.pdf>.
According to these data, HPAI has been detected, since the beginning
of 2006, in at least 455 wild birds in 16 EU countries. The last case
in a wild bird in Romania was reported on 31 Mar 2006.
A map on avian influenza in wild birds is also available there. - Mod.AS]
