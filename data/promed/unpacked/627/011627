Toxic fungus threatens health of consumers of corn
--------------------------------------------------
Ghana, Togo and Benin are joining forces to fight a toxic fungus,
_Aspergillus flavus_, which is contaminating corn and other widely-consumed
crops in West Africa. The fungus produces aflatoxin which penetrates the
body only through the consumption of grain-based food, or poultry and
cattle fed with such food. Aflatoxin contamination of maize, peanut and
other food crops is considered to be a major cause of hepatocellular
carcinoma (liver cancer) in humans.
Rotary International has launched a programme to eradicate aflatoxin in the
three West African countries. It conducted a survey which showed a strong
correlation between the presence of aflatoxin in the blood and liver cancer.
Aflatoxin is also indirectly absorbed by children through maternal milk. As
a result, their immune system is affected. "This contributes to high
infant mortality rates and to impaired health throughout the child's life,"
said Kitty Cardwell, a member of Rotary and an expert on aflatoxin. Infant
mortality rates stand at 76 per 1000 in Ghana, 97 per 1000 in Benin and 77
per 1000 in Togo.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the permitted level in
food products of aflatoxin is zero parts per billion (0 ppb) for children,
20 ppb for adults and 55 ppb for animals. "These norms are not respected
in Western Africa. Some studies show populations consuming 100 ppb per day
since they were born," Cardwell lamented. The studies reveal that
consumers are not aware they are eating contaminated food. The problem with
aflatoxin is that farmers cannot see the fungus that produces it on the
corn. Moreover, it is colourless and it does not disappear after cooking or
fermentation.
"The corn seeds are severely damaged in West Africa because they remain too
long in the fields where they are attacked by many insects. As a result,
they generally have higher levels of aflatoxin," according to the survey
report.

[The U.S Food and Drug Administration initiates regulatory action when
aflatoxin exceeds 0.5 ppb in milk for human consumption. Drying maize
kernels to 15.5% moisture or lower within 24-48 hours of harvest will
minimize the risk of fungal growth and consequent aflatoxin production.
This assumes that maize and other grains seeds are not already infected
with _A. flavus_ in the standing crops. Research by USDA scientists has
demonstrated that two maize lines which are resistant to infection by _A.
flavus_ are also resistant to infection by _Fusarium moniliforme_, another
maize ear-rotting fungus that produces fumonisins, another class of
mycotoxin. These maize lines may be useful in developing lines which not
only resist infection by the two fungi but also to production of the
mycotoxins.
