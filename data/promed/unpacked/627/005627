One reason for the rarity of rabies in rats is the simple fact that
rodents rarely survive the attacks of carnivores (rabid or otherwise)
and are unlikely to recover, develop the disease and then bite humans.

[Dr. Berger's point is well taken. It may also be that rodent bites
are not often reported and the rabies attributed to some other
animal. Likely speculations along these lines could continue but will
not, as this thread is cut unless there are further developments with
the individual who owned the dog or the bitten dog itself. - Mod.TG]
