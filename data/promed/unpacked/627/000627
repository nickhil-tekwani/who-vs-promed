Bluetongue in France
--------------------
[Last year's total has been surpassed despite the
vaccination campaign. A look at the map on the
French Ministry's Web site will demonstrate how
the BTV 1 is rising up the West side of France.
The areas such as the Charente and the Dordogne
are not vaccinated against BTV-1, this year.

It is going to be a huge vaccination campaign
next year (2009)with most animals being
vaccinated against BTV-8 and BTV-1. - Rapp. SB]

The Bureau of Animal Health reports on the
Ministry of Agriculture's Web site published
Paris 3 Oct 2008 that the reglemented zone for
the Blue Tongue serotype 8 and serotype 1 has
been modified by reason of the confirmation of
new cases of the BTV-1 and 8 in the Charente and the Dordogne.

The confirmation of cases of the BTV-1 in the
Departments of the Charente and the Dordogne have
caused a modification of the reglemented zone for
the BTV-1 and the BTV-8 in the Departments of the
Correze, Deux Sevres, the Vendee, Vienne and
Haute-Vienne. The zone is proclaimed by decree of
3 Oct 2008 defining the reglemented zone relative
to the Blue Tongue virus. It comes into force on
4 Oct 2008. The actual list of reglemented
communes will only include the communes in the reglemented zone.

17 257 cases of BTV-8 during 2008 have been the
outcome of viral circulation in 2008.

2750 cases of BTV-1 during 2008 have been the
outcome of viral circulation in 2008. 14 cases of
the BTV1 and BTV8 cases were recorded within the same herds.

For Information: 15 569 cases of BTV-8 were
recorded during 2007 ( 3 cases of the BTV-1 ).

For information: 6020 cases of the BTV-8 declared
in the first 6 months of 2008 ( 6 cases of the
BTV-1 ) have been the outcome of viral circulation in 2007.

[France's BTV-8 situation during 2008 is graver
than the one seen in other European countries.
Even more concerning is the rapid spread of BTV-1
from Spain into France and further in northwards
and eastwards direction, within a susceptible
animal population. This can be clearly seen in
the EU map showing the location of the Bluetongue
restriction zones in Europe, updated 9 Oct 2008:
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_restrictedzones-map.jpg>.

During 2008, Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland
experienced few cases. 23 cases were reported
from the Czech Republic. Hungary confirmed its
1st BTV-8 case on 9 Sep 2008, originating from
animals imported from France in July. The UK
experienced several positive cases in animals
imported from the continent. So far, no viral
spread has been reported. Subscribers may access
the presentation "Bluetongue Â­ where we are and
challenges for the future" delivered during the
annual congress of the British Veterinary
Congress held in London 25-27 Sep 2008, available at
<http://www.farmtalking.com/pdf/bluetongue_bva_congress_08_presentation_oura.pdf>
(thanks to Sabine Zentis for drawing our attention to the said presentation).

Germany reported, as of 3 Oct 2008, 1678 cases
which occurred since 1 May. For additional data,
see the FLI report (in German) at
<http://www.fli.bund.de/253.html?&no_cache=1&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=297&cHash=0111265f06>
and the 2-3 Oct 2008 presentation in English to SCFCAH, available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23102008_de.pdf>,
which includes comparative data for 2006
and 2007 as well as vaccination figures.

In Sweden, 16 infected holdings were reportedly
affected as of 2 Oct 2008 in the counties
Halland, Skane and Kronoberg. Only one animal
showed clinical signs. The 1st case of BTV-8 in
Sweden was confirmed on 6 Sep 2008. See further data at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23102008_sv.pdf>.

Denmark: Between 27 Aug and 2 Oct 2008, 11
outbreaks have been recorded of which 7
demonstrated clinical disease. 4 out of the 7
clinical cases had, reportedly, been vaccinated. See further at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23102008_dk.pdf>.

Several reports on clinical cases in animals
registered as vaccinated have come also from
France and Germany. To the best of our knowledge,
the detailed, full protocols of the efficacy
testing trials of the inactivated BTV-8 vaccines,
manufactured by various producers, have not
become publicly available so far; we would be glad to stand corrected.

As to BTV-1, Spain has reported, as of 1 Oct
2008, 1013 outbreaks, of which 899 in bovines,
106 in ovines and 8 in caprines. For further details, see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23102008_es.pdf>.
