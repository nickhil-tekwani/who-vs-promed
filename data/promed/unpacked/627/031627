This is in response to the request for information about the vaccine recall.

The stop sale and recall of Intervet's equine West Nile vaccine PreveNile
also affects Canada. It is a voluntary stop sale and recall, initiated by
Intervet after an increase in the number of immediate hypersensitivity type
reactions (anaphylaxis, colic) was noticed in the United States. The
Canadian stop sale and recall is a precautionary measure as such an
increase in reported adverse reactions has not been noted in Canada.
Canadian distributors and end users of the product have been notified of
the recall.

[It was unclear from the press release that Canada was affected as well as
the USA.

The actual letter from Intervet stated: "due to an increased number of
adverse event reports associated with the use of these vaccines." Since an
adverse event can encompass a variety of generally negative events, it was
unclear specifically what reactions were the most prevalent, resulting in
the recall.

Dr Cooper has alerted us that it was immediate hypersensitivity type
reactions [see definition at
<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/136217-overview>. - Mod.SH]. We
appreciate the clarification. - Mod.TG]
