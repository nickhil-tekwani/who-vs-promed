[If the Bulgarian assessment is correct, Bluetongue (or Blue Tongue) is
established in Turkey to the west of Istanbul and immediately adjoining the
Burgas region of Bulgaria. However, without seeing the relevant
meteorological reports, winds which are "southerly" in Bulgaria may also
have collected midges in northern Turkey and then swept around clockwise to
bring them to Bulgaria. Either way, it would seem that Turkey is a possible
source. - MHJ
