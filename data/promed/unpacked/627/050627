_Erysiphe corylacearum_, causing an emerging powdery mildew of hazelnuts, was first observed in Romania in 2019-2020 on hazelnut trees (_Corylus avellana_) in forests in the Eastern and Southern Carpathian Mountains.

Native to East Asia, _Erysiphe corylacearum_ is a new powdery mildew of hazelnuts (_Corylus_ spp.) which was first observed in Turkey in 2013 and has since rapidly extended its distribution range in the Middle East, the Caucasus, as well as in Eastern and Central Europe. The species is believed to originate in Asia (China, Japan, Korean Peninsula, Russian Far East) and has been reported as an invasive pathogen in hazelnut orchards (_Corylus avellana_) in Turkey, Iran, and Georgia where it causes serious damage to nut production.

Symptoms are observed on the upper leaf surface, shoots and fruit clusters including husks. The disease was more recently reported from Southern Russia, the Ukraine, Switzerland, Italy and Austria. In the EPPO region it was observed in orchards for nut production, as well as on trees growing in mixed deciduous forests, hedges, as well as in city gardens and parks.

_E. corylacearum_ may already be present in other European countries between Ukraine and Italy and seems to be spreading westwards. Recent phylogenic and taxonomic studies showed that the isolates from North America on _Corylus cornuta_, which were previously assigned to _E. corylacearum_ constitute a species of its own named _E. cornutae_.

[In addition to _E. corylacearum_, powdery mildew symptoms on _Corylus_ species can also be caused by some other _Erysiphe_ species, as well as _Phyllactinia guttata_. Powdery mildews are a group of fungi causing similar symptoms on a range of host plants. The group includes many species in a number of genera. Generally, each fungal species is confined to a number of host species it affects. The pathogens cause serious losses in many important crops including cereals, hops, oilseed rape, sugar beet, grapevine and a number of vegetable crops.

Leaves heavily infected by powdery mildews have reduced photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant vigour and increased chance of winter injury to soft twigs and growth points. Spores are spread mainly by splashing rain, wind or mechanical means (including insect, animal, or human activities). The fungi overwinter in infected leaves and plant debris on the ground. The diseases are usually controlled with fungicides.
