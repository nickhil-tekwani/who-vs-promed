Japan: Fatal Hepatitis E Virus Infection From Consumption of Raw Boar Meat
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 70-year-old man from Tottori Prefecture died in April 2003 of hepatitis E
virus infection after eating raw wild boar [meat] that carried the
Hepatitis E virus, The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper learned on Fri 1 Aug 2003.
It also was learned that a 53-year-old man in the same prefecture who ate
the meat also contracted the disease, as well as 4 people in Hyogo
Prefecture who ate raw deer meat earlier this year.
The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry will issue a warning to prefectural
governments on the dangers of eating the raw flesh of wild animals, sources
close to the ministry said on Friday. The Ministry also is considering
conducting a nationwide survey on what kinds of animals and how many of
them have the virus.
In the Hyogo Prefecture case, 3 people in a family and a friend received
some venison from an acquaintance in late February 2003 and ate it raw, the
sources said. All 4, aged between 40 to 69, displayed symptoms of the
disease, including high fever, vomiting, and impaired hepatic function in
April. They were examined at Kasai Municipal Hospital in Kasai, Hyogo
Prefecture, and diagnosed as having the virus. The 4 victims recovered from
the ill effects of eating the meat without developing chronic hepatitis E
virus infection. [Hepatitis E virus infection, like that of hepatitis A
virus, causes an acute self-limited disease that does not progress to a
chronic phase. - Mod.CP]
A team of researchers led by Shunji Mishiro, director of the research
department of Toshiba Hospital in Tokyo, examined a sample of the venison
from the family's freezer and detected hepatitis E virus with a gene
identical to the virus found in the victims. In the Tottori case, the 2
victims were confirmed as having contracted the disease after eating the
uncooked internal organs of a wild boar.
Hepatitis E can be contracted through tainted water and food. Until
recently, it had been considered a disease of developing countries with
poor sanitary conditions, but Mishiro found that it has claimed the lives
of Japanese people since the 1990s. According to experts, consumers do not
need to worry even if meat contains the virus, provided it is fully cooked.
"The virus is usually killed off by heat, but the risk level of eating the
meat of wild animals is totally unknown. We'll investigate the situation as
soon as possible," a ministry official said. Hepatitis E virus is the only
hepatitis virus that can be spread through zoonosis.

[This report and the preceding report from Japan on hepatitis E virus
infection reveal a previously unrecognized risk associated with consumption
of raw meat from wild animals. Hepatitis E virus infection is usually
associated with water-borne outbreaks of illness or sporadic cases of
enterically transmitted acute hepatitis. As previously commented, hepatitis
E virus is considered to be endemic in tropical regions of Asia, Africa,
and Central America, and non-pathogenic variants are presumed to be present
more widely. On the basis of immunological studies, related or identical
hepatitis E viruses infect primates, swine, and other animals. In Japan --
at least -- these other animals are now known to include wild boar and Sika
deer. The virus recovered from refrigerated raw venison from Sika deer and
the human patients proved to be virtually identical by limited nucleic acid
sequence comparison, confirming the previous inference from immunological
studies that some human and animal strains of hepatitis E virus are closely
related. The outcome of hepatitis E virus infection is not normally
serious, except in the case of pregnant women in the third trimester of
pregnancy, when a case-fatality rate of 15-20 percent has been observed.
Fulminant hepatitis occurs more often in economically deprived communities.
