Italy reports suspected case of the human form of mad cow disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a
fatal brain disease in cattle which 1st emerged in Britain in the
1980s. It is believed that humans can contract a fatal variation of
it by eating infected parts of animals suffering from the disease.

The Italian Health Ministry reported on Friday [23 Oct 2009] a
"likely" case of [variant] Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the
human form of mad cow disease.

Since national records were established in 1993, Italy has had only
one known case of the disease, in 2002, the ministry said [see
ProMED- mail archived reports below]. It said the likely new case was
believed to have been infected before the use of animal and bone meal
in animal feed was banned in December 2000.

[As of October 2009, according to the UK National CJD Surveillance
Unit (NCJDSU) the worldwide tally of confirmed cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease is the following: United Kingdoom, 167
cases, France 25, Ireland 4, Italy one (and the suspected case
described above), United States 3*, Canada one, Saudi Arabia one,
Japan one*, the Netherlands 3, Portugal 2, and Spain 5.

*The cases in the United States, Saudi Arabia and Japan are patients
considered to have contracted the disease while resident in the
United Kingdom (see <http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdworld.htm>). If the
Italian suspected case is confirmed the worldwide total of variant
CJD cases will become 214.

Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
