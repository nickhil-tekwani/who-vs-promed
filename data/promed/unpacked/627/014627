Local Transmission of _Plasmodium vivax_ Malaria --- Palm Beach
County, Florida, 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The majority of malaria cases diagnosed in the United States are
imported, usually by persons who travel to countries where malaria is
endemic (1). However, small outbreaks of locally acquired
mosquito-transmitted malaria continue to occur (2). Despite
certification of malaria eradication in the United States in 1970
(3,4), 11 outbreaks involving 20 cases of probable locally acquired
mosquito-transmitted malaria have been reported to CDC since 1992
(5--7), including 2 reported in July 1996 from Palm Beach County,
Florida (Palm Beach County Health Department, unpublished data, 1998).
This report describes the investigation of 7 cases of locally
acquired _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria that occurred in Palm Beach
County during July-August 2003. In addition to considering malaria in
the differential diagnosis for febrile patients with a history of
travel to malarious areas, health-care providers also should consider
malaria as a possible cause of fever among patients who have not
traveled but are experiencing alternating fevers, rigors, and sweats
with no obvious cause.
Case Reports
Case 1. On 24 Jul 2003, a man aged 37 years was admitted to hospital
A with a 6-day history of fever, chills, hea ache, anorexia, and
vomiting. On 25 Jul 2003, _P. vivax_ was identified on a blood smear.
The patient recovered after treatment with doxycycline, quinine, and
primaquine. The patient is a plumber who reported working outside
during the day but who stayed indoors at night.
Case 2. On 22 Jul 2003, a man aged 46 years reported to the emergency
department (ED) of hospital A with a 3-day history of fever,
headache, chills, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and
malaise. He was treated with intravenous fluids and discharged with
levofloxacin. On 24 Jul 2003, he returned to the ED with worsening
symptoms and was admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. On 25 Jul
2003, _P. vivax_ was identified on a blood smear. The patient
recovered after treatment with doxycycline, quinine, and primaquine.
The patient is a construction worker who reported working outside.
Case 3. On 15 Aug 2003, a man aged 32 years was admitted to hospital
A with a 33-day history of fever, chills, headache, vomiting, and
intermittent sweating. He had consulted several physicians for his
symptoms and had been treated unsuccessfully with azithromycin and
prednisone. On the day of admission, _P. vivax_ was identified on a
blood smear. The patient recovered after treatment with doxycycline,
quinine, and primaquine. He reported having played golf and tennis in
the evenings.
Case 4. On 19 Aug 2003, a man aged 45 years visited the ED of
hospital A with a 2-day history of fever, chills, anorexia,
arthralgias, and diarrhea and was discharged on ibuprofen. The
patient visited the ED again on 21 Aug 2003 for these same symptoms,
was evaluated, and discharged. On 22 Aug 2003, he returned to the ED
with worsening symptoms and mental confusion and was admitted; a
blood smear demonstrated the presence of _P. vivax_. He recovered
after treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. The patient slept in
a homeless camp in a wooded area near a canal. He reported using
insect repellent.
Case 5. On 24 Aug 2003, a man aged 23 years was admitted to hospital
A with a 12-day history of fever, chills, arthralgias, diarrhea, and
vomiting. On the day of admission, _P. vivax_ was identified on a
blood smear. He had visited the ED several days previously with the
same complaints and had been treated with antibiotics for a
respiratory infection. The patient recovered after treatment with
chloroquine and primaquine. He reported fishing at a community pond
in the evenings.
Case 6. On 25 Aug 2003, a person aged 17 years was admitted to
hospital B with an 8-day history of fever, chills, and headaches. On
26 Aug 2003, _P. vivax_ was identified on a blood smear. He recovered
after treatment with doxycycline, quinine, and primaquine. The
patient is a student and reported spending time at a pond near his
house.
Case 7. On 26 Aug 2003, a man aged 48 years was admitted to hospital
C with a 7-day history of fever and chills. He had self-treated
earlier that week with antibiotics. _P. vivax_ was identified on a
peripheral blood smear on the day of admission. He recovered after
treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. The patient is a carpenter
and works until 8 p.m. in an open warehouse.
Epidemiologic Investigation
All 7 patients reported having no previous history of malaria, recent
blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or intravenous drug use. 6
of the 7 patients reported never having traveled to regions where
malaria is endemic. Patient 7 emigrated to the United States from
Bogota, Colombia, in July 2001; although Bogota is free of malaria
transmission, malaria is endemic in some areas of Colombia. All 7
patients live within the West Palm Beach area within 10 miles of Palm
Beach International Airport. No international seaport exists nearby.
Patients 1 and 2 attended the same local party on 4 Jul 2003. None of
the other patients had any known common activities or interactions.
Laboratory Investigation
Blood specimens were reviewed, and _P. vivax_ infection was confirmed
by both microscopic diagnosis and polymerase chain reaction rRNA gene
analysis. In addition, parasite multilocus genotyping confirmed that
all 7 patients were infected by the same strain of _P. vivax_.
Entomologic Investigation
Targeted mosquito trapping was conducted within 1 mile of the homes
of patients. _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_ (n = 33) and _An. crucians_
(n = 425) were tested by CDC. None demonstrated the presence of
malaria parasites.
Prevention Measures and Enhanced Surveillance Activities
Several strategies to prevent further transmission of malaria and to
enhance case detection were implemented by the Palm Beach County
Health Department. Reverse 911 telephone calls delivering a
prerecorded message warning of the presence of malaria in the region
and advising the use of prevention measures were made to all homes in
the county; approximately 300 000 residents were reached. Postcards
in multiple languages were mailed to residents. Flyers and posters in
English and Spanish were distributed at soup kitchens, trailer parks,
and at outdoor activities at which persons were at high risk for
malaria. Local media were encouraged to provide relevant malaria
messages in multiple languages. Multilingual notices were sent home
with all public school students. Several local homeless camps were
visited to distribute brochures and insect repellent. Case-finding
was conducted after reports of fever in these camps. One person was
evaluated for malaria, but his smears did not demonstrate the
presence of malaria parasites. Notices were sent to local physicians
and hospitals by e-mail, fax, and mail, informing them of the
presence of malaria and requesting information and advising testing
for persons with a history of unexplained fever.
Mosquito-control practices were already in place in Palm Beach County
for control of the West Nile virus vector and nuisance mosquitoes.
Additional mosquito spraying was implemented within a 3-mile radius
of the homes of each malaria patient.

MMWR Editorial Note:
This outbreak shares common features with other outbreaks of malaria
reported previously in the United States, including 1) an initial
introduced case without risk factors for malaria, 2) presence of
competent malaria vectors, 3) proximity to a person with malaria
parasitemia, and 4) environmental conditions conducive to the
maturation of the parasite in the mosquito. Possible infected persons
providing a source for this outbreak in Palm Beach County include
both international travelers and the immigrant population, including
migrant farm laborers from Mexico and Central and South America. This
outbreak represents the first reported outbreak of malaria with
extended transmission in the United States since 1986 (8,9). Early
cases might have been sources of subsequent cases or ongoing
transmission might have resulted from an index patient with
unresolved parasitemia being the source for each subsequent case.
Also unique to this outbreak has been the use of molecular techniques
to genetically type the strain of the infecting parasite. These
results support the hypothesis that this cluster of cases was the
result of extended malaria transmission originating from a single
infected person.
This outbreak demonstrates the potential for reintroduction of
malaria into the United States despite intensive surveillance,
vector-control activities, and local public health response to
educate clinicians and the community. Rapid recognition, accurate
diagnosis, and appropriate case management are essential for limiting
the spread of a malaria outbreak. If an outbreak has occurred,
clinicians must consider malaria in the diagnosis of any patient with
fever without apparent cause.
Prevention of mosquito bites through personal protection measures
(e.g., using insect repellent containing DEET) and vector control are
important measures to limit transmission. Risks for locally acquired
malaria are unlikely to abate given migration and travel patterns and
a global yearly malaria burden of 300-500 million cases and one
million deaths.
However, prompt reporting of patients with malaria to public health
authorities and adequate assessment of risk factors for malaria in
all cases allows initiation of an appropriate public health response
to prevent reestablishment of malaria transmission.
