This article tries to lead the reader into believing that because
there are fewer vultures to clean the cattle carcasses, there are
more dogs with rabies. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Most significantly, there is no credible data whatever showing any
increase in the dog population of India since 1992, especially
relative to the human population.

The Central Government introduced the national Animal Birth Control
program in the last days of 1997; I was present when it was ratified
by the Animal Welfare Board of India.

ABC established on a national basis the sterilization, vaccination,
and release methodology, which had already been used to abolish
animal control killing in many major cities (at least officially),
including Mumbai, Chennai, Jaipur, Kolkata, and Delhi. Bangalore,
Hyderabad, Visakhapatam, and Ahmedabad all started major ongoing ABC
programs within the next 2 years.

I believe Jack Reece published the most recent peer-reviewed study of
these programs, focusing on Jaipur. Chinny Krisha published a similar
study earlier. Both found that where ABC programs exist and have been
monitored, street dog numbers have crashed.

Most of the major ABC programs have proceeded with many bumps and
interruptions, and along the way, many noisy local politicians,
bureaucrats, headline writers, and especially people who used to have
a piece of the economic action associated with dog killing have
insisted that ABC is failing, dog numbers are up, etc.

For example, just 2 days ago, a Bangalore official insisted that the
number of street dogs in Bangalore has increased from 70 000 in 2000
to 180 000 today, but the most recent official count, completed in
June 2007, found barely more than 24 000 street dogs plus 17 000 pet
dogs, surveying 3.2 million households. Even if the count found only
half the street dogs, as is likely, the street dog population has
decreased by about 1/3rd, even as the city has nearly doubled in
human population, refuse volume, and potential habitat niches for
scavenging animals.

My own counts in many different parts of India found a ratio of up to
one street dog per 10 humans in 1997, the highest street dogs to
humans ratio I have ever found in decades of counting street dogs and
feral cats in all parts of the world. In some of the same cities, I
found a ratio of as few as one street dog per 160 humans in January
2007, after a decade of aggressive ABC work. The progress was most
obvious to me in Visakhapatnam and Chennai. Another member of the
ANIMAL PEOPLE team saw similar results in Mumbai, Delhi, and Jaipur.
The numbers of dogs considered "high" by some ABC critics today are
minute compared to the numbers that could be seen before ABC started.

Not every city has a good ABC program, and the one dog to 10 people
ratio probably still exists in many rural districts, but it does not
appear to exist any more in any city with an active ABC program.

Also of note, in January 2007, I counted dogs who had been
ear-cropped or tagged to indicate that they had been sterilized and
vaccinated in several different areas of Bangalore, following a fatal
attack on a 9-year-old girl, which, while often described as having
been inflicted by street dogs, actually appeared to have been
inflicted by an escaped 3-dog hunting pack. I found that from 70 to
90 percent of the dogs had been sterilized and vaccinated in inner
Bangalore, with the ratio dropping as one moved farther out into the
suburbs, away from the headquarters of the 3 organizations doing ABC
that I visited.

In Chennai, I saw no dogs within the city limits who had not been
sterilized and vaccinated. In Ahmedabad, the results varied widely by
neighborhood, and a test of the accuracy of my spotting method
determined that I was seeing or hearing and counting exactly 90
percent of the dogs along my route, missing only the indoor lap dogs
who did not bark at my approach to their homes.
