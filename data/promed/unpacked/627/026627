The Ministry of Health of Chubut, through the Esquel Health Program Area, reported this Tuesday [16 Aug 2022] that a new case of hantavirus [infection] was confirmed concerning a 60-year-old man, who is a resident of the rural commune of Cerro Centinela and who is currently admitted to the Esquel Zonal Hospital, with a reserved prognosis. The confirmation of this endemic event in the region was carried out by the laboratory of this Andean hospital.

In regard to this case, the representative of Health Programs of the Esquel Program Area, Emiliano Biondo, pointed out that "he is a relative of the child who died of the same disease on 13 Jul [2022] [see Hantavirus - Americas (23): Argentina (CH) 20220720.8704532], and complying with the selective respiratory isolation [protocol] for being a close contact, presented symptoms compatible with the disease and was promptly taken to the Esquel Zonal Hospital."

EQS Notas published that the official explained that following the provincial regulations for dealing with hantavirus [infections], "the epidemiology and environmental health teams of the Esquel Program Area, in coordination with the Corcovado Rural Hospital, implemented the pertinent preventive measures and alert guidelines, as well as providing the indications for isolation to the close contacts of the case."

Hantaviruses are transmitted primarily by inhalation of virus-laden aerosols from feces, urine, and/or saliva of infected rodents. Other possible routes of transmission are contact with the feces or secretions of infected mice with the conjunctival, nasal or oral mucosa, or by bite of the infected rodent. There is also evidence of airborne transmission from person to person.

Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome can present as a mild condition with a nonspecific febrile syndrome or reach the most serious manifestation with severe respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.

The initial symptoms are similar to flu: fever 38°C [100.4°F], muscle pain, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea without upper airway involvement.

Although it is difficult to specify, the incubation period fluctuates between 7 and 45 days. That is why actions to control of the focus of close contacts of a positive case are relevant, as well as preventive environmental actions, in order to avoid the appearance of secondary cases.

[There is no indication of the environmental setting where this man might have acquired his infection. The health agency's investigation may determine that and is informing the public in that locality about preventive measures for avoiding infection. Although the virus involved in the above case and the previous one is not mentioned, the most likely virus involved is Andes virus, found in western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. There is also the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, which is widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). Andes virus can also be transmitted directly between people in close physical contact, and perhaps this was the route of transmission in the above case. - Mod.TY
