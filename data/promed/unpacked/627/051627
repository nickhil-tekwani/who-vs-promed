According to a report from the National Center for Epidemiological Surveillance and Disease Control (CENAVECE, according to its Spanish initials), 326 cases of hepatitis A have been reported in Yucatan state, whereas only 190 cases were reported in 2011. In spite of this increase, there is no concern about the likelihood of epidemics.

Ms. Brenda Aracely Herrera-Chi, gastroenterology specialist at Ignacio Garcia-Tellez hospital, explained that this disease is an infection caused by a virus that affects the liver, and it generally occurs during childhood years. She also pointed out that one of the main ways for acquiring this condition is by the ingestion of foods and fluids contaminated with faeces, since some persons may have poor standards of hygiene. "Children are the most frequently affected, because of the environment of their usual activities. For example, they may play in the dirt and afterwards eat their lunch at school, and they may also go to the toilet and fail to wash their hands afterwards," she said.

Ms. Herrera-Chi commented that the figures from the National Health Survey for 2010 show that around 74 million Mexican citizens may be carriers of hepatitis A virus. She also pointed out that the infection does not lead to chronic liver damage; consequently, persons affected by hepatitis A will not develop sequels in the future, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis.

[Hepatitis A virus is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water, or through direct contact with an infectious person. Hepatitis A virus infection is associated with a lack of safe water and poor sanitation. Improved sanitation and hepatitis A vaccine are the most effective ways to combat the disease. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality. In developing countries with poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children have become infected with hepatitis A virus before the age of 10 years old. Those infected in childhood do not experience any noticeable symptoms. Epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in such communities are low, and outbreaks are rare.

Yucatan is one of the 31 states which, with the Federal District, comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 106 municipalities, and its capital city is Merida. It is located in southeastern Mexico on the northern part of the Yucatan Peninsula. The population is approaching 2 million according to the 2011 survey.

The interactive ProMED/HealthMap of Yucatan can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/3yzA.

The population of Mexico is about 113 million, and according to the above report, about 74 million people in Mexico are hepatitis A virus carriers, i.e. showing evidence of prior infection. Consequently, the large number of children in Yucatan experiencing hepatitis A virus infection is hardly surprising. - Mod.CP]
