Communicable Disease Threats report (CDTR) -- week 44 [29 Oct - 4 Nov 2017]
Chikungunya - Europe - 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Since August 2017, both France and Italy have reported autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus. In France, the Var department [Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region] is affected while in Italy, the Lazio and Calabria regions reported autochthonous transmission. The 2 events involve strains of different origin and are therefore not related.

Update of the week
As of 27 Oct 2017, the Ministry of Health in Italy reports 331 cases in Lazio region, 176 of which are confirmed. Guardavalle marina, Calabria region, reports 63 cases 45 of which are confirmed. The latest date of onset in the Lazio region was [17 Oct 2017] while in the Calabria region the latest date of onset was [9 Oct 2017]. In addition, the Emilia-Romagna region reports one probable case. The case has a travel history to Rome.

Since the previous CDTR and as of 3 Nov 2017, France has not reported any additional chikungunya cases.

[This report brings the total number of chikungunya virus infection cases in Italy from 358 cases as of 20 Oct 2017 to 402 on 27 Oct 2017. These cases appear to have been acquired in the same localities previously reported, indicating ongoing transmission. It will not be surprising if more cases occur in these places until the onset of colder weather halts mosquito activity. It is good to learn that there are no new cases in France.
