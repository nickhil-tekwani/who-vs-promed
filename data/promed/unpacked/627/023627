Bird flu resurfaces in northeast India
--------------------------------------
Authorities in a remote northeastern state of India prepared to cull
thousands of chickens after a fresh outbreak of bird flu in poultry
was detected on Tuesday [22 Apr 2008], officials said.

More than 25 000 chickens and ducks have already been slaughtered in
Tripura state this month [April 2008] after 8 villages were hit by
the H5N1 strain.

On Tuesday [22 Apr 2008], officials said bird flu had spread to a new
area. "Bird flu has been confirmed for the 2nd time in Tripura,"
Kartick Debbarma, a senior animal resources official said in
Agartala, Tripura's capital. "It is the H5N1 strain."

The remote northeastern state borders Bangladesh, where more than
half the country's districts have been affected by the virus.

In India, the virus resurfaced in the eastern state of West Bengal in
January this year [2008], forcing authorities to cull more than 4
million birds.

Since then the virus has flared up intermittently, hitting poultry
sales in the region. Many states banned poultry products, pulling
down prices sharply and prompting farmers to cut production.

The World Health Organization (WHO) described the January [2008]
outbreak in West Bengal as the worst ever in India.

Officials in Tripura said they were holding meetings and drawing up
their strategy to contain the disease, which has hit Mohanpur, a town
just 20 km (12 miles) west of Agartala [see map at

Health department officials were also checking humans for any
flu-like symptoms.
