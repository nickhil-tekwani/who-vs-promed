3000 hectares [7413 acres] of plantains affected by black sigatoka
------------------------------------------------------------------
The disease known as Black Sigatoka affected 3000 hectares of plantain plantations, causing the loss of 1000 tonnes, which entails huge financial losses, according to a plantain producer from Ejido [area of communal land used for agriculture] San Bartolo [in the municipality of San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec, Oaxaca].

He pointed out that federal and state governments are not giving support to the sector, especially in this area, which is one of the world's largest plantain producers.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ which affects only species and hybrids of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of bananas, with yield losses of 50 percent or more. It is present in the Americas, China, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. Infection occurs on the youngest leaves of the plant; older leaves are not readily infected.

BS seriously affects photosynthetic ability, and fruit can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment causing further losses. It is spread by water, wind and contaminated materials including suckers for planting. Disease management includes frequent applications of fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, and cultural practices, but the high costs of these measures make them essentially unavailable to smallholder farmers. Use of agrochemicals may also cause problems for fruit export, for example to Europe.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS) with similar symptoms. YS causes less damage because symptoms appear mainly on older leaves. There are more crop cultivars with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS.

BS (and also YS) continue to spread in the Americas and Caribbean and are causing serious crop losses in the region. Resistance breeding programmes have been established in the region.
