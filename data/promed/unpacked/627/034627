Egypt's Health Ministry reported on Monday [14 Dec 2009] 3 more deaths from
pandemic (H1N1) 29009 virus infection, or swine flu, bringing the death
toll in the country to 59. Health officials are worried that the winter
months could bring a higher number of infections and deaths due to the cold.

The Ministry said a 42 year old man died of the virus in Beheira, 100 miles
[160 km] north of Cairo, adding that the man suffered from severe dyspnea
and cirrhosis. Ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahine said a 48 year old
woman also died of the virus in Beni Suef, 90 miles [145 km] south of the
Egyptian capital, adding that she had suffered from pneumonia and dyspnea.
The 3rd case reported was of a 27 year old pregnant woman from Minya, 175
miles [280 km] south of Cairo. Since the virus first appeared in Egypt last
June [2009], the country has reported more than 4700 cases.

Amr Kandil, under secretary of the Ministry of Health for Preventive
Affairs, stressed that the virus has not mutated and said that the high
rate of infection per day is not indicative of a mutation. However, Awad
Mahgour, director of Communicable Diseases at the World Health Organization
stressed that the virus has already mutated in a number of countries, "but
slowly and in a restricted context." [Presumably the WHO spokesman is
referring to the sporadic appearance of oseltamivir-resistant virus. - Mod.CP]

Meanwhile, WHO announced the results of their research, which ended last
Friday evening [11 Dec 2009], confirming that there is no clear evidence
that the anti-viral drug Tamiflu prevents complications of diseases, such
as the seasonal flu or pneumonia, among the infected. WHO said in a
statement that it is still recommending the use of Tamiflu in the treatment
of those "separately infected with swine influenza, or who continue to have
symptoms for 3 days, or if their health had deteriorated."

The global health organization [WHO] added that persons in good health, but
infected with swine flu, do not need Tamiflu, since the vast majority of
swine flu patients have recovered without any kind of medical care.

Grave concern is spreading in the Gaza Strip over swine flu [influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] with 10 deaths recorded so far and
another 20 people diagnosed as having the disease, while there may be
hundreds of suspect cases. The Palestinian Civilian Committee is
considering transferring some patients to Israeli hospitals.

Gaza residents have been trying to come up with their own initiatives. One
resident in an affluent neighborhood of Gaza City is keeping his son home
from school, as the schools are seen as incubators of the disease. He told
Haaretz there were hardly any vaccines in the Strip, and most certainly not
enough for the entire population.

Gaza was largely spared the swine flu pandemic, in part because of its
isolation. However, now that the virus has arrived, the high population
density and the poor hygiene common in Gaza's poorest areas could mean it
will spread rapidly.

A Gaza resident said those who can afford it buy vaccine on the black
market for as much as USD 50 a shot. Gazans believe anise helps to cure the
flu, and the herb's price has skyrocketed from NIS [Israeli shekel] 18 [USD
4.75] a kilo a month ago to as much as NIS 80.

On Sunday [13 Dec 2009] 2 more people died of swine flu [influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection] in the besieged Gaza Strip, bringing to 10 the
total number of Gazans who have been killed by the disease, according to
the Hamas-run health ministry. "2 more cases died today [13 Dec 2009] , a
25 year old woman and a 35 year old man, bringing the total number of
deaths from A (H1N1) to 10," said Hassan Khalaf, a ministry spokesman. He
added that another 67 people have been stricken with the disease, including
"a number of serious cases."

Gaza, which has been under strict Israeli closure since the Islamist Hamas
movement seized power in June 2007, was among the last places in the world
to see cases of the virus, the 1st of which were reported a week ago. The
ministry has demanded 300 000 [doses of] vaccine for the impoverished
territory of 1.5 million people, including some 13 000 [doses] for
government and public and private health workers.

Israel has already allowed in 10 000 doses of swine flu vaccine. Israel
said last week [week of 6 Dec] it will allow in 30 000 to 40 000 more
vaccines supplied by WHO, but the transfer has not yet taken place,
according to a military spokeswoman.

The Hamas-run government has meanwhile started examining foreigners
entering the territory through the Erez crossing with Israel for signs of
the disease, including by taking their temperature.

[The closure of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli authorities and the
activities of the Hamas government police have failed to prevent the spread
of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection into Gaza City and the Gaza territory.
