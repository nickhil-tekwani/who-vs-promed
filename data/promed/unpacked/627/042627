A number of residents and livestock keepers in Bouira province, especially in areas where a brucellosis focus was discovered in the past few days, namely Taghzout and Al Hachimia municipalities, expressed their growing concern when 3 new cases were registered yesterday [Fri 7 Aug 2015], according to reliable sources.

The number of brucellosis cases reached 14 in less than a week, and the disease is threatening to expand among people who have consumed contaminated milk or dairy products according to the president of the association of farmers and breeders of the municipality of Taghzout, Rashid Ayad.

Ayad told Echorouk that his association fears the worst and that agricultural services bear part of the responsibility because vaccination of cattle against brucellosis, which was implemented on a regular basis every 6 months up until 2011, is presently neglected by many public veterinarians. He added that the results obtained on samples taken from his cows and sent to the diagnostic laboratory located in the municipality of Draa Benkhadda, Tizi Ouzou province, took more than 20 days to be released and finally showed that 1 of his cows was infected and had to be culled immediately. He expressed his astonishment regarding this delay as such results used to reach owners within only 3 or 4 days in the past. He minimized the importance of the loss of his cow, and stressed the impact of such disease on public health and the wellbeing of citizens.

It should be noted that 7 brucellosis cases were registered a few days ago following the consumption of contaminated milk. A 2nd disease cluster resulted in the affection of 4 additional persons on [Wed 5 Aug 2015] and a 3rd appeared on [Thu 6 Aug 2015] in 3 patients, according to official figures.

Agricultural and health services sent a team to monitor the situation and prevent new cases; however, they seem to be acting with a rather slow pace. This is the reason why people are still expressing concern and calling for the need to move quickly in order to contain the brucellosis outbreak in livestock and provide effective treatment to humans affected with the disease.

[Maps of Algeria can be seen http://www.mapsofworld.com/algeria/maps/algeria-political-map.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3569017,12690. The province of Bouira is located in the Kabylie region, south east of Algiers. It is divided in 12 districts totaling 45 municipalities (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilaya_de_Bouira; in French).

Livestock rearing is widespread in the rural areas of the province, and consumption of raw milk and cheese made from it is not uncommon.

In this province and in other Algerian provinces, abortion storms do occur in both cattle and small ruminants; they often lead to a significant number of human brucellosis cases, requiring prompt and efficient therapy.

It seems that the efficiency of veterinary services has decreased recently, hence the appearance of the reported high number of brucellosis cases in humans. - Mod.AB

It is striking to note that no postings on brucellosis in Algeria have been published by ProMED-mail since 2004, in spite of the serious zoonotic implications of the disease, endemic in Algeria and in the Maghreb, the Eastern Mediterranean, throughout the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and beyond. No reports on brucellosis have been received from the other Maghreb countries, Morocco and Tunisia, since the inauguration of ProMED-mail in 1995. This worldwide underreporting was addressed recently by OIE's director general, who stated, in his preface to Ref 1: "The study of zoonotic brucellosis served as a basis for some of the great early advances in epidemiology, yet the disease remains the most common chronic bacterial infection in the world. It continues to cause important medical, veterinary, socioeconomic, and conservation problems, mainly because its overall burden remains underestimated and often neglected."

A recent example illuminating the accuracy and actuality of the said statement has been provided by the recent Bulgarian _Brucella melitensis_ outbreak. According to a media report dated 7 Aug 2015, multiple holdings have already become known as infected in the municipality of Rila. Bulgaria's main concern, in relation to the recently discovered human brucellosis cases, is the undetected spread of the agent in animals, with humans becoming the unfortunate sentinels instead of the vector animals. This is underlined by the large number (18) of separate holdings already detected as infected. Human cases started to appear in Bulgaria since 2012. Bulgaria, where the last case of _B. melitensis_ in small ruminants was reported in 2009, has become an infected country and is expected to report the recent outbreak in goats to the OIE, as prescribed by the International Animal Health Code. Hopefully, the report will include available information on the origin of the outbreaks in Rila (see http://www.focus-fen.net/news/2015/08/07/379969/19-people-owners-of-brucellosis-infected-goats-in-bulgarias-rila.html).
