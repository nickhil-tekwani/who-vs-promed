Re ProMED COVID-19 update (461): animal, Sweden, mink, 1st report, RFI 20201030.7903582
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to your posting's request for information, I would like to inform you that the following report was sent to the OIE on 29 Oct 2020.

"Sweden has confirmed the 1st case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in mink at a farm in the southeast part of the country, in the County of Blekinge. In this area, approximately 20 of Sweden's 40 mink farms are situated. The affected farm has approximately 9500 minks for fur production.

"Dead minks from the farm were collected and sampled with swabs from the oral cavity and pharynx and analysed with real-time PCR, as part of a recently initiated surveillance based on animals found dead. One out of 3 minks fell out weakly positive on Fri 16 Oct 2020. Organs from the same animals were also analysed with real-time PCR of which all were negative. Another 5 dead minks were therefore collected and sampled and analysed in the same way of which all tests fell out positive late Friday evening, 23 Oct 2020. A slight increase in mortality could be observed during the same period, but no other clinical signs of disease.

"The source of the infection has not been determined yet. Notably, however, the owner of the farm and his father have been tested for COVID-19 and the test results were reported positive on Wed 21 Oct 2020. Further analyses are ongoing in order to assess any association between the virus strains detected in samples from mink and those detected in samples from the people at the farm.

"Movement restrictions and biosecurity measures are in place. We do not intend to cull the animals at this point. The surveillance of mink farms in Sweden is ongoing.

"This information is transmitted to the OIE in the context of Article 1.1.6 in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code in order to provide the relevant information arising from field observations to enable the OIE to have more clarity on which animal species are susceptible to infection and may potentially be involved in the epidemiology of the human disease."

[We are highly indebted to Dr Stahl for immediately responding to our RFI, submitting the 1st-hand report above.

The letter from Sweden's veterinary authorities (CVO, Swedish Board of Agriculture, Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation) to the OIE reproduced above is available on OIE's website at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/Sweden_Update_1_29.10.2020.pdf.

According to an earlier media report (see archive 20201030.7903582), the event is located in the municipality of Solvesborg in Blekinge County.

Sweden has become the 5th country, worldwide, reporting COVID-19 in mink to the OIE. The other 4 are the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, and USA.

ProMED-mail's request for information on the factual situation in Italy, from where informal information on detected positive tests in farmed minks was published (20201028.7897986), is pending.

Minks are farmed in many other countries; China is considered to be the largest fur producer and consumer. - Mod.AS
