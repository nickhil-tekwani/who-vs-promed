Three more cases of chronic wasting disease [CWD] have been found in Mississippi deer, bringing the total to 9.

The Clarion Ledger reports the state Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks Wildlife Bureau says one confirmed case was in Benton County, and 2 were in Marshall County. Department executive director Russ Walsh says this is Benton County's 1st case. The fatal neurological disease is contagious and causes deer to lose weight and have movement problems.

It is present in 25 other states, including Tennessee. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency announced Wednesday [23 Jan 2019] that the total number of confirmed disease cases in Fayette and Hardeman counties, which border Mississippi, has risen to 91. Those counties had confirmed 24 cases by mid-January 2019.

The 1st case in Mississippi was found last year [2018] in Issaquena County.

[Many of the positive deer locations in Mississippi are very near the border with Tennessee. Tennessee has CWD, so it is not surprising that surveillance picked it up in Mississippi. However, there is another county now with CWD, so the disease may be spreading in Mississippi, similar to what is observed in other states with CWD. - Mod.TG
