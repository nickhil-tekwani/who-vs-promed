[1] China: Rabies control in Beijing

More than 100 000 stray dogs roaming the city of Beijing are increasing the
risk of a rabies epidemic. Officials of the Agricultural and Domestic
Animal Bureau in Beijing say that they cannot guarantee how many of the 100
000 stray dogs within the metropolitan area have all been properly
vaccinated, so Beijing is under a threat of a potential rabies epidemic.
According to statistics compiled from the beginning of this year [2006],
more than 60 000 people have been bitten by cats or dogs in Beijing. One
person was bitten by a rabid dog in the outskirts of Beijing and died
shortly without seeking medical treatment. The Beijing municipal government
has not yet introduced any effective measures to deal with stray dogs or to
initiate any public awareness campaign to reduce the risk of a rabies epidemic.
Last week [7-13 Aug 2006], 16 human deaths from rabies were recorded in the
province of Shandong. In response to this situation, the provincial
authorities carried out the destruction of more than 500 000 dogs, an event
that attracted [unfavorable] global media attention.
Recently in Yunan province, 3 people died as a result of rabies contracted
by dog bites. Similarly, in this province, the local authorities responded
with the violent destruction of approximately 50 000 dogs.
According to statistics issued from non-governmental organizations, in
Beijing alone, there are around 100 000 stray dogs and 500 000 feral cats.

[2] China - Fatal human cases in Shanghai

Three people die of rabies in Shanghai
-----------------------------------------
Rabies in Shanghai has a tendency to recur, because local residents who
keep pets are unwilling to have them vaccinated. Three fatal cases of human
rabies have been reported so far this year [2006]. The Shanghai Health
Bureau will issue a public warning today [24 Aug 2006] to inform citizens
of the prevalence of rabies in the canine population. People who are bitten
by a dog (stray or pet) should seek treatment immediately. Stray dogs with
no valid permit of ownership will be destroyed without exception.
The Shanghai Health Bureau points out that the number of urban dogs and
cats has risen sharply in recent years. Some owners of these pets do not
comply with regulations for pet ownership and do not have their pets
vaccinated properly. Such negligence has allowed rabies to reemerge after
several years of absence, and the situation is now dangerous.
According to official statistics for Shanghai, in the 1st half of this year
[2006], there have been more than 45 000 persons reportedly bitten by
household pets, an increase of 40 percent in comparison to the tally for
the previous year [2005]. Among them, 16 000 are classified as serious. In
particular, the districts of Fengxian, Nanhui, Songjiang, Minsing, Jinshan,
and similar localities which lie between urban and rural districts of
Shanghai, are suspected of having more than 10 cases of [canine?] rabies.
The 3 fatal cases of rabies were recorded in the Jinshan, Nanhui and
Minsing Districts. The Jinshan case was caused by the victim's own dog as a
result of a bite sustained at the beginning of this month [August 2006].
The fatal outcome was a consequence of delayed [post exposure] medical
treatment. The other 2 fatal cases involved 2 migrants not native to
Shanghai who succumbed to rabies also due to delayed [post exposure] treatment.
The rabies-affected areas are newly developed communities. The number of
stray animals in these districts is greater than in established
cosmopolitan regions of Shanghai city. A typical feature of these districts
is that they have large migrant populations, made up of people from other
provinces as well as businessmen and their families from Taiwan.
The Bureau reminds residents that rabies is almost 100 percent fatal if
post exposure treatment is delayed The public awareness campaign also
requires all pet owners to have their pets vaccinated in a timely manner.
The Shanghai Public Security Unit will rigorously enforce compulsory
licensing of all pets, especially dogs and cats. All qualified pet owners
must apply for dog licenses from the Public Security Office and bring their
pets to the designated places for vaccination regularly. Any violators will
be fined 200 to 1000 yuan [USD 25 to 125].
