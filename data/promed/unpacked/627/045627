Nine cases of anthrax in humans have been confirmed in southern Kyrgyzstan,
and some 30 patients are suspected of having contracted the disease.

"As of yesterday [14 Jul 2008], we have 9 confirmed cases of anthrax, and
34 people have been hospitalised with suspected cases. All of the cases are
the cutaneous [skin] form," Jalalidin Gaibulin, head of the National Centre
for Quarantine and Especially Dangerous Infections, told IRIN from the
Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek on 15 Jul 2008. All the cases were registered in
southern Kyrgyzstan, in Jalal-Abad and Osh provinces.

"Confirmed cases are receiving treatment, and suspected cases are
undergoing diagnostic procedures and are under constant surveillance. So
the situation is under control," Gaibulin said.

One of the 9 confirmed cases, a 78 year old man, died on 10 Jul 2008.
"After he and his son slaughtered an infected animal, the man got sick and
had been staying at his place for several days unaware of the seriousness
of his condition. He went to hospital only on 9 Jul 2008, but it was too
late, as the disease had already progressed," Gaibulin said.

Kyrgyzstan's Health Ministry said in a statement on its website
<http://www.med.kg/News/2008/7/11.shtml#809> last week that all cases were
related to the slaughtering of cattle without prior veterinary examination.
The main factor leading to the disease is the natural occurrence of anthrax
in the soil, it said.

"Humans contract anthrax via contact with infected animals or their
carcasses, and the cattle get infected while grazing in places where
infected animals had either died or been buried, or where the anthrax virus
is still in the soil," Gaibulin explained.

There were 23 confirmed cases of anthrax in Kyrgyzstan in 2007, all of them
in the south. No casualties were reported last year [2007], according to
Gaibulin.

Preventing outbreaks not easy: preventing anthrax is complex, involving
health facilities, veterinary bodies, local authorities and communities
themselves, the health official said. "It is a multi-faceted issue, and all
parties involved should act together. For instance, villagers [try] to
minimise their losses whenever their animals fall sick, so what they do is
slaughter them, sell or distribute the meat without proper veterinary
examination, and end up with various animal-borne diseases like anthrax,
brucellosis, etc," Gaibulin said, adding that awareness-raising activities
among the population were needed.

Every year, health workers vaccinate "at risk groups" -- people in contact
with cattle, like herders and butchers -- against various infections,
according to the Health Ministry. Meanwhile, veterinary workers are
currently vaccinating cattle in areas where anthrax cases have been reported.

[Biologically, the prevention of livestock anthrax could not be easier:
Annual vaccination and proper carcass management when cases occur.
Unfortunately, where rural communication is deficient and the veterinary
presence light, the social aspects of disease control take charge, and any
weaknesses result in what we see here in Central Asia. And, as with
previous Kyrgyz outbreaks, they are associated with the slaughter and
butchering of sick cattle. This report confirms what we had suspected
earlier about there being multiple outbreaks in Osh and Jalalabad and firms
up the numbers of people affected. See the following report. The case of
the 78 year old man reinforces the necessary advice that cutaneous anthrax
cases should not be ignored, especially by elderly people, but treated
early and promptly with antibiotics, when a cure is assured. - Mod.MHJ]
