A tea bug, _Helopeltis_, is causing havoc in the tea gardens of Upper
Assam, with the industry staring at not less than 20 percent loss in
produce this season. "I have never seen such devastation in my
10-year career in tea," said a manager of a Jorhat-based garden,
adding that the curse had turned into an epidemic.

A senior scientist at Tocklai Experimental Station in Jorhat said the
bug migrated from the West Bengal Dooars and Nagrakata regions in the
late 90s but because of congenial weather conditions, it multiplied
several folds this season [2008] proving fatal for the tea crop. High
temperature and heavy rainfall are ideal conditions for the bug to
multiply. The bug, also known as tea mosquito, sucks out the juice
from the tea plants leaving their leaves almost useless and has
become one of the biggest threats to the gardens.

B. Borthakur of Tocklai said it was not only the _Helopeltis_ but
also the bacterial black spot, a disease of the tea plant, which has
become a cause of concern. "Both _Helopeltis_ and the bacterial black
spot cause similar damage to the plant and the 2-pronged attack has
compounded the problem. The bug has also become resistant to some of
the chemicals over the years." Tocklai, he said, has initiated
several measures in recent times under the integrated pest management
programme to control the pest. "The gardens which have been following
Tocklai guidelines to control the pest are likely to suffer less."

The _Helopeltis_ attack on the tea crop in the Upper Assam gardens,
the hub of the tea industry in the state, has come at a time when the
industry is targeting a record production of 500 million tonnes this
year [2008].

[The term 'bacterial black spot' used above may refer to bacterial
canker of tea caused by _Xanthomonas theicola_ (synonym _X.
campestris_ pv. _theicola_). The genus consists of species and
strains specialising in different crop hosts. The pathogens may
affect leaves, fruit, branches, and stems causing crop losses. They
mostly enter their hosts via wounds, which can be caused, for
example, by insects or human activity. In the outbreak above, the
mirid bug _Helopeltis antonii_ is apparently thought responsible for
spreading the bacterial pathogens. Besides tea, the insect also
attacks other crops including cocoa, cashew, avocado, mango, guava,
passion fruit, and sweet potato.
