In recent weeks, _Cucumber aphid-borne yellows virus_ (CABYV) has affected increasing numbers of cucumber growers throughout the Netherlands. They are surprised at the speed of spread of the virus in glasshouse cultivation during June 2021. The reason is considered to be the aphid vectors, which are difficult to control with currently available agrochemicals.

Incidence varies between glasshouses, from a few affected plants to up to 10% of the crop. According to reports from Germany, a yield loss of up to 50% may result.

All current cucumber cultivars are susceptible to CABYV. Cucurbits grown in private gardens provide virus reservoirs. Some commercial growers are trialling insect screens to protect their glasshouses from aphids. Genetic host resistances have been identified but are not available in commercial cucumber varieties so far.

Overall, aphid-borne viruses of cucumbers have been observed regularly in the past years in the country, including also _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (genus _Cucumovirus_) and _Zucchini yellow mosaic virus_ (genus _Potyvirus_).

[_Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus_ (CABYV; genus _Polerovirus_, Luteoviridae) affects primarily cucurbit crops (such as cucumber, zucchini, melons, pumpkins, squashes), but has also been reported from lettuce, beet, and some legumes (chickpea, broad bean). Symptoms may be confused with nutritional problems and vary with crops, cultivars, and environmental conditions. They may include interveinal yellowing, thickening and brittleness of leaves, complete yellowing of whole plants, and loss of plant vigour leading to reduced flowering and fruit production. Yield losses of up to 50% for cucumbers and 15% for melons have been reported.

The virus resides in phloem tissue and can be spread by several aphid species in a persistent manner. Different aphid species vary in their efficiency of CABYV transmission, with _Aphis gossypii_ being one of the most efficient. Infectious insects can be spread with plant material or carried on air currents for long distances. The virus cannot be transmitted mechanically or by seed. Weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management of aphid-transmitted viruses is difficult and may include vector control, removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitation, cultural measures (such as barrier plantings), and use of resistant crop cultivars, if available.

A novel severe strain of CABYV has recently been identified in Spain in watermelon and squash (see link below). In watermelon, yellowing symptoms were much enhanced and often accompanied by considerable fruit abortion.

The currently known luteoviruses are mostly important crop pathogens and include _Potato leafroll virus_, _Turnip yellows virus_, _Maize yellow mosaic virus_, and several barley yellow dwarf viruses (see previous ProMED posts in the archives).
