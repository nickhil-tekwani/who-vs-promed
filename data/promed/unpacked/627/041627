VIRAL OUTBREAK CLAIMS 3 MORE LIVES
[Excerpts
Taipei, July 7 (CNA) A killer intestinal virus outbreak has claimed the
lives of three more children in Taiwan. The Department of Health (DOH)
reported the new fatalities simultaneously on Tuesday.
According to hospital reports, the three victims, all younger than two,
showed symptoms of enterovirus infections early this month and died in 24
hours after being hospitalized.
One of the fatalities was reported by the Provincial Taoyuan Hospital in
northern Taiwan, another by the Chiayi Christian Hospital in southern
Taiwan and the other by the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in the southern
city of Kaohsiung.
Despite the report of new fatalities, the DOH said the total death toll
from the epidemic stands at 52, not 60 as previously calculated.
Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease
Control, said the decrease in the death toll tally was because of the
deletion of eight fatal cases in which the victims had not shown the
symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease typically seen in those who were
infected by enterovirus. (By Sofia Wu)

[We need to beware of circular reasoning here. If fatal cases are being
discounted because they do not fit the picture of those associated with
HFMD or EV-71, then of course the epidemic will be ascribed to HFMD or
EV-71. But what did the other 8 cases die of, and why were they at first
thought to be part of the same outbreak? - Mod.JW
