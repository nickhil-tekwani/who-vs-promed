A measles outbreak in Romania has been ongoing since February 2016 and cases continue to be reported despite ongoing response measures that have been implemented at national level through reinforced vaccination activities, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). From September 2016 to 17 Mar 2017, Romania has reported 3799 cases.

In Italy, about 700 cases reported so far this year [2017], in Germany more than 200 cases and in Belgium more than 100 cases. Dozens of cases have also been reported from France, Spain, Hungary and Austria. In some countries, the spread of infection has occurred among health care workers.

Measles is caused by a virus belonging to the paramyxovirus [family]. The disease is one of the most infectious diseases that exists. Measles virus excreted by breathing the air and spread through air droplets (aerosols). Susceptible people infected via the respiratory tract or mucous membranes of the eyes.

The incubation period is 7-18 days, usually about 10 days. At the onset, measles is acute with rapidly rising fever, eye irritation and increasingly troublesome dry cough. After a day occurs a red and often confluent rash that usually is only seen in the face and then spreads down the trunk and extremities. Other early symptoms of measles are small white spots on the buccal mucosa (Koplik's spots).

Complications are quite common. Toddlers often suffer from respiratory problems and the infected mucous membranes may become secondarily infected with bacteria. Children can then have, for example, otitis media, sinusitis or pneumonia, which often requires antibiotic treatment. Measles virus is also capable of causing pneumonia in itself.

A "major outbreak" of measles is hitting the encircled, rebel-controlled Damascus suburbs of East Ghouta, with doctors telling Syria Direct that vaccine shortages are to blame for more than 350 cases of the easily preventable disease in less than 2 months.

With up to 80 percent of children unvaccinated inside the 450 000-person opposition pocket, measles is making an alarming resurgence where such incidences were once "very rare" before the war, Amani, a pediatrician at the Kafr Batna hospital who asked to be referred to only by her 1st name, told Syria Direct. Doctors began seeing patients with the disease as recently as late December [2016], she said. "By the beginning of February [2017], it became an outbreak," Amani said. Doctors across East Ghouta now tally more than 350 confirmed diagnoses of the disease, with new cases emerging on a daily basis.

Measles is a viral disease that disproportionately affects young children, often with a fever, rash and potentially lethal complications that can be prevented by immunization. Vaccines, however, have either been slow or entirely unable to reach East Ghouta amidst the Assad regime's ongoing blockade and bombardment of the rebel-held territory, 2 km [approx 1.24 mi] east of Damascus. The encirclement, coupled with densely crowded living conditions due to mass internal displacement, are turning the 100 sq. km [approx. 38.6 sq mi] suburbs into a breeding ground for the highly contagious infection.

As a result, hundreds of East Ghouta children now suffer from dangerously high fevers, severe respiratory issues and, in at least 2 instances, death.

Even when the Syrian Arab Red Crescent delivered scores of vaccines to East Ghouta on [9 Mar 2017] -the first such shipment in months- doctors said the amount was "hardly enough" to treat the area's unvaccinated population.

Dr. Amani describes the local hospital as "packed with children" waiting to receive 1 of the limited vaccines, which are often given on a 1st-come, 1st-serve basis. "Inevitably, not all of the children will get the vaccine...what we have just isn't enough," she said.

At least 2 people have died of measles-related complications since the start of the outbreak, including a 23-year-old woman in Kafr Batna and an 8-year-old girl in the town of Hamouriyah, 2km [approx 1.24 mi] northeast, earlier this month [March 2017].

Children who are already symptomatic cannot be given a vaccine, and antiviral treatment does not currently exist for the disease. This means that doctors can only resort to palliative measures such as painkillers, antipyretics and IV fluids to ensure that the condition of patients, such 2-year-old MN, does not worsen. MN spent more than 15 days in the Kafr Batna hospital with upper respiratory problems, a rash characteristic of measles, and severe conjunctivitis. His condition deteriorated to such an extent that he was unable to open his eyes for 2 days, his mother, UM, told Syria Direct. "I was incredibly worried for my child's life," she said. "Even though he's doing relatively better now, I don't deny that I'm still afraid, both for his health and afraid that he may infect another child," said UM. Families with multiple, unvaccinated children living in 1 room such as UM's often see more than 1 child contract the virus.

In patients with access to quality health care, measles can be managed. But for populations with malnutrition and inadequate health care, "mortality can be as high as 10 percent," the France-based Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM) reported earlier this month [March 2017]. Children affected by measles within East Ghouta face an added risk of serious health complications given the dire food and medical shortages resulting from the opposition-held area's 5-year encirclement.

Fears of measles-related complications stemming from severe malnutrition drastically increased last month [February 2017] after regime forces launched a campaign to cut East Ghouta's vital food and medical supply routes via underground tunnels, Syria Direct reported. The ongoing campaign is largely stalemated with little ground changing hands but has claimed dozens of lives.

While disproportionately affecting the young, "it's important to note that measles does not just affect children," said Dr. Ahmed al-Baqai, the director of the Save a Soul center, East Ghouta's only medical center specialized in infectious diseases and epidemics, which is in Kafr Batna. "There are confirmed cases even with people over the age of 40," he added.

The United Nations has been unable to transport vaccines to encircled towns within East Ghouta for several months because of "fighting in the area, on the road, in addition to road closures due to security issues, lack of administrative permissions and facilitations and/or agreement between parties to the conflict," Linda Tom, a spokeswoman with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), told Syria Direct from Damascus.

With doctors recording new cases of measles every day, "time is running out for the people of East Ghouta," Elizabeth Hoff, the World Health Organization (WHO) Representative in Syria, said in a press statement on [Mon 27 Mar 2017]. "As health needs increase, available resources are being depleted day by day."

Measles is one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable deaths, with more than 134 200 deaths attributed worldwide to the disease in 2015, the World Health Organization reported in November [2016]. That figure is down from an estimated 2.6 million annual measles-related deaths prior to widespread vaccination campaigns beginning in 1980.

The World Health Organisation is working towards a measles free Europe in 2 years. The World Health Organisation has issued a measles warning for Europe as outbreaks of the illness rise. In January of this year [2017], over 500 cases of measles were reported in the European region.

There is the potential to cause large outbreaks wherever immunization coverage has dropped below the necessary threshold of 95 percent.

In Ireland in the period from February 2016 to January 2017, 45 cases of the measles were recorded. This gives Ireland an incidence rate of 9.5 people in every million getting the illness. This happens to be the 5th highest incidence rate in Europe behind Belgium, Tajikistan, Italy and Romania where it is particularly endemic.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause potentially serious illness.

As measles remains endemic in most parts of the world, it can spread to any country, including those that have eliminated the disease. Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe said: "With steady progress towards elimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that measles cases are climbing in Europe. Today's travel patterns put no person or country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will continue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the level of immunization needed to fully protect their populations."

The largest current measles outbreaks in Europe are taking place in Romania and Italy. Italy has seen a sharp rise in cases in the first weeks of 2017. So far 238 cases have been reported for January 2017 and preliminary information indicating at least as many cases for February [2017], the total number of cases reported for 2016, approximately 850, may soon be surpassed.

Romania is the worst hit country and has reported over 3400 cases and 17 deaths since January 2016. [See [1] above. - Mod.LK]. The majority of cases are concentrated in areas where immunization coverage is especially low.

Dr Jakab added: "I urge all endemic countries to take urgent measures to stop transmission of measles within their borders, and all countries that have already achieved this to keep up their guard and sustain high immunization coverage. Together we must make sure that the hard-earned progress made towards regional elimination is not lost."

Measles outbreaks across Europe threaten progress towards elimination
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Over 500 measles cases were reported for January 2017 in the WHO European Region. Measles continues to spread within and among European countries, with the potential to cause large outbreaks wherever immunization coverage has dropped below the necessary threshold of 95 percent.

"With steady progress towards elimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that measles cases are climbing in Europe," says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. "Today's travel patterns put no person or country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will continue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the level of immunization needed to fully protect their populations."

Two-thirds of the Region's 53 countries have interrupted endemic transmission of measles; however, 14 remain endemic, according to the Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC).

Unchecked transmission threatens progress
-----------------------------------------
As many as 559 measles cases were reported in the Region for January 2017. Of these, 474 cases were reported in 7 of the 14 endemic countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Switzerland and Ukraine). Preliminary information for February [2017] indicates that the number of new infections is sharply rising. In all of these countries, estimated national immunization coverage with the 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine is less than the 95 percent threshold.

"I urge all endemic countries to take urgent measures to stop transmission of measles within their borders, and all countries that have already achieved this to keep up their guard and sustain high immunization coverage. Together we must make sure that the hard-earned progress made towards regional elimination is not lost," continues Dr Jakab.

Current major outbreaks
-----------------------
The largest current measles outbreaks in Europe are taking place in Romania and Italy.

Romania has reported over 3400 cases and 17 deaths since January 2016 (as of 10 Mar 2017). The majority of cases are concentrated in areas where immunization coverage is especially low. According to reported data, the 3 measles genotypes circulating in Romania since January 2016 were not spreading in the country before, but were reported in several other European countries and elsewhere in 2015. Comprehensive laboratory and epidemiological data are needed before the origin of infection and routes of transmission can be concluded.

Italy has seen a sharp rise in cases in the first weeks of 2017. With 238 cases reported so far for January 2017 and preliminary information indicating at least as many cases for February [2017], the total number of cases reported for 2016 (approximately 850) may soon be surpassed.

Countries at highest risk
-------------------------
Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause potentially serious illness. As measles remains endemic in most parts of the world, it can spread to any country, including those that have eliminated the disease. Every un- or under-immunized person regardless of age is therefore at risk of contracting the disease; this is especially true in those countries where persistently low immunization rates increase the risk of a large outbreak with possible tragic consequences. National authorities should maximize their efforts to achieve and/or sustain at least 95 percent coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine to prevent circulation in the event of an importation.

The WHO Regional Office for Europe is working closely with the national health authorities of countries at risk and in the midst of large measles outbreaks to plan and implement appropriate response measures. These include enhancing surveillance and identifying and immunizing those at heightened risk of infection, especially susceptible persons who may be or come in contact with infected persons, as well as engaging communities to encourage vaccination for all those who need it.

Measles and rubella elimination in Europe
-----------------------------------------
In adopting the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020, all 53 Member States of the Region committed to eliminating measles and rubella as one of the Region's priority immunization goals.

Progress towards this goal was confirmed at the 5th meeting of the RVC in 2016, which concluded that:
- 37 of the 53 countries had interrupted endemic measles transmission;
- of these, 24 countries maintained interruption for more than 36 months and were therefore considered to have eliminated the disease;
- 14 countries remain endemic for measles transmission; and
- 2 countries have not submitted annual status updates.
WHO technical experts cooperate closely with European countries to achieve this goal, providing comprehensive support to strengthen immunization programmes, increase population immunity and confidence in vaccines, build disease surveillance capacities, and respond to outbreaks in line with countries' commitment to elimination.

Third-grade students and staff from Eagle Elementary School may have been exposed to measles at the Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Museum in Ashland on [Mon 13 Mar 2017].

An infected person from Omaha spent time at the museum on [Mon 13 Mar 2017] between 8 AM and 2 PM. Eagle 3rd-grade students visited the museum that same day.

According to a public health alert letter sent to staff and parents from the school's superintendent on [Mon 27 Mar 2017], measles is a "highly contagious viral disease" that "can remain in the area for 2 hours after the infected person has left."

The school has confirmed that all of the 3rd-grade students have their immunizations up to date, and no students or staff members have reported any symptoms. Unless more cases are identified, the school said the risk for developing measles from this exposure will end 3 Apr. [See URL above for exposure locations. - Mod.LK]

Those most at-risk include people who have had no measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, only 1 dose of the vaccine and those who have not had the measles. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, coughing, red eyes, sore throat and a rash, and usually begin 7 to 14 days after exposure.

A measles outbreak is spreading mainly among children in drought-affected rural areas of Buhodle in northern Somalia's Togdheer region, according to local medical workers.

Dr Farah Hassan Aden, who works at Widhwidh health centre, 65 km [approx. 40 mi] from Buhodle, told Radio Ergo the centre had admitted 18 measles patients from Ged-dher, Belli-hara, Banyal and other rural villages where migrating pastoralist families have gathered seeking food and water. The doctor reported 40 known cases, including 32 children, of measles over the last 10 days.

In Ged-dher village, which has no health centre, the doctor said the local people confirmed that there are 26 people sick with measles. NAM, 41, who lives in Ged-dher, told Radio Ergo by phone that 5 of her 7 children are sick with measles. She said she was looking after them at home because she does not have the 100 000 Somali shilling (USD 4.5) per person to travel by vehicle to the health centre in Widhwidh, 20 km [approx. 12.4 mi] away.

"All of the 5 children are bedridden and cannot get up without help," she said. "If I knew the problems the disease causes I would have sought to vaccinate my children a long time ago." NAM said she is borrowing money from a local shop to buy painkillers for her sick children.

Like many pastoralist families they have not had time to think about vaccination and other health issues being busy with their livestock. NAM's family has 30 goats left which she cannot sell as they are weak and thin. Four months ago, she fled from Banyal village, one of the worst hit areas by the drought, hoping to find pasture in this part of the region. The family lost 120 goats so far in the drought.

Dr Farah said he sometimes receives patients in critical condition, as they have not received any treatment. The health centre in Widhwidh is supported by Somali Aid Society (SAS), a local organisation that provides free services, including nutritional treatment.

[Alert: Pre-famine in Somalia from 23 Feb 2017. Somalia is on the brink of famine. An immediate scale-up of the drought response is required to prevent the worst-case scenario. A pre-famine alert was issued for Somalia on 2 Feb 2017 by the UN Humanitarian Coordinator. Over the past 6 months, the food security and nutrition situation has deteriorated significantly and a 3rd famine in 25 years is a real possibility. More than 360 000 acutely malnourished and 70 000 severely malnourished children currently need urgent and life-saving support. - (http://www.who.int/hac/crises/som/sitreps/en/)

Added to this is the burden of disease the Somalians bear. Measles is just one of the health problems the children face, but one that could be prevented with vaccination. - Mod LK]
