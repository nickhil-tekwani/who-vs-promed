The Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Control reported a tetanus death in northern Kazakhstan. The case was a 54-year-old man from Uzbekistan who injured his right foot with a nail during construction work (August 21 [2021]). Despite exhibiting symptoms he did not seek medical help until 5 days after the injury.

With the persistence of symptoms on August 26 [2021], an ambulance was called for the man. The patient was taken to the emergency room of the district hospital. At the time of the examination, he presented with spasm of the jaw, stiffness along the entire spine, and severe weakness.

"Based on the presence of an epidemiological history and clinical picture, a diagnosis of tetanus was made. The vaccination status of the patient is unknown. Emergency vaccination was carried out. From the moment of admission to the hospital, the patient's condition remained without visible changes, consistently grave. On August 28 [2021], he died," stated Arman Kushbasov, deputy head of the regional department of sanitary and epidemiological control.

Tetanus is an acute infectious disease caused by spores of the bacteria _Clostridium tetani_. These spores are found everywhere: in the environment (especially soil), ash, intestines / feces of animals and humans, and on the surface of skin and rusty tools such as nails, needles, barbed wire, and others. Due to the high resistance of spores to high temperatures and most antiseptics, they can live for years. Anyone can get tetanus, but the most common and most severe cases of tetanus are people who have not been adequately immunized with tetanus toxoid vaccines.

The incubation period for tetanus lasts from 3 to 21 days after infection. In most cases, the disease develops within 14 days. Symptoms may include jaw spasm or inability to open the mouth, sudden painful muscle spasms often triggered by random noises, difficulty swallowing, convulsions, headache, fever and sweating, changes in blood pressure, and heart palpitations.

The only means of prevention is timely routine vaccination, which in Kazakhstan is included in the national vaccination calendar and is carried out free of charge from 2 months of age, then at 3, 4 months, at 1.5 years, at 6 years, 16 years, and then every 10 years.

[Tetanus is an intoxication related to a local, usually wound, infection due to the vegetative form of _Clostridium tetani_, an anaerobic toxin-producing Gram-positive bacillus. The neurotoxin tetanospasmin blocks release of neurotransmitters (such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, and glycine) from inhibitory neurons, leading to disinhibition of lower motor neurons (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564069/). This results most classically in trismus (spasm of jaw muscles, causing the mouth to remain tightly closed), risus sardonicus (spasm of facial muscles, causing a sardonic grin), and opisthotonus (spasm of back muscles, causing bending of the spine and extremities convexly forward, with the body resting on the head and the heels).

Tetanus is a vaccine-preventable disease. Having tetanus does not confer immunity to the disease. Immunization with tetanus toxoid will produce antitoxins that prevent the disease, but waning immunity and increased immigration of non-immunized or inadequately immunized individuals represent a significant cause of cases in developed nations (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00051456.htm).

Tetanus toxoid (T) vaccine is available combined with diphtheria toxoid, both in full-strength diphtheria toxoid doses (denoted by upper case letter "TD") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength diphtheria toxoid doses (denoted by upper case T and lowercase d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult formulations (Tdap).

In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children: one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm). Booster doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are recommended every 10 years throughout life. In Uzbekistan, DTP is scheduled to be given at 2, 3, 4 and 16 months of age; and DTP3 vaccination coverage is reported to be greater than 95% (https://extranet.who.int/countryplanningcycles/sites/default/files/planning_cycle_repository/uzbekistan/att_01._uzb_cmyp2011-2015_revised_aug_2013.pdf).

In addition to traumatic wound infections, as in the patient described in the news report above, heroin users, particularly those who inject heroin subcutaneously or intramuscularly, appear to be at high risk for tetanus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC546055/). In newborns, tetanus (tetanus neonatorum) is a major cause of infant mortality in underdeveloped countries, but is rare in the United States. Infection results from umbilical cord contamination during unsanitary delivery, coupled with a lack of maternal immunization. The risk for development of tetanus is highest in the elderly population, as a result of waning vaccine-induced immunity. - Mod.ML
