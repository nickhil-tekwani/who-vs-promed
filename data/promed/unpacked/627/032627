State health officials are investigating a 3rd suspected case of
botulism that an Indiana resident may have contracted by eating a
product included in a recent canned meat recall.
The person ate one of the products on Sun 29 Jul 2007 and became ill,
although officials will not know whether it is botulism until test
results return in a few days, said Lynae Granzow, an epidemiologist
with the Indiana Department of Health. Granzow said Tuesday [31 Jul
2007] she was not sure which of the recalled products the patient
might have eaten.
"Even though this recall has been out and we keep asking the media
and the public to communicate the message, persons still are unaware
of it," she said. "Make sure this is absolutely not on your shelves."
The government has told people to immediately throw away more than 90
different products, from chili sauce to corned beef hash to dog food,
produced at a Castleberry's Food Co. plant linked to a botulism outbreak.
Indiana health officials last week [23-27 Jul 2007] stepped up
efforts to pull the products from store shelves around the state,
saying the recall message that warned of a link to botulism had not
been heard by everyone.
So far, 4 confirmed cases of botulism have been reported, 2 from
Indiana and 2 from Texas. All 4 people consumed Hot Dog Chili Sauce
Original, a product made by Castleberry's. But health officials in
other states, including Hawaii and California, are also investigating
possible cases.

[Cases occurring after the recall are particularly worrisome. The
MMWR Dispatch from CDC (30 July 2007) discusses the 2 original
Indiana cases and the 2 Texas cases and mentions the (as of yet) not
clearly linked California case. The 8 reported botulism cases from
Ohio and the 2 less clearly confirmed cases from Hawaii await further
information. - Mod.LL]
