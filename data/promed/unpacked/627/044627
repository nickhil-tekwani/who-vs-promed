Bovine tuberculosis has been detected in dairy cattle in eastern New
Mexico, state officials said Thursday [14 Jun 2007].
State Agriculture Secretary Miley Gonzalez confirmed that animals in
a herd in Curry County had the disease [In March 2007, a confirmed
positive was found in Eddy County as well. - Mod.TG]. He said it will
likely lead to the destruction of the herd, but that the federal
government will compensate the owners. He was uncertain of the exact
size of the herd, but said it was at least 2 dozen cattle.
Bovine TB is rarely passed to humans, but workers at the dairy, which
was not identified, will be tested, Gonzalez said.
The highly contagious lung disease is spread by infected cattle
coughing, snorting and bellowing in pastures or feedlots. It affects
such animals as cattle, bison, deer, elk and goats, and causes weight
loss and general debilitation. It can be fatal.
The outbreak could threaten New Mexico's status as a bovine
tuberculosis-free state.
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said that without TB-free status,
livestock producers in the state would be subject to costly animal
testing. "This situation is certainly serious, because the loss of
New Mexico's TB-free status would affect livestock producers across
the state," he said.
Because of an outbreak of the disease 3 years ago, federal
restrictions in Curry and Roosevelt counties prevent dairy cattle
from being shipped outside of that area. Cattle can be moved among
dairies in the area, however. Milk from dairies in the area is tested
and can be marketed outside of those counties, Gonzalez said.
The new outbreak of the disease likely will mean the federal
restrictions on dairy cattle in the 2 counties will be extended for
several additional years, Gonzalez said. Gov. Bill Richardson formed
a Bovine TB Intervention Group, which will be led by Gonzalez. Two
other dairies in Curry County are being tested for the disease.

[New Mexico had a split state status for many years because their
eastern counties, primarily dairy in operation, had tuberculosis.
They have worked very hard to clean it up, but it appears
that this slow insidious disease is not finished with New Mexico yet.
New Mexico has a "modified accredited advanced" status in the portion
of the state that has TB. This appears to be the 2nd herd in 2007,
which likely could put the state at risk of losing what status it has
gained.
A map of the counties of New Mexico
<http://www.hometownlocator.com/StateMap.cfm?StateCode=NM>
shows there is some distance between Curry county, the site of the
present outbreak, and Eddy county, the site of the March 2007
outbreak. Eddy county was not within the infected zone.
The disease may be passed to humans through unpasteurized milk. It
has been thought possible for TB-infected workers to pass the disease
to animals. Since they are testing the workers, one wonders whether
it is because the workers drank unpasteurized milk or whether they
suspect the workers of being infected.
Tuberculosis in cattle is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium
bovis_. - Mod.TG]
