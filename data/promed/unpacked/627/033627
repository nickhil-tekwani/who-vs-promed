A 60-year-old woman who was diagnosed as suffering from dengue fever
died here on Sunday at the Shardaben municipal hospital, Ahmedabad,
even as medical experts now feel that the mysterious fever that had
led to 6 deaths in a Gandhinagar village could have been dengue fever.
A 16-year-old boy suspected to be suffering from dengue fever also
died the same day at this hospital. Civil hospital superintendent Dr
Anil Chaddha could not confirm that the 6 deaths in Borisana village
of Gandhinagar were also due to dengue fever on the grounds that,
"the report of those tests are awaited."
Ahmedabad reported a few cases of dengue, while the 6 persons who
died in Borisana village of Gandhinagar district of a mysterious
fever and 75 patients were affected, also showed symptoms of dengue,
according to medical experts [see: Undiagnosed deaths - India
(Gujarat): RFI in refs. below].
Medical officer of health at the AMC Dr P. K. Makwana told TNN that a
dengue fever case was also diagnosed on 9 Sep 2003 in the city.
"Ahmedabad has seen a few cases of dengue fever this season. Better
diagnostic facilities in private pathology laboratories has now made
it possible to diagnose it," he said.
According to Makwana, AMC health officials have now started a mass
awareness campaign to educate people about the cause and symptoms of
dengue fever. "We have asked residents to ensure that all overhead
storage tanks are sealed with an airtight cover. We have also asked
people to regularly change water in air coolers etc," he said.

Medical professionals in Vadodara city are on high alert after 2
people died of the dreaded dengue fever recently. Another 8-10 cases
have been reported from various hospitals in the city. Most of the
cases reported are from Navayard, Wadi, Raopura, Tarsali and
Manjalpur. The deceased were children; a 3-year-old from Wadi and a
7-year-old from Navayard, who were admitted to KG Patel Children's
Hospital.
At the moment, about 5 cases are being treated at F. G. Patel and
Krishna Children's Critical Care Centre in the city. Says Dr Hitesh
Desai, a paediatrician at KG Patel Hospital, "Till now, we have had
about 6 dengue cases. The 2 patients who died were in a critical
condition. However, we have ICU facilities, which are crucial for
managing this disease. The patient needs round-the-clock monitoring."
"We have a confirmed case of dengue still undergoing treatment,
while one has been shifted back to Godhra. The patients need to be
kept under critical care monitoring, as most cases lead to
complications. As only presumptive diagnosis is possible, we are left
with no choice but to monitor hydration and blood pressure of the
patient," informs Dr Tushar Kulkarni of Krishna Children's Critical
Care Hospital.
The appearance of dengue in Vadodara has come as no surprise despite
the fact that it is usually found in the coastal region, say doctors.
"The city has a migrating population and moreover, the mosquito
species _Aedes aegypti_, which carries the dengue virus, is not new
to Vadodara. Vector control through elimination of mosquito breeding
sites and protection from mosquito bites can go a long way in disease
prevention," says Dr Satish Pandya, who presented a report on dengue
at a clinical meeting held recently.
The presence of dengue virus is confirmed through 2 tests: Viral
isolation and antibody titre tests. However, the pathological
laboratories in the city have only the antibody titre tests to
confirm the cases. Meanwhile the Vadodara Municipal Corporation has
informed all hospitals in the city to report the dengue cases as and
when admitted. "The VMC has directed us to report the cases so that
the samples could be despatched for viral isolation tests at Pune,"
informed Desai.

At least 5 persons have died of suspected dengue in Jal Vihar near
Lajpat Nagar Central Market this month, and the Municipal Corporation
of Delhi (MCD) apparently came to know about it only on Friday. The
deceased had similar symptoms of high fever and died within 3-4 days
of falling ill.
On Saturday, the civic body ordered an inquiry into the deaths, all
of which have been reported from the "Madrasi Colony" of Jal Vihar.
The colony has more than 2500 jhuggis [slum dwellings] that line a
railway track amid heaps of filth and stagnated water.
The latest cases of suspected dengue deaths were reported on Friday.
2 people, including a 50-year-old railway employee, died in the area.
Residents said he had fallen ill about 3 days back and died early on
Friday. MCD health officer, Dr KN Tewari said none of the cases had
been reported to them till now. "The deaths probably did not occur in
hospitals who would have notified us. Another point is that dengue
deaths usually occur between 5 and 7 days, not within 3-4 days.
However, I have asked the deputy health officer of the zone to look
into the matter and give a report," Tewari told HT.

Health authorities have confirmed 9 cases of dengue in Nasik of west
India's Maharashtra state, 1222 km from New Delhi, according to the
Press Trust of India (PTI) Sunday. 56 blood samples were collected
from different parts of the city and sent to the National Virus
Research Laboratory in Pune of the state. 9 of them were found
positive, PTI reported.
The health department has reportedly examined 18 293 houses and also
given guidance to the citizens. A total of 10 535 containers were
examined, 173 of which were found with mosquito larvae. Notices have
also been issued to owners of septic tanks.
[These statistics are intriguing. On average apparently only about
50 percent of the houses inspected had a container that could breed
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, and 173 positive out of 10 535 containers
is an extraordinarily low number to sustain a dengue epidemic.
Perhaps they were all concentrated in one district, from which all
the dengue cases are coming? - Mod.JW]

An outbreak of dengue fever has hit several regencies in North
Sumatra in Indonesia this year, leaving at least 10 people, mostly
children, dead and 280 others hospitalized, the daily Jakarta Post
reported Friday.
The disease, carried by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, started to spread
last January [2003], but the 10 deaths were just recorded between
March and September [2003]. 2 of the deaths were reported on Tuesday
and Wednesday from the Sari Mutiara and Pirngadi hospitals in Medan,
the capital of North Sumatra.
According to data from the North Sumatra provincial health office,
the number of dengue fever cases stood at 280 between 15 Jan and
September 2003.

2 more children were reported to have died from the outbreak of
dengue fever that has been plaguing several parts of North Sumatra,
bringing the death toll to at least 12 victims since March [2003].
Health officials said on Friday that the 2 children, P.B., 4, from
Satria village in Tebing Tinggi regency, and F., 5, from Medan, died
in local hospitals on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Syahrial
R. Anas, acting head of the Medan health office, said the children
died after suffering from severe hemorrhaging. In fact, the deaths
could have been prevented if the families of the victims had taken
the children to hospital immediately for treatment. "Parents can take
early measures by giving their infected children enough fluids and
anti-fever drugs so as to reduce their temperatures before bringing
them to the hospital," he told The Jakarta Post.
Responding to the controversy over the swallow aviaries that are
believed to be the breeding places of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in
the province, Syahrial said his office has sent a team to inspect 60
of the 600 such aviaries in Medan. The environmental health technical
center at the Medan health office recently found that 90 percent of
the swallow aviaries served as breeding places for the
disease-carrying mosquitoes. Swallows' nests, cemented together by
the birds' saliva, are used in traditional medicine and are a major
source of income in North Sumatra.

Marikina City health personnel and volunteers were directed yesterday
to continue the massive information drive in the 16 health centers as
well as public and private schools to drum up awareness among
residents to stop the spread of dengue fever within the Shoe Capital.
Mayor Marides C. Fernando issued the order after having been informed
that 55 cases of dengue have been reported by the City Health Office
(CHO) from 1 Jan - 31 Aug 2003. City health and sanitation officer
Ronald Dalusong said of the number, 85 percent were males with ages
15 years old and above.
DoH Secretary Manuel Dayrit said the National Epidemiology Center
(NEC) -- charged with monitoring the prevalence of the disease --
reported that at least 29 percent of dengue cases were detected in
Manila, 15 percent in Caloocan City, and 9 percent in Quezon City.
July and August are said to be the peak months of the disease and
likely to drop this current month [September] and October.

As of 14 Sep 2003, as many as 2948 people in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh
City were infected with dengue fever, up 71.8 percent against the
whole year of 2002, local newspaper Young People reported Friday.
The 2 main reasons are that the city is rainy and hot, and many
locals store rainwater in containers for domestic use, which create
favorable conditions for the development of mosquitoes. Most of
Vietnamese dengue fever patients live in the south of the country. As
of mid July [2003], over 12 000 people in the region were reported to
have been infected with the disease, a year-on-year increase of 164.6
percent.
