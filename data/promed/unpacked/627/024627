The Department of Health Services, Epidemiology and Disease Control
Division has refuted any mystery disease behind the recent deaths that took
place at Belapur VDC [Village Development Committee - village clusters -
Mod.MPP] of Dadeldhuda District.
Talking to the RSS [the national news agency of Nepal - Mod.MPP], Chief of
the Division Dr. Manas Kumar Banerjee said that the study conducted by the
public health administrator, medical officer from the District Health
Office, Dadeldhuda and 2 local journalists who were assigned in the area
following the news published in some newspaper reporting that more than 400
persons have been infected and 9 deaths due to a mystery disease in the
area did not find such disease in the area.
The medical examination carried out by the team to a total of 278 persons
of Belapur VDC-4 found out that of those falling in the village, 40 per
cent were suffering from chronic stomach ailments, 40 per cent with
respiratory disease and 20 per cent with normal cough and cold.
Regarding the death, the investigation team found out that 5 persons who
died in the area after [22 Sep 2006] were not due to any mystery disease
but were suffering from hepatitis, asthma, paralysis, epilepsy and kidney
problems, the Division stated.

[In response to the request for information about an outbreak of an acute
febrile respiratory illness with 8 unexplained deaths in Dadeldhura Nepal
-- Undiagnosed deaths - Nepal (Dadeldhura): RFI 20061014.2954 -- reported
in a newswire, Dr. Khanchit Limpakarnjanarat, from the WHO South East Asian
Regional Office (SEARO) Outbreak group forwarded a series of correspondence
surrounding an investigation conducted by the WHO SEARO Outbreak Group in
collaboration with the WHO office in Nepal and the Nepali Ministry of
Health for an earlier "mystery" outbreak in Chamchet village, Kathmandu,
Nepal during September 2006.
The final conclusion of the investigation was that there was no unusual
outbreak, nor a cluster of unexplained deaths. "Persons who went to
investigate had reported that there was no unusual morbidity as claimed in
the press in that VDC [district]. Neither was there any mortality
attributable to an epidemic outbreak. Additional support was neither needed
nor requested. Press had exaggerated the normally prevailing ailments of
the locality it appears.... This confirms what was originally suspected
about this report, and that media is used to draw attention to underserved
regions by declaring phantom epidemics of rare diseases. This is not the
first time in the last year this has happened."
From the information provided in the follow-up newswire on the outbreak in
Dadeldhura above, it appears as though the news reports of this outbreak
were also distorted. This moderator frequently gives lectures on the value
of the informal sector in disease surveillance. One of the points in these
lectures deals with constraints with using informal sources -- the
possibility of a secondary agenda on the part of the source. In the above
case, it appears as though the media is being "used" to highlight
weaknesses in the health care delivery system in an area of a country.
In the specific case of the reported 8 undiagnosed deaths in Dadeldhura,
Nepal, the conclusion seems to be that there was no unusual outbreak, nor
were there unexplained deaths in the region, and that the media report was
in fact spurious. Fortunately, we have had a low percentage of spurious
reports posted on ProMED, and we continue to view the media as a valuable
source of early reports on disease outbreaks and unusual disease occurrence.
In many countries, a significant proportion of the population does not use
official ministry of health facilities as their first line of assistance
when an illness occurs, so these cases are not being seen by health care
providers, who would be reporting these cases through the official disease
surveillance system. An anecdotal report from one country epidemiologist
was that they learned of 60-70 percent of the outbreaks in their country
from local media reports. Fortunately, the number of false reports appears
to be low.
ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Khanchit Limpakarnjanarat of the WHO
SEARO Outbreak Team for sending us a rapid response to our request for
information. - Mod.MPP]
