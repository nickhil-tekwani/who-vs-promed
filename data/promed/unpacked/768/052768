Public Health Minister Pradit Sintavanarong has expressed his worries over the hand, foot and mouth disease situation in Thailand as over 27 000 cases have been found this year [2013]. Minister Pradit said he was concerned about children's health as the statistics, collected from [1 Jan 2013] to [19 Aug 2013], shows that there were 27 400 hand, foot and mouth infections during the period, which accounted for nearly 43 of every 100 000 people, adding that the disease has already claimed one life. Most of the infections were found in children less than 3 years of age, while the North was the region with the highest number of cases, followed by the South, the Central Plains and the Northeast.

Meanwhile, Dr. Pornthep Siriwanarangsun, Director-General of the Disease Control Department, said the monsoon season is the peak period for hand, foot and mouth disease, while urging all kindergartens and child care centers to draw up strict preventive measures against the disease.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by intestinal viruses called enterovirus. It is moderately contagious and is spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva, or feces of an infected person. However, he said a body [?] infected with the virus can usually heal itself within 7-10 days.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in adults. Symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease include fever, mouth sores, and a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. These viruses includes the polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States and Europe, whereas other coxsackieviruses have been associated with HFMD elsewhere. Enterovirus 71 has also been associated with HFMD and outbreaks in Asian countries and can have more serious consequences in some situations.

According to the WHO HFMD Situation Update of 6 Aug 2013 (http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/index.html): "Regional HFMD in Asia is variable. Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan and Republic of Korea have reported more cases in 2013 than in 2012 for the same time period. The recent trend, following seasonal patterns, is showing an increase in cases in China, Macao (China) and Japan; however, cases declined in Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam. It seems that Thailand can now be added to this list. There are no reports so far of an involvement of enterovirus 71 in these outbreaks. - Mod.CP
