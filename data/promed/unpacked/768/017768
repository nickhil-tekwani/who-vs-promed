The Ministry of Health has announced that a dog which has been treated in 2 veterinary clinics, in Tel Aviv and Herzliyya, has been found positive for rabies. The bitch, reportedly about 1.5 years old, was collected by a citizen of Holon about 2 weeks ago in the upper Galilee, near Meron. On Friday, 15 May 2015, the dog bit a woman in Holon. Subsequently she was brought to the premises of an animal protection society in Herzliyya, where she was handled by several people. Due to some clinical signs, the animal was examined by a veterinarian, suspected of having rabies, put to sleep and examined in the national laboratory for rabies (Beit Dagan) where it was found positive.

The dog had contact with many people and pets since its arrival in Israel's centre. The health authorities are investigating the issue and had called upon people in Holon, Tel-Aviv, Herzliyya and the vicinity of Meron, who may have had contact with the animal, to seek medical advice immediately.

A peripatetic, medium-sized, brown and white female dog managed to wander from Mount Meron to Holon, where it bit a woman before dying of rabies. The mixed-breed dog could have been in contact with more than 1000 people between May 3 and 17, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday [20 May 2015]. The ministry urged anyone who was in contact with the dog to go to their nearest district health office or hospital emergency room.

The bitch was 1st seen at the Lag Ba'omer festivities near the tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai on 7 May 2015, where thousands had congregated for the holiday. Two people picked up the stray dog and took her to their home in Holon. The next day, she was examined by a veterinarian in the city and remained with the adopting family until the 16th. The day before, the dog bit a woman.

On the 16th, the dog was taken to the SOS dog shelter in Herzliya and treated by a veterinarian and volunteers. The following day the dog died and soon after it was confirmed that she was infected with the disease, which is fatal to mammals and humans.

The ministry is trying to alert those who were near the cave and in touch with the dog or other mammals. Those who were in direct contact with the dog should contact the district veterinarian to determine whether they need the prophylactic rabies vaccine.

2 cases of rabies in stray dogs have been registered in recent days in the densely populated central urban areas of Haifa and Tel-Aviv which have not experienced rabies for many years. In both cases the rabid animals were collected by travelers in rabies-infected areas in northern Israel.

1. [Event No. 7 of 2015]: a 3 month old puppy collected in the Adamit Park, near Kibbutz Ayalon in the Western Galilee by travelers who fostered the animal. After staying in several locations, including Nahariya and Kiryat Bialik where it was presented to 2 veterinarians due to suspected rabies, the puppy arrived in Haifa's municipal rabies observation station after presenting behavioral changes and neurological signs. A veterinary examination led to the decision to euthanize the dog. The animal was found to be positive for rabies at the national rabies laboratory (Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan).

2. [Event No. 8 of 2015]: a mixed-breed bitch aged about 1.5 years was collected by a group of people from central Israel near the Idra cave on mount Meron, Upper Galilee. They were participating in a traditional, annual Jewish celebration, held this year on 7 May 2015.

The bitch was brought by one member of the group to his home in Holon [south of Tel Aviv]. The next day, she was taken to a veterinary clinic for general examination without any unusual findings. The bitch stayed a week with the family, but since she bit 1 family member and a visitor, they decided to deliver her "as an unfriendly and seemingly ill" dog to a local animal asylum in Holon.

The bitch was refused, and the owners then tried to deliver her to another asylum of an animal protection society in Herzliyyah [north of Tel Aviv] where she similarly was refused. The bitch was tied some distance away and at the end of the day was taken home by one of the association's volunteers. The volunteer brought her next morning to a "Pets Adoption Day" in Kfar Shmaryahu, but the organizers refused to accept her since she was not electronically chipped nor vaccinated against rabies. Subsequently, the bitch was transferred by volunteers to a veterinarian, who took care of applying an electronic chip and vaccinated the dog against rabies. Subsequently, the bitch was given to a foster home in Ramat Gan. 2 days after her arrival in her new home, she became ill and was transferred to a veterinary clinic in Tel Aviv, where she died 2 hours later. Thanks to the practitioner's alertness the dead animal was sent to the Veterinary Institute, where rabies was confirmed.

[The upper Galilee and the Golan have witnessed a significant rise in the incidence of rabies in recent years, involving mainly dogs and wolves most likely introduced from Syria. Other parts of the country have been practically free from rabies for several years, thanks to the introduction of oral vaccination in wildlife.

The 1st 6 rabies cases in Israel during 2015 are presented on the map available at
http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/Vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/Pirsumim/2015/kalevet_map_2015.htm.

The traditional 'Lag Ba'omer' festivities in Meron, Upper Galilee, near the tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai (a religious leader of the 2nd century AD) is held 33 days after the Jewish Passover ("Pesach") feast, involving a very large number (6 digits) of participants from the entire country. This year, the event took place on 7 May. We are informed that the group involved in the event (collecting the dog) in Meron, did not participate in the general mass gathering but several hundred meters away, in a side-event at another holy site (a cave named "Idra"). This group numbered 400-600 people. Two pictures of the bitch involved in the said event are available at the source URL of item 1 above, to support the identification and (post exposure) treatment of potential (exposed) victims in the various locations visited by the dog during its last 10 days.

Public education seems to be much needed to prevent similar events in the future. Alertness of practitioners is essential.

Israel's last case of human rabies was recorded in 2003.

According to Israel's rabies ordinance and regulations, the owner of a dog that has bitten a person is required to bring the pet, within 24 hours of the incident, to a rabies detention observation kennel. There are more than 30 such municipal kennels throughout the country. The purpose of the detention, which lasts 10 days, is to exclude rabies and save the need to treat the bitten persons. There has been a proposal to revise these regulations, allowing the option of keeping the dogs at home, brought by their owners for checkups at the municipal veterinaty office. In view of the deficiencies illuminated by the current events, including the poor awareness of the public and some drawbacks elsewhere, the proposal deserves to be reconsidered.

While the event in Meron, involving an adult bitch, seems more dramatic due to the circumstances and history as described in detail above, the rabid puppy deserves to be addressed very seriously and with extreme attention. Children specifically are inclined to touch and play with puppies, whose bites may not always be noted or perceived as significant.

For the locations of the 2 sites where the rabid canines were collected, please refer to square 2 in the interactive map available at http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html. The coordinates of the Adamit Park are: X=397.6, Y=312. The coordinates of the Meron event are X=687.2, Y=454.4. - Mod.AS
