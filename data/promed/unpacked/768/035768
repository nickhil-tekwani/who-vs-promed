I read the last of two messages on tularemia cases in hares in Italy
related to imported animals. I submitted the message to Dr. Fabbi, who sent
me the following information and requested it be posted.

I read with interest the discussion about tularemia in Northern Italy
brought to the attention by Dr. Pasquale Urbano. Maybe I can provide some
more accurate information on this subject as our diagnostic veterinary
laboratory (Pavia section of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
della Lombardia e dell'Emilia) diagnosed tularemia infection in the hares,
the object of this discussion.
First, we diagnosed only three cases of tularemia (isolation of
_Francisella tularensis_) in hares, not four cases as was reported by some
newspaper; two hares were imported from Hungary and one from Slovakja.
Second, these animals come directly from the shipment (transport truck) and
not from the local population. In fact, Veterinary service must control the
animal health and investigate any case of illness or death among the
imported animals.
No cases of tularemia are reported in the local hares as of today in our
area. I can tell also that in December, 1995 we diagnosed two cases of
tularemia in hares, again directly from the shipment (transport truck), one
coming from Hungary and another from Romania. Before these cases, we
detected another one case of the disease in 1987 in hares coming from the
local population. No cases of tularemia have been notified in humans since
1982.
Our area (named "Oltrepò pavese", the hilly area of the Pavia province), is
an endemic area for tularemia since about 1965, when the first case of the
disease in Italy was described. Two other important endemic areas for
tularemia are the Tuscany region in central Italy (Arezzo province) and the
Liguria region (Val di Vara, inland of La Spezia province) in north-west
Italy.
In Oltrepò pavese the cases in humans were sporadic and linked to the
contact with infected hares, while in Tuscany and Liguria regions the
epidemics were linked to the water consumption.

[Many thanks to Drs. Capucci and Fabbi for this informative and
authoritative report. The statement that the affected imported hares were
dead on arrival confirms private information I had received from Hungary. -
