PNEUMONIA CLUSTER - CHINA (XINJIANG): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

We have heard from a reliable source about a report of a cluster of
pneumonia cases in Tashan Hospital, leading to the isolation of patient(s)
and hospital healthcare workers for "viral infection." Tashan is located
600 km from the capital city of Xinjiang Province and is the area where an
outbreak of H5N1 among migratory birds (see ProMED-mail postings below) was
reported to the OIE by the Ministry of Agriculture recently.
To date, reports are that influenza was ruled out in these patients, and a
diagnosis of "lobar pneumonia secondary to streptococcal A infection" was made.
[ProMED-mail does not have further detailed information on this cluster
(such as number of patients, ages, outcomes) or specific information on the
laboratory testing that was performed. We are posting this report, as the
report of isolation of patients and hospital staff is curious in the face
of a bacterial pneumonia cluster and begs the question of why this was
implemented. More information from knowledgeable sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
