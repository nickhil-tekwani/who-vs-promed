The dengue fever outbreak that began in early October [2012] on the island of Madeira in the Autonomous Region of Madeira continues to increase in numbers, according to the latest case count from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on 3 Dec [2012; available at http://bit.ly/RCbNU4].

European health authorities report 1819 dengue cases as of 25 Nov [2012]. This is up from 1672 cases reported one week prior.

In addition, since the beginning of the outbreak 2 months ago, at least 118 people infected with the mosquito borne virus required hospitalization for their illness. There has been no deaths reported associated with this outbreak.

The vast majority of confirmed cases from this outbreak have been in residents of Madeira Island, particularly in the city of Funchal, which is the main port on the island. Cases have also been reported on the other inhabited island in the archipelago, Porto Santo.

The number of travelers to the island who have turned up dengue positive upon return home has increased to 43, up from 33 a week ago. This includes Portugal (10), the UK (14), Germany (10), Sweden (1), France (3), Finland (2), Denmark (1), Spain (1), and Slovenia (1).

Health officials say this is a significant, albeit not unexpected public health event since a vector of the dengue virus, _Aedes aegypti_, has been a known presence on the island.

According to an ECDC Epidemiological Summary of the outbreak, sequence analysis of viral genomes from several positive human samples indicates high sequence similarity with dengue virus type 1, circulating in Venezuela and Colombia, strongly suggesting a Latin American origin.

[The dengue outbreak showed no signs of easing in November 2012. Fortunately, no deaths have been reported, although some infected individuals have been hospitalized. With Europe entering the winter season, there is no risk of onward transmission of dengue virus when tourists infected in Madeira return viremic to their home countries.
