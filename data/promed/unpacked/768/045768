China Discovers Outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease
-----------------------------------------------
China discovered the 2nd outbreak in 2 months of foot and mouth
disease among livestock in the western province of Qinghai. Symptoms
of the Asia 1 strain of foot and mouth were discovered in 4 dairy
cows on a farm in Haiyan County on 26 Apr 2006 and were confirmed by
the Ministry of Agriculture at the national foot and mouth disease
reference laboratory. The ministry and the provincial government are
taking emergency measures to contain the outbreak, disinfect the area
and cull the sick animals.
Foot and mouth, harmless to humans, is a highly contagious viral
disease that causes hogs, sheep and cattle to blister on their mouths
and tongues and reduces milk and meat production. It can be carried
by the wind and on the vehicles and clothes of people who come into
contact with infected animals.
Qinghai province reported on 12 Mar 2006 a separate outbreak of the
disease in Guinan County. A cow showed symptoms of the disease on 4
Mar 2006, and the national reference laboratory confirmed the outbreak.
The outbreak in Haiyan Country is the 5th reported case in China this
year [2006], according to the agriculture ministry. The country
reported outbreaks in the northern provinces of Gansu on 8 Mar 2006
and Ningxia on 16 Jan 2006 and in the eastern province of Jiangsu in
January 2006.
Globally, 3575 outbreaks of the disease were reported in 2004,
according to the World Organisation for Animal Health's website,
while the figures for 2005 were not posted.

[The recent appearance of the Asia 1 serotype in China (east and
west), Hong Kong, Mongolia, Myanmar, Russia, Tajikistan, along with
the traditional occurrence of this serotype in India, Iran and
Pakistan suggests that a single strain of Asia 1 could be spreading
throughout Asia.
However, according to data presented by the OIE Reference Laboratory
for FMD, the virus belongs to 5 different genetic sub-lineages. These
sub-lineages seem to be responsible for this widely dispersed
outbreak throughout Western Asia. See:
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/index.html>.
As mentioned previously, between May 1999 and the end of 2004, OIE
had not received a single report from China involving an outbreak of
FMD. However, since the beginning of 2005, the FMD serotype Asia 1
has been reported in over 10 outbreaks affecting 5 provinces in
China; the OIE Reference Lab report contains a useful map of these
outbreaks. Recently, there have been numerous outbreaks in the
frontier regions of several of China's neighbors, primarily Russia
and Outer Mongolia. The steady but unsettling increase in FMD
outbreaks in western Asia needs collaborative investigation by both
Russian and Chinese governments. - Mod.PC]
