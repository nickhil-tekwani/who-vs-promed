Wildlife authorities sounded an alert over the deaths of a rare
primate species in Assam of a mysterious disease in the past week,
officials said Thursday.
A wildlife official in Assam said forest rangers recovered corpses of
9 golden langurs in the western district of Kokrajhar, about 230 km
from here.
"9 deaths in a few days is a matter of serious concern. We are
worried, as the disease might spread further and hence an alert to
save this rare primate from getting wiped out," Kempa Borgoyary, a
wildlife warden in Kokrajhar, told IANS.
The golden langur is one of the world's most endangered species,
found only in a few pockets in western Assam and adjoining Bhutan.
The total population of this rare primate species is about 10 000.
According to locals and unofficial reports, some 15 golden langurs
have died so far in the area.
"We appeal to experts with knowledge in primates from anywhere in the
world to come and help us to save this highly endangered primates
from extinction," the warden said. "We cannot allow this beautiful
species to get annihilated from the world map."
Forest officials have sent samples for forensic tests to find out the
exact cause of the deaths. "We do not know if the primates are hit by
some viral disease," another wildlife official T. Basumatary said.
Wildlife authorities in Bhutan are also concerned at the sudden
deaths of golden langurs in Assam.
"The golden langurs are found in small belt and if there is a viral
outbreak then it might hit the species in our area as well. We are
keeping a strict vigil and in touch with our counterparts in Assam,"
a Bhutanese wildlife official said by telephone from Samdrup Jhonkhar
district requesting anonymity.
Experts and conservation groups said the deaths come at a time when
this is the mating season for the golden langurs.
"We believe the deaths were caused due to poisoning, with the golden
langurs probably drinking water from a river where people use
chemicals to kill fish," said Soumyadeep Dutta, director of Natures
Beckon, a conservation group working on the golden langurs.
The primates, first discovered in 1920, live in groups of up to 50.
However, they are generally found in smaller troops of about 9.

Moderator JW has indicated that Kaysanur Forest disease should be
taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis.
The following information has recently been provided by Steve Berger
(see 20060120.0187):
Black-faced langurs (_Presbytis entellus_) and macaques (_Macaca
radiata_) are regarded (among others) as possible reservoirs of the
virus. Between October 1964 and September 1973, 1046 monkeys (860 _P.
entellus_ and 186 _M. radiata_) died in endemic areas. KFD virus was
isolated from 118 _P. entellus_ and 13 _M. radiata_.
Any relevant information and assistance to the conservationists in
Assam will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
