New outbreaks (2)
Summary of outbreaks, Total outbreaks: 2
Outbreak 1: Port Phillip, Victoria
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Mar 2015
Outbreak status: resolved 30 Apr 2015
Epidemiological unit: coastal area
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Flat oyster (_Ostrea angasi_) / 0 (scale 0 to 5 / 3 (scale 0 to 5) / - / - / - / 0 / 0
Affected population: Trial farming of hatchery reared _Ostrea angasi_ in Victoria.

Outbreak 2: Westernport Bay, Victoria
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Mar 2015
Outbreak status: resolved 30 Apr 2015
Epidemiological unit: coastal area
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Flat oyster (_Ostrea angasi_) / 0 (scale 0 to 5 / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / - / - / - / 0 / 0
Affected population: Trial farming of hatchery reared _Ostrea angasi_ in Victoria.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Specimens of _Ostrea angasi_ were examined by histopathology following low level mortalities in trial farming of this oyster species. Histopathology indicated the presence of Bonamia parasites. Subsequent diagnostic tests to confirm Bonamia infection and identify the species are included: Bonamia genus-specific TaqMan qPCR (Corbeil et al. 2006a): positive. OIE Bonamia genus-specific conventional PCR (Cochennec et al. 2000): positive, sequence homology with _B. exitiosa_. _Bonamia ostreae_ PCR (Ramilo et al. 2013): negative. _Bonamia exitiosa_ PCR (Ramilio et al. 2013): positive, sequence homology with _B. exitiosa_. _Bonamia sp._ 18S SSU (571-641) PCR (Corbeil et al. 2006b): positive, sequence homology with _B. exitiosa_. _Haplosporidia sp._ PCR (Carnegie et al. 2014): positive, sequence homology with _B. exitiosa_. ISH Bonamia genus-specific method (Ramilo et al. 2014): positive. The test results from April 2015 did not satisfy the OIE definition of a confirmed case of _Bonamia exitiosa_. Further diagnostic tests were performed, and these took considerable time.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2015, Chapter 2.4.2 "Infection with _Bonamia exitiosa_" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.4.02_B_EXIT.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:

"_Bonamia exitiosa_ is a Haplosporidia protozoan parasite infecting haemocytes of several oyster species and inducing physiological disorders and eventually death of the animal."

"_Bonamia exitiosa_ is an intrahaemocytic protozoan, but it can be observed extracellularly. This intrahaemocytic protozoan quickly becomes systemic and can be found in different organs, especially in the connective tissues of gills and mantle. In _Ostrea angasi_, the parasite is epitheliotropic, and apparently very light infections may cause a massive focal haemocyte infiltration with necrotic foci. In _O. edulis_, the parasite is associated with heavy haemocytic infiltration and appears in the connective tissue of different organs, mostly within haemocytes but sometimes outside host cells. In _O. stentina_, haemocytosis was not observed in animals found to be infected with the parasite."

"Clinical signs include dead or gaping oysters, but these clinical signs are not pathognomonic for infection with _B. exitiosa_ and could be indicative of other infections." - Mod.CRD
