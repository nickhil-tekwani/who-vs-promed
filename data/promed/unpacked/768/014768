Imported cases of chikungunya in metropolitan France: update to June 2006
-----------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------
We report a situation update of imported chikungunya infections in
metropolitan France (the part of France that is in Europe, including the
Mediterranean island of Corsica), from April 2005 to June 2006 [1].
Since the beginning of the epidemic in March 2005, 266 000 cases of
chikungunya fever are estimated to have occurred on the island of Reunion,
a French overseas territory [2]. Weekly estimates of suspected cases are
based on the number of patients with suspected chikungunya seen by sentinel
physicians on the island of Reunion and extrapolation of these figures to
the entire island population. Numbers of newly estimated cases peaked at 45
000 in week 5 (1st week of February 2006) and have since decreased. By June
2006, the estimated weekly number of cases was around 400. The islands of
the south west Indian Ocean (including Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius,
Mayotte, and Seychelles), and several states of India [3] have been
affected by chikungunya epidemics in 2005-2006.
Imported cases of chikungunya have been reported from several European
countries [4]. The vector responsible for the transmission in the French
territories of the Indian Ocean is known to be _Aedes albopictus_. This
mosquito has been detected on the French Mediterranean coast, between the
cities of Menton and Nice, and recently in the Bastia area of Corsica, a
French Mediterranean island.
Given the situation and the high number of travelers (304 113 for the year
2004, according to the French Ministry of Tourism) between Reunion and
metropolitan France, surveillance of imported cases and vector densities is
an important part of the risk assessment of autochthonous transmission in
France.
Methods
-------
Chikungunya serological testing in France is carried out by 2 national
reference centers for arboviral diseases and 2 private laboratories.
Data on positive tests were collected regularly between April 2005 and June
2006 and have been analyzed. The variables used are patient and laboratory
postcodes, age, sex, and date of blood sampling. An imported case is
defined as follows:
- detection of IgM antibodies against chikungunya virus and/or detection of
viral RNA by PCR, and/or positive viral culture; and
- sampled in metropolitan France (even if the patient is not resident in
metropolitan France).
Results
-------
From April 2005 to June 2006 inclusive, 766 imported cases of chikungunya
were identified in metropolitan France. The mean age was 48 years (range: 5
months-83 years), and the male:female sex ratio was 0.9:1.
The temporal evolution of imported cases correlates with the dynamics of
the epidemic in Reunion (Figure 1). Between April and July 2005, an average
of 20 imported cases was observed monthly, corresponding to the 1st Reunion
outbreak peak and the epidemics on the Comoros islands. Following a
decrease between August and November 2005 (winter in the southern
hemisphere), the estimated number of cases increased again and peaked in
March 2006 (177 imported chikungunya cases).
Since then, the trend has been decreasing, with 119 imported cases reported
in April, 88 in May and 48 in June 2006. No severe chikungunya cases
(neurological signs and/or organ failure) were reported in metropolitan
France between April 2005 to June 2006.
Discussion
----------
The number of chikungunya cases imported to metropolitan France has been
decreasing since March 2006. This temporal evolution correlates with the
dynamics of the epidemic in Reunion, which has also been going down. The
peak of the imported cases in March 2006 was observed one month later than
the peak of the Reunion outbreak, which occurred in February 2006. This
time lapse may be explained by the different methods used: distribution of
estimated cases in Reunion was based on the onset of clinical symptoms,
while imported cases were dated by blood sampling, which was often done
several days or even weeks after symptoms began.
The number of imported cases is probably underestimated, since asymptomatic
cases cannot be detected by surveillance. Chikungunya IgM antibodies appear
5 days after the onset of clinical symptoms on average, and can last for
several weeks. Having measurable IgM titres at a given time does not imply
viraemia, and only viraemic patients can cause further transmission. The
risk of secondary transmission in metropolitan French areas where the
vector is present is therefore probably overestimated, based on imported
case data.
_A. albopictus_ is known to be currently spreading around the world [5],
and is present in north and central Italy [6] and Albania. The mosquito can
transmit the virus, but its actual vectorial capacity
(environment-dependent) in metropolitan France is not yet well documented.
_A. albopictus_ is also capable of transmitting dengue fever.
Risk assessment of autochthonous transmission is based on surveillance of
both the vector and imported viraemic cases. A plan for preventing the
circulation of chikungunya in metropolitan France [7] has been developed,
and reinforces entomological and epidemiological surveillance. Since 7 Jul
2006, chikungunya and dengue fever have been added to the list of diseases
for mandatory notification in France. Entomological surveillance in France
has confirmed the presence of the vector in the city of Bastia in northern
Corsica, in addition to the area on the south east coast of France where it
had previously been identified. Alert procedures have been developed and
coordination with vector control services strengthened. All "suspect"
chikungunya cases detected in these regions with confirmed vector presence
must now be reported immediately, without waiting for biological
confirmation. This should facilitate rapid information to the surveillance
system and the implementation of control measures.

[The repeated introduction of chikungunya virus into France and other
European countries is an ongoing reminder that we live in a globally
interconnected world. With rapid air travel, viruses can be, and are,
introduced into countries thousands of kilometers apart. Their arthropod
vectors are also moving, for example with _Aedes albopictus_ now
established in southern Europe. The warming temperatures resulting from
global climate change can be expected to bring an extension of the range of
this mosquito. Expanding ranges of vectors and frequent introduction of
arthropodborne viruses, such as chikungunya, into countries where they are
not present currently, underscores the need to:
- develop ongoing surveillance mechanisms backed by rapid, reliable
diagnostic capability in developing countries where these viruses are endemic;
- alert primary caregivers and their supporting laboratories in countries
currently free of a given disease to the risk of imported cases;
- develop contingency plans and interdisciplinary teams to be able to
diagnose and treat and control introduced arboviral diseases; and
- link the biomedical community worldwide through real-time communication.
The eternal question is who pays for these measures in a world of
economically competing needs and demands? - Mod.TY]
