The World Health Organization (WHO) reported receiving on [28 Apr 2020] information regarding a confirmed yellow fever [YF] case in Mango village, Oti district, Savanes region in the northern part of Togo in late April [2020].

The case is a 55-year old female with no travel or vaccination history for yellow fever. On [3 Feb 2020], she presented to a health facility with symptoms of fever with aches. The following day she developed jaundice and a blood sample was taken and transported to the national laboratory as YF was suspected. The case-patient died 3 days later while receiving treatment.

The results were confirmed at the YF reference laboratory, Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal by seroneutralization. Then on [17 Mar 2020], the sample tested IgM positive for YF. On [22 Mar 2020], an in-depth multi-disciplinary investigation was conducted, and no additional case was detected.

YF is a viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the _Aedes_ species. YF can lead to serious illness and even death. YF vaccine is the best protection against YF disease, which can be fatal.

[There were 3 confirmed yellow fever (YF) cases in the same (Servanes) region in 2007 after a 20-year absence of cases (see ProMED-mail post Yellow fever - Togo (03) 20070212.0528). A mass vaccination program was carried out in the region at that time. That vaccination effort may account for there being no additional cases currently. There is no indication in the above report if there have been routine YF vaccination efforts in the region. - Mod.TY
