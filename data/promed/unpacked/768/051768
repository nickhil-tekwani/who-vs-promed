Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials received confirmation of anthrax in a barbary sheep, also known as an aoudad, on a premises in Uvalde County on 18 Aug 2022. This is the 1st case of anthrax in Texas this year [2022].

The premises is located 16 mi [26 km] northwest of Uvalde, Texas, and has been quarantined. TAHC rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses on the premises prior to release of the quarantine.

"The TAHC is closely monitoring the situation in Uvalde County," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC state veterinarian and executive director. "Producers are encouraged to consult their veterinary practitioner or TAHC Region Office for questions about the disease in livestock and a medical professional with concerns about personal anthrax exposure."

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. Anthrax cases in Texas are most often found in a triangular area bound by the towns of Uvalde, Ozona, and Eagle Pass. It is common to see an increase in anthrax cases after periods of wet, cool weather followed by hot, dry conditions. In this case, rainfall exposed the contaminated spores and provided opportunities for animals to inhale the spores or ingest the anthrax bacteria while consuming grass and hay. Outbreaks usually end when cooler weather arrives.

After exposure to anthrax, it typically takes 3-7 days for animals to show clinical signs. Once symptoms begin, death will usually occur within 48 hours. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are all common signs of anthrax in livestock. If you see wild or exotic deer dying more than 10 animals at a time, and carcasses show bleeding characteristic of anthrax, move livestock away from carcasses immediately.

Owners of livestock and animals displaying clinical signs consistent with anthrax or experiencing death of animals should contact a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official immediately. Producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions when handling affected livestock or carcasses. It is recommended to wear protective gloves and long-sleeve shirts and to wash thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

An effective vaccine for livestock is available and is commonly used in areas that are prone to have anthrax.

[It is sad, though comforting, to have one's prediction on an anthrax outbreak confirmed. This area of Texas is dense with past deer and livestock anthrax outbreaks over previous years. So it would not be surprising if other deer and livestock ranches in the area are similarly affected in the next week or 2. The report carries a map showing the general area in Texas at risk.

Aoudad sheep are spectacular large and bright coloured, and their flocks are tight, usually led by an alpha-ram. They stand out. The ram's skull and horns are dramatic and make a great wall display for those given or wanting to shoot them as "game." But this is Texas, and I admit to having one in my office from a ranch in the Uvalde area, and possibly the one where this outbreak occurred. The game ranches are well aware of the risk and nature of anthrax outbreaks.

It was pointed out to me -- many thanks! -- that Argentina suffered a similar rain-initiated anthrax epidemic in 2013. The links are listed below in the see alsos. With thanks to Alex Martinez, and thanks to my fellow moderator Mod.TG in Texas for the prompt following the TAHC report on this outbreak near Uvalde. - Mod.MHJ
