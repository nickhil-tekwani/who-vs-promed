[In contrast with earlier follow-up reports, the 2 recent follow-up reports, nos. 15 and 16, do not include location names; only the municipality's name is indicated. However, the exact location of each case remains available by the given coordinates (published in WAHIS archive at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000029132_20190107_141903.pdf).

According to the provided coordinates, the most westwards outbreak (dead, ASF confirmed boar) so far was reported in follow-up report no. 15, submitted 31 Dec 2018. This refers to outbreak 10, as follows:
Location: Meix-devant-Virton, Luxembourg (given coordinates: latitude 49.63, longitude 5.44).
Date of start of the outbreak: 25 Dec 2018
Outbreak status: resolved (25 Dec 2018)
Epidemiological unit: forest
Affected animals: one wild boar (_Sus scrofa_), found dead
(http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=29093)

The above location is considered, according its coordinates, to be situated less than 1.5 km [0.9 mi] from the French border.

The French TV France3 published on Mon 7 Jan 2019 the following data (in French, trans. & summ.; available at https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/grand-est/peste-porcine-epidemie-se-rapproche-lorraine-1602473.html):

"In Lorraine and Belgium, measures to prevent the spread of African swine fever have been strengthened to prevent the spread of the virus in pig farms. A total of 30 km [18.6 mi] of fences have already been laid to prevent wild boars from passing to France. This Monday, 7 Jan 2019, an additional fence of 15 km [9.3 mi] is installed at the French border from the Orval Forest in Sommethonne, to the town of Meix-devant-Virton (map at https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Iytk-rH5Zulj7pSB6xw3XIy3eRmHXP9D&ll=49.61262954173572%2C5.401424099999986&z=13).

"In Belgium, in a reinforced observation zone, hunters are invited to exterminate the species: traps, baits, exceptional bonuses to hunters for killed boar.

"Initially, the experts estimated that the disease was expected to advance about 1.2 km [0.75 mi] per month. Now, they judge it at 3 km [1.9 mi] per month, reflecting an increased acceleration of the epidemic."

ASF reached the territory of the municipality Meix-devant-Virton, bordering France, on 30 Nov 2018. It has spread westwards since; on 14 Dec 2018, it was reported from Gerouville (see RFI in ProMED-mail archive no. 20190103.6241296). Since then, 17 additional outbreaks have been reported from this municipality. - Mod.AS
