The provincial health office raised its dengue alert level after the number
of dengue fever cases in Pangasinan increased in June.
The PHO recorded 63 dengue fever cases last month, the highest this year.
At least 125 cases were recorded from January to June. The mosquito-borne
disease has claimed the lives of two children this year. They were a
7-year-old girl of Alaminos town who died in May and a 5-month-old girl of
San Carlos City who died in January.
Dr. Alyle Ochotorena, provincial health officer, said the number of dengue
cases ballooned this year because of "correct reporting." "There is an
increased awareness now among people. Once they experience (the) symptoms
of the disease, they immediately go to hospitals," she said.
Ochotorena said the PHO has conducted fogging operations in several public
schools and villages in western Pangasinan where the number of dengue cases
is high.
In Nueva Ecija, dengue fever claimed 6 lives and downed 742 persons in the
province from January to July 5 this year, the provincial health office
said. Dr. Bienvenido de Guzman, provincial health officer, said 2 of the
fatalities were from San Isidro town. Cabanatuan City and the towns of
Aliaga, Zaragoza and General Natividad have had one fatality each.
The number of dengue fever cases in Nueva Ecija represented 22.08 percent
of the total number of cases in the country since January, according to the
Department of Health.
De Guzman said Cabanatuan had the most dengue fever cases in Nueva Ecija
with 202. Bongabon town, which was earlier reported to have a dengue fever
outbreak, had 69 cases.

42 fall ill as dengue strikes Ecija
------------------------------------
Dengue cases are again on the rise in Nueva Ecija with the number of
patients admitted in local hospitals placed at 42 in just a week.
This time, the deadly _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes spared no one, not even
some local doctors and their families. Six members of the family of a top
official of the Nueva Ecija Doctors Hospital here, are under observation in
the hospital since yesterday.
Last month, a surgeon at the Paulino J. Garcia Memorial Research and
Medical Center died of dengue. A son of another doctor also died last
April, said Dr. Benjamin Morales, medical center director.
Initial count showed 16 patients at the Doctors Hospital; 18 children, aged
4 to 10 years old, and 4 adults at the Paulino J. Garcia hospital; and 4 at
the Good Samaritan Hospital. More cases are being admitted in other big
hospitals and clinics in towns outside Cabanatuan, the provincial health
office said.
Morales reiterated the use of insect repellent for the peoples' safety.
"Dengue mosquitoes do not choose where to hover and whom to bite, whether
you are rich or poor. The key word is to be more conscious about basic
sanitary practices," he said.
