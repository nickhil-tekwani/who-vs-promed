Gilead said on Wednesday [29 Apr 2020] that the drug, which is given intravenously, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19 and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection. Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has launched a national viral genomics consortium to better sequence the transmission of COVID-19.
- "No miracle": What explains Bali's low coronavirus cases?
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/miracle-explains-bali-coronavirus-cases-200502035557649.html

An estimated 1.3 million Chinese tourists visited Bali in 2019 and another 110 000 in January [2020] before tourists from China were banned on 2 Feb [2020] [File: Ian Neubauer/Al Jazeera].

The Indonesian resort island of Bali, which received half a million international tourists per month until visas on arrival were halted on 20 Mar [2020], is now the site of a medical mystery that has beguiled many: there are no visible signs of a widespread coronavirus pandemic here.

"I was wrong, and I'm starting to question the assumptions behind these models, because the rate of transmission is a lot lower than expected," said Dr Panji Hadisoemarto, an epidemiologist at Padjadjaran University in Java. "But the real question is, is this real or just an artefact of under-reporting?"

Indonesia has one of the worst COVID-19 testing rates in the world: only 374 per million compared with 20 241 per million in the US and 24 600 in Singapore, according to coronavirus tallying site Worldometer. In Bali, an island of about 4 million people, there were only about 1300 tests conducted so far.

"Either there is no transmission in Bali, or the transmission is silent because people are getting infected but most of them are asymptomatic," he said, adding that either answer leads to more questions. "Does it have anything to do with genetics, the lifestyle in Bali, or how the virus behaves in the tropics?"

Epidemiologist Dr Dicky Budiman, who helped formulate Indonesia's Ministry of Health pandemic-management strategy for 20 years, said the spread is going undetected because of a lack of testing and underreporting caused by cultural norms that encourage traditional healing at home. He also theorised that many COVID-19 infections in Bali are being misdiagnosed as dengue fever, a disease spread by mosquitoes. "There is an extraordinarily high number of dengue cases in Bali right now, more than 2100 cases, and I believe that is because testing for dengue is easier, cheaper, and faster than testing for COVID-19."

Udayana University Professor Gusti Ngurah Mahardika, Bali's most senior virologist, pointed out that the virus does not transmit as effectively in tropical climates like Bali's. "I have published a paper that argues COVID-19 might be sensitive to heat and humidity as has been reported with MERS and SARS," he says.

"The higher the temperature, the higher the humidity and direct exposure to sunlight will further shorten the life span of the COVID-19 in the air and on non-porous surfaces. This is good news for Indonesia," Indonesian President Joko Widodo said, basing his statement on "emerging findings" released by the US Department of Homeland Security.

But the heat theory fails to account for infection rates in Singapore, which has very similar meteorological conditions to Bali, but experienced a daily jump of more than 1400 confirmed COVID-19 cases on 20 Apr [2020], despite having one of the world's strictest lockdowns.

In the Brazilian city of Manaus, where meteorological and demographical conditions are also almost identical to those in Bali, Mayor Virgilio Neto described the situation as a "horror movie," with bodies piling up in refrigerated trucks, mass graves being dug outside cemeteries, and a healthcare system that has collapsed.

Prof. Mahardika qualifies his responses by saying it's all guesswork because of the limited testing.

Dr Hadisoemarto concurs: "The truth is no one can explain what is happening in Bali. It's very interesting, and someone needs to go there and do the research because it could help us come up with an answer to stop COVID-19 in its tracks."

Case definitions
-----------------
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) document, which includes surveillance definitions.

Definition of COVID-19 death:
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g., trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.

Surveillance

[With the addition of Tajikistan (European region) and Comoros (African region) reported on 1 May 2020, the number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is now 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 48 674 new cases (52.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 3109 deaths (53.6% of the global newly reported deaths). Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 65.3% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 14.8%, Peru at 6.3%, and Canada at 3.3%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 42.7% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 18.0%, Canada at 9.5%, Mexico at 8.4%, Ecuador at 8.3%, Chile at 5.8%, and the Dominican Republic at 1.9%.

The European region reported 30 620 new cases (33.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 2386 deaths (41.1% of the global newly reported deaths). Russia reported 31.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 20.3%, Germany 8.4%, Turkey 7.1%, Italy 6.4%, and Belarus 2.9%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6406 new cases (7.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 143 deaths (2.5% of the global newly reported deaths). Saudi Arabia reported 21.0% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 20.2%, Iran at 15.7%, Qatar 10.7%, and the United Arab Emirates at 8.7%.

The African region reported 1310 new cases (1.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 40 deaths (0.69% of the global newly reported deaths). South Africa reported 23.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 18.2%, Cameroon at 18.1%, Algeria at 11.3%, and Senegal at 6.9%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1565 new cases (1.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 39 deaths (0.67% of the global newly reported deaths). Singapore reported 59.6% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 18.1%, Japan at 16.9%, and Malaysia at 4.4%.

The South-East Asia region reported 3402 new cases (3.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 82 deaths (1.4% of the global newly reported deaths). India reported 67.4% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 16.8% and Indonesia at 12.7%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 51.5% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 39.0%, and the Maldives 6.5%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 2 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.UBA
