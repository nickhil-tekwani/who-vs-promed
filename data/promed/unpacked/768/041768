At least 8 people have died and more than 180 others are infected in a cholera epidemic that is sweeping across 2 health districts in Cameroon's Southwest region, international medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Tuesday [30 Nov 2021].

"The Ekondo Titi Health District has reported over 160 cases of cholera, with 62 patients hospitalized at the Cholera Treatment Unit, 15 patients treated at the Oral Rehydration points, and 5 deaths recorded. The Bakassi Health district has also reported 29 suspected cases with 3 deaths from 27 Oct 2021 to 29 Nov 2021. The condition is particularly worrying because it means that cholera has spread in the community," Donatien Tshishimbi, MSF Medical Coordinator said in a statement. The population is vulnerable to infectious diseases like cholera because access to health care is difficult and the living conditions are poor, MSF said.

The international medical charity has established 2 cholera treatment centers and dispatched a team of health personnel to the affected areas to provide free treatment to the population. In early November 2021, the country's health authorities in the region warned that cholera was spreading in parts of the region accompanied by a rise in COVID-19 cases.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Taraba state)

A fresh outbreak of cholera has been reported in one of the 16 local government councils of Taraba State. The outbreak, as gathered by the Daily Post, occurred on Thursday [25 Nov 2021] in the Jen-Ardido community of the Karim-Lamido Local Government Council. Confirming the report, the council chairman, Markus Hamidu, also admitted that no fewer than 13 victims of the outbreak have as well been hospitalized with the death of one person.

An official of the state ministry of health who also admitted that there is an outbreak of the epidemic in the council, also noted that several cases of cholera have been recorded in different parts of the state.

The outbreak came barely 3 months after the outbreak of the disease in Tella village of Gassol Local Government Council; the situation led to several deaths and scores hospitalized.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
