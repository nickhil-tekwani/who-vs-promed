Public health officials are worried an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at a suburban Chicago retirement home appears to be spreading with 2 new cases in the nearby community.

Legionnaire's is a flu-like illness contracted when infected water vapor is inhaled. The elderly and people with weakened immune systems can be particularly susceptible.

The Illinois Department of Public Health reported 12 cases at Covenant Assisted Living in Batavia through August [2019]. The 2 new cases were reported in recent days. State officials say the retirement home plans to clean its water systems, including cooling towers that release water drops into the air.

The agency's director, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, says there could be additional cases, even with corrective measures.

Illinois reported over 500 cases of Legionnaires' disease in 2018.

The Illinois Department of Public Health reported [Sat 14 Sep 2019] that 2 more people in Batavia have contracted Legionnaires' disease, after 12 were already found with the infection at a retirement home in the west suburb.

The 2 new cases were discovered [Thu 12 Sep 2019], health officials said. Unlike the previous 12 cases confirmed since [31 Aug 2019], which were found in residents at the Covenant Living in Holmstad retirement home, the 2 newest cases were "community based."

Legionnaires', a form of pneumonia, is a serious lung infection that people contract by breathing in small water droplets containing the Legionella bacteria, officials said. It is mostly dangerous to people over the age of 50 or to those with increased risk factors, such as current or former smokers and people with chronic diseases or immune problems.

"As the epidemiological and environmental investigation of this Legionnaires' disease cluster continues, it is important to release this information to ensure that nearby residents are aware and seek treatment if they become symptomatic," IDPH director Ngozi Ezike said in a statement.

After identifying the most recent cases, the IDPH has taken samples of potential sources within a one-mile [approx. 1.6 km] radius of the Covenant Living campus, officials said.

Legionnaires' symptoms begin to show about 2 weeks after exposure, officials said. Those symptoms include a high fever, chills, muscle aches, cough and shortness of breath.

More than 200 cases have been confirmed in the state so far this year [2019]. Illinois saw 512 reported cases of Legionnaires' disease statewide in 2018.

As many as 12 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been reported since August [2019] at the Covenant Living at the Holmstad retirement facility at 700 W. Fabyan Parkway in Batavia.

A total of 4 more cases of Legionnaires' disease have been reported at a retirement home in west suburban Batavia, bringing the total to 12 confirmed cases. The new cases were confirmed [Wed 11 Sep 2019] at Covenant Living at the Holmstad and reported to both Kane County and the Illinois Department of Public Health, according to Amanda Gosnell, Executive Director of Covenant Living. "As we continue to partner with IDPH in the investigation of the campus to search for any other risk points, we are pursuing all possible interventions to protect resident and employee safety and well-being," Gosnell said.

The 1st 4 cases of Legionnaires' at Covenant Living, 700 W. Fabyan Pkwy., were announced [31 Aug 2019] by the Kane County Health Department. On [9 Sep 2019], the Health Department announced 4 more cases, bringing the total to 8. A spokesperson for the Kane County Health Department could not be reached [Wed 11 Sep 2019] for comment on the new cases. "We await more thorough results from the state testing and pray that a source can, if at all, be identified, either on or off our campus," Gosnell said.

_Legionella_ bacteria are transmitted through water droplets in the air and can cause serious lung infections and death. Illinois saw 512 reported cases of Legionnaires' disease statewide in 2018, with 219 confirmed so far this year [2019], the Health Department said.

[The news reports above say that 14 cases of legionnaires' disease have been reported since August 2019 in the city of Batavia, Illinois, a suburb of nearby Chicago; 12 cases reside in Covenant Living at the Holmstad, a residence for the elderly, and 2 cases reside in the surrounding community (https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20190916/batavia-woman-one-of-two-new-legionnaires-cases-outside-senior-living-community). A map showing the location of Covenant Living at Holmstad can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Covenant+Living+at+the+Holmstad.

Inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ is a common way for acquiring Legionnaires ' disease, and aerosols containing _Legionella_ can be generated from contaminated water by cooling towers, hot tubs, fountains, showerheads, and misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments. We are told that the mode of transmission in the Batavia outbreak is suspected to be inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_. However, in the elder who are prone to aspirate, contaminated drinking water may be another possible mode of transmission. Prevention in these circumstances should include use of only bottled water until the source is identified and remediated.

Genotyping of clinical and environmental isolates should be done. Cases from the Covenant Living residence and the surrounding Batavia community with matching _Legionella_ genotypes will establish a cluster with a common source and matching clinical and environmental isolates will establish a source responsible for the particular cluster. - Mod.ML
