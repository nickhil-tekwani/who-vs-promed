First report of the presence of the lethal yellowing group (16Sr IV)
of phytoplasmas in the weeds _Emilia fosbergii_ and _Synedrella
nodiflora_ in Jamaica
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coconut lethal yellowing (CLY) disease is the single most important
disease affecting coconuts in Jamaica. A study was conducted in 2005
to investigate alternate hosts of the CLY phytoplasma affecting
coconuts. Weeds have been known to act as reservoir hosts of many
plant pathogens. As a result, weeds growing in areas where coconuts
are planted were tested for the presence of the CLY phytoplasma. The
weeds _Emilia fosbergii_ and _Synedrella nodiflora_ (both Family
_Asteraceae_) were collected at random from coconut farms in areas
that had high as well as low incidences of CLY. None of the weeds
were symptomatic. DNA from weed samples and reference coconut trunk
sample (coconut plant infected with CLY) was done and nested PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] was conducted (Harrison et al., 2002a & 2002b).
A 1.6 kb [kilobases] amplicon [DNA fragment] was obtained from 9/51
_E. fosbergii_ plants tested and 4/36 _S. nodiflora_ plants. The
amplicons were compared by RFLP [restriction fragment length
polymorphism] to that of the CLY reference sample and were found
identical to that of the reference sample. Amplicons from _E.
fosbergii_ and _S. nodiflora_ were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of
the sequences showed a 99 percent similarity to that of coconut
lethal yellowing phytoplasma in Jamaica, Nevis, and Florida, members
of the 16Sr IV group of phytoplasmas.
This is the 1st report of the lethal yellowing (16Sr IV) group of
phytoplasmas affecting the weeds _E. fosbergii_ and _S. nodiflora_ in
Jamaica. Recognition of weeds as hosts of 16Sr IV group of
phytoplasmas in Jamaica has epidemiological significance and suggests
that weed control in and around coconuts may benefit disease
management over the long term. It also lends credence to the
possibility of the existence of another CLY vector other than _Myndus
crudus_, which has been known to feed only on monocotyledonous plants.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) was 1st reported from the Caribbean region and
by 1981 it had killed 90 percent of the Jamaica Tall variety of
coconut palms in Jamaica. LY is spreading in the Americas and parts
of Africa and has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in
affected areas. It is caused by the phytoplasma _Candidatus_
Phytoplasma palmae, which can infect a large number of palm species.
Transmission is thought to occur by the planthopper _Myndus crudus_,
but seed-transmission cannot be excluded. Symptoms may be suppressed
by tetracycline, but commercial control of LY is primarily being
achieved by replanting with resistant varieties (see ProMED-mail post
20070522.1643)
16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) sequences were adopted as a framework for
formal taxonomic classification of phytoplasmas, a unique taxonomic
group of small, unculturable, intracellular, plant parasitic bacteria
within the group of the Mollicutes. One of the primary groups defined
is the palm lethal yellowing group (type member _C._ P. palmae),
which was designated as group 16SrIV. A number of LY group 16SrIV
strains have since been described from Jamaica, Florida, Mexico, and
elsewhere. Different strains associated with decline of coconut
(strain LDY) and yellows disease of the cyclanth (strain CPY), have
been identified from other sources. Several other distinct strains
were found associated with leaf yellowing syndromes of coconut palm
in LY-free areas of Mexico.
The discovery of asymptomatic dicot weeds as reservoir hosts of _C._
P. palmae is a very important finding for disease management of LY,
as well as for research on phytoplasmas in general. However, many
questions still remain about the epidemiology of LY, for example
whether another vector is involved for spread between palms and weeds
and whether there is a difference between phytoplasma strains that
infect monocots and dicots. Sequence comparison in this publication
only includes the 1.6 kb fragment and does not exclude that some
differences may occur elsewhere in the genome. Precise identification
of strains is important for understanding disease epidemiology.
RFLP is a method to search for mutations that may distinguish closely
related target DNA molecules (for example different isolates of a
microorganism or varieties of a plant species). Since it is much less
labour intensive than sequencing, it may be used to reduce the number
of candidates that need to be sequenced.
