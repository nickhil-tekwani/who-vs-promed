[This is the 1st OIE confirmed ranavirus report from the Netherlands.
On 19 Sep 2010, a single wild marsh frog (_Rana ridibunda_) was found
dead in a lake at Dwingelerveld National Park, Drenthe province, which
is in the northeast of Netherlands. PCR test results were positive for
ranavirus. However, no further detail is provided in this OIE report.
Missing information that could help us better understand this incident
is detail of the surveillance program for ranavirus in the
Netherlands, such as sampling locations, frequency and how many
animals were tested.

This report is actually not the 1st published record of ranavirus in
the Netherlands, the 1st report was in 2004 from imported pet newts,
as summarised in this abstract:

"A mass die-off of imported red tailed knobby newts (_Tylototriton
kweichowensis_) occurred in 2004 in Belgium and the Netherlands. In
addition to massive infection with _Rhabdias tokyoensis_, a parasitic
nematode worm, Ranavirus was isolated from 3 dead newts examined
virologically, and the gene coding for the major capsid protein of the
virus was sequenced. The isolate showed 99.8 percent similarity to the
published sequence of frog virus 3. Upon experimental infection of
axolotls (_Ambystoma mexicanum_) with this isolate, no marked
pathology was noticed, and the virus could not be re-isolated at 9
weeks post-inoculation. Apart from the possibility of exposure of a
non-sensitive host, the mortality episode in the newts may be related
to stress resulting from the importation of the newts in breeding
condition. This possibility is supported by the presence of
degenerating egg-follicles in the females." (The Veterinary Journal,
Volume 176, Issue 2, May 2008, Pages 257-259,
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17449300>.)

Ranaviruses are non-zoonotic viruses of the _Iridoviridae_ family
that mainly affect amphibians, but there are also reports in fishes
and turtles. It was 1st described in 1966 but not associated with
disease until the 1980's, when mass die-offs of frogs were 1st seen.
Ranavirus has now been reported on every continent except Africa.

The mode of transmission is via contaminated water. The most common
presentation is an explosive mortality event with death due to
peracute systemic haemorrhagic disease. In these cases, usually there
are no external lesions. Diagnosis is by virus culture followed by
identification using electron microscope or PCR. Direct electron
microscope or PCR examination of diseased tissues can also be used.
There is currently no known prevention or control method. For
aquaculture, a 4 percent concentration of sodium hypochlorite can be
used to disinfect premises, and ozone water can be used to sterilise
water.

A study in the UK has confirmed that ranavirus not only causes sudden
mass-mortality events, but also long term population declines. The
researchers examined wild common frog (_Rana temporaria_) numbers in a
selection of populations around the country where ranavirus disease
had been previously reported since 1996. The finding was that half of
the populations has had repeated outbreaks of the disease. In almost a
quarter of the cases, frog numbers had dropped by 81 percent over the
last 12 years. (Animal Conservation Volume 13, Issue 5, Pages 514-522
<http://www.savethefrogs.com/chytrid/ranavirus/articles/teacher-2010-ranavirus-common-frog-declines.pdf>.)

OIE currently has 2 diseases of amphibians on their reporting list:
_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ and infection with ranavirus, with
ranavirus reports to the OIE starting in 2009. Up till today, there
has been confirmed clinical infection in 3 countries: Canada, Japan
and the USA. But surprisingly, the official OIE status of ranavirus in
the UK is suspected but not confirmed.

Ranavirus might actually be underreported to the OIE, as
approximately half of the OIE reporting countries state that "There is
no information available on this disease." Although not officially
reported to the OIE, many times there are scientific papers detailing
the presence of ranavirus, such as this research paper from China
claiming a prevalence of 5.7 percent on adult wild frogs and 42.5% of
tadpoles in Heilongjian Province:

"Ranaviruses have been associated with die-offs in cultured
amphibians in China, but their presence in wild amphibians has not yet
been assessed. We sampled free-ranging _Rana dybowskii_ at 7 sites
throughout Heilongjiang Province to determine the presence and
prevalence of ranaviruses in this region. Our results revealed an
overall infection prevalence of 5.7 percent (18/315) for adults and
42.5 percent (51/120) for tadpoles by PCR. PCR-amplified product
showed a high degree of homology with several members of the
Iridoviridae, mostly with those belonging to the genus Ranavirus. The
results indicate that ranaviruses are broadly distributed throughout
Heilongjiang Province and could have important implications for the
health of native wildlife. Additional sampling and management
strategies should be urgently adopted to address the prevalence and
health consequences of ranaviruses throughout China." (Ecohealth. 2010
Aug;7(1):18-23. Epub 2010 Mar 9.
