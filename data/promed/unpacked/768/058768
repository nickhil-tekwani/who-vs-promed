Britain's 1st ever case of monkeypox in a human was confirmed Saturday night [8 Sep 2018], Public Health England (PHE) announced.

The patient, a Nigerian national, is undergoing expert treatment in the infectious disease unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London after being transferred from at a naval base in Cornwall.

PHE said in a statement: "This is the 1st time this infection has been diagnosed in the UK. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals."

The patient is a resident of Nigeria, which is where they are believed to have contracted the infection, before travelling to Britain, PHE added.

"The infection can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person; however there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population," the statement said.

As a precautionary measure, PHE experts are working closely with the NHS and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice.

This includes contacting a number of passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to Britain. People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly. If passengers are not contacted then there is no action they should take, said a spokesperson for PHE.

Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital in London, said: "Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person's health. Most people recover within several weeks. It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries.

"It does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients."

First case of monkeypox confirmed in England.
------------------------
Public Health England (PHE) can confirm an individual has been diagnosed with monkeypox in England. This is the first time this infection has been diagnosed in the United Kingdom (UK).

Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.

The infection can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person; however there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population.

The patient was staying at a naval base in Cornwall prior to transfer to the expert infectious disease unit at the Royal Free Hospital, London where they are now receiving appropriate care.

The patient is a resident of Nigeria, which is where they are believed to have contracted the infection, before travelling to the UK.

As a precautionary measure, PHE experts are working closely with NHS colleagues and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice.

This includes contacting a number of passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to the UK. People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly. If passengers are not contacted then there is no action they should take.

Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital, said:
:Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person's health. Most people recover within several weeks.

"It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries.

"t does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients."

Dr Nick Phin, Deputy Director, National Infection Service at PHE, said:
" It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.

" Public Health England is following up those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary.

"PHE and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission".

[This case is another example of how rapid, long-distance international movement can bring an infectious pathogen to a location where it has never been before. Nigeria has had many monkeypox cases in 2017-2018 in several states. The most recent cases were in June 2018 in Plateau state. The locality in Nigeria where the individual might have become infected is not stated. These cases in Nigeria were caused by the West African clade of the monkeypox virus, and presmably is the same clade of the virus as infects the above case.

Non-human primates are not a monkeypox virus reservoir. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
