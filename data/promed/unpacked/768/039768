During the period Wed 29 Sep to Tue 5 Oct 2004, a total of 81 cases of
human West Nile virus (WNV) illness were reported from 18 states (Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Texas, and Virginia).
During 2004, a total of 40 states have reported 1865 cases of human WNV

ArboNET (table). Of these, 583 (31 per cent) cases were reported in
California, 370 (20 per cent in Arizona, and 225 (12 per cent) in Colorado.
A total of 1071 (58 per cent) of the 1833 cases for which such data were
available occurred in males; the median age of patients was 51 years
(range: 1 month to 99 years). Illness onset ranged from 23 Apr 2004 to 23
Sep 2004; a total of 59 cases were fatal.
Blood donors
------------
A total of 177 presumptive West Nile viremic blood donors (PVDs) has been
reported to ArboNET in 2004. Of these, 70 (40 per cent) were reported in
California; 37 (21 per cent) in Arizona; 15 in Texas; 12 in New Mexico; 5
each in Colorado, Louisiana, and Nevada; 4 each in Georgia and Oklahoma; 3

state and local health departments.
Dead birds
----------
In addition, during 2004, a total of 4706 dead corvids and 1138 other dead
birds with WNV infection have been reported from 45 states and New York City.
Equines
-------
WNV infections have been reported in horses in 36 states. [Details of the
numbers and distribution of equine cases can be obtained by accessing the
APHIS-USDA map <http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahps/equine/wnv/map2004.html>.
As of Thu 7 Oct 2004, the total number of equine cases in the USA in 2004
now stands at 951, an increase of 192 cases since 22 Sep 2004. California
heads the list with 422 cases (44 per cent of the total), followed by
Arizona with 93 cases, Nevada with 78 cases, Texas with 46 cases, Wyoming
with 31 cases, Oregon 28, Mississippi 27, Colorado with 26 cases, and
another 29 states with 18 or fewer cases. The following states have not
reported cases in 2004: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Louisiana,
Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island,
South Carolina (?), Vermont and Washington. - Mod.CP]
Other animals
-------------
West Nile virus infection has been confirmed in one bat in Wisconsin; 6
dogs in Nevada, New Mexico, and Wisconsin; 6 squirrels in Arizona and
Wyoming; and 13 unidentified animal species in 8 states (Arizona, Idaho,
Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nevada, New York, and South Carolina).
Sentinel chickens and others
----------------------------
WNV seroconversions have been reported in 964 sentinel chicken flocks in 13
states (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Iowa,
Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Utah) and in
25 wild hatchling birds in Missouri and Ohio. 4 seropositive sentinel
horses were reported in Minnesota and Puerto Rico.
Mosquito pools
--------------
A total of 6585 WNV positive mosquito pools have been reported in 36
states, District of Columbia, and New York City. Additional information
about national WNV activity is available from CDC at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm> and at
<http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov>.
[The above report is supplemented by a figure showing the location of the
states reporting cases of human WNV infection in relation to the states
reporting non-human cases of WNV infection only and the remaining states
still to report human cases of WNV this year.
During the past 7 days, the number of human cases has increased by 81 from
1784 to 1865, and the total number of WNV-related deaths has increased by 3
from 56 to 59. These figures record for the first time a decrease in case
numbers (down from 180 to 80) and deaths (down from 8 to 3) in comparison
with the preceding 7 days. - Mod.CP]

California: outbreak of West Nile virus infection in horses declining
-------------------------------------------------
The West Nile virus epidemic in Californian horses appears to be waning
after cases more than doubled during the month of September, a state
veterinary medical officer said Wed 29 Sep 2004. For the state as a whole,
the case load jumped from a little more than 150 confirmed cases in late
August to 386 as of Friday, said C Oliver Kenagy, of the state Department
of Food and Agriculture. Riverside County, which caught the brunt of the
viral epidemic earlier this year, saw only 6 new cases between 17 and 23
Sep 2004, bringing the county's total case count for the year to 85 horses
with 45 deaths. "I'd say we're on the downswing," Kenagy said.
The veterinarian reported the figures to about 50 Norco residents, mostly
horse owners, who showed up for a West Nile information meeting at Nellie
Weaver Hall in Norco on Wednesday night. The meeting was co-sponsored by
the city, the Fort Dodge Pharmaceutical Co, the Northwest Mosquito and
Vector Control District, Norco Animal Control and the Norco Horsemen's
Association.
About half of Riverside County's 85 cases probably occurred in the Norco
area, Kenagy said. The fatality rate for infected horses in California has
reached about 43 per cent, well above the roughly 30 per cent seen in other
states. By year's end, however, that percentage could drop, Kenagy said.
Representatives of Fort Dodge Pharmaceutical, which manufactures one of 2
available West Nile vaccines for horses, provided the horse owners with a
primer on the mosquitoborne disease and what symptoms to look for. The
company's vaccine appears to have limited the epidemic's spread, company
spokeswoman Sara Cash said.
The number of equine cases nationally dropped from more than 15 000 in 2002
to a little more than 5000 in 2003. The Fort Dodge vaccine became fully
licensed in February 2003. Norco Animal Control superintendent Renee Power
encouraged horse owners to keep their animals current with vaccinations and
booster shots.

Mexico: West Nile virus infection surveillance data as of Thu 30 Sep 2004
---------------------------------------------------
[The following figures have been extracted from the Resumen Epidemiologico
file accompanying the pictorial maps of West Nile virus activity in Mexico:
<http://www.cenave.gob.mx/von/archivos/ResumenCASOSVON.xls> - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - humans
--------------------------
As of Thu 30 Sep 2004, the figures remain unchanged from those reported on
Tue 9 Sep 2004; that is, a total of 210 individuals resident in 25 of the
32 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection: 209
were seronegative and asymptomatic, and one individual in the state of
Sonora exhibited signs of disease. [see: West Nile virus - Mexico (Sonora)
20040905.2486]
Cumulative totals - equines
---------------------------
As of Thu 30 Sep 2004, a total of 2871 (an increase of 165) horses from 30
of the 32 states had been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection.
Of these animals 2103 (an increase of 63) were seronegative and 768 (an
increase of 102) were seropositive. All these animals were asymptomatic.
Cumulative totals - birds
-------------------------
As of Thu 30 Sep 2004, the figures remain unchanged from those reported on
Tue 9 Sep 2004; that is, a total of 738 birds from 7 of the 32 states have
been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds 685
were seronegative and 51 were seropositive (and considered to be
asymptomatic), and one case in the state of Sonora and one case in the
state of Baja California exhibited signs of disease. (Initially both birds
appear to have been assigned to the state of Sonora). The seropositive
birds were detected in the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Queretaro and
Yucatan.
[Sonora state, where the single human case and one of the 2 avian cases
were confirmed, shares its northern border with the state of Arizona in the
USA. Seropositive equines were reported from 25 of the 32 states with 65
per cent reported from the 3 states of Guerrero (160), Sonora (222), and
Veracruz (118). In contrast to the situation in the United States, none of
the seropositive equines exhibited signs of disease. - Mod.CP]
