North east health experts moved to reassure the public on 3 Dec 2002 after
it emerged that a fifth member of an Aberdeenshire family had the
potentially deadly _Escherichia coli_ O157 bacterium. The father in the
family confirmed yesterday that both he and his 6 year old son had tested
positive for the organism. His 2 year old daughter is on a life support
machine in Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital. She was the first of the family of
7 to show signs of the illness, on Sun, 1 Dec 2002.
The other 2 daughters, aged 4 and 1, are said to be in satisfactory
condition in Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital. Only the mother, who is
keeping a bedside vigil over her daughter in Glasgow, and the son, age 5,
have tested negative.
NHS Grampian said last night that, although the cause of the outbreak was
unknown, it was believed to be a "family cluster", and posed no risk to the
public. Dr Helen Howie, a consultant in public health with NHS Grampian,
said: "We believe that this is what we term a family cluster, and we know
from experience that this infection can spread easily within families.
There is no evidence to suggest that there is a risk to the wider
population. We are continuing to investigate, but as yet we have no
evidence to suggest how this infection was acquired. Sometimes, despite our
best efforts, we may never be able to pinpoint a specific source."
She added, "However, we do want to remind everyone of the 2 important
things that we can all do to prevent the spread of bacterial infections
like _E. coli_ O157, and also the gastrointestinal viruses that are common
in the community at the present time. One is to remember the importance of
personal hygiene and especially thorough hand washing. The second is that
anyone who does have symptoms of diarrhea and or vomiting should not be at
work or school and should remain at home until 48 hours after their
symptoms have completely settled."
Aberdeen-based Professor Hugh Pennington, a world-renowned expert on _E.
coli_ O157, said there was no cause for concern in the community. "The odds
are they will never find the source of the outbreak, but it is most likely
one of the kids brought it into the house from outside. It is strongly
linked to animal manure and is more prominent in the north east than
anywhere else in the world. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do to
stop it -- it really is a matter of luck."
He added: "This is a case of a family outbreak, which always remain
restricted to the family. There is no danger to the public at all. However,
it does act as a reminder of its existence and the need for people to
remain extremely hygiene conscious."

[Although no other cases have yet been reported, and while it is true that
close person to person contact as in a family setting may spread the
organism, the source is, as stated, not known. If it was foodborne, other
individuals may be at risk from the same source. If it was contacted from a
petting zoo, the risk, likewise, still remains. The importance of
appropriate food handling and cooking and good hand washing cannot be
overemphasized, but it must also be stressed that other members of the
community should remain alert to the possibility of other cases. - Mod.LL]
