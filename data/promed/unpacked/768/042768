Rift Valley fever in the United Republic of Tanzania
----------------------------------------------------
Reported outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) among animals began on
18 Jan 2007, with the 1st human case reported at the beginning of
February 2007 in Arusha region. A response team from the Tanzanian
Ministry of Health, WHO (World Health Organisation) Country Office,
WHO Regional Office for Africa, and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) carried out an initial investigation,
including active case finding and specimen collection. The
WHO-accredited Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) laboratory
confirmed 2 cases from Arusha and Tanga. By mid-February 2007, 8
cases were reported: 4 fatal cases were confirmed by KEMRI, while the
remaining 4 cases from Arusha, Mangara, and Tanga were hospitalized.
The United Nations Emergency Coordination Group of WHO, FAO (United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation), UNICEF (United Nations
Children Fund), and WFP (United Nations World Food Programme) has
been providing support to the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and the
Ministry of Livestock. In addition to continued technical and
financial support, WHO has also provided training in patient care for
clinical staff and in diagnostic techniques for laboratory staff.
With UNICEF, WHO has also trained journalists and other media staff
to increase public awareness about the disease and how to prevent it.
In mid-March [2007], new clusters of RVF cases occurred. Fifty-eight
suspected cases, including 14 deaths, with 8 specimens confirmed
positive were reported from Dodoma region. In addition, 60 new
suspected cases were reported from Morogoro region.
WHO is concerned about the recent increase in human cases. It is
particularly important to increase community awareness as well as to
improve the coordination with veterinary services to contain the
outbreak. A WHO outbreak response team from the Department of
Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response (EPR) and the Regional
Office for Africa will be assisting the WHO Country Office in the
assessment of the outbreak, including the cases in Dodoma and
Morogoro, and refining the health component of the emergency response
plan, including the early warning system, active case detection, case
management, and social mobilization.

[ProMED-mail posting Rift Valley fever, Eastern Africa (23): Tanzania
(Dodoma) 20070320.0983, included the following information:
"Veterinary officials in Kenya said the ongoing domestic animal
vaccination campaign could be the cause of the rampant spread of RVF".
Subsequently, we approached Prof Glyn Davies, a world authority on
RVF, for advise regarding the above concerns and about the evolvement
of the outbreak in Tanzania; we are very grateful for Glyn's
following authoritative commentary. - Mod.AS]
RVF virus has not spread to Dodoma and Morogoro regions from Kenya.
It has been known to be enzootic there for many years, and the data
is recorded in the Tanzanian Veterinary Department annual reports and
various publications. It would have emerged and virus activity would
have been occurring following the excessive rainfall and flooding in
the region late in 2006.
There appears to be a lack of awareness of the basic natural history
of the RVF virus. It is transovarially transmitted in floodwater
breeding _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The virus emerges and amplification will
occur with successive cycles of transmission. Factors affecting this
are the persistence of the flooding and the generation of huge
populations of mosquito species breeding in the floodwater, which are
capable of secondary transmission of the virus. Many _Aedes_,
_Culex_, and other mosquito species can do this. The amplification
cycles will involve the indigenous ruminant populations as feeding
hosts, most of which would be unlikely to manifest any clinical signs
of disease. The length of the acute epidemic curve will depend on the
persistence of the floodwater but is usually of only 3-4 months
duration(*), with some cases lasting for 2-4 more months.
Indigenous sheep, goats, and zebu-type [_Bos indicus_] cattle are
relatively resistant to RVF infection. During this period, clinical
disease in man might be the 1st indication of any RVF virus activity.
RVF disease might also be seen in exotic breeds of cattle and sheep
or goats and their crosses; they would abort and young animals may
show clinical signs of disease. These may not be present in many RVF
enzootic areas in Africa. Without these indicator disease hosts, the
RVF virus activity would be cryptic.
The current epizootic in eastern Africa appears to be following the
expected time scale. There may have been alterations to the curve,
which have followed the effective transmission of virulent RVF virus
caused by the widespread vaccination programmes. These may have
involved hundreds of thousands of animals, which would not have been
otherwise affected.
Vaccination with the Smithburn MLVV (modified live virus vaccine)
strain (**) or any other vaccine is totally contraindicated at any
time when active virus transmission is taking place.
It was for this reason that we developed early warning strategies, to
identify the pre epizootic conditions for RVF (see my various
references) and allow for pre epizootic vaccination programmes to be
carried out before the disease occurs. FAO/EMPRES (Emergency
Prevention System) division in Rome used the predictive model
developed in Kenya, and predicted this epizootic long before it
occurred (August-September 2006, I believe).
Vaccination of animal populations during periods when RVF virus is
actively being transmitted by vectors, will serve to propagate the
virus very effectively by needle passage. The virus is readily
transmitted by infected needles from animal to animal. The apparent
increase in cases in the Dodoma region is likely to be due to this.
The information from our Predictive Models to provide Early Warning
of Epizootic RVF virus activity and to drive Emergency Preparedness
has been our objective.
(*) This is the time period in the flood plains of North-Eastern
Kenya and Somalia. It may recur, sporadically, for around 18 months-2
years after the rains in the highlands and coastal areas of eastern Africa.
(**) The vaccine is cheap and easy to produce but causes problems in
susceptible sheep breeds (abortions and foetal abnormalities in
around 10 percent). It is safe in cattle and non-pregnant animals.

[Besides the specific hazards related to the use of the Smithburn
vaccine, special attention should be paid to Dr Davies' warning
against any mass application of injection needles in ruminants during
RVF epizootics. His remarks about the possible negative impact of the
(belated) vaccinations upon animal health, with subsequent enhanced
dissemination of the RVF virus, fall in line with the timeline of
events as recorded. According to official information, the RVF
outbreak in Tanzania started on 18 Jan 2007, while the 1st batch of
vaccines arrived (from South Africa) on 2 Mar 2007, followed by mass
vaccinations (see ProMED-mail posting Rift Valley fever - Eastern
Africa (20): wildlife, not 20070305.0777).
Additional background information can be found in an earlier
commentary by Peter Roeder, FAO (see ProMED-mail posting Rift valley
fever - Eastern Africa: Somalia, Kenya 20070112.0164).
A detailed, useful review of RVF in humans and animals, including
accumulated data on its epidemiology, is available at
