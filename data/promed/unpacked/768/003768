MALFORMATION DISEASE, MANGO - AUSTRALIA: (QUEENSLAND), ALERT

Biosecurity Queensland is investigating a suspected case of Mango
Malformation Disease (MMD), a slow moving fungal disease, identified
on a single property at Caboolture.

Biosecurity Queensland Mark Panitz said the property had been placed
under quarantine. "The property is not a commercially-managed
orchard, but we are taking this seriously and moving quickly to
protect Queensland's AUD 70 million [USD 62 million] mango industry,"
he said. "Biosecurity Queensland is already surveying nearby
properties for any evidence of MMD. This is a critical 1st step to
identify where the disease is."

Mr Panitz said MMD could significantly reduce yields in mango
orchards if left unmanaged. The Australian Mango Industry Association
(AMIA) said MMD did not affect the quality of the fruit. Biosecurity
Queensland is working closely with AMIA and the Federal Department of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to ensure any potential impacts
are minimised.

[Mango malformation disease (MMD) is a fungal disease caused by
several species of _Fusarium_, some yet to be described. Mango is the
only known host, and it is one of the most important diseases of this
crop. The disease was 1st reported in India, but has subsequently
been found in many other regions. However, fungal species
contributing to MMD may possibly vary in different areas.

Infected shoots are misshapen with shortened internodes and small
stubby leaves. Inflorescences are shorter, thicker, have crowded
branches, and do not bear fruit. Shoot malformation is most severe on
seedlings but can also seriously affect mature trees. Symptoms are
thought to be a result of hormonal imbalances induced by the fungi.

The epidemiology of MMD is poorly understood. It spreads very slowly,
but if left unchecked, it can severely reduce yields. The main method
of spread to new areas is through infected vegetative planting
material; there is no evidence of spread with fruits or seeds. It is
often associated with the bud mite _Aceria mangiferae_, but the mites
have been shown to spread the disease only within a tree, not between
trees. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitary measures,
removal/exclusion of inoculum, and the use of clean planting material.

Australia was thought to be free of MMD until it was detected in a
small number of trees on a research farm in the Northern Territory in
2008 (ProMED-mail post 20080229.0832). The station was quarantined;
extensive surveys in the area did not detect any additional trees
with MMD symptoms, and affected trees were burnt. It remains to be
clarified what the sources of both the NT and QLD infections may have
been and if the 2 outbreaks are in any way connected.
