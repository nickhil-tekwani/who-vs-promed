[1] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Masvingo Province)

At least 5 cholera cases have been recorded in Chingwizi area, where over 3000 families displaced by flooding [during 2014] along the Tokwe-Mukosi dam basin are staying. An official from the ministry of health in Masvingo told Newzimbabwe.com that there were strong fears that more people could be affected as there are no proper sanitary facilities to cater for the flood victims.

"We have recorded 5 cases of cholera at Chingwizi and laboratory tests are still being carried out on 3 more cases," said an official who refused to be named since he is not allowed to speak to the press. "Masvingo province has so far recorded over 11 cases of cholera but in most cases those affected have since been treated and discharged," added the official.

"The outbreak was first recorded at Chizvirizvi resettlement scheme; patients were treated and discharged and we are happy that no one has died of the disease so far," said the official.

Contacted for comment, Masvingo provincial medical director Robert Mudyiradima confirmed the outbreak of the disease at Chingwizi. "The reason why we have such problems at Chingwizi is because there are no proper sanitary facilities there," said Mudyiradima. The outbreak comes at a time when the government has conceded that Chingiwizi is inhabitable.

[2] Cholera - Tanzania (Mara Region)

2 major markets have been closed indefinitely in Rorya District of Mara Region following an outbreak of cholera in the area. According to the Rorya District Administrative Secretary ((DAS), Mr Daud Murumbe, the closed markets are Utegi and Randa. "Apart from the markets, all small restaurants that were not complying to hygienic regulations were also closed," Mr Murumbe told the 'Daily News'.

"So far, we have 7 cholera patients admitted," the official said, adding that 2 health centers of Utegi and Kowaki have been put on standby to handle cholera patients. The most affected villages include Utegi, Nyanguge and Nyanduga. He said that authorities in Rorya District are doing everything possible to stop further spread of the disease in the area.

"Health officials are also going around the entire district urging people to observe hygiene," the DAS said. Lack of latrines in many homes in Rorya is reportedly making the District prone to frequent cholera outbreaks.

Late last week, Rorya District CCM Chairman, Mr Samwel Keboye called for immediate construction of latrines in all markets scattered in various parts of the District. "Most of the markets have no latrines. This is shameful. All markets must be closed before the situation gets out of hand," the CCM leader said shortly after he visited cholera patients at Utegi health centre where he donated medicines and other items in a bid to improve treatment for patients.

[Mara Region is one of Tanzania's 30 administrative regions. It is located in extreme northern Tanzania, and across Lake Victoria to the northeast is southern Kenya, where cholera is also active.

[Mombasa County is one of the 47 counties of Kenya. Its capital and the only city in the county is Mombasa. Initially it was one of the former Districts of Kenya but in 2013 it was reconstituted as a county, on the same boundaries. It is the smallest county in Kenya, situated in the southeastern part of the former Coast Province and can be seen on a map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa_County.

Mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluids and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), Nova Science Publishers, 2015 (in press):

As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that it was found that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in refugees from war-torn Bangladesh, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally based on glucose or rice powder, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.
