The anthrax disease is increasing in Koraput District due to lack of
awareness among the tribals and negligence of the District Health
Administration and Animal Resources Department. During the last 9
years 45 [people have] died of anthrax, out of 439 [cases].

As per the information, in 1992 an anthrax patient was identified for
the 1st time in Sarapalli of Bandhugan Block. Thereafter anthrax
patients were identified in Narayanpatna, Laxmipur, Dasmantpur,
Baipariguda, Lamtaput, Semeliguda, Potangi, and Nandapur and many of
the them have died. But the district administration has taken no such
eye caching steps for anthrax. [As reported by the government, over
the last 9 years 45 people have died of anthrax, out of 439 affected
people. During 2002, 2 persons died out of 42 cases.] During 2003
[rest of sentence is missing. MHJ]

During 2004, 3 died out of 11 cases; during 2005, 6 died out of 52
cases. During 2006, 4 out of the affected 19 persons died. During the
2007, 11 of 55 affected died. During 2008, 8 out of 68 affected died.
During the year 2009, 3 of 59 affected died. During 2010, none of the
affected 22 persons died.

[Indian health statistics are not totally reliable. These numbers for
Orissa differ from what they have told us before but the story is the
same. Anthrax is a chronic problem in the state and the authorities
appear to be ignoring it, especially when it afflicts the tribals.
And it is not unlikely that the disease springs from the livestock
being fed contaminated feed, such as, oil cakes. This would make it
hop around from one district to another.
