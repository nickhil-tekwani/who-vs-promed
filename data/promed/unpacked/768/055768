Queensland's black sigatoka outbreak is currently confined to 3 confirmed
sites, including one on a commercial plantation, all within 3 km of the
original discovery. The area in question is near Tully in far north
Queensland, approximately 140 km south of Cairns, and is deemed a
significant threat to the region's $200 million banana industry.
Up to 400 growers in a 50 km radius of the outbreak have been forced to
temporarily suspend the movement of all fruit consignments. Personnel from
the Department of Primary Industries have deleafed plants at the commercial
plantation and are conducting intensive sampling and surveillance.
While far north Queensland has recorded 8 outbreaks of black sigatoka in
feral bananas within the past 10 years, this is the first time the fungal
disease has been detected in a commercial production area.

[Many thanks to Rebecca Winter for putting this outbreak of a serious
disease into perspective. Spores of the fungus can be spread over short
distances by splashing rain, and wind is reported to carry the spores over
several kilometers. - Mod.DH
