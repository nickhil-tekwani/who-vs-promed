The avian flu virus involved in an outbreak in British Columbia is related to a deadly strain that has spread through Asia and is now affecting North American poultry for the 1st time, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency says.

Experts say the presence of an avian flu virus with Asian lineage does not increase the danger to humans -- which remains very low -- but it could pose a significant risk to the poultry industry.

Nearly 250 000 chickens and turkeys are either dead or set to be euthanized due to avian flu, which has infected 11 sites in B.C.'s Fraser Valley since the beginning of the month [December 2014].

Officials have already identified the subtype as a highly pathogenic, or high-path, strain of H5N2. Viruses with high pathogenicity kill birds, while their low-path counterparts typically do not.

The agency said tests have determined the virus contains genes both from H5N2, which is common to North American wild birds, as well as genes from a high-path Eurasian strain of H5N8. It keeps the label of H5N2 because its N gene is from H5N2.

"This is the 1st time a Eurasian lineage highly pathogenic H5 virus has caused an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry in North America," it said in a statement. "The appearance of this particular re-assortment virus is significant due to its ability to cause high mortality in domestic poultry."

The agency has yet to determine the source of the outbreak or how it is spreading. The statement noted it has not yet been detected in wild birds in Canada.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that 2 wild birds in Washington State tested positive for avian flu, one with H5N2 and another with H5N8. It's not clear whether those cases are connected in any way to the B.C. outbreak.

Earl Brown, a University of Ottawa microbiologist who is an expert on the influenza virus, said a virus with Asian roots could be significant if it sustains itself in wild birds. Brown said that in North America, avian flu typically infects farmed poultry in its low-path form, which often does not have a significant impact on operations. The virus can evolve into a high-path variety, but that doesn't always happen, and it's a long process. He said that doesn't appear to be what happened in the current outbreak.

"If you get bird flu into a poultry barn right now, most of the time you can get away with it because the virus won't adapt and won't evolve to high virulence," Brown said in an interview on Friday [19 Dec 2014]. "But if you have high-path in your wild birds, then every time there is a slip through biosecurity, it will be seen as a big event of mortality. It really hinges on whether this virus stays behind in the wild birds."

Ray Nickel, president of the B.C. Poultry Association, said it's a concerning development for the industry, because it means the virus is already in its high-path form when it 1st enters a barn. "Our vigilance is going to have to be extraordinarily careful, because it could be in the environment," Nickel said. "It isn't like we'll get control, we'll clean this up, and we won't have to worry about it anymore. We will continue to have to be very careful about environmental contamination."

High-path H5N8 has been responsible for recent outbreaks in Asia and Europe, including in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. There have not been any cases of H5N8 transmitting to humans.

Hundreds of people, primarily in East Asia and the Middle East, have been infected with H5N1, with more than half of them dying, while there has been one reported case of a human H5N6 infection.

Brian Ward, a microbiology professor at McGill University in Montreal, said the link to Asian influenza does not increase the risk to people in B.C. "The fact that it's highly pathogenic is a big deal for birds," Ward said. "Human infection is very rare, and more importantly, from a pandemic point of view, human-to-human transmission is extremely unlikely."

The current outbreak began about 3 weeks ago, when officials from B.C.'s Ministry of Agriculture detected avian influenza on a turkey farm and a chicken farm. The virus has now infected 11 sites in Chilliwack, Abbotsford and Langley. The latest, a chicken farm in Langley, was confirmed on Wednesday [17 Dec 2014].

The most serious avian flu outbreak in Canada was in the Fraser Valley in 2004, when a high-path strain of H7N3 spread to 42 commercial farms and 11 backyard coups in the Fraser Valley. In response, the federal government ordered the slaughter of 17 million chickens, turkeys and other domestic birds.

[Avian influenza (AI) is caused by type A influenza virus. The signs can vary from a mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza) depending on the infecting virus strain, host factors, and environmental stressors. Signs of avian influenza are extremely variable. In some flocks, the only evidence of the infection is seroconversion, that is, the birds develop a detectable antibody titer to AI. AI can also be manifest as respiratory, enteric, reproductive, or nervous system disease. Decreased food consumption and drops in egg production are among some of the earliest and most predictable signs of disease.

Signs including coughing, sneezing, ruffled feathers, swollen heads, nervous signs like depression, and diarrhea may occur together or singly. In some cases, birds die rapidly without clinical signs of disease.

Wild birds and their excreta should be considered a major source of avian influenza. Preventing direct contact with free-flying birds and protecting domestic poultry from contact with the feces of wild birds is an important way to prevent avian influenza.

Influenza viruses are very sensitive to most detergents and disinfectants. They are readily inactivated by heating and drying. However, flu viruses are well protected from inactivation by organic material, and infectious virus can be recovered from manure for up to 105 days. Complete removal of all organic material is part of any effective disinfection procedure.

Contaminated houses are heated for several days to inactivate virus. Organic material is removed followed by complete cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces. Contaminated litter and manure is problematic and should be composted or buried to ensure that it does not spread infectious virus.

How this particular strain has come to infect this area has not been fully explained, but all involved are working to both answer the question as well as to avoid any other infections.

The doors of international trade are likely to remain closed until this outbreak is cleaned up. The government is stamping out the disease by ordering the euthanasia of infected or potentially infected birds. Any cleanup is costly, and this disease has already proven to be costly with more cost likely.
