The official website of the regional administration reports that a
mass rabbit die-off due to myxomatosis has been registered in
Sosnovsky, Pavlovsky, and Vachsky rayons [districts] of [Nizhegorod]
oblast [province]. The outbreak started in August [2009]. Currently,
quarantine measures have been imposed in the affected [districts] and
the export of animals is banned.

The sources of infection are sick and recovered animals who carry the
virus on their skin, in subcutaneous tissue, blood, and eye discharge.
The virus transmission occurs via direct contact or through contact
with surrounding objects and food. Mosquitoes, fleas, lice, ticks,
birds, and farm staff also can passively transmit the infection from
one rabbit to another.

[According to the information available on OIE's interface WAHID,
myxomatosis is a reportable disease in Russia, subject to targeted
surveillance. The disease was not reported during 2008; its last year
of occurrence was 2007.

Myxomatosis is one of the 2 Lagomorpha diseases on OIE's list of
reportable diseases (the other one is rabbit hemorrhagic disease).

Details on the etiological agent, relevant diagnostic techniques and
vaccines can be seen in chapter 2.6.1 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic
Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.06.01_MYXO.pdf>.

Modified live virus vaccines prepared from fibroma virus or modified
_Myxoma_ virus strains are available for immunisation of rabbits.

For additional background on this viral disease, see Mod.PC's
comprehensive commentary in ProMED-mail posting 20070224.0674. - Mod.AS]
