In its 28 May 2020 Situation Report, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) identified Maricopa County, Arizona, as newly infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), having 2 new confirmed positive and 1 new suspect premises.

So far in 2020, Arizona counties affected (with number of confirmed positive premises / suspect premises / premises released from quarantine / and currently quarantined premises) include:

Cochise: 4 / 0 / 2 / 2
Gila: 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Maricopa: 2 / 1 / 0 / 3
Pima: 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Pinal: 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Santa Cruz: 1 / 0 / 0 / 1

Premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases are quarantined and monitored by veterinarians for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

Vesicular stomatitis [VS] virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks, (and) the most recent and largest VS outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways."

Some states and other countries might restrict the movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

[Known competent vectors for transmission of VSV include black flies, sand flies, and biting midges (_Culicoides_ spp.). The use of equine fly/mosquito approved spray is helpful in controlling the insect vectors transmitting this virus.

Please watch your animals and treat them with appropriate fly/mosquito approved sprays. It may be protective but will likely make your animal(s) more comfortable without the pesky insects. - Mod.TG
