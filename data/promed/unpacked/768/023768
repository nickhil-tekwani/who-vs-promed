[Given the occurrence of this disease in the area (see ProMED-mail archive list below), it should not be surprising that lumpy skin disease (LSD) has now been reported in Saudi Arabia.

This outbreak of clinical lumpy skin disease (LSD) was located on a Saudi island situated near the western shores of the Persian Gulf. It follows the notification of LSD in Kuwait, submitted 4 Jan 2015, reporting Kuwait's 1st LSD outbreak since 1991, which had reportedly started earlier, namely in November 2014. Following the said notification, the Saudis reportedly banned imports from Kuwait (see ProMED post 20150205.3146341). LSD has been spreading throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia since 2012.

The countries already known to be infected are Azerbaijan, Cyprus (North), Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestinian Autonomous Territories and Turkey. Syria is also known to be infected, though no direct information could be obtained. LSD is endemic in Egypt. To see the location of outbreaks officially reported since 2012, please go to OIE's interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/pfrx4ye (click on the cluster, zoom in).

It would be interesting to note if the Saudi outbreak reflects a further spread southwards of the Iranian and Kuwaiti epizootics, either by vectors or animal movements. Bahrain's territory is adjacent to this Saudi outbreak and deserves to be on alert.

Hopefully, the stamping out of this outbreak, apparently limited to an island, will prevent further spread in Saudi Arabia. However, in view of the vector borne mode of LSD spread, additional cases on the Arabian Peninsula should not surprise. - Mods.AS/CRD
