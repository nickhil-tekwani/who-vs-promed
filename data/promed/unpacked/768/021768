South Coast grain growers are urged to be on high alert for cereal
rust outbreaks this season [2009] following further discoveries of
barley leaf rust in the region. The abundance of barley leaf rust and
wheat stem rust on volunteer cereals over summer [2008/2009] were
strong warnings of rust risk for this season [2009], according to the
Grains Research and Development Corporation [GRDC].

Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia plant
pathologist Kith Jayasena said the risks to crops were high on the
south coast after a build up of rust during a damp summer. "We have
not detected wheat stripe rust in the state at this stage, but the
barley leaf rust is an early indicator that other rust diseases could
come to prominence along the south coast soon," Dr Jayasena said. "In
the central and northern regions we had unfavourable conditions for
rust development; however the risk of a stripe rust outbreak is still
present."

Dr Jayasena said growers across the state should continue to monitor
their crops carefully because there was still a significant risk of
yield losses if rust became established, and with all rust diseases
early identification is most important for efficient management.
"Potential yield losses from stripe rust will diminish, the later in
the season an outbreak occurs; however stem rust is favoured by
warmer spring conditions and can cause significant yield loss even
with late season outbreaks," he said.

[Cereal crops are affected by different rust fungi: leaf rust (or
brown rust) is caused by _Puccinia recondita_ in wheat and by _P.
hordei_ (synonym _P. recondita_ f.sp. _tritici_) in barley. Stripe
rust (or yellow rust) of cereal crops is caused by _Puccinia
striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. Stem rust (or black rust) of wheat
is caused by _Puccinia graminis_ f.sp. _tritici_. Serious yield
losses may be caused by these rusts on cereal crops, and new even
more virulent pathogen strains are emerging.

Rust spores are mainly spread by wind and with infected straw, and
some grasses or volunteer cereals may generate a "green bridge"
providing inoculum for the next cropping season. Disease management
relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop
cultivars and control of pathogen reservoirs. Crop monitoring, as
suggested above, for early discovery of infection at any stage of the
crop cycle is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of
the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.
