[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- the scope of
the occasional ProMED-mail updates has been broadened to include other
prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on other forms of
CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

vCJD statistics
---------------
The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of Wed 4 Jan
2012 remains 176. No definite/probable patient remains alive, so the
total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive)
remains 176.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was
28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9
in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, 1 in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in
2010, and 5 in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
------------------------------------------------------------
During 2011, there were 148 referrals, 74 fatal cases of sporadic CJD,
2 cases of GSS, 9 cases of familial CJD, 5 cases of vCJD, and 3 cases
of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2881 referrals, 1289
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 176 cases of vCJD, 92 cases of familial
CJD, 68 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 45 cases of GSS.

Isolation of prion with BSE properties from farmed goat

Abstract
--------
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal neurodegenerative
diseases that include variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans,
scrapie in small ruminants, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
in cattle. Scrapie is not considered a public health risk, but BSE has
been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Small ruminants are
susceptible to BSE, and in 2005 BSE was identified in a farmed goat in
France. We confirm another BSE case in a goat in which scrapie was
originally diagnosed and retrospectively identified as suspected BSE.
The prion strain in this case was further characterized by mouse
bioassay after extraction from formaldehyde-fixed brain tissue
embedded in paraffin blocks. Our data show that BSE can infect small
ruminants under natural conditions and could be misdiagnosed as
scrapie. Surveillance should continue so that another outbreak of this
zoonotic transmissible spongiform encephalopathy can be prevented and
public health safeguarded.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are fatal diseases
characterized by neurodegenerative changes in the central nervous
system that include vacuolation, gliosis, and accumulation of an
abnormal isoform (PrPSc) of a naturally occurring host-encoded protein
(PrPC) (1). According to the prion hypothesis, PrPSc is the major or
the sole infectious agent (1). Although this hypothesis has not
received universal acceptance, PrPScis ubiquitous in all known
naturally occurring TSEs, and its detection is widely used for their
diagnosis.

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a TSE of cattle, was first
detected in 1986 (2) and has since been linked with emerging TSEs in
other species (3,4) including humans (5,6). Because of its ability to
cross species barriers and particularly its zoonotic potential, BSE is
considered a public health risk, and extensive measures have been
established to detect and eliminate the disease.

Scrapie, a naturally occurring TSE affecting small ruminants, has been
known for centuries (7) and is not considered to pose a public health
risk (8). Under experimental conditions, however, small ruminants are
susceptible to BSE, with pathogenesis and clinical signs that are not
readily distinguishable from scrapie (9-12). Additionally, the fact
that small ruminants were exposed to BSE-contaminated food before the
exclusion of meat and bone meal from ruminant feedstuffs led to the
possibility that sheep and goats on commercial farms could be affected
by BSE that could be misdiagnosed as scrapie (13,14). The response to
this potential risk was the implementation of extensive statutory
active surveillance, elimination, and breeding for resistance programs
in the European Union (EU).

In 2005, as part of a review of historical TSE-positive cases of sheep
and goats in France, a specimen from a goat slaughtered for human
consumption in 2002 was reported to be "indistinguishable from a BSE
isolate on the basis of all identification criteria available." (15).
In response to this report, 2 retrospective studies were initiated in
the United Kingdom to analyze archived samples from goat cases that
were initially diagnosed as scrapie (16,17). Because only fixed
material was available, both studies had to use differential
immunohistochemical analysis (D-IHC), a technique that can
discriminate scrapie from experimentally induced BSE in sheep (18).
These studies identified a single case, originally diagnosed in 1990
as scrapie, that had a D-IHC signature indistinguishable from BSE
(16).

Given the wide phenotypic variance of scrapie in sheep and our limited
knowledge of this variance in goats, the D-IHC result on its own was
insufficient for an unequivocal diagnosis. In accordance with EU
regulation 36/2005 (19), the case was referred to the EU Reference
Laboratory Strain Typing Expert Group, which recommended further
investigation by bioassay.

Bioassay is conventionally undertaken by using unfixed tissues to
prepare inocula. Much historical tissue is available only as formalin
fixed or formalin fixed and paraffin wax embedded. TSE infectivity
persists in such material but with a lower infectious titer than with
unfixed frozen tissue (20). However, the potential effects on
biological activity, and therefore strain characterization, of
fixation and processing are unknown. Thus, further investigation of
this case required an extensive panel of controls. We report the
results of the bioassay analysis and confirm the diagnosis of BSE in a
goat in the United Kingdom.

been extracted from the Discussion.

"The 2 cases of naturally occurring BSE in small ruminants, the one
reported here and the one identified in France (15), occurred in
different countries, during different time periods, and before strict
BSE control measures were fully implemented. Therefore, the most
likely origin of these 2 cases would be exposure to BSE-contaminated
food supplements. Although in France goats constitute 14.3 percent of
the small ruminant population, in the United Kingdom they account for
only 0.3 percent of small ruminants. It is intriguing, therefore, that
the only naturally occurring BSE cases in small ruminants in France
and particularly in the United Kingdom were detected in goats and not
in sheep, although they have also been exposed to contaminated food
supplements. A possible explanation could be that goats are generally
managed more intensively than sheep and thus might have been exposed
to higher doses of the infectious agent because of the more frequent
use of concentrates in intensive dairy farming. Similar observations
have been reported in cattle, in which the incidence of BSE was
significantly higher in dairy herds and in which management is much
more intensive than in beef herds (34). In the United Kingdom, most of
the commercial goat herds are kept for milk production in a typically
intensive production system, similar to dairy cattle.

The BSE case we have confirmed was 1 of 26 historic goat samples
examined in the United Kingdom collected during 1984-2002 (16,17).
Since 1993, scrapie in goats has been a notifiable disease in the
United Kingdom, and since 2005, samples from all suspected cases of
TSE in small ruminants are required to be tested for BSE-like features
by using Western blotting (WB) (19). No BSE cases have been
identified, although an intermediate case in a goat was reported and
is under investigation by bioassay for final resolution (35,36). This
screening of brain samples from all small ruminant cases offers
reassurance that BSE is not present in the contemporary small ruminant
population. However, application of WB to sheep experimentally
co-infected with BSE and scrapie detected only the scrapie agent (37).
Also, in contrast to BSE, where infectivity is mainly confined to the
nervous system, in small ruminants the BSE agent is widely distributed
in peripheral tissues and can be transmitted horizontally (11,38).
Therefore, feed ban measures alone would be inadequate to control a
BSE outbreak in small ruminants. Also, it would be impossible to
prevent BSE from entering the human food chain through consumption of
food products derived from small ruminants.

Because TSEs in goats are still a problem, particularly in
Mediterranean countries, our data suggest that extensive surveillance
and breeding schemes must remain in place to prevent a BSE outbreak in
small ruminants and to safeguard public health. This report also
highlights several issues regarding the use of mouse bioassay to
identify TSE strains. As governing bodies seek confirmation of
equivocal cases that are identified worldwide, they must be aware of
the limitations, cost, and timescale demands of confirming such
cases." - Mod.CP]

[3] South Korea: 1st case iCJD
Date: Wed 30 Nov 2011

A woman has died of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD),
becoming the 1st confirmed victim of the terminal disorder in Korea.
She is believed to have been infected during a subdural transplant
surgery in the mid-1980s. The disease is not to be confused with the
similarly named variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of
mad cow disease, though both lead to disintegration of the brain.

iCJD occurs when the prion-infected tissue of one person infects
another. It has nothing to do with variant CJD, which infects humans
who have eaten beef from infected cattle, health authorities said.
According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[KCDC] on Tuesday, [29 Dec 2011] the 54-year-old woman suffered from
meningioma, a disease that causes water to fill a certain area of the
brain. In 1987 surgery was performed to remove tumors and the dura
mater that surrounded them. She had a subdural transplant over the
surface of her brain with Lyodura, a German-manufactured piece of
artificial dura mater that was produced in the 1980s, [see comment
below] to cover the affected area.

She had since lived without any special symptoms. But since 2010 she
suffered from sensory disorders in the face and feet, movement
disorder, and brain disease symptoms like seizures. She rapidly
deteriorated and died in November last year [2010], 5 months after the
iCJD symptoms began, the KCDC added. CJD normally has an incubation
period of 20 to 30 years.

[4] South Korea: 2nd case iCJD
Date: Fri 8 Dec 2011

South Korea's health authorities on Thursday [7 Dec 2011] confirmed
the country's 2nd case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a
degenerative neurological disorder. A 48-year-old man was diagnosed
with iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) on Wednesday [6 Dec 2011], according to the
Center for Disease Control [KCDC].

The report of the country's 2nd-ever iCJD case comes after a
54-year-old woman was found last month [November 2011] to have died
from the same disease that is often transmitted by the use of
defective prion proteins found in surgical tissue graft products. The
woman had received brain surgery using Lyodura, a tissue graft
product, some 23 years ago. The KCDC said the man in the latest case
had also received Lyodura during brain surgery in 1988.

This form of CJD [iatrogenic CJD] has an incubation period of more
than 20 years but once symptoms occur, death usually takes place
within a year. CJD is the most common of the so-called human prion
diseases with one person in every 1 million diagnosed each year
worldwide. It is an invariably fatal illness with death occurring
after the onset of dementia, hallucinations, coordination dysfunction,
and seizures.

The animal form of the disease is called bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) which is commonly called mad cow disease. BSE
also leaves holes in the brain that resemble a sponge.

[These 2 deaths have been attributed to the use of Lyodura, a medical
product derived from cadavers and used in neurosurgery. Lyodura was
introduced in 1969 as a product of B Braun Melsungen AG, a leading
hospital supply company based in Germany. The product was used as a
quick and effective patch material for surgery on the brain. It was a
section of freeze-dried tissue which could be stored for extended
periods on hospital shelves and could be made ready for use simply by
soaking it in water for a few minutes.

The raw material for Lyodura was the dura mater of a human cadaver.
The tissue would usually be harvested during an autopsy and then sold
to the manufacturer. After neurological diseases were linked to use of
Lyodura, an investigation determined that the manufacturer had
obtained the donor tissue by black market methods. Autopsy staff would
remove the tissue from cadavers, regardless of whether the deceased's
family had agreed to an autopsy or not, and sell it in quantity to
representatives of the manufacturer. Due to this illegal method of
collection, no record of patient history accompanied the tissue to
production.

Large quantities of the harvested tissue would be mass sterilized in a
heated vat. The tissue would then be freeze dried and packaged for
purchase. The manufacturer believed that its sterilization procedure
was sufficiently powerful to render any tissue harmless and was
therefore unconcerned about cross-contamination from CJD-containing
tissue to other tissue in the same sterilization vat. It is now
believed that almost all Lyodura product was tainted with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [prion] through this process. More than 70
CJD-related deaths in Japan occurred as a consequence of use of the
Lyodura product. (From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyodura.

An account of Lyodura use and the risk of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease in Australia, by FJ Brooke, S Boyd, GM Klug, CL Masters, and
SJ Collins has been published in the Medical Journal of Australia;
180(4), 177-81, 2004. The following information has been extracted
from the Introduction to this publication:

"Although infectiousness is a feature of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD), only a small proportion of cases are linked to transmission
through healthcare provision. As of January 2003, over 120 cases of
CJD associated with use of human cadaveric dura mater had been
recognised worldwide; almost all were associated with the commercial
product Lyodura. Most cases (97) have occurred in Japan, giving an
overall risk estimate of around 1 per 2268 patients treated with
Lyodura (0.04 percent) in that country. In Australia, 5 cases of CJD
have so far been linked to Lyodura, but, given the protracted tails of
previous epidemics of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies,
further cases are possible. Results of surveys of Lyodura use in
Australia are incomplete, but information from the manufacturer
suggests that 2208-2478 sheets of Lyodura may have been used here.
This use translates to a relatively high incidence of
Lyodura-associated CJD, with current overall rates appearing around 5
times higher than those reported in Japan; reasons for this difference
are unclear.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal, transmissible,
neurodegenerative disorder belonging to the group known as the
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). CJD can occur
without explanation (sporadic), secondary to mutations in the prion
protein gene (PRNP), or as a complication of medical treatment using
contaminated therapeutic agents or equipment (iatrogenic). Although
corneal grafts and neurosurgical equipment have been associated with
disease transmission, the most common causes of iatrogenic CJD have
been treatments involving human-derived cadaveric pituitary hormones
or dura mater.

The 1st identified case of CJD in a dura mater recipient was reported
in the United States in early 1987. In response, the US Food and Drug
Authority issued a safety alert in April 1987, seeking immediate
discontinuation of use of the identified dura mater batch (Lyodura
batch no. 2105). A 2nd patient with CJD linked to Lyodura was detected
in New Zealand in 1988, but the specific batch could not be
identified. This has remained a frequent difficulty when tracing
contamination sources.

As of January 2003, over 120 CJD cases related to dura mater use had
been detected globally, with 97 in Japan. These cases were
predominantly associated with Lyodura, a commercial product produced
since 1969 by B Braun Melsungen AG Only a few reports suggest the
possibility of CJD after use of dura mater from other commercial or
non-commercial sources.

Lyodura consists of lyophilised, irradiated human dura mater sourced
post mortem. Additional processing with immersion in a solution of 1M
sodium hydroxide was instituted in 1987, with a noticeable reduction
in Lyodura-related cases thereafter. Lyodura has been used in a number
of countries, including Australia, Japan, Canada, the United States,
and the United Kingdom, mainly in neurosurgery, but also in
orthopaedic, otological, dental, urological, gynaecological, and
cardiac procedures.

Most cases of CJD associated with dura mater have occurred in Japan.
In 1996, in response to the growing incidence, a survey was undertaken
of Lyodura use in almost 3000 Japanese healthcare institutions. This
estimated that up to 100 000 people received Lyodura grafts between
1983 and 1987, and up to 220 000 between 1979 and 1991 (out of a total
of 260 000 who received dura mater grafts). Use of these grafts
greatly declined after 1991 but may have continued until 1997.
Assuming that all cases of CJD associated with dura mater were a
consequence of Lyodura use, the overall risk of Lyodura-associated CJD
in Japan is approximately 0.04 percent." (For further information, go
to
http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/180_04_160204/bro10566_fm.html).

The extreme resistance of the CJD infectious agent to inactivation by
irradiation and severe chemical treatments in the Lyodura process
confirms the singular nature of prions. - Mod.CP]

[5] Switzerland: BSE
Date: Fri 16 Dec 2011
Source: Prionics AG, e-scope newsletter [edited]
http://escope.prionics.com/issue/2011-december-4/


In spring 2011, 2 new cases of BSE were discovered in Switzerland [see
ProMED-mail posting Prion disease update 2011 (10) 20111107.3317].
Both cases were detected using the Prionics(R)-Check BSE tests. A
report has now been published showing that these cases represent a
novel type of BSE. What are the consequences of these new BSE cases?

After a period of 4 years without BSE positive cows, in spring this
year [2011] Switzerland was shaken by the discovery of 2 new BSE cases
detected only one month apart from each other. The cases appeared in
different areas of Switzerland and involved animals aged 8 and 15
years, which were tested with the Prionics(R)-Check BSE tests as part
of the active disease surveillance program. Bettina Bernhard, Head of
the Prionics diagnostic laboratory reported that: "It was the 1st time
in 4.5 years that we had found a BSE positive sample in our
laboratory. Based on the results from the Prionics(R)-Check WESTERN,
we immediately saw that the fingerprint of the prion protein was not
that of the classical BSE cases we have detected before. We then
informed the Swiss National Reference Laboratory and veterinary
authorities and the positive result was confirmed with the
Prionics(R)-Check PrioSTRIP."

Novel type of BSE?
------------------
BSE cases that differ from the classical BSE strain have been detected
before, however, with low incidence. These atypical strains,
designated BASE/L-BSE and H-BSE, were first reported in 2004 in Italy
and France. Both strains were detected as part of routine surveillance
using the Prionics(R)-Check WESTERN and ELISA tests. The recent
publication by Torsten Seuberlich of the Swiss National and OIE [World
Organisation for Animal Health] Reference Laboratories for BSE and
Scrapie and his colleagues, is showing that these 2 Swiss cases not
only differ from classical BSE, but also from the atypical BSE cases
found in other countries. It appears that the 2 BSE cases detected in
Switzerland seem to represent a novel type of atypical BSE. Dr
Seuberlich explains: "We are now undertaking further investigations
into these 2 cases and until there is more clarity, surveillance
should continue to be carried out at a high level and disease
awareness should be increased. Furthermore, we have to ensure that
diagnostic techniques are applied that identify such cases."

Continued vigilance needed
--------------------------
Whereas consumption of meat from cows affected by classical BSE has
been associated with vCJD, the public health hazard from atypical BSE
is unclear. Little is known about its origin and whether it can be
transmitted to other animals. These cases show, however, that BSE has
not been completely eradicated and that the disease can continue to
occur even with current preventive measures (such as the meat-and-bone
meal ban) in place. The appearance of new strains of the prion protein
could also indicate that BSE is still evolving. Continuous monitoring
will be needed to keep these new strains under surveillance.
