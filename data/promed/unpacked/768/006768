Gianyar man dies of rabies
--------------------------
A man from Tegallalang in Gianyar died of rabies in Sanglah Hospital
on Saturday [2 Oct 2010] -- only 20 minutes after being admitted to
the hospital's rabies ward. Gianyar is one of the 2 regencies where
proponents of a vaccination-only [canine] rabies control programme
conducted a pilot programme that led this month to the provincial
government agreeing to a foreign-funded mass vaccination programme as
an alternative to mass dog culls.

A 43-year-old resident of Banjar Taro Kaja in Tegallalang, was
declared a rabies case by the Sanglah rabies team. Its secretary, Dr
Ken Wirasandhi, said the man died at 12:30 am, shortly after
admission. "He had been under our nursing care for 20 minutes," Dr
Wirasandhi said. The man had been bitten on his right leg about 2
months ago but according to Dr Wirasandhi the bites were not dealt
with seriously. "There is no history of wound care or of anti-rabies
vaccine," he said. He said it was certain that the man had contracted
rabies, from observation of the clinical symptoms he showed. "Phobia
had emerged so it was almost certainly rabies," he said.

Until the victim's death there had been no recorded human rabies
fatalities in Gianyar or neighbouring Bangli regency since the Bali
Animal Welfare Association -- which has been given the job of managing
the new island-wide scheme -- began its pilot community-based
dog-vaccination programme in both districts.

Nearly 100 people have died from rabies in Bali since the outbreak
began almost 2 years ago.

[The rabies death toll in Bali continues to climb, from the nearly 90
previously reported to the current nearly one hundred. Despite this
single fatality in Gianyar it is too early to judge the effectiveness
of the dog vaccination programme being conducted in this part of the
island by the Bali Animal Welfare Association.
