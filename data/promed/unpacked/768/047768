CDC updates guidelines on preventing, treating anthrax in adults
----------------------------------------------------------------
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released updated guidelines for treating and preventing anthrax in adults and pregnant women, recommending, among other things, the simultaneous use of antimicrobial drugs and antitoxin in patients who have systemic disease.

The 2 sets of guidelines were published 17 Jan 2014 in Emerging Infectious Diseases. They were prepared by multidisciplinary expert panels that met in 2011 and 2012.

The adult report says that before 2001-- the year of the anthrax letter attacks -- mortality rates for patients with inhalation anthrax approached 90 percent. Since then, 8 (53 percent) of 15 known patients with inhalation anthrax have survived, thanks to early diagnosis, combination antimicrobial treatment to kill the bacteria and inhibit toxin production, and aggressive pleural effusion management.

The adult CDC guidelines cover postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and antimicrobial and antitoxin treatment options and describe critical care measures. The report includes an expanded discussion of critical care and clinical procedures and additional antimicrobial choices, including antimicrobial treatment for possible anthrax meningitis.

For PEP for those exposed to airborne _Bacillus anthracis_ spores, the revised guidelines, like the previous version, recommend 60 days of antimicrobial drugs, regardless of whether the patients have been vaccinated.

The report discusses 2 antitoxins, anthrax immune globulin and raxibacumab [human monoclonal antibody], and says there are no considerations that clearly favor one over the other. An antitoxin should be added to antimicrobial treatment for any patient in whom systemic anthrax is highly suspected, the report recommends, because the potential benefit outweighs potential risks.

The revised guidelines for pregnant women also discuss considerations for postpartum and lactating women, with the aim of guiding health professionals caring for women in the event of a bioterrorist attack involving anthrax. The report discusses general principles of prevention and treatment, vaccines, antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment, clinical considerations and critical care issues, antitoxin, delivery concerns, infection control measures, and communication.

Abstract
--------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened panels of anthrax experts to review and update guidelines for anthrax postexposure prophylaxis and treatment. The panels included civilian and military anthrax experts and clinicians with experience treating anthrax patients. Specialties represented included internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, infectious disease, emergency medicine, critical care, pulmonology, hematology, and nephrology. Panelists discussed recent patients with systemic anthrax; reviews of published, unpublished, and proprietary data regarding antimicrobial drugs and anthrax antitoxins; and critical care measures of potential benefit to patients with anthrax. This article updates antimicrobial postexposure prophylaxis and antimicrobial and antitoxin treatment options and describes potentially beneficial critical care measures for persons with anthrax, including clinical procedures for infected nonpregnant adults. Changes from previous guidelines include an expanded discussion of critical care and clinical procedures and additional antimicrobial choices, including preferred antimicrobial drug treatment for possible anthrax meningitis.

Abstract
--------
In August 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in partnership with the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, convened a meeting of national subject matter experts to review key clinical elements of anthrax prevention and treatment for pregnant, postpartum, and lactating (P/PP/L) women. National experts in infectious disease, obstetrics, maternal fetal medicine, neonatology, pediatrics, and pharmacy attended the meeting, as did representatives from professional organizations and national, federal, state, and local agencies. The meeting addressed general principles of prevention and treatment for P/PP/L women, vaccines, antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment, clinical considerations and critical care issues, antitoxin, delivery concerns, infection control measures, and communication. The purpose of this meeting summary is to provide updated clinical information to health care providers and public health professionals caring for P/PP/L women in the setting of a bioterrorist event involving anthrax.


Two experienced teams put these valuable guidelines together for treating human cases of anthrax. But like all guidelines once there is a foundation of advice, the need for changes and specific improvements will emerge. In the past 10 years we have seen a series of major changes which have radically improved the prognosis for this clinical disease in its various forms. And with this better and optimistic situation I am sure we will see more improvements in the next decade.

This is not to criticize what these teams have achieved but it is the nature of the medical beast. The 1st paper covers injection anthrax but maybe not in the detail it deserves and now in place by the British teams successfully handling such cases. - Mod.MHJ]
