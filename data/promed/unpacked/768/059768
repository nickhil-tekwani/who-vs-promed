Consumer Reports urged the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reverse its proposed decision to allow the use of streptomycin to treat citrus disease because of the unacceptable risk it could pose to human health and the environment.

In comments submitted to the EPA, the consumer group noted that the proposal would result in a 26-fold increase in the use of streptomycin in plant agriculture and could trigger antibiotic resistance that would reduce the drug's effectiveness in treating diseases in people.

The EPA's proposal comes at a time when medical experts have warned that growing antibiotic resistance poses one of the most serious threats to public health and as other federal agencies have worked to reduce the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture and human medicine.

"This misguided proposal would allow a massive increase in the use of streptomycin, far greater than its use in human medicine," said Michael Hansen, PhD, senior staff scientist at Consumer Reports. "The EPA has failed to adequately investigate the risks associated with this proposal, which would undermine current government efforts to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics. We urge the EPA to withdraw this proposal."

Streptomycin is classified by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as highly important in human medicine and is used to address hard-to-treat tuberculosis infections, and bubonic plague, among other diseases. The EPA has proposed to allow streptomycin to be sprayed on all citrus trees in the US up to 3 times a year. Based on current commercial citrus acreage, the amount allowed to be sprayed would total more than 942 000 lb [about 428 000 kg], a 26-fold increase in streptomycin use in plant agriculture.

In comments to the EPA, Consumer Reports urged the agency to more carefully assess the risk of antibiotic resistance from being exposed to low levels of streptomycin for people who drink citrus juices or water in citrus-producing areas. If the EPA moves forward with allowing streptomycin to treat citrus diseases, it should set a tolerance level well below the amount that can trigger antibiotic resistance and take a number of other steps to better manage the risk it poses.

Consumer Reports called on the EPA to restrict application of the antibiotic to injection of infected trees rather than allowing spraying of all citrus. The consumer group also urged the EPA to classify streptomycin as a Restricted Use Pesticide so it can only be applied by a licensed trained applicator.

The FDA, in an effort to reduce antibiotic use in animal agriculture, issued regulations and guidance that ended all use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion and required a veterinarian's supervision for use in disease prevention and treatment, in 2017. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 2 million people in the US acquire serious infections with bacteria that are resistant to one or more antibiotics, and at least 23 000 people die as a result.

[Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. The aminoglycoside group of antibiotics also includes gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, amikacin, netilmicin, paromomycin, neomycin and the recently FDA-approved plazomicin. Aminoglycosides are effective against a broad spectrum of gram-negative bacilli; they are also used in combination with other antibiotics to improve antibacterial activity against some gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Streptomycin is used to treat a number of bacterial infections, including tuberculosis, endocarditis, brucellosis, plague, and tularemia. In 2010, a shortage of the injectable streptomycin was reported in 15 countries, with 11 more countries predicting their stocks would run out before they could be replenished (https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/supply-chain/global-antibiotic-shortages-are-fueling-superbugs-5-report-findings.html).

Resistance to aminoglycosides is mediated primarily by enzymes that modify the drug. Spraying streptomycin on citrus trees in the US up to 3 times a year would cause widespread environmental contamination with the antibiotic, creating selective pressure for the emergence of antibiotic resistant environmental organisms, and, if the genes that encode resistance are attached to mobile genetic elements, resistance to streptomycin would be able to spread widely to multiple bacterial species. The effect might not be limited to streptomycin. Depending on the resistance mechanism, resistance to streptomycin may also be associated with cross-resistance to other aminoglycosides and perhaps to other classes of antibiotics if the genes encoding these additional resistances are linked to the gene encoding streptomycin resistance. The use of antibiotics in agriculture should be subject to strict regulations. - Mod.ML]

[Readers may wish to consult "Streptomycin; Pesticide Tolerances for Emergency Exemptions," described as a Rule by the EPA, dated 15 Mar 2017, in the Federal Register (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/15/2017-04779/streptomycin-pesticide-tolerances-for-emergency-exemptions). The document considers risks of acute and chronic exposure to the levels of streptomycin that might result from spraying, concluding that "there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population, or to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to streptomycin residues." There appears to be no discussion, however, about the impact of the policy on antibiotic resistance in microorganisms.

It is not clear to me what has prompted Consumer Reports to raise this issue now, almost 2 years after publication of this document. A hint comes from https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2018/streptomycin-12-27-2018.php, but this was issued at the end of 2018. - Mod.SH]

[Antibacterial leaf sprays and seed treatments containing antibiotics may be used in agriculture, but are subject to strict regulations in most countries due to their associated risks of facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistances in other crop, animal and human pathogens (see links below). Residues of antibiotics may also lead to rejection of exported produce by some countries.

Furthermore, beneficial soil microbes may be killed off as collateral damage, making the plants weaker and more susceptible to other diseases. A specific microbiome is now considered an integral part of the wider genome and the extended phenotype of all plants. Functionally, this microbiome has been shown to have a significant impact on plant health, nutrition and ability to tolerate biotic and abiotic stresses (see http://bennetzenlab.genetics.uga.edu/). Thus, any changes in plant-associated or environmental microbiomes may affect a wider region. The role of complex microbiomes in biosystems and the global environment is still largely unknown.
