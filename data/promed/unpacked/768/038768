More than 40 pupils at an elementary school in a suburban area are
suspected of having contracted scarlet fever, parents claimed
yesterday. At least 39 children in a grade 2 class at the Mingqiang
Elementary School are feared to have the disease, they said. One
parent said the school gathered parents on Wednesday [?Dec 7 2011] to
inform them that an initial test indicated 39 out of 48 children had
the disease. Parents also said 6 pupils in a grade 3 class are
suspected to have the disease.

Some parents claim the first case emerged a fortnight ago and accused
the school --which has hundreds of pupils -- of not acting quickly
enough. They say it should have isolated sick children and canceled
all classes to sterilize classrooms.

According to a 2005 directive by Shanghai's education department, a
school where a case of an unidentified contagious disease is
discovered should report to authorities and cancel classes involved.
"The school has put all the children at the risk of catching the
disease," claimed one parent. The Mingqiang Elementary School has only
canceled lessons for the grade 2 class but other parents are taking
their children to hospital for tests, said the parent, whose child
tested negative.

Another father told Shanghai Daily that 6 children -- including his
son -- in a grade 3 class were also diagnosed with scarlet fever.

The first parent claimed school outings had continued this week. "I
don't understand how the school could organize for a class to visit a
city attraction as group activity on Monday, when it didn't know how
many children may have this contagious disease," he said.

School staff declined to comment yesterday, saying top officials were
at an emergency meeting. Earlier, a teacher at the school told China
Network Television that parents' accusations were untrue as only one
or two students were confirmed to have scarlet fever and had been
isolated.

The city's health authority said it is normal to see an increase of
scarlet fever at this time of year, but didn't have a figure. An
official, surnamed Liu, with Fudan University's Children's Hospital
confirmed they have received children with scarlet fever over the past
2 weeks, but said their condition was not serious. Liu did not give a
figure.

Scarlet fever symptoms include a sore throat, fever and a rash,
doctors say. It is treated with antibiotics.

[Scarlet fever is caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci
(GAS)(_Streptococcus pyogenes_), a Gram positive coccus that grows in
chains. An erythrogenic exotoxin released by the strains of _S.
pyogenes_ that cause scarlet fever leads to the red rash that is
characteristic of the illness.

Scarlet fever is usually follows GAS pharyngitis. The incidence of
pharyngeal disease is highest in school-aged children (5-15 years),
during winter and spring, and in a setting of crowding and close
contact. Person-to-person spread of GAS pharyngitis from infected
patients by means of respiratory droplets is the commonest mode of
transmission. GAS pharyngitis can rarely spread through contaminated
food (http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196904242801702).

Scarlet fever may also follow GAS infection of the skin or soft
tissue, such as wounds, burns, the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet
fever), or even the skin lesions of chicken pox. Over a century ago,
scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its
mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became
available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate
of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1 per cent.

GAS pharyngitis has rarely caused blood stream invasion (bacteremia)
that can lead to infections at distant sites
(http://www.jstor.org/pss/4456639,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19812863). Tissue invasiveness of
_Streptococcus pyogenes_ has been attributed to several virulence
factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene.
Serotypes M1 and M3, in particular, have been associated with invasive
infection. The serotypes of isolates involved in a prior Hong Kong
outbreak were reported to be predominantly serotype M12, with smaller
numbers of M1 and M2 (ProMED post Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever
- China (07): (HK, MO) 20110627.1963).

The incubation period (the time between becoming infected and having
symptoms) is short, generally 1-2 days. The illness typically begins
with a fever, sore throat, and an initially white, then bright red
tongue with prominent red papillae, the so-called "strawberry" tongue
(http://dermatlas.med.jhmi.edu/derm/display.cfm?ImageID=-19962688),
followed 12-48 hours later by a rash. The rash usually first appears
on the neck and chest, then spreads over the body, and is more intense
in skin folds, the so-called Pastia lines
(http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19082.jpg).
The rash is described as "sandpapery" to touch. The face may be
flushed with perioral pallor. The rash can last for more than a week
and is followed by peeling (desquamation) of the skin around the
palms, fingertips, toes, and groin area.

Diagnosis of scarlet fever is clinical. Blood cultures are rarely
positive, but GAS can usually be demonstrated in the throat by culture
or a rapid streptococcal test. Complications of scarlet fever include
local spread of the streptococcal throat infection to involve regional
lymph nodes, retropharyngeal tissues, middle ear, and sinuses and
immune-mediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Septic complications due to
spread of GAS in blood, such as meningitis, pyogenic arthritis, and
endocarditis, occur rarely.

People who have GAS sore throat or skin infections are most likely to
spread the infection; those who carry the bacteria but have no
symptoms are less contagious
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm).
Transmission of all types of GAS infection can be reduced by good
handwashing, especially after coughing and sneezing and before
preparing foods or eating. Early recognition and treatment of GAS
infection is essential to prevent its spread to others. Persons with
GAS infection should stay home from work, school, or daycare until 24
hours after taking an antibiotic, at which time they should no longer
be contagious. Treatment of scarlet fever is no different than that of
GAS pharyngitis, that is, oral penicillin, [cephalosporins],
erythromycin, or clindamycin for 10 days, or one intramuscular dose of
penicillin G benzathine.

With proper antibiotic treatment, complications are uncommon:
penicillin therapy for treatment of GAS pharyngitis within 9 days of
onset of symptoms has been shown to decrease the incidence of ARF;
unlike ARF, antimicrobial therapy does not prevent acute
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. In the Hong Kong outbreak this
year, the GAS isolates were reported to be resistant to some of the
antibiotics usually used to treat this infection. However, the above
news release does not report the antibiotic susceptibilities of the
isolates in the Shanghai outbreak.

Shanghai is the largest city by population in China and in the world,
with a population of over 23 million in 2010
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai); It is one of the 4
province-level municipalities in the People's Republic of China and is
located on the coast in eastern China. A map of the provinces of
China, showing the location of Shanghai, can be accessed at
