Verticillium stripe appears to be making its way west, as some fields in Saskatchewan showed symptoms this [2020] summer as well. [The] soil-borne disease, 1st detected in Manitoba in 2014 [ProMED-mail post 20150108.3077863], caused yield losses in 2020 canola crops.

It is found in Europe and Australia and, because it was detected so recently, very little Canadian research has been completed. According to Justine Cornelsen, Canola Council of Canada, it was called verticillium wilt, but the name was changed because it's a stem-striping disease. In 2015, a survey found it in 6 provinces [see link below], but [2020] saw the most significant losses in hot, dry weather.

In Europe, research based on winter types of canola or oilseed rape found losses of 10-50% in Germany and Sweden. Newer research on spring oilseed rape has found inconsistent or insignificant yield loss, Cornelsen said. Quality seems to be unchanged. Environmental conditions can determine how fast the pathogen moves into the stem. Once the soil temperature is above 15 deg C [59 deg F], especially right before flowering, the pathogen will do well.

Treatment options are limited. There is no good information yet on whether any varieties are resistant. Increasing rotations will help, but the populations will remain in the soil. Research projects underway include one looking at the cause [and] one examining genetics and genomics to establish resistance. Preliminary data found that plants infected later are colonized more quickly.

[Verticillium wilt (or stripe) of oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_; "canola" refers to a group of specific varieties) is caused by the soil-borne vascular fungus _Verticillium longisporum_ (Vl). This species is pathogenic only on _Brassica_ species and has been reported from many European countries as well as Japan and the USA. Increasing areas of intense rapeseed cultivation have rendered the pathogen a growing threat to oilseed rape production.

Unlike other _Verticillium_ species, Vl does not induce wilting but premature senescence and ripening, which may severely reduce yields by up to 50%. It can survive in dead plant tissue and soil for up to 20 years. The pathogen can be spread with soil, as well as by contaminated equipment and with infected plant material (including seed). Disease management is difficult due to the long retention of infectivity of soils and because fungicides are generally not very effective against soil-borne pathogens. Use of clean seed and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread between fields are essential. Biocontrol methods are being investigated. Sufficient genetic resistance is not available in oilseed rape, but interspecific hybridisation may provide a resource for developing resistant crop lines.

Vl appears to be a host-adapted pathogen. Associated microbiomes have recently been found to be a crucial factor in suppressing or enhancing disease development (see link below). Other species in the genus specialise in different host families; for example, solanaceous crops are susceptible to _V. dahliae_, and _V. albo-atrum_ is associated with a wilt of hops.

The pathogen had already been present in North America on other brassica hosts when it was first discovered on oilseed rape in Canada (ProMED-mail post 20150108.3077863). Local spread to oilseed rape or a new incursion with plant material from, for example, Europe may both have been a possible origin of the initial infection.
