The case of the young person who, this past weekend, died in the Collipulli
Hospital while being moved urgently to the Temuco Regional Hospital,
corresponds to a new case of [a] suspected hantavirus [infection]. This was
confirmed by Loreto Uribe, in charge of the Melleco Provincial SERMI
[Regional Ministerial Secretariat] Health Office. She said that she could
not confirm the cause of the fatality while the corresponding [laboratory]
analyses were not [yet] done. "The woman who died is just suspected of
having [a] hantavirus [infection]; some samples were taken after her death
and sent to the Public Health Institute (ISP) in Santiago for
confirmation," she said. The ill-fated 23 year old woman lived with her 2
little children in the San Andres rural area, near Colipulli.

Meanwhile, in recent hours another case with similar characteristics was
reported in the Niblinto rural area, also in Collipulli. This relates to a
a 51 year old man. "This patient went to the Temuco Hospital, is in stable
condition and also suspected of having [a] hantavirus [infection], and
under the same conditions, samples were sent to the ISP for subsequent
testing," said the SEREMI Health representative.

It is worth recalling that to date, there exists just one confirmed fatal
case registered in the Tranaman area, in the Puren community, where a 46
year old worker died. Also, some 2-3 suspected cases in the province were
registered, which were discarded [as hantavirus infections].

One of the main recommendations to prevent the disease [and discourage the
presence of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat that is the reservoir of Andes
hantavirus - Mod.TY] in rural areas is to store firewood 30 cm [12 in] or
more above ground level and at a distance of 30 m [1170 ft] from the house
and maintain the areas around houses, urban spaces and cultivated areas
free of weeds and low-level vegetation.

Also, it is advised that before entering closed places, sheds or unoccupied
cabins, these [places] should be ventilated for several hours and the use
of masks is recommended since it has been detected that the inhalation of
rodent excreta in closed places is one of the main risk factors.

[Although not stated, the hantavirus responsible for HPS [hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome] in the area mentioned above is Andes virus. Chile has
had a series of HPS cases especially in Jan-May this year (2010), and the
season for transmission is again coming, with reports of new suspected
cases and warnings about the risk of infections and how to prevent them.

the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at
