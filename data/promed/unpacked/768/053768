China reports new outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
-----------------------------------------------
China on Tuesday [11 Jul 2006] reported a fresh outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD] affecting 51 head of cattle in the nation's northwestern
Qinghai province.
Cattle at 3 farms in Qinghai's Henan county began showing symptoms of the
illness on 1 Jul 2006. The cattle were diagnosed with FMD on 7 Jul 2006,
the agriculture ministry said on its website.
A total of 212 head of cattle were culled following the outbreak, while
local agriculture officials quarantined and disinfected the farms and the
surrounding area, the ministry said.
The case is the 3rd in Qinghai this year [2006] and brings to 9 the total
number of FMD outbreaks to strike China so far in 2006, according to the
ministry's website.
FMD is a severe, highly contagious viral disease affecting cattle, pigs,
sheep and other cloven-hoofed livestock. It is not usually fatal but causes
losses in the production of meat and milk.

[Since 13 May 2005, China has sent the OIE 14 official notifications on FMD
in bovines, caused by FMD virus serotype Asia 1, in the following 9
provinces (in chronological order of their 1st recordings):
Jiangsu, Beijing, Hebei, Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Shandong, Ningxia and
Jiangxi. The affected territories are stretched over more than 5000 km; a
map of China's provinces can be found at
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-02/19/content_815536.htm>.
Reportedly, the control measures adopted include stamping out of the
affected herds. Farm animals of other species, such as pigs, sheep and
goats (allegedly clinically-unaffected), are destroyed as well if kept on
the same premises.
It will help to obtain information on the vaccination history of affected
animals, the virus strains included in the vaccines, and the vaccination
scheme implemented (is mass-vaccination applied, in which provinces,
minimal age of vaccinated animals, timetable, post-vaccination immunity
surveillance). The disease situation in pigs deserves special attention. -
