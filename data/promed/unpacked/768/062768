SARS-CoV-2 in animals (inf. with), Uruguay
-------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start on: [17 Dec 2020]
Confirmed on: 1 Feb 2021
Reported on: 25 May 2021
Event status: ongoing
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Event morbidity (%): 50
Event mortality: -
Zoonotic potential: yes
Diagnostic details: laboratory test
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak location 1: Montevideo, Montevideo
Started on: 22 Dec 2020
Ended on: 22 Feb 2021
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Dogs / 2 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population description: Canine, male, 3 years old. He had no clinical signs at the time of sample collection and for the following 15 days. Samples were obtained from the nasopharynx and rectum on [22 Dec 2020] (the positive sample was from the nasopharynx) after the owner tested positive for SARS-COV-2 on [7 Dec 2020]. The owner, who tested positive and presented fever and headache, and the wife, who tested negative for SARS-COV-2, live in the house. A 5-year-old female Uruguayan Cimarron dog who tested negative for SARS-COV-2 qPCR is also living in the house.

Outbreak location 2: Montevideo, Montevideo
Started on: [17 Dec 2020]
Ended on: 17 Feb 2021
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cats / 2 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population description: Feline, male, 1 year old, neutered. He had no clinical signs at the time of sample collection and for the following 15 days. Samples were obtained from the nasopharynx and rectum on [17 Dec 2020] (the positive sample was from the nasopharynx), after the owner tested positive for SARS-COV-2 on [12 Dec 2020]. The owner lives alone and presented transient fever with anosmia after 24 hours. He also developed fatigue and headache in the following days. The feline tested positive [and] lives with a one-year-old female cat that tested negative for SARS-COV-2 qPCR.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with ill humans

Epidemiological comments: On [14 May 2021], a research team from the University of the Republic notified the official services of the detection of SARS-COV-2 in pet samples. The work was carried out in the framework of a CSIC project, "Specialised knowledge to face the emergency posed by COVID-19 and its impacts," led by Dr. Alejandro Benech (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine) and Dr. Yanina Panzera (Faculty of Science) and with the participation of virologists from the Faculty of Science (Dr. Santiago Mirazo). Both samples from both animals were diagnosed by qPCR during January and February 2021. The qPCR testing was all performed in duplicate, with internal controls and both negative and blank qPCR controls. After receiving the notification of the positive test, the owners followed the quarantine, hygiene, and disinfection instructions recommended to them by their healthcare providers.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: quarantine, disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test result date / Result
Secc. Genetica Evolutiva - Plat. Genomica - Fac. de Ciencias - Universidad de la Republica (national laboratory) / cats/dogs / 2 / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / from 17 Dec 2020 to 3 May 2021 / positive

["Although current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from an animal source, likely a bat, that source has yet to be identified. The pandemic is driven by human-to-human transmission, which happens through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking, that can remain in the air for some time as aerosols. Genetic sequence data reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in _Rhinolophus_ bat (horseshoe bat) populations. To date, there is not enough scientific evidence to identify the source of SARS-CoV-2 or to explain the original route of transmission to humans (which may involve an intermediate host).

"Several animal species have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with infection being introduced to a population as a result of close contact with humans or animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 or in experimental infection studies performed in laboratory settings. The list of animal species for which information on natural or experimental infection is presented in Table 1" [OIE Technical fact sheet, available at the URL below].

"Biosecurity and hygiene measures are key to preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should restrict contact with mammalian animals, including pets, just like they would with people during their illness. Animals suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should remain separated from other animals and humans while infected.

"Due to their susceptibility, some animal species are being used as models to test vaccines for use in humans. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use in mink and other animal species susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 are in various stages of development and approval."

"The information presented in this technical factsheet reflects the epidemiological observations and research done to date and will be updated when additional information is available."
