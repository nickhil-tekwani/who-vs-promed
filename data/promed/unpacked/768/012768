According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a new human infection with an influenza A(H1N2) variant (A(H1N2)v) virus was reported by Ohio. This is the 2nd H1N2v case reported this year [2021] in the state.

The patient is less than 18 years of age, was not hospitalized, and has completely recovered from their illness.

The patient and the household contacts of the patient report no swine contact or attendance at agricultural exhibits where swine were present.

It is possible that limited human-to-human transmission occurred. No ongoing human-to-human transmission has been identified.

Ten human infections with a novel influenza A virus have been reported in the United States this influenza season, including 2 H3N2v (IA, WI), 3 H1N2v (IA, OH (2)), and 5 H1N1v (IA, NC, WI (3)) virus infections.

Six infections have occurred in children less than 18 years of age, and 4 have occurred in adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Of the 10 infected individuals, only one had no identified connection to swine. The other 9 individuals had direct contact with swine, were on a property with swine present, or had a household member who had direct contact with swine prior to illness onset.

Pigs are commonly infected with swine influenza ("variant flu") viruses that are usually different from human influenza viruses. While rare, influenza can spread from pigs to people and from people to pigs.

Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called "variant viruses."

In general, the severity of illnesses associated with variant influenza have been similar to seasonal influenza.

Influenza symptoms come on quickly in the form of fever, dry cough, sore throat, headache, extreme tiredness, stuffed-up nose, and body aches. Young children and the elderly may not develop fever. These symptoms can be severe and put you in bed for several days.

"One human infection with an influenza A(H1N2) variant (A(H1N2)v) virus was reported by Ohio. The patient is less than18 years of age, was not hospitalized, and has completely recovered from their illness. The patient and the household contacts of the patient report no swine contact or attendance at agricultural exhibits where swine were present. It is possible that limited human-to-human transmission occurred. No ongoing human-to-human transmission has been identified. This is the 3rd influenza A(H1N2)v virus identified in the United States that occurred in 2021.

"When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a "variant influenza virus." Ten human infections with a novel influenza A virus have been reported in the United States this influenza season, including 2 H3N2v (IA, WI), 3 H1N2v (IA, OH (2)), and 5 H1N1v (IA, NC, WI (3)) virus infections. Six infections have occurred in children less than18 years of age, and 4 have occurred in adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Of the 10 infected individuals, only one had no identified connection to swine. The other 9 individuals had direct contact with swine, were on a property with swine present, or had a household member who had direct contact with swine prior to illness onset."

Overall, 10 variant flu cases involving different subtypes have been reported in the United States this flu season, with 3 cases reported for this influenza subtype. Another of the 3 H1N2v cases was reported from Ohio in May [2021]. The patient was a child who also had an infection that didn't require a hospital stay. He or she lives on a farm where pigs are present.

"Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be more fully understood and appropriate public health measures can be taken. Additional information on influenza in swine, variant influenza virus infection in humans, and strategies to interact safely with swine can be found at <www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/index.htm>. Additional information regarding human infections with novel influenza A viruses can be found at http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html."
