ENTEROVIRUS OUTBREAK EASING:
Taipei, July 13 (CNA) The enterovirus outbreak appears to be easing as
there have been no new reported cases of the disease in the last three
days, a Department of Health official said.
Hsu Tsu-mei, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease
Control, said despite the good news the department's alert concerning
enterovirus has not been downgraded.
Taiwan's 596 regional hospitals reported 135 new cases of enterovirus on
June 9, but the figure dropped to 29 on July 10. Since July 10, no new
cases have been reported, Hsu said.
The DOH cannot predict when the alert will be withdrawn, she said, adding
that the enterovirus outbreak could continue until early fall.
She urged the public to continue with preventative measures such as
frequently washing their hands and avoiding public places.
