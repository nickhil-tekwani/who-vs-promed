[There is no indication in this report if these JE virus infections
have been laboratory confirmed. This area is located in the northern
area of the Ganga River plain, where JE virus probably remains
endemic. There have been significant JE outbreaks in Nepal in the
past, with 24 districts having been classified as endemic previously
(see ProMED archive no. 20060831.2475). The 1st outbreak was reported
in 1978, and there have been sporadic outbreaks since.
