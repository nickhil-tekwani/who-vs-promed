Owners must not take horses to events or competitions if others at the yard appear unwell, the British Equestrian Federation (BEF) has stated, after a number of new cases of flu have been confirmed.

The Animal Health Trust (AHT) has reported confirmed cases of the virus in Shropshire, Worcestershire, Norfolk and Buckinghamshire over the weekend. In Worcestershire, 16 horses tested positive at one premise, which the AHT states is thought to be related to unvaccinated horses coming into contact with other equines at an event.

"The BEF continues to recommend strongly that unvaccinated horses do not mix with other horses," the federation said in a statement. "Our advice remains that owners MUST NOT take their horse to an event or competition if horses at their yard appear to be unwell. The current outbreak has demonstrated the importance of vaccinations and the BEF continues to urge all owners to ensure that their vaccination records are up to date. If it has been longer than 6 months since the last vaccination, we strongly recommend discussing a booster with their veterinary surgeon."

The BEF has asked organisers of all competitions and training events to check the passports of all horses attending to ensure they are vaccinated.

A number of venues have also put in place extra precautionary measures, and riders are advised to check requirements before they leave.

British Eventing (BE) season starts next weekend (2-3 March) and some organisers are among those to change requirements. BE said that if a venue has "enhanced the conditions of vaccinations above those required" under BE rule 10.2, any horse competing must abide by these requirements. The list of policies for forthcoming BE fixtures is on the BE website, but riders should check with venues directly.

Statement on equine influenza outbreaks in vaccinated horses
------------------------------------------------------------
We are seeing more cases of equine flu than we would normally expect, due to a new strain of flu in circulation. Through our own laboratories, we continue to test samples from horses suspected of having flu. To 17 Feb 2018, we have confirmed 29 flu outbreaks across 17 counties in England and Scotland.

Equine flu is endemic in the UK. This means that a number of cases of flu are always expected to be seen, as the virus is constantly circulating within the UK horse population. Owners should ensure they are aware of the symptoms of flu and call their vet immediately to make a fast diagnosis, to avoid the spread of the infection.

Vaccinated horses should have a level of protection to this new strain. If vaccinated horses are exposed to the virus, clinical signs should be milder and they should get better faster than an unvaccinated horse. This has been demonstrated in the vaccinated cases seen so far this year. We continue to emphasise the importance of vaccination in protecting horses against equine flu.

Reassuringly, the charity confirms that vaccines are providing a better degree of protection than was initially thought when disease outbreaks became apparent in Europe, especially when recent boosting has been implemented. We recommend that all horse owners revaccinate their horse if the booster vaccination was given more than 6 months ago.

It is clear that this strain of the virus (Florida Clade 1 H3N8) is not going away and is taking advantage of any opportunity given to it to spread among our horse population. Collectively, we all need to do everything we can to minimise these opportunities.

The Animal Health Trust recommends 5 basic protocols:

1. Vaccinate - boost your horse's vaccination if it was given more than 6 months ago and encourage others to do the same. If your horse is not vaccinated, it will need to start a course of vaccinations and will not have protection until 2 weeks after the 2nd vaccine in the course is given.

2. Isolate - what biosecurity measures are in place at your own yard? Immediately isolate new or unwell horses away from the main yard to help prevent the disease spreading. Flu is easily spread amongst a group of horses. Make sure you know your own biosecurity policies, and if you're not sure ask the yard owners and managers.

3. Investigate - if you're planning to attend an event or equine gathering, speak to the organisers and ask about their biosecurity policies - what is in place to minimise the spread of disease at the event / gathering? If you are not comfortable with what is in place, don't attend!

4. Communicate - we encourage vets and horse owners to be open if they have a suspected or confirmed outbreak, to help minimise the spread of flu to others.

5. Mitigate - horse owners are encouraged to do all they can to know the risk of moving their horse or attending an event. Gather as much information as you can to enable you to mitigate against the risk and make your own sensible decision based on this.

[As stated in the AHT updated statement, Equine flu is endemic in the UK, but the current event is caused by a new strain (in the UK). The statement further says: "It is clear that this strain of the virus (Florida Clade 1 H3N8) is not going away and is taking advantage of any opportunity given to it to spread among our horse population".

UK, and other countries suffering 1st introductions of a new virus strain of a listed disease into their respective equine populations are required to report such an event, presenting a change in the pathogenicity/epidemiology of the disease, immediately to the OIE. This requirement is meant to allow member countries to timely apply relevant preventive measures. - Mod.AS
