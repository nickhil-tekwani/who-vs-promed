Paraguay: yellow fever - WHO update 2
-------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPBS) of Paraguay
has reported that more than 1.27 million people have been vaccinated
against yellow fever (YF) in 18 departments [state or province
equivalents], with coverage reaching 83 percent of the population in
Asuncion and 75 percent in the Central Department [the focal areas of
the YF outbreak. - Mod.TY]

The number of confirmed cases of YF has risen with 5 new cases and is
now at 21 cases, including 5 deaths, according to Ministry figures,
with 10 cases in San Pedro, 2 in Laurelty, and 2 in other areas.
Another 12 suspected cases are being investigated.

Meanwhile, at a recent meeting in Port Iguazu, officials from Brazil,
Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru agreed to coordinate
and monitor yellow fever immunization for the populations of border
areas, with the support of the Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO). They also agreed that the principal measure to prevent
urbanization of the disease is reduction of breeding sites for _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes throughout the region.

[This report adds an additional YF case to Paraguay's total. The
massive YF vaccination campaign has achieved the degree of coverage
that there should be few, if any, new cases.
