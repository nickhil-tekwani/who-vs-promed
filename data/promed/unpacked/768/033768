[previous post: Avian botulism killed 400 ducks at a wetlands reserve in
Boise. Avian botulism is a naturally-occurring bacteria which can sometimes
turn deadly for waterfowl. Experts believe this happened for 2 months to
the ducks roosting at night in the 44-acre open space. They say the
bacteria was a slow killer. It altered the ducks ability to fly and they
eventually starved to death in the wetlands where there was not enough food
to sustain them.

As the moderator points out botulism is a disease associated with warm
temperatures. If this problem has been going on for two months, it doesn't
exactly fit the picture. Has encephalitis (EEE, WEE, NDV, etc.) been ruled
out?
