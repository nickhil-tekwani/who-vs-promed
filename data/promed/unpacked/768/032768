Another 2 people died because of monkey fever [Kyasanur Forest disease] in Sagar district. In addition, the deaths of monkeys are continuing at several places in the taluk of Sagar in the district. [A 56-year-old] resident of Kanchikai village of Barangi Hobali under the limits of Aralagodu gram panchayat, who had lost her son 4 days ago due to monkey fever, died on the night of [Fri 4 Jan 2019], In addition [a 17-year-old] resident of Jeegala died on [Sat 5 Jan 2019].

[The 56-year-old woman] was running high fever from the day her son died. She was admitted to Mcgann hospital of the city [Shimoga]. But the treatment did not yield any recovery. [A daughter of] residents of Jeegala was being treated at Sahyadri Narayana Hridayalaya for high fever also died on [Sat 5 Jan 2019]. [She] was studying in Sagar and took ill after she arrived at her hometown of Jeegala. In total 7 people have died because of monkey fever in the taluk of Sagar so far.

DMOs [district medical officers] of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts alert public on monkey fever. The public of the twin districts of DK and Udupi have to take precautions against the monkey fever as the disease is spreading rapidly in the region of Malnad. Steps are being taken to prevent the onset of disease in the people living near forest and hills.

DMO of Mangaluru, Dr Ramakrishna Rao and DMO of Udupi, Dr Rohini said that 7 people have died due to monkey fever in Sagar of Shivamogga district but so far no cases are reported from the twin districts.

Flavivirus which is responsible for this fever is seen in rats, rodents, squirrels, and monkeys. When the leeches on the monkeys which die of monkey fever bite the human beings, it spreads to the concerned person. In addition, the leeches also suck the blood of cattle and through that also the monkey fever reaches human beings. As the leeches are active in the period of January to June, precautions need to be taken.

Symptoms of monkey fever
------------------------
High fever, body pain, head ache, bleeding from nose, mouth, and any other parts of the body. After fever for one or 2 weeks, encephalitis, fever, tightness of the throat, headache, and vomiting is noticed.

"Awareness about the monkey fever will be done through meeting with public in areas of Kundapur and Hebri. If people come across death of monkey, the same should be informed to the health department immediately," said the DMO of Udupi district.

Precautions to be taken against monkey fever
--------------------------------------------
- Leeches are the root cause of the spread of this disease. Caution should be taken while working near the cattle or in the forest or farmland.
- Medicine to kill the leeches should be sprayed.
- It is better to provide fodder to the cattle in the shed itself than allowing them to graze.
- Do not venture in forests and bushy areas. If unavoidable then wearing of boots, clothes full covering the body and hat is mandatory. Once returning from these areas should have bath immediately.
- If dead monkeys are noticed, the same should be brought to the notice of the concerned immediately.
- Do not neglect any fever. Contact the physician at the earliest and take proper treatment.

[The report above mentions 'leeches' as vectors of KFD from monkeys to humans, which is actually not correct. In fact, transmission to humans may occur after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, most importantly a sick or recently dead monkey. No person-to-person transmission has been described. Large animals such as goats, cows, and sheep may become infected with KFD but play a limited role in the transmission of the disease. These animals provide the blood meals for ticks and it is possible for infected animals with viremia to infect other ticks, but transmission of KFDV to humans from these larger animals is extremely rare. Furthermore, there is no evidence of disease transmission via the unpasteurized milk of any of these animals (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/transmission/index.html). -Mod.UBA]

At least 6 people have died due to Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, in Shivamogga district of Karnataka. According to reports, as many as 15 people have also tested positive for the fatal viral infection, triggering fears among residents.

Meanwhile, health officials in the state are working hard to prevent another outbreak of the disease, which is a growing epidemic and has wreaked havoc. Reportedly, the district administration has also issued health advisory asking residents to stay at least 50 metres away from a dead monkey.

What is Kyasanur Forest disease? What causes monkey disease?
Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is a re-emerging zoonotic disease endemic in Karnataka. It is caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. First identified in 1957 from Kyasanur forest area, Shimoga district of Karnataka, India, the disease derives its name from the forest range where the virus was first isolated. The disease is also referred to as monkey fever by local people due to its association with monkey deaths.

How is Kyasanur forest disease transmitted?
The disease can be transmitted to human by the bite of infected ticks or via contact with a sick or recently dead monkey. Human to human transmission has not been reported yet.

What are the signs and symptoms of Kyasanur forest disease?
After an incubation period of 3-8 days, the symptoms of KFD start with chills, frontal headache, and fever. Other symptoms include severe muscle pain with vomiting and diarrhoea, mental disturbances, etc. According to CDC, patients may also experience abnormally low blood pressure, low platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell counts.

In most cases, patients can recover without complication after 1-2 weeks -- but the convalescent period is typically long, lasting for several months. The estimated fatality rate is from 2 to 10 percent for KFD, as per national health portal, India.

How is Kyasanur Forest disease treated?
Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for KFD, however, early medical care and supportive therapy -- such as maintenance of hydration and management of neurological symptoms -- are important.

Can Kyasanur Forest disease be prevented?
A vaccine does exist for KFD and is used in endemic areas -- of a disease or condition occurs regularly in a particular area. Additional preventative measures include using insect repellents, wearing protective clothing in areas particularly where ticks are endemic, and avoiding contact with dead monkeys.

[Based on the report above, there are 15 confirmed cases with 6 deaths in the latest KFD outbreak in various parts of Shivamogga district in Karnataka state.

KFD continues to be a zoonotic disease of public health concern in Karnataka state and other parts of India where the disease in endemic.

Prophylaxis by vaccination, as well as preventive measures like protective clothing, tick control, and mosquito control are advised. The vaccine for KFDV consists of formalin-inactivated KFDV. The vaccine has a 62.4 percent effectiveness rate for individuals who receive 2 doses. For individuals who receive an additional dose, the effectiveness increases to 82.9 percent [Kasabi GS, Murhekar MV, Sandhya VK, et al. Coverage and effectiveness of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) vaccine in Karnataka, South India, 2005-10." PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2013; 7(1):e2025; https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002025]. Specific treatments are not available.

Vaccination with formalin-inactivated tissue-culture vaccine has been the primary strategy for controlling KFD. The strategy involves mass vaccination in areas reporting KFD activity (that is, laboratory evidence of KFD virus [KFDV] in monkeys, humans, or ticks) and in villages within a 5 km [3.106 mi approx.] radius of such areas [Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, 2005 manual on Kyasanur Forest disease; unpub. data]. 2 vaccine doses are administered at least one month apart to persons 7-65 years of age. Vaccine-induced immunity is short-lived, so the 1st booster dose of vaccine is recommended within 6-9 months after primary vaccination; thereafter, annual booster doses are recommended for 5 years after the last confirmed case in the area (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/1/14-1227_article).

There is a need to create awareness on how to avoid tick bites, and KFD vaccination facilities should be available in the affected areas. KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to prevent KFD. - Mod.UBA
