ASR on soybean - Georgia: 1st report 2006
Georgia officials reported today, 10 Jul 2006, a confirmation of soybean
rust from a soybean sentinel plot in Decatur County. Decatur County borders
Gadsden County, Florida, where rust was found earlier this year on kudzu.
This is the 3rd report of soybean rust on this year's soybeans.
Report for 10 Jul from Georgia: Soybean and kudzu sentinel and non-sentinel
sites continue to be monitored for soybean rust. The Miller County find
last week on kudzu has rust that is slowly spreading within that site.
Today rust was found on a sample collected 7 Jul 2006 from a soybean
sentinel plot located at the UGA Attapulgus Research and Education Center
in Attapulgus, GA. This is located in Decatur County, GA, which is in the
southwest corner of the state and about 15 miles from Quincy, FL, where
rust has been confirmed, so this rust found in this location is no
surprise. One of 100 leaflets were infected with 7-8 rust pustules. The 100
leaflets were collected from the lower canopy of the soybean sentinel plot
-- growth stage is about R4-R5. To our knowledge, this is the 1st find on
soybean [in Georgia - Mod.JAD] this season. The rust found today seems to
be a new infection. We can't say for certain, but spores could have
possibly been brought in from Florida when the Alberto system moved through
the area.
ASR on kudzu - Louisiana
Soybean rust was found on kudzu in Iberia Parish, Louisiana on 7 Jul 2006.
This is the 2nd find in Louisiana in 2006.
Summary - USA
Rust has been reported from 25 counties; 5 in Alabama, 12 in Florida, 5 in
Georgia, one in Texas, and 2 in Louisiana.

[Asian soybean rust (ASR) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green beans,
and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen which causes
defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese
arrowroot) is an important alternate host for the pathogen in southern
states of the USA.
The 3rd report of ASR on soybeans in the USA has come this year in mid July
2006 and could be interpreted to mean that the ASR cycle in the crop has
now begun. Additional findings of ASR in kudzu in Louisiana in counties
where ASR has not been previously detected points to the expansion of the
hold the pathogen has on its alternate host.
