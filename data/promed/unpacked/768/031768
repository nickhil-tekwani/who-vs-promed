Nebraska: first case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in state
--------------------------------------------------------------
The death of a man at a Scottsbluff hospital [in June] was Nebraska's first
case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, state officials have confirmed.
State health investigators are trying to determine how the man contracted
the rodentborne disease. The federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have confirmed that the man died of hantavirus [infection].
Hantavirus is contained in the droppings of mice and other rodents that
carry the organism and can be inhaled if it becomes airborne. Samplings
done the past several years found that 3 to 5 per cent of the rodents
tested in Nebraska carried the virus, stated Dr Thomas Safranek, state
epidemiologist. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome begins much like a flu, with
muscle aches and a fever, followed by shortness of breath and coughing. It
typically progresses rapidly, requiring artificial ventilation within 24 hours.
Safranek said people should not be alarmed. "Our advice to people is to do
good rodent control ... whether it is in your house, your workplace, a
barn, whatever." Since it is spread through rodent urine, feces, or saliva,
people typically contract the disease in rural areas by inhaling the virus
particles while cleaning out a rodent infested space, such as a barn, cabin
or stable.
Only about 300 cases of the viral illness have been confirmed in the United
States, only 15 of them east of the Mississippi River. The disease was
first identified in the south west in 1993.

syndrome update, because it represents the first confirmed human case of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Nebraska, although hantaviruses have been
identified in wild rodents in the state. - Mod.CP]
