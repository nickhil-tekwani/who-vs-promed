USA: Norovirus Outbreak Kills 3 in Vancouver (WA) Retirement Center
-----------------------------------------------
A 3rd person died on Fri 7 Apr 2006 from a virus infection outbreak
at a retirement center. The virus has sickened more than 55 residents
and workers, authorities said.
40 residents and 19 staff members of the Cascade Inn were affected by
[norovirus infection]. Nine people have been hospitalized, Clark
County health officials said. Marni Storey, manager of the Health
Department's infectious disease program, said she expects to see more
cases before the outbreak of norovirus [infection] dies down. All 3
deaths involved elderly residents with other underlying medical
conditions, health officials said. The previous deaths occurred Wed 5
Apr and Thu 6 Apr 2006.
Health officials have asked the 180 residents to stay in their rooms
and urged friends and family not to visit until the outbreak runs its
course. Social activities have been canceled.
Norovirus [infection] is common and often takes the form of a mild
stomach disorder. Symptoms can include nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.
The virus strikes the elderly particularly hard if they suffer from
other medical conditions, Storey said. The voluntary quarantine will
remain in effect until 4 days after the last new diagnosis, perhaps
another week, Storey has said. Investigators are still interviewing
residents, hoping to learn more about the source of the outbreak, she
said.

[Outbreaks of norovirus infection are common at this time of year in
hospital wards, health-care institutions, schools, and other closed
communities, and anywhere where people from diverse backgrounds may
be confined together, such as on a cruise ship.
The virus responsible is an enteric virus colloquially known as the
"winter vomiting bug." There is no protective vaccine available, and
only high standards of hygiene and isolation of affected individuals
can contain an outbreak. Fortunately, norovirus-associated disease
normally resolves within 24-48 hours without serious consequence. The
Washington state retirement center outbreak is significant in the
number of deaths observed, possibly due to the frailty of the
residents.
