Anthrax is not new to Dehgam
----------------------------
Nandol village in Dehgam taluka, which is the epicentre of the recent
anthrax outbreak in the state, is not new to the disease. 3 years ago
in Bhaiyal village, 20 km [12.4 miles] from Nandol, a few bovines had
died of a mysterious disease. The authorities then had confirmed the
presence of anthrax bacteria in the area.

"Once released from the body of an infected animal, the bacteria can
survive in the ground for close to 40 years. These bacteria form a
protective cover and then turn into spores. Once they get a proper
environment -- a living body for instance -- the cysts break and
bacteria comes alive," said a senior animal husbandry official.
Senior animal husbandry department officials see this as a warning
sign as recurrence of the bacteria in a particular area would allow
the bacterial spores to develop a more resistant form and can effect
humans too. Incubation period is from one day to 7 days. In some
cases, incubation period can extend up to 60 days. Most infections
occur within 48 hours of exposure. Infected animals are generally
cremated and any human contact with blood as a result of internal
haemorrhage or body fluids oozing in infected animals is avoided.

Authorities are closely watching migrating patterns of the bacteria
and have already created a epidemiological map. Last year [2008],
anthrax bacteria had attacked 7 cattle in Bagdana village in
Bhavnagar district.

While studying the entomology of the disease, animal husbandry
officials suspect that 2 herdsmen were [transporting] a flock of 100
sheep and 30 goats from Rajkot a fortnight [14 days] ago. They had a
brief stop at Bhaiyal and it is here that authorities feel that the
23 sheep might have contracted the bacteria. Authorities confirm that
no deaths have taken place since Saturday after vaccination was
carried out in surrounding villages.

As part of the drive, bovines in Vadvasa, Sanoda, Salki, Ahmedpura,
Halisa and Jhalundra villages have been vaccinated. In the past,
anthrax cases have been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and
Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Karnataka and West Bengal. Outbreaks of
anthrax have been reported from Karnataka in 1999 and 2001, while
Orissa was hit twice in 2003 and 2005.

[Depending on the exposure dose, deaths are fairly prompt, say 1-5
days, but can extend out to 12 days or so. Extended periods beyond
this are more a result of latent infections which break when the
spores germinate in a host with poor innate resistance. This report
indicates that the local authorities are taking this incident
seriously and responding appropriately. Readers will note that there
is no reference to bovine deaths. Read on. - Mod.MHJ]

Government on tenterhooks as cattle die of anthrax
--------------------------------------------------
After 35 deaths of cattle due to anthrax, the state government has
swung into action and decided to vaccinate all the cattle in the
nearby villages of Dehgam.

Animal husbandry minister Dilip Sanghani said after declaring the
area as anthrax-hit zone, the government has sent 5 to 6 teams of
animal husbandry experts and doctors to these villages. Sanghani
confirmed that there were reports of 35 animal deaths due to anthrax.
However, for the last 5 to 6 days, there have no deaths in the region.

Health secretary Ravi Saxena said a house to house survey has been
carried out in the area. Around 5000 people have been checked and it
was found that 9 people had consumed milk from the infected cattle.
However, their reports have revealed that they were safe.

He said the vaccination of animals has been carried out and people
have been asked to dispose of infected animals in a proper and
systematic way. Sanghani said an infected animal could create a threat
to others too. He further said the teams of the health department are
also camping in the region to check any spread of the infection among
humans.

Officials said the government has banned the sale of meat in the
region and issued a warning to the people that they should refrrain
from eating meat, especially that of cattle.

[This is a mite confusing, but the detail provided indicates that
these 3 dozen cattle may have died, and not just be a journalistic
confusion of species and numbers. A number of scenarios present
themselves including the vaccinating teams coming across these
unreported dead animals in various villages in the Dehgam taluka, or
the sheep having died on common grazing where the cattle came in
contact with them. Clarification by one of our informed Indian
colleagues would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ]

[I believe in some Asian countries sheep and goats are referred to as
"small cattle" and bovines as "large cattle", but I do not know if
that is the case in India. Clarification would be welcome.
