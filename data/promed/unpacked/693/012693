Five pet dogs are dead and another 25 have been treated for liver failure by veterinarians in Victoria's east, prompting an urgent investigation into potentially toxic pet food linked to the animals.

A Bairnsdale pet food retailer has issued an "urgent product recall" of 10-kg [22 lbs] Bulk Coarse Beef urging customers on social media to "please stop feeding to your pets and return what is left to us. If you observe any signs of lethargy, illness or your pet is off their food, even a little, please contact your vet immediately," said the Facebook post.

Pet food regulator PrimeSafe said it was in the early stages of an investigation into potential breaches of the law in the production of pet food. "PrimeSafe has recommended the retail outlet initiate a voluntary recall of potentially affected pet meat," the regulator said. The regulator is yet to determine whether the meat is the cause of the liver failure but says it has been linked to each dog that fell ill.

The meat is believed to be sourced from Maffra Knackery in Gippsland and sold by retailer Doggie Den in Bairnsdale. Management at Maffra Knackery declined to speak to the ABC.

State government-run Agriculture Victoria said it was aware of "a cluster of dogs suffering from severe liver disease in the Bairnsdale area." The organisation is working with local vets and facilitating testing to determine what's behind the cluster.

[KN] from Bairnsdale said she first suspected her rescue greyhounds Daisy and Marley were sick when they lost their appetite early last week. "Daisy refused to eat anything," she said. "I tried various foods, but she just really was not herself."

[KN's] fears were confirmed when she checked social media and found concerns by other pet owners. "I got the message there had possibly been contaminated meat in the area, so I took Daisy straight to the vet," she said.

Daisy, who has recovered, was treated by Veterinarian Jade Hammer at Bairnsdale's Main Street Veterinary Clinic. Mr Hammer said the clinic has treated a "cluster of acute hepatopathy" -- liver abnormality and failure -- in the past fortnight.

"Since then, we've seen about 30 cases of dogs affected in the area," Mr Hammer said. "Once we noticed the link between the dogs we started testing for a variety of diseases. Unfortunately, on those having died, we have done post-mortems. Agriculture Victoria has started testing those samples and confirmed it is a toxic insult to the liver."

While the specific toxin test results will not be available until next week, Mr Hammer said he believed most of the dogs had eaten the same product.

Doggie Den owner [WS] said he found out about the cases from a vet on Thursday [1 Jul 2021]. "They found a correlation between all the cases having eaten one of our products, our bulk coarse meat," he said.

The following day, PrimeSafe contacted the business and asked it to recall the product. "We contacted as many customers as we had contact details for," [WS] said. "We also opened it up for anyone who had any doubts about any of the meat. We'll refund it, no questions asked."

[WS] said more than 1000 kilograms [2205 lbs] of the 10-kilogram [22 lbs] bags of meat had been returned. "It's probably cost us in excess of AUD 10 000 [USD 7485]," he said.

"It's been extremely distressing, not just to me but to my staff as well. We don't want to be involved in getting any pet unwell, let alone dying."

Watch your dogs for:
- Reduced appetite
- Increased thirst
- Vomiting
- Yellowing around the eyes and gums

If your dog has any of these signs, call a vet.

[Raw meat diets for pets are popular in Australia and, according to some accounts, under-regulated for safety of the final product.

There are many websites touting Australia's raw meat dog foods and some hazards of feeding it, including such things as _Salmonella_ in some cases and inadequate dietary needs for pets.

However, I am unaware of a meat product capable of producing signs of severe liver disease and lethargy. I noted in this article it is called coarse meat. I am uncertain whether the term refers to a grinding coarseness of the meat, or if it means it is not fully raw/cooked or if something is mixed with the meat, such as a pulverized grain source?

Without toxicology and pathology reports, it is difficult to speculate on the toxin. However, initially it reminded me of the aflatoxin outbreaks associated with pet food in other areas. The clinical signs in the dogs are certainly lining up to look like aflatoxin. However, aflatoxin is a grain-based toxicant. So, is there grain mixed into this meat? Are there multiple issues here such as _Salmonella_ and aflatoxin in this pet food product? Another question for which I currently do not have an answer is whether this or a similar product is fed to cats. Cats can also suffer from toxicities of aflatoxin and/or _Salmonella_.

We look forward to the toxicology report pending from Australia. - Mod.TG
