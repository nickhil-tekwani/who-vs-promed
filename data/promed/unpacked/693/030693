Seychelles: ship quarantined off Reunion - undiagnosed fatal illness
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A French medical laboratory in Lyons has dismissed any likelihood of
Marburg hemorrhagic fever on board the bulk carrier Clipper Lancaster. The
ship is being held in quarantine off the Indian Ocean island of Reunion.
The nature of the mystery fever that claimed the life of a Rumanian
seafarer and left a 2nd sailor seriously ill remains unidentified, however.
The 2 seafarers, members of a crew of 22, became ill soon after the 28 429
dead weight tonnage ship left Durban on 5 Jun 2005, where it had stopped
briefly to refuel. The surviving crewman has been responding to treatment.
Before calling at Durban, the ship had loaded lumber at Pointe Noire in
Congo Brazzaville and had called earlier at Angolan ports. A serious
outbreak of Marburg fever is raging in northern Angola.
Authorities in La Reunion said the vessel would be allowed to continue its
voyage to China once the body had been removed. A postmortem would not be
performed.
