The outbreak referred to by OIE was probably the June outbreak in 2013 that killed a herd of cattle. The report 20130614.1771702 said that 15 were found dead initially but then other deaths were identified. If these were buried near the archeological site, the grave might have been disturbed, and the contaminated soil and bones discovered by these free-ranging cattle. Golan in HaZafon (Northern District) has become a hotbed for this disease and established risk to grazing stock or animals fed on hay from this area. As the vaccine status of this affected herd was not mentioned, I think we can presume that they had not been vaccinated previously. This policy needs to be seriously reconsidered at an early date and for all cattle in that region, and instituted on an annual basis.

As these outbreaks were laboratory confirmed, it is logical to expect that the Kimron Veterinary Institute has archived their cultures and has or can submit them to DNA analysis. If there is a match with previous outbreaks, the link can be seen to be more direct. - Mod.MHJ
