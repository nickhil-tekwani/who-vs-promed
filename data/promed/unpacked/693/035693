Musquash is a synonym for muskrat, of Algonquin Indian origin, but my
dictionary claims their range is just US & Canada.  Not directly related to
the thread, history lovers should hunt out Carleton Gadjusek's (Nobelist)
book titled (I think) Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers and Mycotoxicoses of the
USSR, published around 1950.

The region definitely is Novosibirsk, Siberia. Ondatra is a kind of a
water rat. People in Russia like to hunt that animal because of its fur
which is used for making winter hats.

[The natural range of the muskrat, also called in Russia "fur rat", is in
North America but muskrats were imported to Siberia for commercial hunting
in the 1930s and now populate most lakes in the Omsk and Novosibirsk
regions. The correct species name is _Ondatra zibethica_. Carleton
Gadjusek's book is a classic but for more details than you really want to
know about Omsk hemorrhagic fever, try to find a copy of the book cleverly
named "Omsk hemorrhagic fever", by N.N. Kharitonova and Yu.A. Leonov,
edited by the great man himself, Mikhail Petrovich Chumakov. The book was
published for the National Library of Medicine by Amerind Publishing Co.,
Ltd., New Delhi, India, 1985, 230 pages. It's worth the effort finding it.
Now that we have discussed etymology, can someone provide data regarding
this outbreak? This can be a very serious illness, often fatal. - Mod.CHC]
