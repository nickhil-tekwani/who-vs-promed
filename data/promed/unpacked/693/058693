identifies hantaviruses in the New World as follows.
North America:
Hantaviruses in the New World are associated with hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS). Sigmodontine rodents carry the hantaviruses that cause HPS
and are found throughout the Americas. Sin Nombre virus, carried by
_Peromyscus maniculatus_, is the predominant cause of HPS in the United
States and Canada. Mononghela, New York, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal
viruses also cause HPS and are found in eastern Canada and in the eastern
and southeastern United States.
In South and Central America, hantaviruses that have been identified as
causing HPS are Andes virus in Argentina and Chile; Andes-like viruses
including Oran, Lechiguanas, and Hu39694 in Argentina; Laguna Negra virus in
Bolivia and Paraguay; Bermejo virus in Argentina; Juquitiba virus in Brazil;
and Choclo virus in Panama.
Numerous other hantaviruses have been identified but have not been linked to
human disease. - Mod.CP]

Epidemiological situation of hantavirus in Brazil
-----------------------------------------------
Up to 5 Sep 2004, 85 new cases of hantavirus infection were confirmed
in Brazil as Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HPS). The number of
cases reported to date for this year [2004] is equivalent to the
total number of cases reported for 2003 [illustrated in a figure, not
shown here]. These 85 cases were detected in 10 (37 percent) of the
Brazilian states, with only the northeastern region not registering
cases. Nearly 60 percent of the cases were detected in Minas Gerais
and the Federal District. The geographical spread of the disease is
limited to 45 areas or municipalities of transmission, or 0.8 percent
of the total number of Brazilian municipalities [illustrated by a
figure, not shown here].
Cases [were] detected every month during the year [2004], with 56.5
percent (48) reported from May to July and an increase in the number
of cases from April onwards [illustrated by a figure, not shown here].
Concerning the profile of the persons admitted to the hospital for
HPS this year [2004], 69.4 percent (59 cases) were men and 81.2
percent (69) were between 21 and 50 years of age (Tables 1 and 2).
Age ranged from 15 to 71 years, with the mean and median ages 34 and
36, respectively. The mode was 24 years.

(*) preliminary data
Of the 85 cases, 51 of the patients (60 percent) were released from
the hospital. During the period under analysis, the State of Minas
Gerais presented the lowest case-fatality rate of 32 percent among
the 25 cases; followed by Santa Catarina (with 37.5 percent) and the
Federal District (with 38.5 percent). Altogether, these states
reported 69.4 percent of all cases (or 59 of them). The average
case-fatality rate now stands at 40 percent, which is lower than in
the past (Table 3).

USA: 2 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome; Randolph County, West
Virginia, July 2004
-----------------------------------------------
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare cardiopulmonary disease
caused by viruses of the genus _Hantavirus_, for which rodents are
the natural reservoir [1,2]. Transmission to humans occurs by direct
contact with rodents or their excreta or by inhalation of aerosolized
infectious material (e.g., dust created by disturbing rodent nests).
In July 2004, HPS cases (including one fatal case) were reported in 2
persons believed to have been exposed at sites approximately 12 miles
apart in Randolph County, West Virginia (2000 population: 28 254)
[3]. This report describes the 2 cases and summarizes their
epidemiologic and environmental investigations. Clinicians and the
public need to be educated about the risk for HPS and methods to
reduce that risk.
Case Investigations
-----
Patient A. In early July 2004, a wildlife sciences graduate student,
a man aged 32 years, visited an emergency department (ED) in
Blacksburg, Virginia with complaints of fever, cough, and sore chest
[pains] since the previous evening. The ED clinician noted possible
rodent exposure in the medical history of the patient. Examination
revealed a temperature of 102.7 F (39.3 C) and an oxygen saturation
of 96 percent (normal). A complete blood count (CBC) revealed a left
shift with no bands (granulocytes: 87 percent) and lymphopenia
(lymphocytes: 400/cubic mm). Radiographic examination indicated faint
right-sided pneumonia. In the ED, the graduate student began vomiting
and was admitted for intravenous hydration and parenteral
antibiotics. He became progressively hypoxic, requiring supplemental
oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure, and eventually intubation
with mechanical ventilation. Repeated radiographs revealed bilateral
pulmonary edema.
The next day, the patient was hypotensive, requiring intravenous
pressor support. He received activated protein C to prevent
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A repeat CBC revealed
bands (granulocytes: 20 percent) and a decreased platelet count (115
000/cubic mm); urinalysis indicated mild hematuria and proteinuria.
Despite aggressive supportive care, the patient's status continued to
deteriorate, and he died on the 3rd day of his hospitalization.
Differential diagnosis included tularemia, pneumococcal sepsis, and
HPS. Serum specimens submitted to ARUP Laboratories (Salt Lake City,
Utah) were positive for both IgG and IgM antibodies to hantaviruses;
these test results were confirmed by CDC. A spleen biopsy was also
positive by immunohistochemistry for hantavirus antigens. A serum
sample was positive for hantavirus RNA by real-time reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing of the
amplified nucleic acid identified the virus as the hantavirus species
_Monongahela virus_ [4].
According to interviews with his coworkers, the patient had spent the
previous month [June 2004] trapping small mammals for study and
handling mice (_Peromyscus_ spp.) daily. 2 students and a recent
graduate who had worked with the patient reported that none of them
had consistently worn gloves while handling rodents or washed their
hands after handling rodents or their excreta, even before eating.
The students also reported frequent rodent bites on their bare hands.
Patient B. In early July 2004, a Randolph County resident, a man aged
41 years, spent a weekend at a log cabin with his family. 2 days
later, he had fatigue, a dull headache, and a mild fever. The
following day, he had a temperature of 102.9 F (39.4 C). The next
morning, he visited his primary-care physician with hematuria, but no
fever, and was released on empiric antibiotic therapy for a possible
urinary tract infection.
The patient returned 2 days later with a severe headache of
approximately 12 hours duration; he was referred immediately to the
local ED. On arrival, the patient was hypoxic with a room air oxygen
saturation of 90 percent; chest radiographs revealed right-sided
pneumonia and congestive heart failure. The patient was airlifted to
a referral hospital, with hypotension and bradycardia. His white
blood cell count was normal, and cardiac enzymes were negative. The
patient was placed in the intensive care unit and administered
intravenous pressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Differential
diagnosis included viral myocarditis, atypical pneumonia, and
opportunistic infection, and was later broadened to include HPS and
other infectious and autoimmune etiologies.
The patient was intubated the next day and started on high-frequency
oscillator ventilatory support. The patient's condition deteriorated,
with onset of thrombocytopenia, DIC, hypoalbuminemia, and renal
insufficiency requiring hemodialysis. After 5 days of
hospitalization, his condition began to improve. Serum samples were
reported positive for IgG and IgM antibodies to hantaviruses by ARUP
Laboratories; these results were confirmed by CDC. In addition, a
serum sample taken during his hospitalization was positive for
hantavirus RNA by RT-PCR. Sequencing of the amplified nucleic acid
also identified the virus as the hantavirus _Monongahela virus_. The
patient recovered slowly during the next month [August 2004].
According to family members, when the patient and his family arrived
at the cabin in early July 2004, they aired the interior, after
finding it reeking of rodent urine, and discovered 2 live mice in a
trash can in the kitchen. The patient killed the mice, and later
disposed of the remains, and cleaned the trash can without wearing
gloves. The family slept in the cabin that weekend and trapped 6
additional mice during their stay.
Environmental Investigation
-----
On 3 Aug 2004, investigators from CDC and the West Virginia
Department of Health and Human Resources discovered additional live
mice in the trash can in the cabin of patient B. Openings in the
walls and eaves were identified that permitted easy entry by rodents.
In all, rodents were trapped by the investigating team during the
period 3 to 6 Aug 2004 from 3 rural sites in Randolph County: 1) the
dormitory in which patient A lived and its surroundings, 2) a forest
trapping site where patient A worked the week before his illness, and
3) the family cabin and surroundings of patient B. 14 white-footed
mice (_P. leucopus_) and one deer mouse (_P. maniculatus_) were
captured from 239 traps during a 3-day period. Tissue and blood
specimens were collected and processed for serology. RT-PCR was
conducted on specimens of rodents with positive serology results.
Hantavirus antibodies were detected in one white-footed mouse, which
was also positive for virus RNA by RT-PCR. Sequence of the amplified
RNA indicated that the mouse was infected with the hantavirus
_Monongahela virus_ identical to virus identified in rodents
collected from the location where patient B was presumed to have been
infected. The amplified nucleic acid sequence was similar, but not
identical, to that amplified from patient A.

MMWR Editorial Note
-----
Since HPS was 1st identified in the southwestern United States in
1993, a total of 379 laboratory-confirmed cases of HPS have been
reported in the United States, including 32 retrospectively
identified cases that occurred before 1993. Cases have been reported
in 31 states, the majority of cases in the Southwest. 3 cases of HPS
have been identified as acquired in West Virginia. Subclinical
infections are rare, according to antibody prevalence studies
performed after the 1993 outbreak [5, 6, 7].
In the 1st case described in this report, exposure was probably
occupational. Patient A regularly handled multiple mice, often
suffered bites, and reportedly did not routinely wash his hands after
handling rodents. In the 2nd case, the exposure was peridomestic,
likely associated with contact with live mice and their excreta while
removing them from his cabin. Despite the temporal and geographic
proximity of the 2 cases, no common exposure source, other than the
rodent contact described, appears to exist.
These cases underscore the need to educate the public and clinicians
about the risk for HPS in areas outside the Southwest. In addition,
persons who have occupational exposure to rodents and their excreta
should be trained in proper animal handling and use of personal
protective equipment. Simple, effective methods are available to
reduce exposure to hantaviruses [see original article for details].
Adherence to these precautions can reduce the incidence of HPS.
