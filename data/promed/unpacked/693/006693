According to Ministry of Health, at least 259 people have died from yellow fever in Brazil in the year 2017 and mostly in the southeast from the country.

In the government's announcement on [Fri 12 May 2017], there was a confirmation of 259 deaths, while another 47 were reported to be undergoing investigation and 115 were reported to be ruled out as being due to other causes.

And now there is increase in number of confirmed cases to 756, while another 622 potential cases are being studied by the health authorities.

Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo are the most affected states, which lie in the southeast of Brazil. The states have 488 and 234 confirmed cases, respectively.

_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which is the same vector as Zika, dengue and chikungunya transmits the disease [but not in the current outbreak in Brazil, where the cases are spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. - Mod.TY]

This has been considered as an effective campaign to eliminate breeding grounds for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, conducted both by the government and the public. [The campaign has been focused on vaccination of the populations where the cases have occurred. - Mod.TY]

[Although the number of yellow fever cases continues to increase a bit, the outbreak appears to be declining. Fortunately, there are still no instances documented of _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission, although that risk will continue as long as the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle is occurring.

Individuals planning on traveling to the affected areas in Brazil, or other countries where YF is endemic, should seek vaccination as soon as possible because there is a predicted vaccine shortage starting in mid - to late summer, this year (2017) in the USA.

A 12 May 2017 report indicated that between 27 Apr - 4 May 2017, Brazil has reported 14 additional confirmed cases in the states of Esp√≠rito Santo (9) and Minas Gerais (5), and has discarded 164 suspected cases.
