A new strain of the super bug MRSA has been found in the Isle of Man,
the Department of Health (DoH) has confirmed. The DoH said it had
recently detected a small number of cases of a bacterium called MRSA
USA 300. The strain mostly affects young, fit and healthy people, is
transmitted in sports centres, gyms, and pools and can cause serious
infection, the DoH said. Like all strains, it is resistant to many
antibiotics, it added.

Dr Katie Laird, senior lecturer in pharmaceutical microbiology at De
Montfort University, said: "Bacteria are particularly good at
adapting to their environment and through mutations in their DNA,
which they are able to share with other bacteria, they can become
resistant to antibiotics that are being utilised in health care environments."

The DoH has produced posters, booklets and leaflets about the new
strain, to try to prevent it spreading further. There will also be a
presentation at Keyll Darree Education and Training Centre in Strang,
Douglas, on 17 Jan 2011.

[USA300 is one of the 'USA' types of _Staphylococcus aureus_, e.g.,
USA100-1200 (1). This _S. aureus_ typing nomenclature is a system
established by the CDC that is based on the pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns for both MRSA (2) and
methicillin-susceptible _S. aureus_ (1). Multilocus sequence typing
(MLST), staphylococcus protein A (spa) typing and staphylococcal
cassette chromosome _mec_ (SSC_mec_) typing are also used to
characterize _S. aureus_ isolates. (SCC_mec_ determines
methicillin-resistance.) For example, USA100 are multidrug-resistant
strains of MRSA that typically are associated with health
care-acquired infections.

Over the past decade, USA300 has become the predominant type of
community-associated MRSA in the U.S. (1). It usually carries the
genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leucocidin, and is characterized
by having the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), MLST ST8,
spa-sequence type t008, the _msr_(A) erythromycin resistance gene and
SCC_mec_ type IVa. It has caused outbreaks of skin and soft issue
infection, as well as invasive disease (e.g., bacteremia,
endocarditis, necrotizing pneumonia, and osteomyelitis) in children
in daycare centers, military recruits, athletes, prison inmates, and
men who have sex with men, in which the infected, but otherwise
healthy, individuals had no link to health care systems (1).

USA300 genotype has also emerged as a significant cause of health
care-associated infections in some medical facilities (3,4). USA300
isolates are becoming more resistant to antimicrobial agents,
including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, mupirocin and tetracycline,
and have spread to Europe, Japan, South America and Australia (1).

Isolation of USA300 in regions outside the U.S. (5-7) has been
attributed to importation from the United States due to international
travel, with the potential for subsequent spread in the local
communities. In the UK, USA300 is still considered uncommon (8).

With the experience from the U.S. in mind, the finding of USA300 on
the Isle of Man is of great concern. However, neither the exact
number of cases of infection caused by USA 300, the patient
characteristics (e.g., age, sex, immune status, occupation, exposure
history, etc.), nor the time period during which these cases occurred
is given in the news release above. Further information would be
greatly appreciated.

The Isle of Man, with a population of about 80 000, is a
self-governing British Crown Dependency; it is neither part of the
United Kingdom nor the European Union, although its foreign relations
and defense are the responsibility of the UK Government
(<http://www.isleofman.com/businessandfinance/Parliament.aspx>).

The island is 33 miles (52 kilometers) long and 13 miles (22
kilometers) wide; offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are
key sectors of its economy
(<http://www.isleofman.com/businessandfinance/whyiom.aspx>). It is
located in the middle of the northern Irish Sea, between the islands
of Great Britain and Ireland (For a map of the Isle of Man, see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uk_map_isle_of_man.png>.)

Strang is a hamlet on the Isle of Man where the island's only general
hospital is located and lies just outside Douglas, the island's
capital and largest town, with a population of 26 218 people. - Mod.ML]
