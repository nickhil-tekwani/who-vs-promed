Anthrax in South Dakota buffalo
-------------------------------------------
Anthrax has again appeared in South Dakota livestock. Dr Sam Holland, state
veterinarian, reports [that the disease has struck a buffalo ranch in
Jerauld county.
The state veterinarian's office was called on Wednesday, 29 August, and
specimens were immediately hand delivered to the state diagnostic
laboratory in Brookings where anthrax was confirmed early on Thursday 30
August. Dr Holland reports [that the case involves a herd of about 90
buffalo and losses include 11 head including 10 females and 1 bull. The
herd was immediately treated with antibiotics and vaccinated late on 29
August [because of the preliminary diagnosis of anthrax, and carcasses
properly disposed of under the supervision of Animal Industry Board
personnel. The last death in the herd occurred late on Wednesday 29 August
with no more losses as of Friday 31 August.
Buffalo appear equally susceptible to anthrax as cattle. Canada and Texas
have experienced anthrax in buffalo [and deer this year as well as various
other non-domestic species in Texas. Minnesota and Canada have reported
anthrax in cattle this summer.
Dr Holland says he advised practising veterinarians to be alert for anthrax
in his July newsletter. Rendering companies have also been alerted so that
carcasses are not rendered but properly burned and buried on the farm.

[Anthrax has occurred in Jerauld county before. Though commonly referred to
as "buffalo" these are in fact plains bison. - Mod.MHJ
