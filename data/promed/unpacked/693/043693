Public health officials are warning Santa Cruz County residents of a recent uptick in whooping cough cases. The Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency reports that there have been 66 confirmed whooping cough cases since 1 Sep [2018].

"The number of local pertussis (whooping cough) cases has increased dramatically in recent months," health officials said in a news release. Most of the cases came from school outbreaks, according to the release. Officials didn't say how many cases of the highly contagious illness were reported before 1 Sep [2018].

Officials are working with schools, families, and clinicians to stop outbreaks and prevent more from happening, according to the news release. People can protect themselves from the illness by getting a whooping cough vaccine, according to the release. People should also wash their hands, sneeze into their elbows, and stay home from work or school if they're sick.

The symptoms of whooping cough are often confused with the common cold at 1st. Violent coughing can start one to 2 weeks after the cold symptoms. The illness is treated with antibiotics.

The Flathead City-County Health Department reported a recent rise in pertussis activity. According to a press release, 32 cases have been reported to the department this year [2018], and department officials told NBC Montana that 5 cases were reported Wednesday [28 Nov 2018].

Pertussis can only be confirmed through a nasal swab test. It's a notifiable infectious disease, meaning cases must be reported to the health department. If a case is confirmed, the patient and members of their household are given antibiotics, Dennison said. The Flathead City-County Health Department will also investigate the case to determine others who might have been in contact with the patient and could be at risk.

Dennison said most cases reported to the health department this year [2018] have been among elementary- and middle school-age children. "We've had multiple schools in Flathead County that have been impacted with pertussis," Dennison said.

If a student is diagnosed with pertussis, the school will notify parents. "If your child is considered to be a contact, you will be contacted by the health department," Dennison said.

While the health department reported an increase in pertussis activity in Flathead County, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System shows that cases in the state are down from this time last year [2017]. Last year [2017], 98 cases of pertussis were reported in Montana through 18 Nov [2017]. This year [2018], 59 cases have been reported through Nov. 17 [2018].

The number of cases has trended down nationally since 2012. According to CDC data, 48 227 cases were reported in 2012; 28 639 cases were reported in 2013; 32 971 cases were reported in 2014; 20 762 cases were reported in 2015; 17 972 cases were reported in 2016; and 18 975 cases were reported in 2018.

There is a vaccine for pertussis, and in Montana, children are required to be vaccinated to enter preschool or kindergarten. Children are also required to get another pertussis-containing vaccine before starting 7th grade.

Dennison said adults should make sure their pertussis vaccine is up-to-date. Even if it doesn't prevent the illness, it could mitigate the symptoms.

"It's concerning, the fact that it's so highly contagious and that it is a very dangerous illness," Dennison said. "We don't want it to happen, and we try to limit the spread of it."

https://www.timesreporter.com/news/20181206/akron-childrens-new-philadelphia-office-sees-spike-in-pertussis-cases


In recent weeks, pediatricians from the New Philadelphia office of Akron Children's Hospital Pediatrics have confirmed 14 cases of pertussis (whooping cough), a very contagious and potentially deadly illness, especially for newborns and others at high risk.

Akron Children's is working with public health officials in Tuscarawas, Harrison, and Carroll counties to see if there is any link between the patients, such as sharing the same schools or day-care centers.

Dr. Andrew Newburn, a pediatrician at the New Philadelphia office, said the recent spike in cases is a reminder of the importance of getting immunized for pertussis, using good hygiene when coughing and sneezing, and seeking immediate treatment when parents notice symptoms consistent with the disease. "While pertussis vaccines are the most effective tool to prevent this disease, no vaccine is 100% effective," said Newburn. "When pertussis circulates in a community, there is a chance that a fully vaccinated person, of any age, can catch this disease, but your symptoms will typically be much less severe."

Pertussis is caused by a type of bacterium called _Bordetella pertussis_. The bacteria attach to the cilia, the tiny hair-like extensions that line part of the upper respiratory system, and release toxins that damage the cilia and cause airways to swell. Pertussis is spread by coughing and sneezing. Infected people are most contagious up to about 2 weeks after the cough begins.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the pertussis vaccine for all babies, children, teens, and pregnant women. The 2 kinds of vaccines used today also help protect against other diseases: the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is for babies and children younger than 7 [years of age]; the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is for older children and adults.

"Since the 1st dose of DTaP vaccine begins at 2 months of age, newborns are especially at risk for pertussis, a very important reason for parents and caregivers to get vaccinated if they have not already done so," said Newburn. "About half of babies younger than one year who get the disease need care in the hospital. The younger the baby, the more likely they will need treatment in the hospital." The 5 DTaP doses are recommended at 2, 4, and 6 months; 15-18 months; and 4-6 years."

Initially, pertussis starts with cold-like symptoms, including a mild cough or fever. After one to 2 weeks, the symptoms of pertussis typically include rapid fits of cough followed by a high-pitched "whoop" sound, vomiting during or after coughing, and exhaustion after coughing fits.

"Babies may or may not cough," Newburn said. "A significant complication (along with the cough) is "apnea," or a pause in the breathing. In worst-case scenarios, the disease may cause them to stop breathing and turn blue."

"Pertussis can usually be successfully treated with a 5-day course of antibiotics," said Newburn. "A good general rule for older children is that if a cough is not getting better after 7 days, or if there are other characteristic findings consistent with pertussis, it's wise to make a doctor's appointment. With babies, don't wait to seek care."

South Dakota is seeing a lot more cases of whooping cough. One place it has shown up is at Lincoln High School, in Sioux Falls. Thursday [20 Dec 2018] the district sent a note to parents, letting them know that their child may have been exposed to the illness in the past few weeks.

A November [2018] report says the state has confirmed 120 cases. That's a 700% increase compared to the last 5 years.

A deadly disease has again reared its ugly head, and anyone thought to be suffering is urged to stay home from work or school and see their GP immediately.

New South Wales Health is urging all pregnant women and new parents to be aware of the symptoms of whooping cough and to ensure they and their children are vaccinated on time.

Despite almost 95% of infants in NSW now vaccinated against the disease, outbreaks still occur every 3-4 years as community immunity wanes, and recent high numbers indicate an outbreak may be on the way. An outbreak earlier this year [2018] on the Northern Rivers saw 21 cases within 4 weeks

Dr Vicky Sheppeard, NSW Health's Director of Communicable Diseases, said that in October 2018, almost 800 people in NSW were notified with whooping cough (pertussis), the highest number since October 2016. "Whooping cough is challenging to control at the community level, as it is a highly infectious disease, and immunity against whooping cough wanes over time, regardless of whether that immunity is from having the disease or as a result of vaccination," Dr Sheppeard said. "This means that the number of people susceptible to whooping cough in the community builds up over time, and this can cause periodic spikes or larger outbreaks of the disease. The aim of whooping cough control is to protect infants, who are at highest risk of severe disease or death if they contract whooping cough. Whooping cough vaccination is effective in preventing severe infection."

A GP can test for whooping cough and prescribe antibiotics. People suspected of whooping cough should stay home until they have completed a 5-day course of antibiotics.

Since NSW Health introduced free whooping cough vaccination for pregnant women in April 2015 to protect infants in the 1st weeks of life, there have been no infant deaths from whooping cough in NSW, compared to 4 deaths in the previous 6 years. "People in close contact with newborn infants, such as grandparents, partners, and close family members, should ensure that they have had a whooping cough vaccine in the previous 10 years," Dr Sheppeard said. "Those that need to get vaccinated should do so at least 2 weeks before any infant contact."

In May this year [2018], federal health minister Greg Hunt urged all parents-to-be to get vaccinated. His comments came in the wake of the infant who contracted the illness and died when he was just 32 days old.

Pregnant women in Tasmania are being urged to get vaccinated for whooping cough after a spike in the bacterial disease that can be deadly for newborns. There have been 170 whooping cough cases throughout the state since early August [2018], and 239 this year [2018], compared to 40 reported cases in 2017.

Cases are most prevalent in the state's north, including around Devonport, but are also increasing in the south. "Schools are reporting student and staff illness with children aged under 14 years most affected, particularly those from 5-9 years old," director of public health Mark Veitch said on Monday [26 Nov 2018].

Whooping cough vaccines are free for pregnant women, with the disease life-threatening to newborn babies. The vaccine is also free for children aged 6 months, 2 years and 4 [years].

The last Tasmania-wide whooping cough outbreak was in 2012, with more than 1200 notified cases.

An outbreak of whooping cough has forced a school on the Queensland/New South Wales border to close for the rest of the academic year.

St Mary's Catholic School in Goondiwindi has reported a number of students suffering from the highly contagious respiratory infection.

A Queensland Department of Education spokesperson says no state schools have experienced the level of infection at St Mary's, but they are monitoring the situation.
