Lumpy Skin Disease in Greece -- Update [PowerPoint presentation, 24 slides, of which the following slides have been copied]:

Slide 18: Epidemiological developments
So far (7 Sep 2015):
24 confirmed outbreaks, 17 additional suspicions awaiting confirmation, 1819 cattle destroyed; morbidity about 8.9 percent, mortality about 0.3 percent.

Slide 19: Measures in place
Surveillance and protection zones:
Boundaries to be adapted according to the epidemiological situation in the area.

NOTE: disposal of carcasses of cattle (after stamping out) by sanitary burial on the spot is becoming already problematic within the Evros Delta due to the nature of the soil (extended wetlands in the area).

Entire Evros Prefecture:
Emergency vaccination of cattle of the Evros prefecture as a supplement to control measures (together with stamping out and the other measures of Dir. 92/119/EEC).

Slide 20: Emergency Vaccination against Lumpy Skin Disease
Rationale:
1. Unfavorable epidemiological situation in the area over recent years (e.g. sheep pox in 2013-2014) with devastating effects for the local farming industry in the area (financial + social issues)
2. high costs of stamping out
3. unclear if the stamping out policy alone is sufficient to stop disease spread

Slide 21: Emergency Vaccination against Lumpy Skin Disease
a. Compulsory vaccination of all cattle within the Evros prefecture with homologous LSD vaccine (lumpy skin disease vaccine for cattle -- Onderstepoort Biological Products) followed by a 28 day standstill of vaccinated animals [see comment].

Area / Priority / Estimated vaccination time / Number of holdings / Number of animals
1. Protection zone / 1 / 1st half of Sep 2015 / 88 / 5426
2. Surveillance zone / 2 / 2nd half of Sep 2015 / 84 / 2754
3. Remainder of Evros prefecture (areas outside protection & surveillance zone) / 3 Oct 2015 / 548 / 10 932
4. Totals: 720 / 19.112

b. Establishment of special restrictions/conditions regarding movements of vaccinated cattle and products thereof (work in progress in close cooperation with the E. Commission -- to be described in a dedicated Commission Decision)

Page 22: Emergency Vaccination against Lumpy Skin Disease
Current state of play:
1. A 1st batch of about 8000 doses of LSD vaccines reached Evros on 5 Sep 2015 and vaccination of cattle began the same day.
2. Since then about 4800 cattle have been vaccinated until 7 Sep 2015 (about 100 percent of the cattle within the original surveillance and protection zones + cattle in Soufli and North Evros).
3. Provisional safeguard measures for vaccinated animals (standstill, derogation provided only for milk destined for pasteurization in dairy facilities within the Evros prefecture) pending the relevant Commission decision.
4. Work continues....

[ProMED-mail's posting 20150909.3632160 included the following RFI:

"Information on the vaccine applied in the emergency vaccination around the outbreaks which is already operational, will be appreciated."

Greece's new presentation cited above includes the requested information: the vaccine applied, manufactured in Ondestepoort, South Africa, is a freeze-dried, live attenuated virus (Neethling strain) vaccine. The producers' information and instructions are available at
http://www.obpvaccines.co.za/Cms_Data/Contents/OBPDB/Folders/Product/~contents/PZBJ3K5TLC47W3BJ/2223_LumpySkin_PI.pdf

It may be assumed that the vaccination of the susceptible cattle in Greece as a preventive measure in an EU-member country whch hitherto has been LSD-free, is being closely monitored and a follow-up applied. Information on the protection rendered and on any observed side effects is expected to become publicly available. - Mod.AS
