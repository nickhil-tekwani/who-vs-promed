[In May 2015 Ukraine reported an event of African Swine Fever (AFS) in the Kiev region. The affected population was also wild boar, and that event is considered continuing.

Beside the events reported in 2015, there were 2 other ASF events reported in 2014, in the regions of Chernigov and Sumy Oblast. To date these are all still reported as continuing. See also comments in ProMED-mail post 20150630.3471621.
