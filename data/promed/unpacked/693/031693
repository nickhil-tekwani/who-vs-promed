Most of the 67 people taken ill after eating cyanide-laced curry in western
Japan are still sick a week after the suspected attack left four dead.
Japanese police were still searching for a suspect yesterday after four
people died from eating curry laced with cyanide at the weekend. A further
60 were taken ill after eating curry from one of three pots prepared at an
outdoor summer festival in Wakayama. Yesterday, 41 people were still in
hospital.
Two of the dead were members of the local community council that organised
the event, and municipal officials think that the motive may have been
revenge. The community is very closely knit and passions sometimes run high
about apparently petty issues. One official had received threatening phone
calls accusing him of not taking action against parking infringements and
careless rubbish disposal.
