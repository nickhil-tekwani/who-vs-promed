The 1st Hendra case for NSW [New South Wales] this year [2015] has been reported on the NSW North Coast.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) confirmed Hendra virus as the cause of death of a horse near Murwillumbah on the weekend [20-21 Jun 2015].

NSW DPI Chief Veterinary Officer Ian Roth said the dead horse has been buried and the property will be placed in quarantine today [24 Jun 2015]. The 19-year-old gelding died on Saturday afternoon [20 Jun 2015] after showing typical Hendra signs, including lethargy, for 2 to 3 days prior.

"Samples from the horse were sent for laboratory analysis and results confirmed the Hendra virus," Mr Roth said.

"An additional Murwillumbah property that received a gelding which had been in contact with the sick horse will also be quarantined."

Tracing is underway to confirm movements on or off the property, while 2 other horses and 2 dogs on the infected property are being closely monitored for any warning signs of the virus.

Staff from Local Land Services are working closely with the property owners, and NSW Health have assessed a number of people who had contact with the dead horse.

The DPI confirmed the horse had not been vaccinated for Hendra virus. NSW DPI has been encouraging horse owners to see their veterinarians and work out their vaccination strategy against Hendra virus.

"Winter is the season when horses have been infected with Hendra in NSW in the past -- so now is the time to get a vaccine booster for your horse," Mr Roth said.

"Vaccination is the single most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection in horses."

Mr Roth said people in contact with horses need to practice good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures even if a horse is vaccinated against Hendra virus.

"Horses should be kept away from flowering and fruiting trees that are attractive to bats," Mr Roth said. "Do not place feed and water under trees and cover feed and water containers with a shelter so they cannot be contaminated from above.

"People should avoid touching sick horses but if they need to come into direct contact ensure they are wearing gloves and a protective mask and avoid any contact with secretions from the animal."

[This disease is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can affect people, and even dogs. This is a very serious disease. It is a mystery to me why owners do not vaccine their horses. It is the most effective protection they can get.

Some background information about Hendra virus from the ABC fact box (http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/11/2652404.htm): "Hendra virus (genus _Henipavirus_, family _Paramyxoviridae_) affects horses and humans and is potentially deadly for infected people. Hendra virus first emerged in Australia in August and September 1994, when 13 horses died in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra (hence the name), and 2 horses died in an apparently unrelated outbreak in Mackay. In Hendra, the horse Drama Series became the 1st recorded death from the virus, and 2 people became infected after contact with the mare. One of them, prominent horse trainer Vic Rail, died as a result. In October 1995, a Mackay farmer, Mark Preston, 35, became the 3rd person to be infected with the virus, and he also died as a result. It was only after Mr Preston's infection and death that authorities discovered the initial August 1994 infection of 2 of his horses and made a retrospective diagnosis.

Since 1994, there have been 15 outbreaks of the disease; 7 people have become infected, and 4 people have died.

The mortality rate for horses is extremely high, with 70 per cent of infected animals dying from the virus. Hendra virus is commonly spread by fruit bats. They are the natural carriers of the virus, and they are thought to spread the virus through their urine, faeces, or reproductive fluid. It is believed that Hendra virus is not highly contagious in people, but because all 7 cases of human infection have been in people who have close contact with infected horses, there are strict quarantine guidelines.

There is no evidence of human-to-human spread or human-to-horse spread of the disease. The incubation period in humans is estimated at 5-14 days. The virus commonly affects the respiratory system, and symptoms can often resemble influenza and pneumonia.

The virus may affect the brain as well with encephalitis type symptoms, such as headaches, high fever, and drowsiness, which can lead to convulsions or coma." - Mod.TG
