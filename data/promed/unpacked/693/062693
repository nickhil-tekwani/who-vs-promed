The bluetongue disease which was 1st discovered in farms in South Cyprus has now appeared in animals on 5 different farms in the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus].

According to information released by the Veterinary Departments Director HÃ¼seyin Ataben, precautionary measures have been taken to prevent the disease from spreading.

He said that flies [sic; see comment] are the carriers of the disease and therefore they were in contact with the Basic Health Services Department.

Ataben said that samples taken from the farms tested positive and were sent to Turkey for further confirmation.

[The above report indicates a spread of BTV-8 in the territory of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), a self-declared state that comprises the northeastern portion of the island of Cyprus. In difference from the statement about flies being the carriers, culicoides (midges) are the vectors of the bluetongue virus, assumed to have transmitted it into TRNC simultaneously or following its introduction into the Larnaca district. It will be interesting to be informed about the location(s) of the outbreaks recorded in TRNC.

Since its start in the Larnaca district on 19 Sep 2016, the BTV-8 epizootic has reportedly spread further in the said district, as apparent from 2 follow-up reports, Nos 3 and 4, submitted by Cyprus to the OIE on 5 and 6 Oct 2016. These reports are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21156 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21160, respectively.

The summarised statistics of the epizootic in the Republic of Cyprus (Larnaca), as of 6 Oct 2016, are the following:

Total outbreaks = 20 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep & goats / 4883 / 197 / 61 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 3325 / 113 / 31 / 0 / 0

It may be assumed that most, if not all, of the 310 diseased and 92 dead animals were sheep. Separate statistics for goats would help.

Cyprus has presented a PowerPoint presentation on this epizootic during the meeting in Brussels of EC's Animal Health and Welfare committee (4-5 Oct 2016). The presentation is available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20161004_pres_bluetong_cyprus.pdf.

BTV-8 is currently circulating also in Northern Israel, and plausibly also in other locations in the Eastern Mediterranean, including southern Anatolia. An inactivated vaccine against this serotype has been widely used in Europe during recent years. - Mod.AS
