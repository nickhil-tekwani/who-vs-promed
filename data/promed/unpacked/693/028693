Fatbergs [large masses of fat clumped together with other household waste] from the Caribbean are washing up on Britain's beaches just as families plan their Easter getaway. Vets are warning that dogs will die if they eat the sinister-looking white blobs -- some as big as boulders. And parents have been warned to steer sandcastle-building and rock-pooling children away from them.

The lumps of congealed palm oil have bobbed thousands of miles across the Atlantic from places like Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad. Blobs have appeared on beaches at Newquay, Cornwall, and more are feared to be heading for resorts along the south coast as traders gear up for the Easter holiday season. They can be fatal for pets. Dogs have died after eating the white or yellow waxy lumps which they love because of the distinctive smell.

TV vet Marc Abraham said owners should not let their dogs tuck in because the blobs -- covered in deadly germs -- will kill them. 'Dogs will pick up anything on the beach, from pebbles, to food to palm oil,' he said. 'These things can cause 2-fold problems: the 1st is gastro, the 2nd is foreign body obstructions. As the palm oil is so gelatinous, it can get lodged in the oesophagus and require emergency surgery. If you think your dog has swallowed something it shouldn't, contact your vet immediately.'

Penmellyn Vets, of Newquay, have gone on Facebook to warn about the discovery of the substance on Porth Beach. The same surgery issued a warning last year [2016] after staff had to give life-saving treatment to 5 dogs which collapsed in agony after scoffing the white, waxy blobs scattered on beaches at Constantine Bay and Treyarnon. 'Palm oil has been found in small pieces on Porth Beach, just to make you all aware,' they warned. 'Please share to keep owners informed. If you believe your dog to have digested some, please call the practice.'

The blobs are congealed vegetable oil derived from the pulp of the fruit of African, American, and Maripa palms.

Claire Wallerstein, of Rame Peninsula Beach Care in Cornwall, said 'It's incredibly dangerous. Dozens of dogs have died and people need to know that it's around. We want to warn people about it, we want people to be aware and careful with their dogs at the beach. They need to get their dogs to the vets as soon as possible if they think they might have eaten any of this stuff, or they could die. It's perfectly legal for ships to dump it into the sea -- hopefully at some point the law will be changed because obviously this stuff is dangerous and it shouldn't be legal.'

In February [2017], blobs washed up along the Sussex coast, including Rottingdean, Lancing, and Shoreham. Brighton and Hove City Council warned 'Anyone who spots any suspected palm oil on the beach should contact the seafront team on 01273 292716.' More bobbed ashore recently at Folkestone, Kent, and others have been found on beaches in Devon, Dorset, the Isle of Wight, and Hampshire.

A Cornwall Council spokesman said they have put up warning signs on many beaches. 'People should keep away from the substance -- if you do come into contact, wash it off using normal soap or shower gel and water and wash your clothes.' Jon James, natural environment manager for Cornwall Council, said their contractors have orders to remove the substance from council-owned beaches and 'we will be providing advice to the owners of private beaches.'

In June 2014, a 3 year old labradoodle, was rushed to a canine hospital for a series of life-saving operations after he gulped down lumps of the tropical palm oil on a walk along Kingsand beach near Saltash, Cornwall. His owner said at the time, 'My husband was walking him along the rocks in Kingsand when [the dog] ran off and started to eat this large lump of palm oil. 'It was the size of a boulder. When [the man] realised what was happening he shouted at [the dog], who ran away. 'We were absolutely panic-stricken when we realised what it was that he had eaten. We looked online and were worried that we could lose him after seeing what had happened to other dogs, so my husband rushed him to the vets straight away.' [The dog] underwent GBP 88 [USD 110] worth of vomit-inducing medicine, injections and a large dose of antibiotics before being sent home to rest, and is now in a stable condition. [The owner] said 'We were lucky. We are keeping him away from the beach for now and I would warn other people to be very, very careful if they do go to the beach. A dog died at Portwrinkle recently from the same thing, so it's not uncommon.'

A blob weighing nearly quarter of a ton and measuring several feet around was found on an Isle of Wight holiday beach in 2014. It needed 3 people with a trolley to cart it off the sands at Hamstead beach, near Newtown.

In October 2013 in Cornwall, a miniature schnauzer dog, died after eating some of the palm oil, forcing the council to post signs warning of pollution. And in February 2014, [a woman] told how she was strolling along the beach at Brighton with her Labrador cross, which fell ill after eating a lump of the oil. She had to be rushed to the vet and given life-saving injections.

A spokesman for South Hams district council near Dartmouth, Devon, said blobs had been found on 3 beaches in the Salcombe estuary.

[The photos of these in the source article above look like very large pieces of slimy fat. They seem appropriately named as fat blobs. Fat and salt (from the ocean) would be a very attractive (and unhealthy) treat to a dog.

Large blobs, as the article describes, would tend to cause choking. Also large masses of fat would cause pancreatitis. If the dog does not choke or the blob causing the choking is removed, then any left over fat making its way to the gastric system could still end up causing pancreatitis. This disease has to be carefully managed and shortens the life of our canine companions.

In addition, there could be harmful bacteria, or algae on these blobs. If they are coming from ships, there could also be lipid soluble chemicals in these fat blobs. - Mod.TG
