Bushbuckridge Quarantined for 2 Months
-----------------------------------------------
The Bushbuckridge area in the Northern Province will remain under
quarantine for the next 8 weeks while veterinarians vaccinate livestock
against foot and mouth disease (FMD). Provincial agriculture department
spokesman Thembi Makhuvhele said the first round of cattle vaccination
ended on Friday last week.
"This week we will vaccinate small livestock like sheep and goats, and
after 2 weeks we'll do a second round on the cattle," Makhuvhele said.
The small livestock would also be vaccinated twice, he said. FMD was first
detected at Orinoco farm in Bushbuckridge at the beginning of February.
According to laboratory tests the disease may have been transmitted by
buffalo escaped from the Kruger National Park.
Makhuvhele said 69 percent of more than 84 000 registered cattle in
Bushbuckridge had been vaccinated in 104 dip tanks in the region so far.
"There are even more cattle [that have not been registered," he added.
Meanwhile, Kanhym Estate near Middelburg, where the disease first broke out
in November last year, is also under quarantine until all of the more than
10 000 cattle are slaughtered. Vaccinations are being done in the Nsikazi
district, which borders Bushbuckridge, to avoid the spread of the disease
across the border.
