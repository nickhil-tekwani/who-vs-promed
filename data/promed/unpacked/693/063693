California's pertussis epidemic has escalated, state health officials said Friday [27 Jun 2014], with 4558 cases reported in 2014 as of Tuesday, 24 Jun 2014, 1100 of those in the last 2 weeks. "We are off to a really bad start in 2014," said state epidemiologist Gil Chavez, of the California Department of Public Health, during a phone call with reporters on Friday.

Chavez delivered his comments as the state health department released a new report summarizing the latest data on this year's [2014] pertussis, or whooping cough, epidemic. Of this year's cases thus far, 3614, or 84 percent, have occurred in patients 18 or younger. Out of 142 illnesses that required hospitalization, 89, or 63 percent, were in infants 4 months old or younger.

A total of 3 babies in the state have died from pertussis infections in 2014, Chavez said, though 2 of those will be attributed to 2013's case count because they initially became ill in 2013.

Because infants less than a year old are at the highest risk of hospitalization and death from pertussis, and because babies generally do not receive pertussis vaccinations until they're 8 weeks old, Chavez said that all pregnant women should receive a dose of the Tdap vaccine during their 3rd trimester.

"Vaccination of pregnant women is the most important thing that can be done to protect infants," he said, because the mothers' antibodies can get passed along to their newborns.

Based on historical patterns, Chavez said, it is likely that disease activity will remain high throughout the summer. But he said it was too soon to know if this year [2014] would be worse than 2010, the last year pertussis peaked. That year, more than 9000 Californians were sickened with the disease.

[The number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years, but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years. Utah is just one of a number of USA states including Washington and Wisconsin that have had substantial increase in the disease with, in addition, infant deaths related to cases transmitted by family members. Most up-to-date ACIP recommendations continue to increase vaccination recommendations to order to "cocoon" the susceptible infant cohort. The most recent recommendations include re-vaccination for pregnant women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester for each pregnancy (1).

In addition to the Tartof paper (2), an additional recent publication, currently in press in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilizes a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.
