15 people were poisoned with [sodium] Nitrates in Tyumen (Russia)
------------------------------------------
According to the RIA News agency, 15 people were poisoned with [sodium]
nitrate. All are citizens of Tajikistan that came to Tyumen to work in
sanatorium construction and were admitted to the regional hospital on
Monday. 3 later died and the remaining 12 are in severe condition.
The cause of the poisoning was sodium nitrate being mistaken for salt in
the kitchen; the former substance is used as fertilizer.
According to physician and toxicologist Purtov, all of the patients were
detoxicated and placed on an artificial kidney apparatus [see comment below
- Mod.TG]. The 12 survivors will stay in the hospital for a few more days
until they have completely recovered.

[The Tyumen region is located on the Tura River and is a major transfer
point for river and rail freight. - Mod.NR]
[Nitrite is used for preserving meat and has occasionally been mistaken for
salt or sugar. Undiluted, it may be used as an insecticide or as a
corrosion inhibitor for metal tanks.
Oxidation of the iron in hemoglobin from the ferrous to the ferric state
yields methemoglobin, which does not carry oxygen and imparts a brown hue
to the blood. This etiology should be suspected when a blood sample is
brown and does not redden on exposure to air.
The usual treatment for nitrite intoxication is intravenous methylene
blue. If the "artificial kidney" mentioned is simply a dialysis machine,
it would not be of any benefit. However, it would be of benefit if the
intoxication is with analine, not nitrite. - Mod.TG]
