Massachusetts and federal health officials are looking into cases of salmonellosis that have been reported in multiple states. The Massachusetts Department of Health [DPH] confirmed Thursday afternoon, [20 Nov 2014], that the agency, along with the CDC and FDA, are investigating a potential multi-state salmonella cluster.

The CDC uses the term cluster when a "larger number of people than expected appear to have the same illness in a given time period and area." Although the investigation is underway, as of Thu 20 Nov 2014, none of the cases have been tied directly to one source, according to the Massachusetts DPH. If and when a source is identified, the CDC will alert the public.

[This report from Massachusetts provides little information regarding the scope of the outbreak -- number of cases and number of states involved, whether one or multiple serotypes of _Salmonella enterica_ are implicated, and the length of time that the cases have been occurring.

ProMED-mail would appreciate more information regarding this cluster of cases of salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
