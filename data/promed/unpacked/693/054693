- Peru (Amazonas). 27 Jan 2011. The health minister Oscar Ugarte said
today that the dengue outbreak that is showing up in the Peruvian
forest and has caused 10 deaths, had originated in Brazil and is a new
variety of the virus that was not known previously in Peru. He noted
that this new strain, which has a rapid worsening (clinical) evolution
which produces the "shock type" without causing bleeding. [Although
this report does not indicate where this outbreak occurred,
ProMED-mail reported a significant dengue outbreak this month (January
2011) in Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, caused by dengue virus-2
Asian/American (genotype III), so one presumes that this is the dengue
virus serotype to which the Minister refers (see ProMED-mail archive
number 20110124.0292. - Mod.TY)

do Sul had the 1st suspected case of dengue (virus) type 4 (infection)
