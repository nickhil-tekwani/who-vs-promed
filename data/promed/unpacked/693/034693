Nipah-like virus in Bangladesh - Update
---------------------------------------
As of Thu 26 Feb 2004, WHO has received reports of 22 cases, including 17
deaths, attributed to Nipah-like virus infections (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_02_12/en/>).
Of the total cases, 11 are laboratory-confirmed.
An additional 51 cases are under investigation. The changes in the number
of cases is a result of a review of the case definition and the
surveillance data currently being undertaken by the team of experts from
WHO, partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the
Ministry of Health.
The infections have occurred in 5 districts: Rajbari, Manikganj, Jaipurhat,
Naogang, and Faridpur.
Guidelines for clinical management and hospital-based surveillance for
encephalitis are being developed. Ecological, sero-prevalence, and case
control studies are nearing completion.

[Nipah and Hendra viruses are related but distinct paramyxoviruses which
now comprise a new genus in the sub-family _Paramyxovirinae_ of the family
_Paramyxoviridae_. The genus name _Henipavirus_ has been approved by the
ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses). These viruses have
molecular characteristics that distinguish them from previously known
paramyxoviruses. It is likely that the virus associated with the outbreaks
of encephalitis in Western Bangladesh is a novel member of the genus
_Henipavirus_, in view of epidemiological characteristics that distinguish
it from the 2 established virus species in the genus. Therefore until the
precise relationship of the Bangladesh virus to Nipah virus (first isolated
in Malaysia) and Hendra virus (isolated only in Australia) has been
established, the term "henipavirus" will be used to describe the Bangladesh
virus instead of Nipah/Hendra-like. - Mod.CP]
