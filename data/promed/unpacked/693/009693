There's not a lot that's positive to report right now when it comes to ruffed grouse. Populations of the forest-dwelling bird appear to be on the decline throughout the Northeast and Midwest, according to reports from wildlife management agencies from Maryland to Michigan and all points between.

The Ruffed Grouse Society, for example, holds a "national grouse and woodcock hunt" each fall in Minnesota. This year [2019], the expectation was that grouse numbers were up, at or near the peak of a multi-year cycle.

Yet, the Society reported, the total grouse harvest was down over 2017. Worse still, the proportion of immature birds to older ones, an indication of recruitment and survival, was the lowest in 37 years.

Sightings of grouse in West Virginia, meanwhile, were pretty dismal in 2017. They were even worse going into last fall's hunting seasons, according to media interviews given by Mike Peters, a game bird biologist with the state's Division of Natural Resources. He blamed the admittedly "depressing" situation on 2 things.

The 1st is lack of habitat. Though the state is heavily wooded, too little of it is the young-forest stage grouse need.

The 2nd is disease, namely West Nile Virus.

Ongoing research by the Pennsylvania Game Commission shows a relationship between high rates of West Nile and falling grouse numbers.

Other states are looking for a similar connection. They are, at the least, already finding sick birds.

Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources confirmed that state's 1st recorded cases of West Nile in grouse earlier this winter. Tests on hunter-killed birds are ongoing. Wisconsin, which along with Minnesota and Michigan is sampling hunter-killed birds, confirmed its 1st case of the disease in the birds this winter, too. All 3 states expect to release results of further samples by this summer.

If Pennsylvania's experience is any guide, the news may not be good. Lisa Williams, the Game Commission's grouse biologist, said in January [2019] that 2018 seemed a bad one for West Nile. Preliminary monitoring suggested grouse might have handled that pretty well. That turned out to be wrong. According to the state's departments of Environmental Protection and Health, 2018 was the worst ever for the mosquito-borne disease. And grouse suffered accordingly, Williams said.

A cadre of roughly 3000 grouse hunters record flush rates each year. They reported 22% fewer statewide in 2018 than 2017, Williams said. The reported the steepest declines in the state's southern tier. But things were bad all over.

"We found West Nile on every state game land we looked at everywhere, and those were in every region of the state," Williams said. "So I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that our hunter flush rates were extremely poor this past season."

Pennsylvania isn't alone. Williams said there have been "steep and region-wide declines" in grouse populations from West Virginia and Virginia to Maryland, Kentucky and North Carolina. Despite all that, there's hope the birds will hang on and even recover.

"You see that when the birds get a break from the weather, they are still a highly productive species and they can come roaring back. So there's our silver lining," she said.

But creating habitat will be key, she said. It's only where the birds have lots of it that they can withstand disease. Grouse biologists from across the country at a national summit identified creating habitat in "priority" or "focus" areas -- places that still have decent numbers of birds -- as the most important goal to tackle, Williams said. That was in 2016. Work to implement it is ramping up.

In Pennsylvania, the Game Commission collected information from hunters over the past 6 years, documenting where they shot grouse. It can pinpoint that down to the township level, Williams said. The commission also has data from Christmas bird counts and similar efforts. It shows the location of birds that perhaps aren't being hunted. The commission is using that information to decide where to focus habitat efforts. It's sharing the data with the state's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and nongovernment landowners so they can do the same on their lands.

Other states are a bit further behind but expected to start doing the same soon, Williams said. "We need to support those strongest populations during this time of change," she said.

The commission will examine whether further shortening grouse hunting seasons is necessary.

The agency eliminated the post-Christmas hunt on an emergency basis in 2017-18. It kept it closed in 2018-19 and is closing it for 2019-20, too. That protects the grouse breeding population, largely made up of older, more productive birds, Williams said. "The question now is, if this continues to get worse, do we need to consider other options besides just the length of the late season?" she said.

Some hunters already are lobbying for additional season closures, she said. She would prefer to give the model used for setting seasons more time to work, she said. She is, though, examining it to see if additional triggers need to be added.

There's a lot to look at in the coming year, she said. Commission staff is doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work for grouse already, and more is coming.

Hunters need to stay tuned. "We're not just going to stand pat and wait to see what happens next year," Williams said.

[After the introduction of WNV into the Americas, the population-level impact of this new virus on native bird population remains largely unknown, but some studies have shown large-scale declines of some North American bird populations. An investigation in the endangered greater sage-grouse (_Centrocercus urophasianus_) found unexpected impacts of WNV on radio‐marked birds, reducing late‐summer survival an average of 25% in 4 radio‐marked populations in the western US and Canada (see https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00631.x).

The ruffed grouse (_Bonasa umbellus_) is a medium-sized grouse inhabiting forests from the Appalachian Mountains across Canada to Alaska. This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable (red list category) under the range size criterion. However, the current population numbers reported is reason for concern.
