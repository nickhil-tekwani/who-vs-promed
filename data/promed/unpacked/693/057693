Ornithologists warn of further cases after finding 23 dead green finches within a week in a home garden in Moosthenning [municipality in the district of Dingolfing-Landau, Lower Bavaria].

All birds had the same conspicuous signs: ruffled feathers, weakness, stupor, difficulty swallowing, mucus discharge from the beak.

A mass die-off of greenfinches in northern Germany was documented in 2009.

The pathogen _Trichomonas gallinae_ is suspected, but there is only weak evidence so far. There were also secondary bacterial infections with _Streptococcus suis_ in more severe cases.

[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (Columbiformes), which principally infects the upper alimentary tract where it can cause necrotic ingluvitis. Epidemic mortality in columbiform species has been previously reported, and the parasite infrequently infects other avian taxa such as birds of prey and songbirds. Trichomoniasis has been postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the passenger pigeon _Ectopistes migratorius_ and has been shown to be a significant cause of nestling mortality in the island-endemic pink pigeon _Nesoenas mayeri_ and in the Iberian Peninsula population of the Bonelli's eagle _Hieraaetus fasciatus_.
