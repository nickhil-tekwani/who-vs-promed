Two more Indonesian people were admitted as suspects of being
infected with bird flu virus on Thursday [11 Jan 2007] to Jakarta's
Friendship Hospital, local leading news website detik.com reported.
The 2 patients are husband and child of a 37 years old woman who had
been identified positively infected to bird flu virus on 9 Jan 2007.
Their admission has brought the bird flu suspected patients in the
hospital to 12. But 5 of them were allowed to leave later by the
hospital after days of observation. On Wednesday [10 Jan2007], a
14-year-old boy died from bird flu at this hospital after 4 days
treatment, bringing the death toll from the virus to 58 since the
virus attack was confirmed in 2003.

Two family members of a woman infected with bird flu in Indonesia
were hospitalized with symptoms of the virus, said a doctor treating
the patients. The 37-year-old woman, who tested positive for the H5N1
strain of avian influenza 2 days ago, remains in critical condition
at Persahabatan Hospital in Jakarta, Mukhtar Ikhsan, a doctor at the
hospital, said today. Her 42-year-old husband and their 18-year-old
son have symptoms of fever and respiratory infection, and are being
tested for H5N1.
Infections in birds and people are increasing in Asia, where the
virus was first identified a decade ago. South Korea reported its 1st
avian outbreaks since March 2004 last month, and today reported an
infected person who showed no symptoms. Disease trackers are looking
for signs that H5N1 is changing to become more adept at infecting
humans, which could start a pandemic.
"People were beginning to tell us that we were crying wolf and that
this virus had gone away and there was no problem," Peter Cordingley,
a Manila-based spokesman for the World Health Organization, said in
an interview. "Our message has stayed the same, which is that just
because it's not in the headlines, it doesn't mean it's not in the
environment."
The H5N1 strain is known to have infected 264 people in 10 countries
since 2003, killing 157 of them, the Geneva-based WHO said yesterday.
Indonesia has reported 58 fatalities, more than any other country.
Vie Nam, which reported that the virus killed 30 chickens in Vinh
Long province, hasn't had any human cases since 2005. South Korea
hasn't had any cases confirmed by WHO.
Health officials monitor suspected clusters of cases closely because
they may signal the virus is becoming more adept at infecting humans,
not just birds. "They're showing symptoms similar to bird flu and we
must remain vigilant," Ikhsan, the Indonesian doctor, said in a
telephone interview. Tests for H5N1 are also being run on 2 other
people receiving treatment at the hospital, he said.
The Southeast Asian nation attracted international attention in May
[2006] when 7 members of a family from the island of Sumatra
contracted the H5N1 virus, 6 of them fatally. The cases represented
the largest reported cluster of infections and the 1st
laboratory-proven instance of human-to-human transmission. The latest
confirmed case in Indonesia may have been caused by contact with a
sick bird. The woman slaughtered a chicken she bought from a local
market, I Nyoman Kandun, the ministry's director general of disease
control and environment, said on 9 Jan 2007. The woman, from
Tangerang in Banten province on the western part of the island of
Java, developed symptoms on 1 Jan[2007] and was hospitalized on 6 Jan [2007].

[The suspected cluster of patients are 3 closely related family
members and likely to have been exposed to the same risk of infection
from avian influenza virus in their environment and also likely to
have a similar genetic susceptibility to virus infection. Adaptation
of the infecting virus to person-to-person transmission should not be
assumed. - Mod.CP]
