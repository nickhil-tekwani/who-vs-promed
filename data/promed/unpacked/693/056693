Since yellow fever was eradicated in Cameroon, a single confirmed case is a
source of concern.
A 19 year old young man, a secondary school student staying in Zoetele,
died 2 days after his admission to the hospital of Akonolinga, last
September [2007]. Because the doctors suspected yellow fever, specimens
were taken and analyzed in the Pasteur Center of Yaounde. After
confirmation of the results by the Pasteur Center of Dakar in Senegal, an
alert was issued. Between 2003 and 2007, 9 cases of yellow fever were
recorded in [the] country.
In the most serious cases, yellow fever is fatal in 20 to 50 per cent of
the cases. As for many viruses, there is no specific treatment. But it is
possible to prevent yellow fever by administering a vaccine (antiamaril),
which makes it possible to obtain an immunity of 100 per cent, valid for at
least 10 years, 10 days after its administration. There is no natural
immunity and children are particularly vulnerable. The vaccine was
introduced into the expanded programme of vaccination in Cameroon in 2004
for one year old children, who will be thus protected up to 11 years.
In the event of epidemic risk, the vaccination of the population thus
remains an effective measure, which can be supplemented by massive
insecticide fumigation, when the density of adult mosquitoes is high. But
according to Dr Emmanuel Nomo, permanent secretary of the expanded program
of vaccination, it will be necessary to wait one month before starting this
new response campaign. "We must again gather the funds which are needed for
the launching of the operation," he explained.

[One hopes that this is a single, isolated case of yellow fever (YF).
ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving reports of any additional YF cases
that occur in this area.
