Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 722 / 368 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: beef cattle of all ages under extensive production system

Outbreak 2: kayalami dip tank, Rutenga, Mwenezi, Masvingo
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Apr 2014

Outbreak 3: Fauna ranch, Rutenga, Mwenezi, Masvingo
Date of start of the outbreak: 25 Apr 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 672 / 105 / 7 / 0 / 0
Affected population: beef cattle of all ages under extensive production system with mortalities in calves.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 3
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 3140 / 623 / 7 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 19.84 / 0.22 / 1.12 / 0.22
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with infected animal(s) at grazing watering; contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: all 3 outbreaks occurred in adjoining farms close to a wildlife conservancy with wild buffaloes. There was evidence of fence breakages on the conservancy perimeter fence, which may have resulted in mixing of cattle and buffaloes. Infection is likely to have spread from Alko ranch to Fauna and Kayalami through cattle to cattle contact.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; quarantine; movement control inside the country; zoning; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Cattle / antibody detection ELISA / 6 May 2014 / Positive
Zimbabwe Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 1 May 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[During 2013, Zimbabwe submitted immediate and follow-up reports to the OIE regarding 2 foot and mouth disease (FMD) events. In those cases, FMD serotypes SAT-2 and SAT-3 were identified.

Where SAT-2 was identified, 8 outbreaks were reported, 6 of which were located in the Masvingo region. The source of infection was also determined to be contact with wild species and illegal movement of animals. The complete report and map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014210_20140113_141425.pdf.

For the event where SAT-3 was identified, the source of infection was due to the illegal movement of animals. See complete report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014209_20140113_141108.pdf.

During 2012, Zimbabwe reported 15 outbreaks of FMD serotype SAT-2. According to these reports 238 935 bovines were vaccinated as a response to the outbreak. This information is available in the annual report sent to the OIE in 2012; see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2012&semester=0&wild=0&country=ZWE&this_country_code=ZWE&detailed=1.

Although many species of cloven-hoofed wildlife may become infected, African buffalo (_Syncerus caffer_) are the only wildlife species which plays a significant role in the epidemiology of FMD. Spillover of infection into livestock occurs periodically.
