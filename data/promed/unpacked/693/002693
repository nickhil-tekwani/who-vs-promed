Delaware Bay oysters face new threat, high mortality found among larvae
-----------------------------------------------
Decimated by disease in the 1990s and still recovering, Delaware Bay oyster
beds are facing yet another scourge, a mysteriously high mortality rate
among larvae, a trend that threatens a fishery that has been producing the
plump, salty delicacies for more than 200 years.
A new report by Rutgers University marine scientists says that for the 5th
consecutive year, oyster spat -- or larvae -- aren't taking hold and
growing on the bay bottom in numbers large enough to replace the number of
oysters lost to harvest, predators and disease.
Scientists say the problem could force the closing of oyster beds if not
corrected. Even some of those who stand to lose by a halt in commercial
oystering think that may be necessary. "Every year, everyone's just
pounding and pounding on it and it's taken a toll," said oysterman Todd
Reeves. "What they're doing now isn't working. The bay needs to be closed.
It needs a break." Others who make their living on the water are hoping
nature's course -- together with a little help from man -- can save the
fishery.
In the 19th century, the bay's bounty of eastern oysters (_Crassostrea
virginica_) sustained an industry that saw hundreds of boats and some 5000
workers either plying the waters off the southwestern New Jersey coast or
working in related jobs onshore. The annual harvest ran into the millions
of bushels. Railcars loaded with oysters moved out of towns named Bivalve
and Shellpile destined for restaurants and wholesalers all over the East.
The outbreak of a parasitic disease known as MSX [Multinucleated Sphere X
(unknown), caused by single-celled protozoan parasites] began killing
oysters in 1957. Within 3 years, the annual harvest plunged from 711 000
bushels to 49 000. From there, the industry declined steadily, turning
fishing villages into ghost towns.
In 1986, a 2nd outbreak of MSX affected the oyster beds. 5 years later, a
more damaging parasite called _Perkinsus marinus_, or Dermo, wiped out the
entire harvest. Since then, state regulators have put sharp limits on how
many oysters can be caught.
Last year's [2004] harvest was 68 000 bushels; this year's will be less
than half of that, 26 000 bushels, the lowest limit since the state began
managing stocks.
Last month [March 2005], Rutgers scientists finished work on a study that
confirmed a problem even more dire than disease. Too many oysters were
dying young. "The big problem is that oyster recruitment -- the number of
baby oysters being added to the population every year -- has been at
extremely low levels for 5 consecutive years," said fisheries biologist
Eric Powell.
"We have no idea what the problem is. It is not over-fishing. It's not
directly related to the diseases that are in the bay, as far as we can
determine, although the diseases have reduced abundance," Powell said.
When oysters spawn, they drop eggs into the water that develop into
swimming larvae that linger in the water for up to 3 weeks, consuming
phytoplankton until they grow big enough to sink to the bottom. There, the
babies, or spat, attach to rocks, pilings or shells, taking up to 3 years
to grow to maturity. But fewer spat have managed to set on the bay bottom
since 2000. Researchers don't know whether the adults are producing fewer
larvae or the larvae aren't getting enough to eat.
