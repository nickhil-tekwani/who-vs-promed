Rabies returns, kills one
-------------------------
After 4 months with no reported cases, rabies, which has gripped the
resort island [of Bali] in an epidemic since 2008, struck again this
week, killing a teenager in Gianyar regency. This death brings the
total death toll since 2008 to 137, and this year's death toll to 23.
The victim was an 18-year-old resident of Badung village in Payangan
subdistrict.

Physicians at Sanglah Central Hospital pronounced him dead Sunday
evening [11 Dec 2011], only a few hours after he had arrived at the
island's number-one referral facility for rabies. His family stated
that the boy had been bitten on his left arm by a stray dog 6 months
ago. "Unfortunately, he did not have a rabies vaccine [VAR] after the
incident," Sanglah spokesperson Kadek Nariyantha said. He disclosed
that the victim had already been in a very severe condition when he
was admitted to Sanglah Hospital. "He passed away after a brief
treatment," he added.

The victim showed symptoms associated with advanced stage rabies,
including hydrophobia, high fever, seizures and excessive salivation.
"We are still waiting for the laboratory results of samples taken from
the victim," he said, adding that the body of the boy had been
returned to his family.

Nariyantha said that he wished to remind the public that Sanglah
[Central hospital] still has an adequate stock of VAR and that anyone
who had been bitten by a dog should be vaccinated as soon as possible.
"Everyday we receive individuals who want the VAR inoculation. The
number of people seeking VAR, however, is far less than last year," he
said.

So far this year, 28 people have been treated for rabies at Sanglah.
Provincial health agency data shows that this year, 23 people,
including the teenager from Badung have died from rabies. The disease
killed 4 people in 2008, 28 in 2009 and 82 in 2010.

Bali Animal Husbandry Agency senior official I Wayan Mardiana said
that the agency had received reports about dogs biting humans in
Payangan. Yet, none of them mentioned that the involved dogs had been
tested positive for rabies. "We have sent a team to that region to
search for dogs with rabies symptoms," he said.

[Merritt Clifton has commented that: "According to the Jakarta Post
article above, Provincial health agency data shows that this year 23
people, including the Badung teenager, have died from rabies. The
disease killed 4 people in 2008, 28 in 2009 and 82 in 2010. These
numbers vary slightly from previously published totals of 4 in 2008,
25 in 2009, 86 in 2010, and 18 as of the most recent previously
reported death this year on 16 Sep 2011. As I noted then, there have
also been several dozen suspected but unconfirmed cases, involving
people who died at home in the hills, instead of in hospitals, so that
altogether, the death toll from the Bali rabies outbreak is probably
upward of 150, and maybe upward of 160, but we'll never know for sure
about the unconfirmed cases."

Whatever the precise number of deaths, it seems likely that the number
of human rabies cases and deaths this is now beginning to decline as a
consequence of better organised attempts to control canine rabies in
the island.
