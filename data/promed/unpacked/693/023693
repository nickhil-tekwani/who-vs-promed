A New York man was found guilty on Thu [27 Aug 2015] of trying to buy the deadly toxin ricin on a secretive black market website, with plans to sell it in the form of "simple and easy death pills."

A Manhattan federal jury convicted Cheng Le, 22, of 3 counts, including attempting to possess a biological toxin for use as a weapon. Prosecutors said Le tried to buy ricin from an undercover FBI employee posing as a vendor on a website called Evolution. Le faces up to life in prison. His lawyer, Patrick Brackley, said Le planned to appeal. He had argued no proof existed Le was the website user who sought the ricin [but see below].

Law enforcement has been cracking down on illegal activity involving online black markets operating on a hidden network of websites that can only be accessed using specialized browsers.

The 4-day trial spotlighted how law enforcement has become increasingly concerned about how these marketplaces could facilitate sales of not just drugs, a focus in past cases, but of items posing threats to national security.

The marketplaces included Evolution, which became the largest after the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2013 seizure of Silk Road, where drugs and other items could be bought with the digital currency bitcoin.

Evolution, unlike Silk Road, carried not just drugs but also toxins and weapons. It abruptly closed in March 2015, but similar websites remain.

Prosecutors said that in December 2014, Le, going by "WhenInDoubt," contacted an Evolution vendor called "Dark_Mart" about buying ricin. In messages to the vendor, who was actually an FBI employee, Le discussed plans to sell the ricin as "simple and easy death pills" to customers for their own use.

Prosecutors said Le discussed wanting the ricin pills included in a bottle with ordinary vitamins, saying "as the target takes the medicine every day, sooner or later, he'd ingest that poisonous pill and die."

Le wrote, "After all, it is death itself we're selling here, and the more risk-free, the more efficient we can make it, the better," according to prosecutors.

The FBI that month shipped fake ricin to Le, who, wearing latex gloves, retrieved the shipment and took its contents to his apartment, prosecutors said.

Le was arrested at his apartment, where authorities found the fake ricin, castor oil bean seeds (the source of ricin), and Le's computer, which was logged onto the website.

The case is U.S. v. Le, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00038.

[There is no law against having castor bean plants. They are beautiful, hearty plants. However, if a pet ingests a seed, and cracks it, the pet faces a potentially lethal outcome, especially without immediate emergency care.

It should be noted that castor *oil* has no ricin in it.

"Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent [and laxative. - Mod.JW]. The aqueous phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5-10 percent ricin. Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need, hence, it is often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 C [176 F].

Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.

Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours.

Inhalation: within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid is building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care.

Ingestion: if someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die.

Skin and eye exposure: ricin is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes.

Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received.

In suspected situations where ricin may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities may detect ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of ricin poisoning.

No widely available, reliable medical test exists to confirm that a person has been exposed to ricin.

Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding ricin exposure in the 1st place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible.

Symptomatic ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizures and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated."
