In 2013, 58 cases of measles occurred in New York City among residents of 2 Orthodox Jewish Communities, according to a presentation at the 2014 Pediatric Academic Societies Annual Meeting. "This was the largest single outbreak of measles in the United States since 1996 and the largest number of cases we've had in New York City since 1992," Jennifer B. Rosen, MD, of epidemiology and surveillance, Bureau of Immunization, at New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said during the presentation. However, this outbreak was surpassed during the 1st 4 months of this year [2014], with 129 documented measles cases.

The 2013 outbreak began with a 17-year-old male who had been studying in London and returned to Borough Park, Brooklyn, in March 2013 while still infectious. The patient was part of a large extended family of people who had refused vaccination, which allowed measles to spread to several family members and subsequently 28 neighbors in the community as well as members of Williamsburg, a neighboring Orthodox Jewish Community.

The 1st measles case in Williamsburg occurred in April 2013 in a relative of one of the Borough Park measles cases. Measles eventually spread to 30 people throughout this community with the last case reported in June 2013. "None of the cases in this outbreak had documentation of having been vaccinated at the time that they were presumed to have been exposed to measles," Rosen said. "In Borough Park, where the outbreak 1st occurred, 18 percent of the cases were less than one year of age, so too young to have been vaccinated." 79 percent of the patients with measles in Borough Park were aged 12 months or older, and most were part of 3 large extended families who had refused vaccination.

Once measles spread to Williamsburg, 23 percent of the cases were among children aged younger than one year, and 30 percent were aged 12 months and older, whose families refused vaccine; however, 27 percent of cases were from families who delayed vaccination. "We saw a really interesting change in the age distribution from the start to the end of the outbreak," Rosen said. "In March [2013], the median age of cases was 17 years, and that's consistent with the population that had been refusing vaccination, but by the end of the outbreak, the median age went to 17 months. This was consistent with a shift toward babies who were too young to be vaccinated and parents who delayed but didn't refuse vaccination."

Half of the cases acquired measles infection from a relative and other sources, including residents in the same building, through a friend or a playmate, or nosocomial transmission in the health care setting. 31 percent of the cases never actually presented for medical care and were only identified through interviews of secondary cases. Also, 9 percent of cases saw a health care provider but were not reported to the health department at the time the measles diagnosis was 1st considered. "Over 3500 exposed contacts were identified during this outbreak," Rosen said.

The health department recommended home isolation or post-exposure prophylaxis for exposed contacts that were susceptible to measles. Recall letters were sent to families of children who were not up-to-date with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR; M-M-R II, Merck) in the affected communities, and rapid distribution of vaccines was provided to health care providers. The health department also recommended that pregnant women have their immune globulin G titers checked and that pregnant women should be vaccinated with MMR post-partum if needed.

"Even though this is not a standard recommendation, we did this during the outbreak because of both the shift toward the younger age of cases being affected and because in this community, women are frequently pregnant," Rosen said. "There were very large household sizes." Although these were religious communities, which typically have lower rates of school-mandated immunizations, the health department found that 95 percent of students in the religious schools were up-to-date with immunisations. During the outbreak, the health department recommended that MMR vaccine be given to infants aged 6 to 11 months. However, the dose was not counted as valid and needed to be repeated at age one year. A 2nd dose of MMR was also recommended to be given earlier than aged 4 years as long as 28 days had passed since the 1st dose.

"The outbreak really began as a result of a small number of families who had declined vaccination that later spread to infants who were too young to be vaccinated and children whose vaccinations were delayed," Rosen said. "However, high population MMR coverage really limited spread both within and beyond the community. While 58 cases is a low number of cases of measles in the post-elimination era, had vaccination coverage not been so high, we would have expected to see thousands of cases, similar to what was seen before the vaccine was introduced."

An outbreak of measles in Ohio has infected 68 people, adding to what is already an 18-year high of measles cases in the United States. That's disturbing news for health professionals, who considered the contagious infectious disease eliminated in the United States in 2000.

The outbreak in Ohio began with a group from Christian Aid Ministries, who went on a mission trip to the Philippines earlier this year [2014], health officials say. Philippines is experiencing a very large measles outbreak; at least 20 000 confirmed and suspected cases have been reported in the Asian nation. Four people who were on the mission trip became infected, according to Pam Palm, the public information officer for the Knox County Health Department, and the disease has since spread to 62 others in the Amish community. Knox County has 40 cases.

Palm said the 1st few cases were initially misdiagnosed as dengue fever, a testament to how few cases of measles doctors usually see. "Because of the success of the measles vaccine, many clinicians have never seen measles and may not be able to recognize its features," Dr. Julia Sammons wrote in a commentary published in April 2014 in Annals of Internal Medicine.

Ohio health officials have immunized nearly 800 people with the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine since the outbreak began. "The Amish who are family members and acquaintances of those who now have measles have been extremely cooperative in a willingness to get vaccinated," Jackie Fletcher, director of nursing for the Knox County Health Department, said in a statement. "And those who currently have measles have been staying home."

California, another state reporting a high number of measles cases this year [2014], said its outbreak also resulted from people visiting the Philippines.

Visitors may pick up the disease and bring it back to the United States, potentially infecting those who cannot be vaccinated against measles because they are too young, for example, or who have intentionally remained unvaccinated.

Data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 24 Apr 2014 found 129 cases of measles in the United States between 1 Jan to 18 Apr 2014. That's the highest number of cases recorded for the period since 1996. Some of the Ohio cases were recorded after that reporting period, meaning the total now is undoubtedly higher. Fletcher said many of the measles patients her staff are seeing are "really sick." Symptoms usually include fever, cough and conjunctivitis, along with a rash. In rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal. "Although most of us don't realize it because it is so rare in our country, measles is a serious disease," CDC director Tom Friedenwrote on CNN in 2013. "Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 of 10 people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected."

Clay County says an unvaccinated baby contracted the virus while overseas and has been treated and released at a Kansas City hospital.

Household members of the infant's family have begun receiving the appropriate vaccinations. The infant does not attend any daycare setting. The investigation is ongoing.

Immunization is a personal choice that could mean the difference between life and death for a child. Stephanie Kates admits she struggled with that decision. "I was very unsure about whether we were going to vaccinate or not. The things you hear about autism, side effects and all of that," she said.

A small but growing number of parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children because of similar concerns. Dr. Philip Abraham, a pediatrician with University of Kansas Hospital, says those claims were already proved false. "We are seeing parents misinformed of the truth of vaccinations," Abraham said. Abraham says vaccines have helped eliminate diseases. Measles, he says, is now 99 percent eradicated in the United States. "Speaking from studies that are validated, I have no reason to believe that any of the vaccines are not effective. They are completely effective," Abraham said. Kates came to the same conclusion. "Having done my research, I believe it is right to get vaccinated," she said. Measles kills an estimated 164 000 people each year around the world.

The U.S. is having more reported cases of measles this year [2014] than usual. Most of these cases are associated with international travel. This year, 187 cases have already been reported in 17 states in the U.S., including Missouri. Although highly contagious, it is still fortunately rare in the United States. While most residents in the U.S. have been protected through vaccination, it's important for everyone to know their vaccination status and be aware of the signs and symptoms, which typically begin one to 2 weeks after someone is exposed to an infected person. "We are reminded once again about the importance of making sure both adults and children are properly vaccinated. Please make sure your vaccinations are up to date to protect yourself and help prevent the spread of disease, especially among those in our community who are most vulnerable," urged Gary E. Zaborac, director of Public Health for Clay County.

A case of the measles was reported to the Boston Public Health Commission on Wednesday [14 May 2014]. The commission's Infectious Disease Department has been working with officials at Massachusetts General Hospital, the hospital that reported the case, to prevent the disease from spreading and follow up with anyone who may have come in contact with the infected patient, officials say.

The case was reported on 5 May 2014. No secondary cases have been reported.

We spoke with Shanna Shearon, the Regional Epidemiologist at Jackson-Madison County Regional Health Department on Monday [12 May 2014] shortly after learning about the [measles] cases. Some of her answers to questions about these measles cases are below.

"We are investigating 2 possible measles cases in Madison County. Contacts have been made. All procedures have been followed. Everything has been done with those possible cases and their contacts. Everyone has been prophylaxed. That's what we need to do right now. We are kind of waiting and trying to educate as we can."

"People who are exposed to positive measles cases can actually get post-exposure prophylaxis, which is the MMR shot up to 72 hours after being exposed. Most people who are immunized are supposed to get 2 doses, which is what gives you immunity."

"It's always a good thing to be immunized against these preventable diseases that we are seeing a rise in. You can talk to a physician or contact the health department about setting up an MMR. You can get exposed by someone who is infectious with the measles. It's highly contagious, so you have to be careful with that."

"Measles begins with a fever, fatigue and a cough. You will have a rash a few days after the symptoms start. A lot of times, these diseases come back, especially with international travel, and then the people who are not immune to the disease [can catch it]."

http://www.myfoxal.com/story/25541894/health-officials-urge-vaccinations-after-measles-cases-triple


Health officials are concerned after the number of U.S. measles cases has tripled. The CDC reports measles in 17 states, including a case in Mobile County. Most cases are coming from people who have visited other countries where it's still common, catching the disease and bringing it back to the US.

"Measles is a serious, at times, deadly disease," Dr. Stephen Russell said. Russell works at UAB Health Center in Moody. He says the cases are growing at an alarming rate. The symptoms are not easy to deal with. "People would be presented with a fever, with a rash, very uncomfortable," Russell said. He says what's scary is how easily the disease spreads. "Droplets that contain measles can stay in the air for up to 2 hours after a patient leaves that room. Meaning anyone who comes in contact within that airspace of someone infected can be affected," Russell said.

He says in the last 5 years, there have been more cases of it in the U.S. According to the Alabama Department of Public Health, historically there have been 60 reported cases of measles in the U.S. each year. In 2013, that number more than tripled to 189 cases. And so far in 2014, there have been 187 cases reported nationally. Russell says parents need to make sure their children are protected because kids under 5 are among those most susceptible. "All children one year of age or greater should be getting their 1st vaccination. For all children going into kindergarten, they should have had their 2nd vaccination," Russell said.

While adults who haven't been vaccinated are urged to get it, especially traveling overseas, Dr. Karen Landers with the State Department of Health says some people may not need the vaccine. "Historically people born prior to 1957 should have natural immunity. 90-plus percent of people developed the disease prior to time of vaccination. The vaccination came in the mid to late 1960's. So, many people should have been vaccinated during that time," Landers said.

Adults over 65 and pregnant women are susceptible to the disease as well. If you're an adult and you don't know whether you've had the vaccine, your doctor can run a blood test to determine whether you have been vaccinated.

After a brief lull in reported cases, Edmonton health officials are dealing with another case of measles. Alberta Health Services (AHS) said in a release the latest case doesn't involve someone who was travelling overseas. In this case, the infected individual was also in many public spaces over the past week.

- AHS is warning people who were in the following locations to be on the lookout for symptoms.
- Red Rooster Convenience Store - 87 Avenue and 180 Street, Edmonton 6 May 2014 - 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
- Royal Bank Meadowlark - 157 Street and 87 Avenue, Edmonton 9 May 2014 - 4:30 p.m. to 6:45 p.m.

[9] Italy (Mediterranean cruise)
Date: Thu 15 May 2014
Source: Eurosurveillance, Volume 19, Issue 19 [extracted, edited]
http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20800


The Italian Ministry of Health has to date identified 29 confirmed cases of measles that occurred between 20 Feb and 10 Mar 2014 on the cruise ship in question. Of them, 23 were crew members, and 6 were Italian passengers (data for non-Italian passengers are not available). These include 3 cases in addition to those reported before, one passenger with disease onset on 27 Feb 2014 and 2 crew members with onset on 1 and 10 Mar 2014.

Seven of the 29 confirmed cases developed symptoms at home after returning from the cruise. These cases included a young child (passenger) from Lazio, a young child (passenger) from Umbria, an adult passenger from Sardinia who needed admission to an intensive care unit, 2 cases from Lecce (an adult passenger and a crew member), an adult passenger from Bari, and the teenage passenger from Brindisi reported by Cozza et al [1].

The temporal distribution of symptom onset suggests that most cases may have been exposed to the same source of infection between 8 and 13 Feb 2014. In fact, 28 of the 29 cases clustered between 20 Feb and 1 Mar 2014; this time frame is shorter than the maximum of 14 days expected after a simultaneous exposure, the minimum and maximum expected incubation time for measles being 7 and 21 days, respectively [4,5]. The hypothesis of a unique source of infection is also supported by the results of molecular investigation which identified a single molecular variant in all infected patients who underwent phylogenetic analysis.

As we could not find any obvious common exposure on board, it is likely that 28 subjects may have been infected ashore while visiting one of the places where the ship stopped, i.e. Savona on 8 Feb 2014, Marseille on 9 Feb 2014, Barcelona on 10 Feb 2014, Palma 11 Feb 2014, or Civitavecchia on 13 Feb 2014; on 12 Feb 2014, the ship was at sea. In contrast, the case that occurred on 10 Mar 2014 is likely to have been infected on board. Molecular characterisation of the viral strains circulating in these locations within the 1st half of February 2014 will further clarify this point.

Cozza et al. raised another interesting issue with relevant public health implications: the contact tracing investigation pointed out that 12 of all 32 potential measles cases from Puglia were associated with exposure to measles within an emergency department [1]. Media news reports that the Department of Health in Spain is investigating a large, still ongoing, measles outbreak in Catalonia, with about 102 cases in the 1st 3 months of 2014 [3].

It is noteworthy that about 24 percent of all reported cases in Catalonia occurred among healthcare workers [3]. Healthcare settings may play an important role both in spreading and in controlling respiratory infections. In particular, emergency departments may represent a significant site of transmission for respiratory pathogens due to close contact between cases and susceptible subjects, both patients and healthcare workers [6]. The experience from Puglia and the information provided by the Spanish Department of Health suggest that there is still a need to implement better procedures for infection control in emergency departments in Europe.

The Katsina State Government on Monday [12 May 2014] confirmed the death of 9 children following the outbreak of measles in some areas of the state. The state Commissioner for Health, Alhaji Hussani Yammama, told newsmen in Katsina that the outbreak had affected all the 34 local government areas in the state with 1260 children so far infected.

The commissioner said that the refusal of parents to take their children to the healthcare centres for routine immunisation had caused it. He, however, said the government had already taken measures to curb the spread of the disease. According to him, the measures include procurement of enough vaccines and other medications for the treatment of infected children. He, therefore, urged parents to present children for routine immunisation against the 6 child killer diseases.

The commissioner also urged them to report cases of disease outbreak to the nearest healthcare facility for urgent medical attention.

The Sindh High Court on Tuesday [13 May 2014], taking notice of the reported deaths of 48 children in the provinces of Thatta and Sujawal due to a mysterious disease, sought answers from the provincial government, its health department, and other concerned parties before 14 May 2014, according to a Dawn report.

A citizen had written to the court asking it to take notice of hundreds of children affected by a disease known as rubella [rubeoa?] in Thatta and Sujawal areas of Sindh. He also requested vaccinations against the disease to contain it, warning that failure to do so would enable the disease to spread across the country.

Chief Justice of Pakistan Tassaduq Hussain Jillani had earlier, on 7 Mar 2014, taken suo motu [see [11] above] notice over the deaths of children due to famine and outbreak of epidemics in Tharparkar district, one of the drought-hit parts of Sindh.

City health workers have conducted a massive vaccination drive here against measles as cases continue to rise, officials said.

Annette Villaces, city information officer, said that 160 persons, mostly children, have been afflicted by the viral disease from 1 Jan to 13 May this year [2014]. City health officials declared a measles outbreak on 3 May 2014.

The massive vaccination drive is continuing in the different villages [districts] in the city to combat the disease, targeting children 6 months to 4 years old. Dr. Romulo Ybiernas, chief epidemiologist of the Surigao City Health Office, said the vaccination drive includes mostly the villages of Taft, Washington and San Juan, where most of the victims reside.

The Department of Health in Region 13 (Caraga Region) has dispatched personnel from the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit to help combat the disease, Villaces said.

International SOS, a medical and travel security risk services company, is advising travellers to Southeast Asia to get vaccinated against measles as cases in the region increase. According to the World Health Organization, over 3700 cases, including at least 65 deaths, have been reported across the Philippines since the beginning of the year [2014], and 3000 confirmed cases and more than 100 deaths were recorded in Viet Nam during the same period. Singapore's Ministry of Health issued a health advisory on measles last month [April 2014] stating there has been a significant rise in measles as well.

In the light of the outbreak of the virus in the region, International SOS is advising travellers to:
- Get vaccinated against measles regardless of destination, unless one has had it before or an adequate series of measles vaccinations.
- Check vaccination records. Measles vaccines require 2 doses, usually given once to a young child and again before entering school.
- Speak to a doctor if unsure about one's immunity.

David Teo, regional medical director at International SOS, said: "Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause serious complications and fatalities in children. Measles is effectively prevented by vaccination. The virus spreads via the airborne route, as well as through direct contact. In addition, people with measles are infectious for 4 days before and after they have a rash. For these reasons, very large outbreaks occur in communities with low vaccination rates, as we are witnessing in parts of Southeast Asia. Every traveller should ensure they are immune to measles, regardless of their destination. Organisations should have a plan for how to respond if measles is diagnosed in an employee," commented Teo.

A measles scare at a Perth hospital has left hundreds of people potentially exposed to the virus. Students at Brisbane Catholic girls' school Stuartholme will forfeit all netball games today [16 May 2014] due to a case of measles at the school. A message posted on the Stuartholme School website yesterday [15 May 2014] said Queensland Health's Metro North Public Health Unit had been notified of one case "associated with the school." It said the person had been at school between 5-12 May 2014, while unaware they were infectious.

"The case was not aware they were infectious at this time, and the disease can be passed on before a person becomes unwell," it said. "This is an important public health matter, and we ask for parent co-operation with the school and Queensland Health to help prevent the further spread of measles."

The unit said the school was taking the following recommendations to prevent the spread of measles:
- Students and staff who are not immune to measles, that is they do not have 2 documented doses of a measles-containing vaccine or other evidence of measles immunity, should be excluded from school and remain isolated at home until 30 May 2014 (with the date to be revised if there are further measles cases).
- Students and staff who have a previous documented single dose of a measles-containing vaccine may return to school upon receipt of a 2nd documented dose; however, these students/staff should be restricted from attending events external to the school (e.g. interschool sport) until 30 May 2014.
- Any student or staff who has a condition that suppresses the immune system (regardless of vaccination status) should be excluded from school and remain isolated at home until 30 May 2014 (with the date to be revised if there are further measles cases).
- Pregnant staff who do not have 2 documented doses of a measles-containing vaccine or other evidence of measles immunity should be excluded from school and remain isolated at home until 30 May 2014 (with the date to be revised if there are further measles cases).
- Boarding students will be assessed on a case-by-case basis for advice on isolation and activity restrictions, but the use of public transport, including air travel, is strongly discouraged.
- Anyone who develops symptoms of measles in the next few weeks, as described in the measles fact sheet should remain away from school and seek medical advice. This includes people who are considered immune to measles as there is a small possibility they may still develop the disease. Please phone your doctor before you see them so that appropriate precautions can be taken to limit the spread of the disease in the medical setting.

Western Districts Netball Association last night [15 May 2014] said all Stuartholme teams would be forfeiting their games today. Queensland Health said there had been regular measles outbreaks in the state since September 2013, with many people contracting the highly infectious illness while overseas. In March 2014, a Sunshine Coast traveller caught the infection in Viet Nam.

Measles symptoms can include a fever, tiredness, coughing and runny nose followed by a red spotty rash and sore eyes. Queensland Health said these symptoms usually become more severe over the 1st 3 days.
