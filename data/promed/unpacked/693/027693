Two recent postings (FHM disease in Singapore and Rift Valley Fever in Saudi
Arabia) have included references to schools closings as a means to attempt
to control these outbreaks. Although they are quite different problems,
both approaches see short-sighted in their ability to affect the spread of
the disease in question.

In Saudi Arabia, the explanation is offered that the schools were closed
for spraying
and cleaning, in an effort to control this mosquito-borne disease. While on
the surface this might make some sense, I offer that it might influence
other behaviors that will not contribute to the control of the outbreak. RVF
is transmitted by day-biting _Aedes_ (and perhaps _Culex_) mosquitoes. By
closing the
schools, the children who might otherwise be confined (and controlled) may
very well be allowed to roam more freely and put themselves more at risk.
The only reason that closing schools might be an effective intervention in
such a situation is if the children were then dispersed to other
non-infected areas.

In the Singapore case, dispersal is just the potential problem. Closing the
few schools where the FHM disease was first detected might very well have
contributed to the dispersal of infected (incubating) children to other
schools. Might it not have been better to concentrate efforts to train the
adult caregivers in the control of the virus at the places where it had
already occurred?

It would be interesting to determine if the dispersal of children was in any
way related to the spread of the disease.

[Dr. Karwacki raises some very interesting points.
In the case of the RVF outbreak in Saudi Arabia, this moderator's
interpretation of the Health Minister's explanation for the school closure
was purely a temporary situation to permit insecticidal spraying and
cleaning of premises ("...the schools were closed to spray insecticides and
clean the premises.") This was in response to an alarmist newspaper report
that all schools were closed indefinitely because of the epidemic.
Obviously this information is from a press release so in the absence of a
direct response from an official source involved with the ongoing outbreak
this is only speculation and inference. With respect to daytime feeding of
_Aedes_ spp. mosquitoes (and possibly _Culex_ spp.), Dr. Karwacki's
suggestion that the only positive effect of school closure would be if the
students were then taken to non-involved areas, there is room for an
additional comment that educational campaigns on mosquito bite avoidance
such as the distribution and use of insect repellent deserves mention
(however impractical it may seem in the context).
Dr. Karwacki's point on the HFMD school closures raises an interesting
question if there is evidence that closures of the "index" schools (in this
case daycare centers as reported in the newswires) contributed to further
spread of the disease. In this case it is possible that working parents in
need of daycare transferred clinically non-ill (yet potentially infected
and thereby infectious) children to previously uninvolved daycare centers.
It should be noted that transmission is via the oropharyngeal route during
the early stages of infection, but viral excretion in the stool may persist
for prolonged periods. The incubation period for the disease is 3-5 days
and the average duration of illness is 7-10 days. Recommended control
measures include case isolation and crowd reduction, hence justifying
closure of the involved daycare centers for 2 incubation periods after
onset of the last reported cases. Training of the caretakers on stool
precautions after re-opening of the daycare centers is also critical to
prevent potential renewed transmission in that setting. An important
intervention in this case would be the education of parents on the need to
keep the known exposed children at home for a minimum of 2 incubation
periods or until the daycare center is re-opened to avoid possible spread
to others both in the daycare setting as well as in the community at large.
If there are any ProMED-mail subscribers from Singapore with official
information to address the question if closure of the daycare centers may
have contributed to further spread of the disease, we would very much
appreciate hearing from them. - Mod.MPP
