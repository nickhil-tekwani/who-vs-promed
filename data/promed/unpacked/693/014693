In the past week, cVDPV1 cases have been confirmed in the DR Congo and cVDPV2 cases were confirmed in Cameroon (1st case in 2022) and Chad. Positive ES were identified in Algeria, Nigeria, and Yemen.

Since 1 Dec 2022 (the current month), there have been positive ES for WPV1 in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In the same period, there have been AFP cases due to infection with cVDPV1 in Congo DR, Madagascar, and Mozambique.

AFP cases due to infection with cVDPV2 have been reported in Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Sudan, Togo, and Yemen. ES positive for cVDPV2 have been identified in Algeria, Botswana, CAR, and Nigeria. This translates to evidence of a poliovirus circulating in 17 countries during this month (December 2022).

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

[2] USA (New York state): wastewater sampling update
Date: Fri 30 Dec 2022 4:40 pm CST

Since an acute flaccid myelitis patient [it was an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case using international nomenclature - Mod.MPP] was identified in Rockland County, New York (NY) in July 2022, wastewater samples have been tested for poliovirus.

Polio is hard to detect when relying on clinical symptoms in humans, says the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Therefore, wastewater testing for poliovirus is required to determine if there is a community health risk.

As of [30 Dec 2022], an updated sequencing analysis by the CDC confirmed the presence of poliovirus in a total of 99 positive samples of concern, with 92 samples genetically linked to the Rockland County resident. Of the 92 samples, 44 samples were collected in Rockland County, 29 in Orange County, 13 in Sullivan County, and 5 in New York City, all of which were from Brooklyn (Kings County), with 4 of these in an area that contains an adjacent portion in Queens County.

The NY Department of Health Poliovirus Wastewater Surveillance Report, dated [28 Dec 2022], is posted at https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/docs/waste_water_surveillance_report.pdf.

To quantify the extent of the poliovirus exposure, CDC announced on [30 Nov 2022] that it would expand wastewater testing in select jurisdictions such as Detroit and Philadelphia.

Globally, poliovirus type 2 isolates have been identified in sewage samples collected in London and Israel related to the NY findings.

On [1 Nov 2022], a World Health Organization Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and extended Temporary Recommendations into 2023.

To notify international visitors, CDC updated its global polio Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions on [30 Nov 2022], regarding outbreaks and poliovirus detections in various countries. Furthermore, the CDC suggests eligible people become and maintain their polio immunizations.
