Basically each province has seen the spread of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]. Relatively hard hit areas are Jiangsu, Shanxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong [provinces]. All have had step-by-step transmission with a definite impact on local pig prices.

[Earlier this month (December 2015), the same economical media source named 3 provinces with reported FMD in pigs, namely Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shanxi. The current report adds 5 provinces to the list: Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangxi and Guangdong.

FMD is regarded to be endemic in China. According to the People's Republic of China page on the WRLFMD website, the following serotypes have been recorded throughout the years:
FMDV-O: 1958, 1986, 1999-2001, 2003, 2005, 2010-2014
FMDV-A: 1951, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964, 2009-2010, 2013-2014
FMDV-C: 0000
FMDV-Asia 1: 1958, 2005-2009
FMDV-SAT 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 2: 0000
FMDV-SAT 3: 0000

China's annual reports to the OIE since 2010 mention 2 circulating serotypes: O and A. According to the available information, at present 5 separate FMD epizootics are "continuing," of which 4 started during 2013 and one started in November 2014 (pigs, Jiangsu).

According to the stipulations of OIE's International Animal Health Code, immediate notifications are prescribed if/when there is a significant change in the epidemiology of an endemic disease or following the appearance of a new or exotic strain. Otherwise, all FMD outbreaks and the relevant statistics and applied measures are to be reported twice yearly in the semi-annual reports, which are meant to include the information for each province, specifying the serotype involved. - Mod.AS
