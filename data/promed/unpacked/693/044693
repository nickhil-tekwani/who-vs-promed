A 7-month-old child is in serious condition in an Israeli hospital after ingesting spores of a rare and deadly disease just days earlier.

"During our checkup, we concluded that he was suffering from botulism," Dr Eli Shapiro, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit chief at Rehovot's [HaMerkaz, Central District] Kaplan Hospital, told Army Radio on Wed 28 May 2014. "We're talking about the most powerful poison in nature, one that causes fast and complete neurological and muscular paralysis," Shapiro said. "It was decided to treat the baby with the antidote stored in our emergency stocks, even before we got back the lab test results."

Kaplan, like all Israeli medical facilities, keeps ample supplies of biological and chemical warfare antidotes on hand in case of war or terrorist attacks, and regularly drills staffers in dealing with the symptoms of various chemical, neural, and blister agents.

The quick-thinking mother immediately brought the child to the hospital when she saw he was suffering from vomiting, difficulty in breathing, listlessness, and an inability to nurse or eat, hospital officials said. "He seemed apathetic, couldn't take any food, and was glassy-eyed," the mother recounted to Israel's Ma'ariv daily. "Since he received the antidote, there's been a slight improvement in his condition and visual responses, but he's a got a long road ahead to fully recover," she cautioned.

"The infant is still in a life-threatening situation, however, the muscular paralysis has been checked and there's been a small degree of improvement in his muscular weakness," Shapiro said.

Shapiro said it was, as yet, unclear as to the source of the poisoning, however, Health Ministry officials have been alerted and are investigating the circumstances.

[The following is abstracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail posting: Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism - Mod.LL] Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _C. botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

As was done in the case above, botulism immune globulin (BIG) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.
