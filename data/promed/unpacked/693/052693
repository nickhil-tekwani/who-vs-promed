Bovine Outbreak in Southern Province
-----------------------------------------------------
A senior government official has confirmed the outbreak of contagious
Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP) in Southern Province.
Chief veterinary officer Dominic Minyoi said in an interview that CBPP has
affected Bombwe, Ngwezi, and Simonga, which is 15 km away from Livingstone.
Dr. Minyoi said the disease has been transmitted because of movement of
cattle from Sesheke in Western Province to Southern Province.
He, however, said there were vaccinations carried out, though he believed
they could not be 100 percent because of illegal cattle movements. He said
veterinary officers have been sent to take samples in Nyawa and Zimba to
ascertain the presence of the disease in the areas.
Dr. Minyoi said vaccinations of cattle were to be carried out in Kazungula
and Livingstone because of the nature of the disease. He said CBPP was
contagious, making it dangerous; and that Kazungula and Livingstone were
under surveillance.
Dr. Minyoi has appealed to the provincial permanent secretary and all the
district commissioners in Southern Province to ensure there was no movement
of live cattle from other areas into the province.
He has urged meat suppliers such as ZAMBEEF, ZamZam, Luscold, and others
not to off-load their meat products in undesignated areas.
