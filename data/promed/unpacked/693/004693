Summary
-------
An outbreak of measles is ongoing in Geneva,
Switzerland, since January 2011, in the context
of a measles epidemic in neighbouring
Rhone-Alpes, France. A total of 41 confirmed
cases have been reported, the majority among
young adults, many unaware of their non-immune
status. There is no large clustering of cases and
14 cases were imported or linked to imported
cases. Catch-up vaccination, especially among
young adults, may be necessary to prevent further extension of this outbreak.

Background
----------
Between 1 Jan and 2 Mar 2011, 58 suspected cases
of measles were notified to the Geneva health
authorities in Switzerland. [See also ProMED-mail
post: Measles - Switzerland (GE), France
(Rhone-Alpes) 20110222.0588). - Mod.CP]

Of the 58 suspected cases, 41 (8.9 cases per 100
000 population) were confirmed (by laboratory
confirmation or evidence of an epidemiological
link) and were living in Geneva. In the previous
18 months (July 2009 to December 2010), only 9
confirmed cases had been notified. The last
national outbreak of measles in Switzerland
lasted from November 2006 to July 2010, with 4410
reported cases, including 84 in Geneva [1].

A large outbreak of measles is currently being
reported in the neighbouring region of
Rhone-Alpes, France, where more than 900 cases
have been notified from January to mid-February
2011 [2]. Geneva canton (population 464 000) is
located on the eastern part of Switzerland and
shares 103 km [64 miles] of its border with
France and 4.5 km [2.8 miles] with the rest of Switzerland.

In Switzerland, measles notification has been
mandatory since 1999. Physicians should report to
local health authorities any patient presenting
with maculopapular rash associated with fever and
any of the following: cough, coryza or
conjunctivitis. Notification of confirmed cases
is also mandatory for laboratories. Childhood
measles vaccination has been recommended since
1975: the current vaccination policy is to
vaccinate twice with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)
at the age of 12 months and 15­24 months (the 2nd
dose was introduced in 1996) [3]. The most recent
estimate of national coverage among children aged
2 years is 89.8 percent for one dose and 74.6
percent for 2 doses (unpublished data).

Case description
----------------
Of the 41 cases included in the analysis, 33 were
laboratory confirmed (by IgM or PCR) and 8 were
epidemiologically linked cases. The epidemic
curve is presented as a figure in the original
text. An additional 14 notified cases were not
included, even though they were diagnosed in
Geneva and reported to the health authorities,
because they were French residents (n=11) or
living in the canton of Vaud (n=3). All worked,
attended school or consulted a physician in
Geneva. 2 suspected cases were reported and later
ruled out due to negative serology results.

The male to female sex ratio of the 41 cases was
1:2 and their median age was 20 years (range: 11
months­58 years). Of 35 cases with known
immunisation status, 25 had not been vaccinated
with MMR vaccine, 8 had received one dose and 2 at least 2 doses.

6 patients presented with at least one
complication such as pneumonia (n=4), bronchitis
(n=1), respiratory failure (n=1) and otitis
(n=1). 8 patients were hospitalised: one was in
intensive care with respiratory failure, one had
pneumonia, 2 had a general alteration of heath
status (in one case, this was associated with
hypoxemia and in one, with fever) and 2 were kept
in for overnight observation. The reason for
hospitalisation is still unknown for one patient.
No deaths were reported. All but one of the
patients with complications or who were
hospitalised were adults (median age: 36 years).

Of the 41 cases, 14 were imported (n=8) or
epidemiologically linked with an imported case
(n=6). These cases came from or were
epidemiologically linked to cases from France
(n=9), the canton of Vaud (n=4) and, possibly,
Argentina (n=1). 4 clusters were identified: in 2
clusters, there were 4 cases per cluster, and in
2 clusters, there were 2 cases per cluster,
giving a total of 12 cases. Transmission occurred
in settings such as families (3 occurrences),
schools (n=2), social contacts (n=4) and the health service (n=1).

Control measures
----------------
In Switzerland, notification is mandatory within
24 hours of diagnosis and control measures are
implemented as early as possible by local health
authorities and school health services without
waiting for laboratory confirmation. Cases are
isolated at home for 4 days after the beginning
of their rash. Extensive and rapid contact
tracing is conducted as an emergency measure so
that contacts and relatives of cases can be
informed and their vaccination or immunisation
status assessed. Control measures are customised
and depend on the age, immunisation status of the
contact and when the contact took place.

They include post-exposure vaccination of
unvaccinated or non-immune contacts with recent
exposure (less than 72 hours), administration of
immunoglobulins to unvaccinated or non-immune
pregnant women and newborns less than 4 months
old. Unvaccinated or non-immune siblings, close
and classmate contacts are quarantined at home
for 18 days, with vaccination at the end of the
quarantine period. A total of 20 exposed
non-immune persons were quarantined. 5 developed
measles but there were no subsequent cases; 7 are still quarantined.

In addition, Geneva health authorities regularly
sent epidemiological updates and practical
information by email to local physicians. These
include reducing the age of first measles
vaccination from 12 to 9 months of age. A press
release, individual emails to all Geneva
university students, and information letters to
directors of schools, day-care centres and
creches have been sent out by the university or
school health services. The main message has been
targeted to young adults, recommending them to
check their immunisation status and be vaccinated if necessary.

Discussion
----------
This outbreak occurred in the context of a large
measles epidemic in neighbouring Rhone-Alpes
region in France. In addition, cases have also
been recently diagnosed in the Lausanne and Basel
regions, but very few are being reported in other parts of Switzerland.

The epidemiology of infectious diseases in the
canton of Geneva is closely related to its
neighbouring regions for obvious economic and
geographic reasons. As a consequence, about one
3rd of the cases in the outbreak were imported or
related to imported cases, mostly from the
bordering department of Haute-Savoie [France].
The 14 cases who were not included in this
analysis as they did not reside in Geneva were
investigated in collaboration with the local French health authorities.

Most cases in this outbreak were adults, many of
whom were not aware of their immune status. There
was a delay in the diagnosis of several cases as
early presentation of measles can be quite
similar to influenza (seasonal influenza peaked
in Geneva between weeks 1 and 7 of 2011). In some
instances, there were multiple consultations
before measles was diagnosed. However, only one
health care-related case has been documented so far.

Control measures have been implemented early for
all cases including those whose measles diagnosis
has not yet been confirmed. Post- exposure
vaccination is often ineffective because it is
implemented too late. As secondary attack rate in
unvaccinated household members is high [4],
quarantine of non-immunised relatives and close
contacts and classmates is enforced and has
proven effective in previous outbreaks in Geneva
[5]. None of the 5 quarantined contacts who
developed measles transmitted the virus to others.

Although national MMR vaccination coverage
remains below the threshold required for measles
elimination in Switzerland [6,7], it is somewhat
higher in Geneva. In 2007, 89.7 percent of
28-month-old infants had received 2 doses of
measles vaccine [7-9] and in 2009, the
corresponding figure was 91.7 percent, according
to the most recent analysis of the Geneva
vaccination database [10], in June 2010.
Progressive accumulation of non-immunised or
insufficiently immunised persons, is therefore
inevitable and explains this outbreak, along with
multiple introduction of infectious patients into the Geneva community.

Conclusion and recommendations
------------------------------
Fairly high MMR vaccination coverage in children
[as] well as early and effective prevention
measures have probably contributed to reducing
the magnitude of this outbreak, as indicated by
the absence of any large clusters of cases so
far. However, the influx of cases from
neighbouring regions may continue and the
potential for extension of the outbreak is substantial.

Catch-up vaccination is critical to prevent
further extension of this outbreak, especially
among young adults, particularly students.
Careful scrutiny of the situation should continue
as well as close collaboration with the neighbouring health authorities.

Warning on measles outbreak in Blacktown local government area
--------------------------------------------------------------
Residents have been warned of a measles outbreak
in the Blacktown local government area. Dr Vicky
Sheppeard, manager, NSW Health Communicable
Diseases for the public health unit said there
had been 14 confirmed cases since the end of
January [2011] at Rooty Hill, Seven Hills, Mt Druitt and St Marys.

She said the initial symptoms of measles was
fever, tiredness, runny nose,cough and sore red
eyes. "Symptoms usually begin around 10 days
after contact with an infected person, so people
need to be aware of any signs of infection in
themselves or their children during this week,"
she said. "A red, blotchy rash would appear 3 to
3 days after initial symptoms. The rash starts on
the face and then spreads over the body and will
last 3 to 3 days. Anyone who develops these
symptoms should seek advice from their GP.

"We ask that people to ring ahead to say that
they could have measles and ask to be seated in a
separate waiting room to avoid spreading the
disease to others. Measles is one of the most
easily spread diseases and just being in the same
room as someone with measles can result in
infection. Around one in 5 people who catch
measles require hospitalisation, so it's better
to prevent catching it if possible. The public
health unit has been working with local
hospitals, GPs and schools to identify and
contact people who may have been exposed to the infection."

Dr Sheppeard said it was important for people who
had not been immunised to watch out for these
symptoms as they may have come in contact with
the disease. Children should be vaccinated
against measles at one year and 4 years of age.
For adults between 25 and 45 years old, who are
often as susceptible to measles as when they were
young, only one dose of vaccine was recommended.

Health authorities warn of possible measles outbreak
----------------------------------------------------
Health authorities yesterday [15 Mar 2011] warned
of a possible measles outbreak in Taipei City's
Wenshan District and told the residents there to
be on guard after confirming 3 cases.

A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control
said genetic sequencing has tentatively confirmed
a 28-year-old male Swiss student, a 20-year-old
female Taiwanese student, and a one-year-old
baby, all from Wenshan [district], have
contracted the highly contagious respiratory
diseases "from the same viral sources."

The baby, who contracted the disease from the
female college coed earlier this month, has been
discharged from hospital in fair condition.
Condition of the 2 grown-ups is not immediately
known. The Swiss [student] lives about a
"10-minute walk" from the female student, and the
2 and the baby are total strangers to each other.

The Swiss [student], who returned to Taiwan from
India during the Lunar New Year break, appears to
be the 1st of the 3 to come down with the
disease. Next came the female student, whose
onset is dated 16 Feb 2011. There was a 2-day
overlap in the 2's incubation periods. The female
student then passed the virus on to the baby, who
has had contact with 155 people, one of whom is
another baby who has never been immunized against
measles with the so-called MMR (measles, mumps,
and rubella) vaccine. The 2nd baby's condition also is not known.

The spokesman said CDC will continue to monitor
the situation before confirming the disease is not spreading further.

[This incipient outbreak appears to be the result
of importation of infection via a Swiss
nationality student vacationing In India. The
vaccination status of the itinerant student is not stated.

240 people affected by an outbreak of measles
---------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry on Monday [14 Mar 2011]
stated that the number of people affected by the
outbreak of measles which began in January [2011]
in Seville and its surrounding province had risen
to 240, but was now believed to be contained.

Health Department sources stated that the number
of people affected by measles in the municipality
of San Juan de Aznalfarache had now reached 109,
an outbreak that is linked to that recorded in
Seville, particularly in the neighborhoods of La
Plata, and Litanies Poligono Sur. The number of
cases in this linked outbreak has rises to 47, of
which 12 are located in La Plata, 19 in Las
Litaneias and 16 in Litanies Poligono Sur.

Besides these cases, the Health Ministry has
recorded 84 others measles case in Seville and
its province, but these cases are considered
"sporadic;" i.e, unrelated epidemiologically to
the above outbreak, and considered to be "under control."

In Seville on Monday the Minister of Health,
Maria Jesus Montero, responding to questions from
reporters stated that there had been a massive
positive response to the call for vaccination in
contrast to the situation in Granada "where some
families had been reluctant to be vaccinated."

The Health Department emphasized the need to
achieve protection of all children by vaccination
in view of the contagiousness of measles. For
this reason and in view of the exceptional
circumstances it was essential to vaccinate all
6-month-old children in the slums of South Range,
Litany and La Plata. Children under 6 months of
age are naturally immunized (from the mother
during pregnancy and through subsequent breast-feeding).
