Authorities are reporting another mumps outbreak at the Lopez State Jail in Edinburg [Hidalgo county, Texas].

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice [TDCJ] confirms there are 149 offenders there who have been quarantined. 3 offenders recently tested positive for the illness.

If anyone has a loved one in the facility, the prison is asking for them to call before you head over for visitation.

A notice posted on the TDCJ website said there is also housing areas at the gurney unit in Palestine, Texas and at the Willacy County State Jail that are under restrictions due to "confirmed illnesses."

[2] Canada: Manitoba, correctional center

An outbreak of mumps at the Brandon Correctional Centre [BCC, Manitoba] has staff worried as the number of cases more than tripled in the past few weeks.

A correctional centre staff member, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job, said the number of confirmed cases had gone to 9 from 2 in a 2-week period, with 3 more cases waiting to be confirmed as of [Thu 14 Sep 2017]. One of those confirmed cases is a staff member.

"It may be small numbers, but it's still not small potatoes to us," the staff member said. "Staff at the centre are biting their nails... we want to exhale, but we can't."

Mumps is a contagious viral infection that causes flu-like symptoms, swollen and painful salivary glands, swollen cheeks, difficulty chewing, swallowing or talking, and loss of appetite.

Mumps can be spread through the air and by sharing of food or drinks. It can also be contracted by touching something previously touched by an infected person.

Staff are concerned there aren't enough reactive measures or preventative measures happening at the medium/maximum security centre that houses both men and women.

"The clean up and the follow up for these communicable diseases is really poor, as far as we're concerned," the staff member said, adding other inmates are given a mask and put in charge of wiping cells down with disinfectant after an infected inmate leaves the area.

A quarantine area has also been set up in a disassociation cell next to a staff office less than 10 feet [3 m] away. Infected inmates are required to wear face masks at all times, the staff member said, but it doesn't always happen.

"At one time, we had 3 guys in one cell with the mumps... they were hot and sweaty and they were tired of wearing their face masks so they took them off while we're serving them meals," the source said.

The mumps cases started in the kitchen, the staff member said, adding to the concern with how quickly it's spread.

"We hear (the inmates) during meal time, they'll say things like, 'Mmm, spaghetti with a side of mumps.' They know what's going on... I have yet to have anyone refuse a tray from the kitchen... but they're aware it's there."

A spokesperson for Manitoba Justice confirmed via email there have been a small number of inmates who have shown symptoms or tested positive for mumps, adding to date those symptoms have been flu-like and relatively minor, and the effect on operations has been minimal.

When asked to comment further -- specifically on staff concerns -- the spokesperson said BCC is following public health advice on appropriate cleaning and other management protocols.

"All of our correctional centres have health and safety representatives who are encouraged to raise employees' concerns with management. Though mumps is a recent example, the management of infectious diseases is an ongoing part of daily operations in all of our facilities," the spokesperson wrote.

Requests for a further interview with the superintendent of BCC or an official with Manitoba Justice were declined.

The staff member said several people have completed workplace health and safety forms, and the union has also been advised of their concerns.

"Our officers strive to ensure the safety of everyone in the jail, so anytime a medical situation arises it's obviously concerning," Manitoba Government and General Employees' Union president Michelle Gawronsky said via email. "Public health has been involved and are providing guidance for staff and inmates, and we are taking direction from them on what next steps are needed."

Staff were encouraged to double-check their immunization records and make sure they are up-to-date, the staff member said, and BCC was required to provide a clinic for staff to receive the required vaccines to protect against mumps.

The Brandon Court House is also taking precautions, opting to have inmates with symptoms or confirmed mumps cases appear in court by video.

[Because of the close living quarters of inmates and movement of inmates between and within facilities, controlling mumps in a correctional setting can be difficult. Vaccination and quarantine are required to prevent continued transmission, and spread outside the facility.

[3] Canada: British Columbia (Vancouver) alert

http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2017/09/14/health-authority-calls-for-immunization-after-mumps-outbreak.html


Vancouver Coastal Health [VCH] is encouraging young people heading back to university to get immunized after 13 new cases of mumps were recorded over the past month.

The health authority says there have been 80 cases of mumps since February [2017], compared to 86 for all of last year. The average number of cases over the previous 5 years is 32.

Last year [2016], Vancouver Canucks [ice hockey team] defenceman Troy Stecher was diagnosed with the contagious virus, while 5 teammates and a trainer all displayed symptoms of the illness.

"We continue to see mumps in increasing numbers, and these outbreaks will continue unless young adults between the ages of 23 and 47 receive 2 doses of vaccine so they are fully protected," said Dr Althea Hayden, VCH medical health officer, in a statement [Thu 14 Sep 2017].

Mumps is a virus that causes fever and swelling of the salivary glands, located below the jaw and ears and under the tongue. In rare cases it can cause sterility, deafness, and inflammation of the brain.

The virus is spread through saliva or mucus from the nose, mouth, or throat of an infected person. It can spread through coughs and sneezes and by sharing food, drinks, cigarettes, and by kissing.

Young people living in shared housing in close contact with others -- like those heading off to university -- are most likely to contract mumps, experts warned.

Vancouver Coastal Health says people born in 1970 of after need 2 doses of mumps vaccine, while those born between 1957 and 1969 need only one dose. People born before 1957 or have had a mumps infection are considered protected.

[As do the inmates in correctional facilities, students in universities live in close quarters, and frequently move between classes and living quarters, allowing for virus spread to unimmunized individuals or those with waning immunity. A 3rd MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine dose has been administered at some universities when outbreaks begin, with some success.
