There have been reports of a suspected human and animal anthrax outbreak on
the island of Sumbawa, Indonesia. Data collection on the current outbreak
comes from 2 regional news organizations and from the regional health
department. Data was collected by Dr Lany Harijanti from the International
SOS public health department at the Batu Hijau Mine in Sumbawa.
According to a local newspaper (Lombok Post 09 Nov 2004) there were 4 cases
of suspected human anthrax from Batu Bangka village, Moyo Hilir District in
Sumbawa. The latest report from this newspaper on 11 Nov 2004 states
another 2 additional human cases from Berare village, Moyo Hilir. The
source of the infection was reportedly eating meat from the carcasses of
infected cattle. The human cases were all treated and observed by the local
Puskesmas (government clinic).
According to the initial newspaper reports, about 22 cattle were reported
to have died because of anthrax. However the Kasubdin Kesehatan Hewan --
Dinas Peternakan Sumbawa (Cattle Office, Sumbawa) have stated that only 5
cattle have died from suspected anthrax. The symptoms in the cattle were
high fever of up to 42 degrees Celsius and bleeding from all orifices
(nostrils, mouth, and anus). According the regional health authorities
there are 6 human cases that all have cutaneous anthrax. They are being
treated as outpatients. The local health office and cattle office have said
that they are on top of the problem and are investigating it to control
transmission. The 5 carcasses have apparently been burnt.
Anthrax has been reported sporadically on the island of Sumbawa since 1955.
Human and animal anthrax seems to be endemic to the island of Sumbawa and
elsewhere in Indonesia. [Yes - Mod. MHJ] There are some confusing reports
about how many cattle have died. The cattle symptoms seem to be very
suggestive of anthrax (non clotting of blood at death) although I suppose
there are other possibilities. There were pictures in the newspaper of the
[human] cutaneous lesions and they looked very suggestive of cutaneous
anthrax. It seems highly likely then, that this is in fact an outbreak of
human and animal anthrax.
The common custom in this part of Indonesia is not to eat cattle or goats
that have died of an acute illness like this. Some meat was apparently cut
from the carcasses and fed to dogs, which then died within a week. The
villages of Batu Bangka and Berare are remote and people in that area are
mainly subsistence farmers. It is highly unlikely that cattle are
vaccinated and very likely that the meat from these recently departed
animals was handled.
If meat from the carcasses was consumed, then in these parts, it would
normally have been well cooked and not eaten raw or even undercooked
(unless eaten as grilled satay sticks!). Spores normally survive
temperatures up to at least 80 degrees celsius for 10 minutes. One of the
methods of killing off contaminants in the lab is to heat shock the sample
to 80 degrees for 10 minutes. This kills contaminants and can stimulate
heat-resistant _Bacillus anthracis_ spores to germinate. Therefore, is
seems that to be sure meat is properly decontaminated, one would need to
cook meat at or over 100 degrees Celsius for more than 10 minutes. The
human cases were reported to have cutaneous anthrax, so its unlikely that
the transmission was from eating contaminated meat, otherwise GIT
[gastrointestinal tract] anthrax would be expected. It is more likely
transmission was from handling the dead carcasses. Samples have apparently
been sent to a laboratory for processing but no results are available. The
health and cattle office are working together and more vaccines have
apparently been ordered.

I generally feel 80 C is getting a little hot for the comfort of anthrax
spores and, if you are using that temperature to select them out from other
bacteria, you may start to lose some. I don't know the precise decimal
reduction figures though (not sure anyone does), but if the population is
large enough, some will survive 10 min at that temp too. Probably, in
practice, when a lab person says he has applied 80 C for 10 min, the centre
of the container never reaches that temp. I prefer 60-65 C for 15-20 min
myself, making some attempt to ensure that the whole thing does achieve
those conditions.
But all that is not terribly relevant to the point he (Dave Knight) is
making, which is that, should such meat be eaten, it should be properly
cooked first. [Ideally] it shouldn't be eaten at all.

[Our experience matches Peter's; heat sterilisation temperatures are
normally in excess of 135 deg C. We have never been impressed by the
germination potential of "heat shocking" but it certainly helps, especially
if one is not comfortable in identifying _B. anthracis_ colonies, in
removing the competing growth noise on the plate. Eating or not eating
anthrax carcasses essentially comes down to the poverty level in rural
areas. In areas where meat of any variety is rarely eaten, the risk is
accepted. Members of some religions will not eat an animal that died, but
moribund animals will have their throats cut so that the carcass can be
salvaged and the meat sold and/or consumed by the family. It happens all
over, viz that Minnesota farmer's family in Roseau County in 2000, that
near-miss in Texas where an anthrax goat was in the farmer's deep freeze
waiting for Sunday when his veterinarian came to investigate the caprine
deaths, and in Central Russia. "Properly cooked" is a matter of definition.
Given the choice, now that I live in Louisiana and not the UK, I would
prefer "well-cooked."
Our thanks to Dave for his informed report, and Peter as ever. - Mod.MHJ]
