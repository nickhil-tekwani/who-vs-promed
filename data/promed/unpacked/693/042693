China's State Council has called for continued efforts on prevention and control of an H7N9 bird flu outbreak.

Information about the outbreak should be widely available to prevent panic and strengthen monitoring of transportation and trade of live poultry, according to a statement released after a State Council executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on [Wed 22 Feb 2017].

The government ordered better management of live poultry markets, including closure, sanitation and quarantine. The live poultry trade should be stopped in places where H7N9 cases have been reported or where the virus has been detected, the statement said.

There will be harsher punishment for wrongdoing concerning poultry transportation, sales and slaughter, and there should be improvements in the care of critical patients.

Since January [2017], at least 270 H7N9 human infections have been reported in China, with at least 87 fatalities. Most cases were around the Yangtze and Pearl River deltas.

H7N9 was 1st reported in humans in China in March 2013 and is most likely to strike in winter and spring.

[2] China, Jiangxi and other provinces, live poultry markets closure

An eastern Chinese city joined others across the country in banning live poultry sales amid fears over the deadly H7N9 strain of bird flu.

The ban is effective for 2 weeks starting today [Wed 22 Feb 2017] in Nanchang, capital of eastern Jiangxi Province. All poultry markets in the city, (pictured), will be disinfected.

The Nanchang Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the public do not need to panic.

Jiangxi reported 28 human H7N9 cases, with 7 deaths, from January to mid-February [2017], according to provincial health authorities.

Authorities in Kunming, capital of southwestern Yunnan Province, on [Tue 21 Feb 17] announced that the city will ban the sale and culling of live poultry in downtown areas starting in March [2017].

Earlier this month [February 2017], the H7N9 virus claimed the lives of a 23-year-old woman and her 3-year-old daughter in Kunming. [Simultaneous infection from a common source? Human to human infection excluded? - Mod.AS].

Since January [2017], at least 270 H7N9 human infections have been reported in China, with at least 87 fatalities. Most cases were around the Yangtze and Pearl River deltas.

So far, live poultry sales have also been suspended in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Suzhou, several cities in Hunan and Sichuan provinces and the whole of Zhejiang province.

The bans have greatly reduced the number of new infections in many regions, said Ni Daxin, deputy director of the emergency response center at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Ni suggested replacing live poultry with frozen birds to reduce the risk of infection.

[[Mainland China officially reported the detection of H7N9 HPAI in samples from Guangdong Province collected in January 2017 from several live bird markets (LBMs) and from 2 human cases with known exposure to live birds. These strains, which are similar to the circulating influenza A(H7N9) virus, showed a mutation leading to multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site: a sign for high pathogenicity in poultry.

The reported involvement of China's highest ranking authorities in the handling of the issue (item 1), including the extensive closures of LBM's, is indicative of the view of said authorities on the seriousness of the findings and the commendable decision to exercise a One Health approach.

As long as human-to-human infection is absent, the zoo-sanitary measures addressing poultry health deserve to be prioritized and intensified. The worst scenario, hopefully never to occur, is the development of a highly pathogenic virus mutation transmissible from human to human. Such scenario may herald the start of a pandemic.

So far, no significant mortality in poultry infected by HPAI H7N9 has been reported. - Mod.AS
