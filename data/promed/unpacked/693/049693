More than 1,000 wild horses living on tribal and federal lands in eastern
Utah will, according to this story, be rounded up to prevent the spread of
a deadly virus that has cropped up at a much higher rate than usual.
The Ute tribe and Bureau of Land Management made plans for the round-up
after 29 of 200 horses tested this spring on the Uintah and Ouray
Reservation were found to have equine infectious anemia.
State veterinarian Mike Marshall was cited as saying the infection rate of
15 percent far exceeds the typical rate is one in 7,000; and in Utah about
two to four domestic horses tested each year have the disease. Marshall was
quoted as saying, "This is certainly the biggest incidence we've seen in
Utah, probably in the intermountain West. There is no treatment for this.
Once the animal has this, it's either going to become very weak or die."
Spread by mosquitoes and horse flys, the virus causes death in about 30
percent of cases. Horses found to have the virus, which is not
transmittable to humans or other animals, will be killed.
The story says that the roundup will cover an area of 600,000 acres with
all kinds of terrain. An estimated 500 of the horses to be rounded up are
on 300,000 acres of federal land; another 600 are estimated to live on
330,000 acres of the million-acre reservation.

[In the normal course of events no more than 80% of animals (cattle, horses)
can be rounded up in broken country, in a good year. To get 100% will be
very difficult. - Mod.MHJ]
