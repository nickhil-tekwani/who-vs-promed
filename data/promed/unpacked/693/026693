Horses, emus and humans become involved with EEE virus only after
considerable virus amplification at foci with specific ecological
characteristics. These enzootic foci can be discrete in both time and
space. The volume of mosquito and bird samples indicated in this
correspondence probably is insufficient in both time and space for
statewide coverage to detect initial activity, unless these samples came
from well known early season foci of activity.
Based on a series of excellent studies on the East Coast, infection of horse
cases, and to a lesser extent game birds and emus, appears to involve a very
complex series of ecological events that culminate in the involvement of a
series of bridge vectors. Sampling the bridge vectors provides less of an
"early warning" than sampling the source.

It is important that Dr. Calisher points out (see ref. above) the
alternative attitude to the present prevailing philosophy in public health
[which] seems to say; show me the diseased body (plant, animal, or human),
then we will take care of the situation. The other view seems to say; let's
find what is out there, what it is doing, what damage it may or may not do,
announce it to the professional and general community, and let remedies &/or
precautions be implemented before the bodies start to drop.
With budget cuts, surveillance systems are the first to go. Yes,
eradication, control, and remedies are important but properly established
surveillance and evaluation systems are just as important.
Public health [management] by crises is extremely expensive. Including
surveillance and monitoring within a sound health program is far less
expensive in the long run.

[We might be at Square One with respect to ADEQUATE surveillance systems,
Bobbi. The magnificent work done decades ago by CDC (Work, Chamberlain,
Sudia), UC/Berkeley (Reeves, Hardy), and so many others, including the
states of Florida, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, New Jersey and more,
remarkably, seem to have been forgotten. The wheel needs reinventing.
Cutting funds for field work and calling it "downsizing surveillance" is
like getting a divorce and calling it "downsizing a marriage". - Mod.CHC]
