[ProMED-mail postings 20090814.2890 and 20090905.3121 included the
following request for information:
"The reportedly increased rabies incidence in Ukraine is somewhat puzzling
in view of the statement that oral vaccination of wildlife is being
applied. It will help to obtain information on the oral vaccination's date
of inauguration, number of distributions per year, mode of application,
number of baits per square kilometer, geographical coverage, the baiting
material used and the vaccine strain."

We are grateful to Volodymyr Solodchuk, general director of the Ukrainian
state enterprise "Ukrvetprompostach", for providing us with the following
response. - Mod.AS]

Further to your request we have prepared the following information,
addressing the rabies situation in Ukraine.
1. Oral vaccination in Ukraine started in 2007.
2. Number of distributions [campaigns] per year - 2 distributions, in
spring and in autumn (according to the WHO and OIE recommendations).
3. The 2 campaigns are: the spring campaign (end April - beginning May),
and the autumn campaign (till 2008 - mid November; in 2009 -- mid October).
4. Mode of application -- vaccine is applied orally. Till 2009 the oral
rabies vaccine for wildlife distribution was conducted by hand and
partially by air transport. From the beginning of 2009 -- only by air
transport: helicopters and airplanes.
5. Number of baits -- 15 per sq/km.
6. Geographical coverage -- 132 746 sq/km [see further names of the 6
regions included].
7. Vaccine applied for oral rabies vaccination is vaccine "Brovarabies
V-RG," produced by Ukrvetprompostach LLC, Ukraine
8. Baiting material used -- edible bait with biomarker of Tetracycline
range (produced by Ukrvetprompostach LLC, Ukraine).
9. Vaccine strain -- V-RG (Vaccinia Rabies Glycoprotein), produced by
Merial, France.
10. Epizootic situation on number of reported rabies cases in animals in 6
provinces (Kyivska, Donetska, Luganska, Poltavska, Sumska and Kharkivska)
of Ukraine, where vaccination is currently conducted, before and after
rabies vaccination

[There seems to be a significant decrease in the number of rabies cases
since the launch of the campaign in 2007. This is most pronounced in
relation to farm animals (225 in 2007, 11 in the 1st 8 months of 2009) and
wild animals (473 in 2007, 32 in the 1st 8 months of 2009). Final figures,
to cover entire years, are expected in early 2010.

Besides the Kyivska province (oblast), in north-central Ukraine, the other
5 provinces are located in the east and north east of Ukraine, 4 of them
bordering Russia; see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/ukraine_adm93.jpg>. Ukraine is
divided into 24 oblasts and one autonomous republic (Crimea). - Mod.AS]
