The Public Health Agency of Canada announced on Wednesday [20 Jan 2016] that an investigation is under way regarding an outbreak of infections caused by the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_ [http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/phn-asp/2016/listeria-eng.php].

In all, 7 cases have been reported from 5 provinces, 3 in Ontario and 1 [each] in Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. All were hospitalized and 1 person died. "It has not been determined whether listeria contributed to the cause of death," said the agency. Two thirds of patients are women whose average age is 81 years. These people fell ill between September 2015 and the beginning of January 2016.

In a press release, the agency said it is working with its federal and provincial partners of public health on this issue. For now, the source of the outbreak has not been confirmed. The Agency of Public Health reported that pre-packaged leafy vegetables, mixed salads and salad packaging products are at the center of the investigation.

According to the Agency of Public Health Canada, the people most at risk are pregnant women and their fetuses or newborns, seniors 65 and older and people with weakened immune systems. By consuming the bacterium listeria these people may develop serious illness called listeriosis. Meat, seafood and refrigerated smoked fish, milk and unpasteurized cheeses, plants and raw vegetables are the foods at risk.

To protect their health, high-risk individuals should follow safe food handling practices such as frequently washing and disinfecting the refrigerator surfaces used in the kitchen when preparing food.

People with listeriosis may have different symptoms including fever, muscle aches, nausea, diarrhea, headache, loss of coordination, seizures and neck stiffness.

[Presumably these 7 cases are linked by being infected with a strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ having the same genotype. More information from knowledgeable sources in this regard would be welcomed.
