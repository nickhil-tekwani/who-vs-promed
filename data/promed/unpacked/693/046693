US Says Pneumonia Cases in Iraq Seem 'Sporadic'
---------------------------------------------------
Medical experts investigating a spate of serious pneumonia cases among US
troops in Iraq and nearby nations have found no evidence the illnesses were
spread from one person to another, officials said on Tue, 6 Aug 2003. Lt.
Gen. James Peake, the Army's surgeon general, last week sent 2 teams of
investigators to determine the cause of more than 100 pneumonia cases
recorded since 1 Mar 2003 among troops deployed for operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
The 15 most seriously ill troops -- 14 men and 1 woman -- were put on
ventilators to help them breathe. Of those, 2 soldiers who had served in
Iraq died, 1 in June 2003 and 1 in July 2003, said Col. Robert DeFraites,
chief of preventive medicine in the Army surgeon general's office. 10 of
these 15 cases occurred in Iraq, with others reported in Kuwait, Qatar, and
as far away as Uzbekistan, DeFraites told a Pentagon briefing.
DeFraites said investigators, trying to determine any relationship among
the cases, found that 2 of the 15 cases were caused by the streptococcus
bacterium [_S. pneumoniae_, the pneumococcus - Mod.LL] , the most common
cause of bacterial pneumonia. Both patients recovered, he added.
He said investigators have not pinpointed the cause of the other cases
including the 2 deaths, but were narrowing down the possible culprits.
DeFraites noted that the cases were spread out over time and that the
troops involved were in different places and in different military
units. "There's no evidence of any other kind of individual relationship
of one case to another to suggest that it could be person-to-person
spread," DeFraites said. "It does seem to be sporadic in nature," he added.
Asked whether any biological weapon agent could be involved, DeFraites said
there have been "no positive findings of any anthrax or smallpox or any
other biological weapon. So, yes, I'm pretty close to ruling it out." He
added that investigators have looked for the bacteria that causes
Legionnaires' disease and the virus that causes SARS, and neither appears
to be playing a role.
DeFraites said possible noninfectious causes being considered include
environmental conditions such as dust. "We think we're well on our way to
understanding what's going on here," he added, without offering a theory.
He said autopsy results for the 2 dead soldiers should be completed within
10 days.
DeFraites said the number of pneumonia cases statistically is "about the
amount that one might expect" considering the number of troops
deployed. He also said that in the 5 years ending in 2002, 17 Army
soldiers died from complications of pneumonia.

[A transcript of the news conference held at the Pentagon on 5 Aug 2003 can
be found at
<http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/2003/tr20030805-0523.html>. At this
point, without more information, this thread will be suspended. There is
no direct evidence to link the 13 cases of respiratory illness (those not
diagnosed as pneumococcal in origin were spread fairly equally over 4
months and included cases outside of Iraq, as noted in the news
conference). - Mod. LL]
[The above report is an excellent overview of the investigations to
date. According to the information available to date there have been
approximately 100 cases of "pneumonia" occurring in military personnel
stationed overseas, predominantly in the Middle East. There have been 15
cases of serious pneumonia with severe respiratory insufficiency leading to
respiratory assistance (patients are placed on respirators) and 2 deaths
among these more serious cases. Of these 15 serious cases, 2 had a common
pneumonia-causing bacteria isolated as the etiologic agent. Given the
available data, there does not seem to be either temporal or geographic
clustering of cases, and the general number of 100 cases occurring in a 4
month period is not above that which is normally seen in these individuals
("the background rate"). Another newswire mentioned that a retrospective
look at the pneumonia rate during the 1991 military deployment to the
Mid-East was also underway. Until further information becomes available
suggesting otherwise, it is very difficult to use the word "outbreak" to
describe the above observation on the respiratory illnesses reported. -
