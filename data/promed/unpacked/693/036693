Seal virus toll reaches 1000
-----------------------------
A deadly virus has killed around one third of the seal population off
the Norfolk coast.
Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) has killed about 1000 animals, said
Mike Hogg, Chief Inspector with the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) on Wed 18 Sep 2002.
Infected seals found alive are being kept in long-term quarantine at
the RSPCA's animal hospital at East Winch near King's Lynn in
Norfolk. So far more than 100 have been taken there and about 40 have
been saved. "We are looking at next spring before they will be able
to be released back into the wild," Mr Hogg said.
RSPCA inspector Mark Thompson spent Wednesday looking for live seals
on North Norfolk beaches. All he found was dead ones brought in by
the tide. "At the moment we are getting a lot more dead adults come
up on the beach."
"Whether they are dying out at sea and being washed in we are not
sure, but they don't seem to be coming up onto the beach alive to be
taken to the hospital at East Winch."
The last 1998 outbreak of the virus claimed an estimated 1500 seals
off the north Norfolk coast. There is no known treatment for the
virus, and no way of preventing it.

predominantly Lincolnshire, Suffolk, Northumberland and the East
Riding of Yorkshire. 67 animals have been sent for post-mortem
examination, to date 26 of these have been confirmed PDV cases.
Further test results are awaited. All but one of the positive cases
have been from the Wash area, the one exception was confirmed in a
common seal from Essex. There have now been 95 reported dead seals
around Scotland (13 common seals, 17 grey seals, 65 species
undetermined). 8 post-mortems have been carried out in Scotland and 2
