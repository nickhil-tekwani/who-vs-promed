Nova Scotia to begin mumps immunization for health-care workers
---------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is starting a mumps immunization program for health-care
workers as an outbreak of the virus in the province climbed in the last
week [6-12 May 2007] by 19 confirmed cases to 222 on Fri [11 May 2007].
The immunization program will begin as early as next week with roughly 40
000 doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine being made available
to health-care workers. A week ago [6 May 2007], there were 203 confirmed
cases of the virus in Nova Scotia.
Dr. Shelly Sarwal, the province's medical officer of health, said the
vaccination program will help the maintain health services in the
province. "We feel this is an important public health measure," Sarwal
said in a news release. "A vaccination campaign will not stop the
outbreak, but what it will do is help to manage absenteeism in health-care
workers as a result of mumps, and therefore help sustain the health-care
system for Nova Scotians."
Since the beginning of the outbreak in February [2007], 222 cases of mumps
have been reported across Nova Scotia - and the disease is continuing its
track into other provinces. New Brunswick reported on Friday [11 May 2007]
that its case load had jumped to 40, up from 34 a week earlier. Prince
Edward Island remained unchanged at one confirmed case.
Ontario health officials said there are now 8 confirmed cases in the
province, up from 3 a week ago [6 May 2007]. Of those, 6 are university
students in Nova Scotia who recently returned home to Ontario for the
summer. The other 2 cases are adults who had been travelling in the
Atlantic province.
While the number of new cases in the Halifax region is declining,
elsewhere across the province cases were up from last week [6-12 May
2007]. Health officials predicted the decline in the Halifax area as
university students, where the outbreak is believed to have begun,
returned home for the summer. Public health officials said they spoke this
week with their counterparts in the United States and the United Kingdom
about lessons learned from management of mumps outbreaks in those
countries.
Nova Scotia is also looking at an immunization program for the
university-age population. People are being advised to watch for patients
with mumps-like symptoms. These include aches, pains, fever, loss of
appetite and, in about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva
glands that give mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look.
The Nova Scotia outbreak, which began in the 3 week of February [2007], is
the province's 3rd in 2 years. It is by far the largest; the earlier
outbreaks, in 2005, involved 13 and 19 cases respectively. It has been
fuelled by a pool of susceptible young adults. Sarwal has said authorities
believe many of the province's cases were vaccinated with MMR [measles,
mumps, rubella] in childhood, but received only one dose. The one-dose
schedule for the MMR vaccine was adequate to protect many people. If it
had not been, this outbreak would be much larger. But it's now known one
dose doesn't protect everyone and MMR is now given in 2 doses. University
dormitories and crowded student apartments make for easy spread of the
virus among susceptible young adults. When they move home, however, they
spend more time around adults, most of whom would have had mumps in
childhood and would be immune.

Nova Scotian health-care workers to be immunized; 1st case in British
Columbia
---------------------------------------------------------------------
With the number of mumps cases rising in the province, the Nova Scotian
government announced yesterday it will begin immunizing thousands of
health-care workers against the virus as early as next week [14-19 May
2007]. As of yesterday [Fri 11 May 2007], 222 confirmed cases had been
reported in Nova Scotia, up 19 from 203 the previous week. Shelly Sarwal,
the province's medical officer of health, said about 40 000 doses of the
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine are being made available on a
voluntary basis to health-care workers, with the aim of protecting health
services in the province. "Providing this vaccine now to health-care
workers isn't going to do much for the current outbreak," Dr. Sarwal said
in an interview yesterday. "It's for preventing future outbreaks similar
to this and for making sure that our population is properly immunized. The
purpose of this program is to maintain our health-care system and the
staffing within the health-care system," she said. "We do have some
health-care workers who have been diagnosed with the mumps who are off of
work."
About 900 of the province's 30 000-plus health providers have been exposed
to mumps, and currently 130 are off the job, she said. Any worker who has
come into contact with an infected person could potentially be off work
for 2 weeks or more because the incubation period for the virus is 14 to
25 days. "We have to be extra cautious within the health-care system," Dr.
Sarwal added. "I can't take the chance of a health-care worker
transmitting the infection to a patient."
While the number of new cases in the Halifax region is declining,
elsewhere across Nova Scotia cases were up from last week[6-12 May 2007].
The Nova Scotia mumps outbreak began in February [2007], likely among
university-aged students with inadequate immunity to the virus. Cases have
begun springing up elsewhere in Canada, as those exposed to the disease
return to their home provinces. The latest province to join the mumps hit
list is British Columbia (BC), which has one confirmed case reported, said
Perry Kendall, BC's medical officer of health.
As of yesterday [Fri 11 May 2007], New Brunswick had 40 cases, up from 34
a week earlier. Prince Edward Island remained unchanged at one confirmed
case. Manitoba and Saskatchewan report no mumps cases, while Alberta has 3
cases for the year, but they are among unimmunized, international
travellers and unrelated to the Nova Scotia outbreak. In Ontario, health
officials said there are now 8 confirmed cases, up from 3 a week ago [6
May 2007]. Of those, 6 are students who attend university in Nova Scotia
and recently returned home to Ontario for the summer. The other 2 cases
are adults who had been travelling in the Atlantic province.
Symptoms of mumps include aches, pains, fever, loss of appetite and, in
about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva glands that give
mumps patients their characteristic chipmunk-cheek look. Public health
officials said they spoke this week with their counterparts in the United
States and Britain about lessons they have learned from management of
mumps outbreaks.
