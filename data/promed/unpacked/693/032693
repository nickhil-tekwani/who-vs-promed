Government vets have started an investigation into a possible case of
Newcastle disease in East Lothian [map at
<http://www.aberlady.net/myimages/Eastlothianmap2.gif>]. The Scottish
Executive said there was no significant threat to public health from the
affected poultry flock and no suspicion of an avian flu link.
A restriction order has been placed on the premises while laboratory tests
are carried out. If they prove positive, the flock will be culled and
contacts with other farms will be investigated. Restricted zones could also
be set up around the property.
Under the latest outbreak response guidelines from the executive, this
would involve declaring a 1.8 mile [3 km) protection zone and a 6 mile [10
km] surveillance zone around the infected premises.
The last known outbreak of Newcastle disease in the UK was in July 2005,
when a large flock of pheasants was culled near Surrey.
Its symptoms in birds include sneezing, gasping for air, nasal discharge,
coughing, and a greenish, watery diarrhoea. It can lead to sudden death and
an increased death loss in a flock. There is no danger to humans eating
meat from a chicken affected by the disease.
In April this year, the potentially fatal H5N1 strain of bird flu was
confirmed in a dead swan found in Fife. It led to a wild bird risk area
covering 1000 square miles being set up in eastern Scotland around the
discovery site at Cellardyke. Despite reports of large numbers of dead
birds after news of the outbreak, all subsequent tests on carcasses across
the country proved negative. The wild bird risk area was lifted on 1 May.
Newcastle disease is listed as a notifiable disease under Department for
the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs guidelines, meaning a suspected
outbreak has to be reported as soon as possible. A spokesman for the
Scottish Executive said: "At the moment it's just a suspected case of
Newcastle disease. "There is no danger to the general public." Scottish
Executive officials also advised anybody who suspected their animals may
have the disease to report it immediately to the State Veterinary Service.

[According to UK's information to the OIE, prophylactic vaccination of
poultry against NCD is undertaken routinely. It would be interesting to
note if the suspected birds have been vaccinated.
Results of the laboratory investigations are expected soon. - Mod.AS]
