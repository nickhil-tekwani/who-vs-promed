The Santo Domingo Oeste municipality [Dominican Republic] has registered 66 percent of all malaria cases registered in the country so far this year [2018], according to the most recent epidemiological bulletin.

In the week [8-14 Jul 2018], 8 cases were detected confirmed, of which, 7 are indigenous and one imported, this one a 35-year-old Venezuelan man in whom _Plasmodium vivax_ was detected. The indigenous cases come from the transmission focus in the La Ciénaga neighborhood in Santo Domingo Oeste.

During the last 4 weeks, 50 cases have been confirmed, of which 33 reside in the Santo Domingo Oeste municipality, for a total of 190 cases accumulated up to week 28 [week of 8 Jul 2018]. The highest frequency and accumulated incidence rate is registered in the Santo Domingo province.

Malaria is transmitted through the bite of anopheline mosquitoes infected, and cause high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms, and anemia.

The health authorities consider that the resurgence of cases is related to the rains caused by the remnants of the storm Tropical Beryl [9 Jul 2018], which left the most rainfall in the District National, Santo Domingo, and San Cristóbal.

In this regard, it is recommended to strengthen surveillance to detect outbreaks in these 3 territories.

[Autochthonous malaria transmission has been described regularly in the Dominican Republic over the past 15 years. The main explanation is that people with malaria from Haiti visit and work in the Dominican Republic, initiating local transmission. This has also resulted in visitors from North America and Europe returning with malaria from tourist resorts in the Dominican Republic.

The CDC recommends malaria chemoprophylaxis to the province of Santo Domingo (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever-malaria-information-by-country/dominican-republic#seldyfm879). - Mod.EP
