[ProMED-mail has received the following information on laboratory
studies related to the Gansu encephalitis outbreak from a usually
reliable source.]
The early results of the tests are confusing. The lab is discussing
the possible interpretations of these results but is awaiting the
results of convalescent sera for final interpretation.
Of the 20 serum samples tested for IgM/IgG of ECHO and Coxsackie:
12 specimens are positive for Coxsackie,
15 specimens are positive for ECHO.
[therefore some must be coinfections with both ECHO and Coxsackie viruses? -
Mod.MPP/jw]
Of the 8 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from the
children (different from those serum samples collected as indicated
above) in the hospital: a Coxsackie A9 was isolated by cell culture
and sequenced by the National CDC. [Is this a single isolate or did
all 8 CSF samples grow Coxsackie A9 virus? - Mod.MPP]
ELISA tests were carried out for ECHO using H antigen of (B1-B6) as
coating antigen. It has been documented that serum tests of ECHO and
Coxsackie might have some degree of cross-reactivity. Both viruses
belong to the Enterovirus family. Coxsackie A 2,4-7,9,10,12,16 &
B1-6 are known to cause non-bacterial encephalitis [meningitis], as
do ECHO 4,6,9,& 30 viruses.
At present, the thinking in the lab is that there are coinfections of
ECHO and Coxsackie viruses. I personally [our reliable source] am
speculating that this outbreak is most likely due to Coxsackie A9
infection, based on the results of the viral sequencing on the
isolate. Positive results on ELISA testing may be related to
cross-reactivity of ECHO and Coxsackie viruses. Coxsackie virus is
harder to isolate than ECHO virus. An additional interesting finding
is that the National CDC used the PCR method to test the CSF samples,
and all were negative on PCR testing. One wonders if this was a
result of a problem with the primer used.

[While this statement is not an official one, it does come from a
usually reliable source known to ProMED. The bottom line is that
there is truly no Japanese encephalitis (JE) outbreak in Gansu. The
laboratory hard evidence indicates the presence of viruses other than
JE. Involvement of the non-poliomyelitis enteroviruses seems not
surprising. This seems to be the long-awaited answer to the mystery
of the 3-month-old outbreak of suspected viral encephalitis in Gansu.
To make the story complete, we are awaiting further confirmations. -
