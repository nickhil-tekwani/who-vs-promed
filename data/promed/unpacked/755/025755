The Norwegian Veterinary Institute has diagnosed chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a free-ranging reindeer (_Rangifer tarandus_) from the Nordfjella population in South-Norway. CWD is a lethal disease in cervids. The disease is well known in North America; however this is the 1st detection of CWD in Europe. Also, this is the 1st detection of natural infection in reindeer worldwide. This news includes a video with expert interviews.

- The sick female reindeer (_Rangifer tarandus_) was detected in the middle of March 2016 in connection with capture for GPS-collaring using helicopter performed by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA). It died, and the carcass was submitted to the Norwegian Veterinary Institute in Oslo for necropsy and laboratory examinations. It was an adult animal, says wildlife pathologist Turid Vikoren at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute, who performed the necropsy.

The body condition of the reindeer was below medium, but it had still some adipose tissue left. In cervids older than 18 months, we routinely collect sample of the brain for CWD examination as part of the national surveillance program for CWD, and that was also done in this reindeer, Vikoren continues.

The head of the Norwegian Reference Laboratory for animal prion diseases at Norwegian Veterinary Institute, Sylvie Benestad, states that the brain sample from the reindeer was positive for the detection of prions both by the 1st routine test (ELISA-test) and in 2 supplementary tests (Western Blotting, Immunohistochemistry).

The disease
Chronic wasting disease is a contagious neurological disease that attacks the brain of cervids. CWD belongs to a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), in which the infectious agents are known to be prion proteins, a normal protein that misfolds and destroys the brain. The development of the disease is slow, and affected cervids show loss of body condition and altered behaviour. Death is inevitable once clinical disease occurs.

CWD is an endemic disease in North America, in which natural infections occurs in mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_), white-tailed deer (_O. virginianus_), elk (_Cervus elaphus nelsoni_) og moose (_Alces alces shirasi_). The reindeer from Norway represents the 1st detection of CWD in Europe. Also, this is the 1st detection of a natural infection in reindeer worldwide.

The Norwegian Veterinary Institute will take the initiative to follow-up surveys of this disease in the Norwegian wild reindeer populations.

[It was only a matter time before this disease slipped the bounds of cervids in the USA. One does have to wonder how it got into reindeer, but global trade of animals and products can move disease.

"Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a transmissible neurological disease of deer and elk that produces small lesions in brains of infected animals. It is characterized by loss of body condition, behavioral abnormalities and death. CWD is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), and is similar to mad cow disease in cattle and scrapie in sheep.

Infectious agents of CWD are neither bacteria nor viruses, but are hypothesized to be prions. Prions are infectious proteins without associated nucleic acids.

Although CWD is a contagious fatal disease among deer and elk, research suggests that humans, cattle and other domestic livestock are resistant to natural transmission. While the possibility of human infection remains a concern, it is important to note there have been no verified cases of humans contracting CWD.

CWD can reduce the growth and size of wild deer and elk populations in areas where the prevalence is high, and is of increasing concern for wildlife managers across North America. The disease was long thought to be limited in the wild to a relatively small endemic area in northeastern Colorado, southeastern Wyoming and southwestern Nebraska, but has recently been found in several new areas across the North American continent. The disease also has been diagnosed in commercial game farms in several states and provinces." ...and now in Norway.
