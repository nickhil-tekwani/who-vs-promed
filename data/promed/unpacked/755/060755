Scientists reveal Schmallenberg virus study findings
----------------------------------------------------
Scientists are one step closer to understanding how the Schmallenberg virus works, potentially paving the way for the development of a new vaccine or novel control strategy.

Key findings from a study of the disease carried out by the University of Glasgow comes at a time when the government is under growing pressure to develop a suitable vaccine following reported losses from the disease of up to 50 percent in some early lambing flocks.

By synthesising and changing the Schmallenberg genome, researchers from the MRC Centre for Virus Research at Glasgow University discovered that the virus (SBV) prefers to attack neuron cells, explaining why it infects and damages the brain.

This results in muscular defects, such as abnormally flexed legs, often seen in stillborn animals when the virus is transmitted from an infected mother to her offspring.

Recent work, led by Alain Kohl at Glasgow University and Esther Schettler, also gave the 1st insight into how infected midges respond to viruses such as SBV.

These insects control the viral infection by mounting a complex immune response that ensures they are not adversely affected by the virus. This work may help inform the development of novel control strategies that target the insect rather than the animal.

Abstract:
"Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is an emerging orthobunyavirus of ruminants associated with outbreaks of congenital malformations in aborted and stillborn animals. Since its discovery in November 2011, SBV has spread very rapidly to many European countries. Here, we developed molecular and serological tools, and an experimental in vivo model as a platform to study SBV pathogenesis, tropism and virus-host cell interactions.

Using a synthetic biology approach, we developed a reverse genetics system for the rapid rescue and genetic manipulation of SBV. We showed that SBV has a wide tropism in cell culture and 'synthetic' SBV replicates in vitro as efficiently as wild type virus. We developed an experimental mouse model to study SBV infection and showed that this virus replicates abundantly in neurons where it causes cerebral malacia and vacuolation of the cerebral cortex. These virus-induced acute lesions are useful in understanding the progression from vacuolation to porencephaly and extensive tissue destruction, often observed in aborted lambs and calves in naturally occurring Schmallenberg cases. Indeed, we detected high levels of SBV antigens in the neurons of the gray matter of brain and spinal cord of naturally affected lambs and calves, suggesting that muscular hypoplasia observed in SBV-infected lambs is mostly secondary to central nervous system damage. Finally, we investigated the molecular determinants of SBV virulence. Interestingly, we found a biological SBV clone that after passage in cell culture displays increased virulence in mice. We also found that a SBV deletion mutant of the non-structural NSs protein (SBVDNSs) is less virulent in mice than wild type SBV. Attenuation of SBV virulence depends on the inability of SBVDNSs to block IFN synthesis in virus infected cells. In conclusion, this work provides a useful experimental framework to study the biology and pathogenesis of SBV".

Schmallenberg virus 'costing farms thousands'
---------------------------------------------
1st indications of the full impact of Schmallenberg disease are starting to emerge, with some sheep flocks reporting up to 50 percent lamb losses, costing their businesses thousands of pounds.

Industry organisations are worried the impact of the disease could be worse than initially expected for some producers, with others describing the virus as worse than Bluetongue.

The government is under pressure to approve a vaccine. And while the chief veterinary officer for England, Nigel Gibbens, has described the disease as "low impact," producers are insistent it is not the case at farm level.

Carroll Barber, breed secretary for the Charollais Sheep Society, said it was the worst disease the society had experienced.

"We have had reports from 60 flocks experiencing substantial losses from 20 up to 50 percent. The losses have been widespread from as far north as North Yorkshire down to Lincolnshire, Devon, Cornwall and across into south Wales."

Ms Barber said she was "frustrated" by Mr Gibbens' comments and added she was worried the disease might be the final straw for some producers.

"We've had quite a few members say if a vaccine is not available soon, they will either quit sheep or not breed next season. They are not prepared to go through this again. This is not a low-impact disease and is far worse than Bluetongue."

Speaking to Farmers Weekly, Oxfordshire sheep producer Tony Good said he had lost 300 lambs (17 percent) in total as well as 24 ewes, which he estimated had cost him about BP 22 000 [USD 35 486].

"We have had horrendous problems. It has been truly demoralising for our team. Lambing ewes containing a number of well-grown but deformed lambs resulted in 24 ewes dying," he said.

Reports suggest well-known early lambing sheep breeds such as the Poll Dorset and Charollais have been badly affected.

Losses have also been reported in suckler herds.

Vet Maarten Boers, from The Livestock Partnership, said he had seen higher than normal empty rates in suckler cows and of those empty animals, more than 90 percent tested positive for Schmallenberg antibodies. "One herd of 1000 cows had 200 empty. They were vaccinated for leptospirosis and BVD and I suspect that Schmallenberg had hit bull fertility."

The National Sheep Association along with other industry organisations such as the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, NFU and National Beef Association are now in talks about pulling together an industry-wide survey to assess the impact of the disease.

Phil Stocker chief executive of the NSA said: "We are still in the talking phase and beginning to pull together some questions.

"We hope to have a survey available to assess the impact in the next couple of months."

Views from the farms:

1. Matt Holmes, near Exeter, Devon
- Poll Dorset ewes
- Tupped July
- Lambing November/December
- 20 percent loss

Matt Holmes has witnessed lamb losses in his stepfather's flock as a result of Schmallenberg.
Out of a 70-ewe batch that lambed last month, 14 of the ewes gave birth to deformed lambs.
Ewes on the farm were scanned in early summer with 70 showing barren, which were consequently put back with the tup in July.
"It's these ewes that have been infected with the disease, as the flock lambing in September was fine," he said.
Mr Holmes reckons the disease has cost the farm at least BP 1800 [USD 2900] from the lamb losses alone.

2. Robert Hole, Sherbourne, Dorset
- 450 Poll Dorset ewes
- Tupped July
- Lambing October/November
- 35 percent loss

Out of 130 ewes put to the tup, Robert Hole said only 65 were in lamb. Tests indicated Schmallenberg virus as the problem with ram fertility also thought to be affected due to the disease.
Out of the 65 ewes that did lamb, 35 percent of lambs were lost due to Schmallenberg, with test results confirming virus exposure.
Mr Hole said: "It's been soul destroying. Once you've seen deformities, you know you've got it and it's just horrible. The biggest shock was when we scanned the batch of 130 ewes at the start of September and half of the ewes were empty. I'm just glad it wasn't the main lambing flock which lambed in September and were all fine," he said.
Most lambs were born at full term with a healthy twin often born alongside a deformed lamb.
"We also had ewes that had been scanned as carrying twins, but were only carrying a single and then passed a very messy afterbirth," he said.

3. David Smith, Lincolnshire
- 70 Hampshire Down ewes
- Sponged 10 ewes to lamb start of December
- 60 ewes lambing March
- 80 percent loss (from the 10 ewes)

David Smith has seen high losses in a small number of ewes on his farm in Lincolnshire. 10 ewes were sponged [sponges including progestagens inserted intravaginally to induce or synchronize estrus], 2 of which reabsorbed [the fetus] and 8 ewes scanned in lamb with 16 lambs in total.

"Out of 16 lambs we've had 12 Schmallenberg lambs born, 3 normal lambs and one lamb which will be fattened and not kept for breeding.

"It has been depressing to say the least. When the ewes were going into labour we were wondering what the hell we were going to get. We were pulling things out that were looking like aliens."

4. Nick Hart, Herefordshire
- 38 Charollais ewes lambing in December and 80 in March
- Tupped July
- 30 percent loss and one ewe

Retired vet and farmer Nick Hart believes Schmallenberg virus passed through his farm in mid-August when his early lambing ewes were 20-50 days pregnant.

Mr Hart lambed 38 ewes in December and has got 45 lambs on the ground.

"We have lost 30 percent of lambs including lambs that haven't come out. I have never seen anything like it."

Mr Hart stressed the importance of having a vaccine.

"Having a vaccine is a big deal. We blood tested 5 ewes and 2 had not been exposed. Next year that means there could be some sheep not exposed, so if it over-winters we will be in the same boat."

Affected federal states are North Rhine-Westphalia (272 cattle, 273 sheep, 13 goat holdings), Lower Saxony (226 cattle, 143 sheep, 6 goat holdings), Hesse (124 cattle, 137 sheep holdings, 9 goat holdings), Schleswig-Holstein (111 cattle, 107 sheep holdings, 1 goat holding), Rhineland-Palatinate (1 Bison holding, 50 cattle, 43 sheep, 5 goat holdings), Baden-Wuerttemberg (43 cattle, 35 sheep, 6 goat holdings), Brandenburg (24 cattle, 21 sheep holdings), Thuringia (28 cattle, 42 sheep, 2 goat holdings), Saxony-Anhalt (19 cattle, 23 sheep, 2 goat holdings), Hamburg (2 cattle, 6 sheep holdings), Bavaria (163 cattle, 37 sheep holdings, 1 goat holding), Saxony (11 cattle holdings, 39 sheep holdings), Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (13 cattle, 11 sheep holdings, 1 goat holding), Saarland (1 cattle holding, 4 sheep, 2 goat holdings) and Berlin (1 sheep holding).

The Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Denmark , Switzerland, Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Czech Republic have also reported cases of Schmallenberg virus. Austria, Poland, Sweden and Finland detected antibodies in cattle and sheep and goats respevtively. Cattle exported from Austria to Russia also showed SBV-antibodies. In Norway the virus has been detected in biting midges.

A large proportion of Swedish herds have been exposed to infection
-----------------------------------------------------
Schmallenberg virus (SBV), which is spread by midges, has become widely spread in Sweden within a few months. Surveillance Results during autumn 2012 and Map of results based upon bulk milk survey are available at http://tinyurl.com/afwtgdx.

A 1st bulk milk screening was done in May-June 2012, when only one positive herd, located in Blekinge, was detected. In a 2nd bulk milk screening conducted in November [2012], 75 percent of the surveyed herds were found positive for antibodies. The massive spread of SBV in Sweden has occurred between June / July and October 2012.

To evaluate the effects of the virus, 2 types of studies are undertaken:

1. Analysis of fetuses and stillborn animals, to closely study the types of injuries that can be attributed to SBV. There are indications that infection can cause symptoms beyond just malformed offspring. This collection will continue until enough materials are obtained, in order to get a clear picture. This sampling is not done to confirm the SBV in each herd, but to give an idea of the impact the disease has had on fetal development.

2. Several questionnaires are to be distributed to owners, to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the effects of infection on herd level.

[Subsequent to the termination of SBV's vector season of 2012, it remains to be seen what impact the new SBV infections, acquired during the season, will have upon the progeny of domestic and wild ruminants due to be born in the (18) infected European countries during the 1st half of 2013. Obtaining full and accurate data from the farming industry is a demanding task -- conditional for the production of a reliable economical assessment. The data from UK and Sweden, included in items 2 and 4 above, demonstrate the complexity of the issue.

For further reading, subscribers are referred to the presentations addressed at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/schmallenberg_virus/scientific_seminar_en.htm and to the analysis, by EFSA, of SBV epidemiological data (Nov 2012), reviewed in posting 20121124.1422556.
