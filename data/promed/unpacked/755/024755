Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Newport infections linked to red onions
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on 24 Jul 2020, an additional 184 ill people have been reported in this outbreak, including 37 from 11 new states: Alaska, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas.

As of 29 Jul 2020, a total of 396 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport have been reported from 34 states.

Total / 396

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 19 Jun 2020 to 12 Jul 2020. Ill people range in age from less than 1 to 102 years, with a median age of 39; 52% of ill people are female. Of 236 ill people with information available, 59 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Whole genome sequencing analysis of 48 isolates from ill people did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antibacterial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is underway.

Whole genome sequencing analysis shows that an outbreak of _S._ Newport infections in Canada is related genetically to this outbreak in the USA. This means that people in both of these outbreaks likely share a common source of infection.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
On 10 Jul 2020, CDC PulseNet identified an outbreak of 13 _Salmonella_ Newport infections in 3 states. Since being identified, the outbreak has rapidly grown to a total of 396 infections in 34 states. State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before their illness started.

Many ill people were identified as part of illness clusters. An illness cluster is defined as 2 or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating at the same restaurant location, attending a common event, or shopping at the same location of a grocery store in the week before becoming ill. Investigating illness clusters can provide critical clues about the source of an outbreak. If several unrelated ill people ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there. A total of 22 illness clusters have been identified in 7 states. Information from these clusters shows that many ill people ate red onions. The traceback information collected from these illness clusters identified Thomson International, Inc. of Bakersfield, CA as a likely source of red onions. Due to the way onions are grown and harvested, other onion types, such as white, yellow or sweet, may also be contaminated. Additional traceback is ongoing to determine if other onions are linked to the outbreak.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is investigating an outbreak of _S._ Newport infections, which is related by whole genome sequencing to this outbreak in the USA. On 30 Jul 2020, Public Health Agency of Canada's outbreak investigation identified USA red onions as a likely source of their outbreak.

Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, serve, or sell any onions from Thomson International, Inc. of Bakersfield, CA.

The CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[It now appears in this expanding ongoing outbreak that red onions are the vehicle for transmission of the salmonellosis. The contamination of the produce may have been in the field or during or after harvesting.

Anecdotally, here in northwest Wisconsin where I work as an infectious diseases physician, we currently have 3 inpatients with salmonellosis, 2 of whom had bacteremia. The strains are to be evaluated and sent to the CDC but may well be part of this growing outbreak. - Mod.LL
