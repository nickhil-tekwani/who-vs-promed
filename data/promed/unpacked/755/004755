The Department of Health is today [Mon 5 Mar 2007] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of the disease thought to
be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Fri 2 Mar 2007
------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 112
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 46
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 158
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 7
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 165
(The next table will be published on Mon 2 Apr 2007).
Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 5 Feb 2007, the
total number of deaths from definite vCJD remains unchanged for a 2nd month
and stands at 158. Likewise the overall total number of definite or
probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) is unchanged.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is
in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by
20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006 and so
far none in 2007.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK since 1995
------------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 2 Mar 2007, in the UK in the year 2007, so far there have been 15
referrals, 1 death from sporadic CJD, 1 death from iatrogenic CJD, and none
from familial CJD, variant CJD, or GSS.
During the period from 1995, when vCJD was 1st diagnosed, up to the
present, there have been 955 deaths from all forms of CJD including the 158
deaths attributable to definite or probable vCJD. [These data are

[2] 25 nm TSE-associated particles

Yale MD makes leap in mad cow research
--------------------------------------
Though challenging the accepted theory of the causes of mad cow disease may
seem like madness itself, a team of researchers from the Yale School of
Medicine has announced potentially ground-breaking findings concerning the
origins of the disease.
Yale School of Medicine professor Dr Laura Manuelidis, the head of
neuropathology at the school, and her team of researchers recently
published a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
[see below] asserting that a virus, rather than prion proteins, is the
cause of mad cow disease in animals and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in
humans. These spongiform encephalopathies of the brain have traditionally
been thought to be caused by prions, abnormal proteins that convert healthy
proteins to the disease state. But the new study suggests prions may simply
be part of the late stage of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
[TSE] that affect the brains and nervous systems of victims, including
sheep, deer and humans. The term "spongiform" comes from the fact that the
infection causes neurons to die, leaving tiny holes in the brain, so that
it eventually resembles a sponge. Humans afflicted with the incurable
degenerative disease show memory and personality changes and sometimes
problems with movement. Mad cow, the cattle version of the disease, has
achieved infamy because the infectious agent in cows appears to be the
cause of vCJD, a variant form of CJD in humans.
The research team's goal was to try to identify viral particles in infected
cells. They infected cell lines with either scrapie (a sheep disease
related to mad cow) or CJD agents and found virus-like particles that did
not contain prion protein. An abundance of these particles was related to
high levels of infectivity, which was not true of the presence of prion
proteins.
"People hypothesize that prion proteins are infectious, but they're
probably part of the disease, not the infectious agent itself," Manuelidis
said.
The virus-like particles had been found by other researchers but were
largely ignored. They were 1st identified in 1968 in synaptic regions of
scrapie-infected brain and later found in many other animals with different
TSEs. But Manuelidis said that researchers apparently forgot about them
once the prion hypothesis became dominant.
"I had totally forgotten about them, too," she said. "But after we found
the 25-nanometer particles, I went home and remembered I've seen these
before. I went back to the old journals from the '70s and there they were."
Manuelidis said part of the reason for the neglect of the virus-like
particles is that in previous studies, they were always found in
degenerating brain tissue, so it was impossible for scientists to draw
accurate conclusions about them. What allowed her to collect relevant
experimental data was the fact that her team observed the particles in
highly infectious tissue culture cells.
"We saw them in tissue culture cells that weren't degenerating," she said.
"The infected cells were as healthy as the uninfected cells that had no
25-nm virus-like particles."
The study is a work in progress, and the researchers want to conduct more
experiments with tissue cultures to gather further evidence and learn more
about the particles. Manuelidis said that since it is easier to work with a
simplified cell system than with infected animals whose brains are
degenerating, tissue culture experiments can be used to identify essential
features of the infectious agent and clarify the way in which the particles
invade cells. Her team will use the tissue cultures to purify the
virus-like particles more completely. "In the future, we will try to
isolate the particles from tissue cultures and characterize what is in
them," she said.
The team's specific viral particle hypothesis suggests new avenues for
treatment and vaccines, Manuelidis said. If they are successful in rapidly
measuring infectivity in tissue culture, they will be able to gain better
understanding of possible remedies. She even pointed out that prion
proteins, while not the infectious agent, are probably essential receptors
for replication and growth of the TSE virus. "The infectious agent needs
prion proteins to grow," Manuelidis said. "This means targeting the prion
protein may also be a useful therapeutic step."
Researchers at other universities pointed out that the Yale study does not
definitely prove the viral hypothesis, nor does it fully disprove the prion
hypothesis.
Tricia Serio, an assistant professor of molecular biology, cell biology and
biochemistry at Brown University, said that while the research is
intriguing, the viral hypothesis still needs to be directly proven. She
also pointed out that there are many examples of protein-based phenotypes,
like the one described in the prion hypothesis.
"For example, we study prions in yeast, and work from the Weissman, King,
Liebman, Saupe and Wickner labs has shown that the transfer of recombinant
protein produced in bacteria is sufficient to induce a heritable phenotype
in yeast," she said. "This is direct proof of a prion mechanism for the
yeast traits."
Surachai Supattapone, associate professor of biochemistry and medicine at
Dartmouth University, said that the next challenge for Dr Manuelidis group
will be to isolate and identify a specific virus that can cause
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. He said, however, that there is
still work ahead for prion protein researchers.
"Proponents of the "protein only" hypothesis -- which is also not proven --
will need to demonstrate that purified prion proteins alone can fulfill
Koch's postulates [a set of criteria for establishing a causal
relationship]" he said.

[The research referred to in the above report is described in: L
Manuelidis, Z-X Yu, N Banquero, B Mullins. Cells infected with scrapie and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agents produce intracellular 25-nm virus-like
particles. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2007; 104(6): 1965-70.
The abstract reads: "We had repeatedly found 25-nm-diameter virus-like
particles in highly infectious brain fractions with little prion protein
(PrP), and therefore we searched for similar virus-like particles in situ
in infected cell lines with high titers. Neuroblastoma cells infected with
the 22L strain of scrapie as well as hypothalamic GT cells infected with
the FU Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent, but not parallel mock controls,
displayed dense 25-nm virus-like particles in orthogonal arrays. These
particles had no relation to abnormal PrP amyloid in situ, nor were they
labeled by PrP antibodies that faithfully recognized rough endoplasmic
reticulum membranes and amyloid fibrils, the predicted sites of normal and
pathological intracellular PrP. Additionally, phorbol ester stimulated the
production of abnormal PrP gel bands by>5-fold in infected N2a22L cells,
yet this did not increase either the number of virus-like arrays or the
infectious titer of these cells. Thus, the 25-nm infection-associated
particles could not be prions. Synaptic differentiation and
neurodegeneration, as well as retroviruses that populate the rough
endoplasmic reticulum of neuroblastoma cells, were not required for
particle production. The 25-nm particle arrays in cultured cells strongly
resembled those 1st described in 1968 in synaptic regions of
scrapie-infected brain and subsequently identified in many natural and
experimental TSEs. The high infectivity of comparable, isolated virus-like
particles that show no intrinsic PrP by antibody labeling, combined with
their loss of infectivity when nucleic acid-protein complexes are
disrupted, make it likely that these 25-nm particles are the causal TSE
virions that induce late-stage PrP brain pathology."
ProMED-mail thanks Ginger Switzer for forwarding the same information. The
immediate priority will be to isolate and characterize these putative virus
particles observed in association with TREs in order to establish their
precise role in the disease process. - Mod.CP]

Portugal: 2nd case of human form of mad cow disease suspected
-------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities stated on Wed 21 Feb 2007 that they believe they have
detected Portugal's 2nd case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a
fatal brain disorder believed to be contracted by eating meat contaminated
with mad cow disease.
Laboratory tests indicated a young woman had contracted the human form of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, the General
Health Directorate said in a brief statement posted on its website.
Officials said the disease could be proved beyond doubt only after death.
Portugal detected its 1st case of the disease in humans in June 2005. The
previous year, the European Union lifted a 6 year ban on Portuguese beef
exports due to mad cow disease, saying improved inspections were checking
its spread.
Portugal and Britain were the only EU countries to have their beef and beef
product exports banned by the EU. More than 500 cases of mad cow disease
[in cattle] were found on Portuguese farms during a health scare that
gripped Europe through the 1990s.
More than 160 people in Europe and North America, the vast majority of them
in Britain, are known to have contracted the human form of the disease.

[4] Blood transfusion risk prediction

Blood transfusion and spread of vCJD
------------------------------------
A paper concerning: "Blood transfusion and spread of vCJD," by Klaus Dietz
and 8 others, published in EID, 13, no. 1 online, comprises a mathematical
analysis of the consequences of blood transfusion on the spread of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The abstract and introduction to the
paper are reproduced below to present the conclusions of these authors.
Abstract and introduction
-------------------------
vCJD may be transmissible by blood. To prevent secondary transmission
through blood components, several countries have started to exclude as
donors persons who have received a blood transfusion. We investigated the
effectiveness of this measure by using a dynamic age-structured model. It
is the 1st such model based on epidemiologic data: 1) blood donor
activities, 2) a case-control study on CJD, 3) age distribution of
recipients, and 4) death of recipients of blood transfusions. The model
predicts that an infection like vCJD, which has been introduced into the
population by the alimentary route, could not become endemic by transfusion
alone and that only <1 per cent of cases would be avoided by excluding from
blood donation those persons who have received a transfusion.
Recent studies of vCJD indicate that this disease is transmissible by
blood. One case of probable transfusion-transmitted vCJD infection has been
reported, and one case of subclinical infection has been detected. On 9 Feb
2007, a 3rd case was announced by the UK Health Protection Agency
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press_releases/2006/060209_cjd.htm>).

Each of the 3 patients had received a blood transfusion from a donor who
subsequently developed clinical vCJD, which indicates that transfusion
caused the infection. However, a policy to exclude potential donors who had
received a transfusion would not have prevented at least the 1st 2 cases,
because the corresponding donors had not received any blood transfusion.
Diagnostic tools to detect prions in blood are under development, but no
routine test for the presence of the infectious agents of vCJD is
available. Therefore, the questions arise as to whether an infection like
vCJD could become endemic through blood donation alone and to what extent
exclusion of potential donors with a history of transfusion would influence
the transmission of such an infection (i.e., how many deaths due to the
infection could be prevented?). The mathematical model presented in this
paper is the 1st to address these questions on the basis of epidemiologic
data and realistic and epidemiologically justified assumptions.
