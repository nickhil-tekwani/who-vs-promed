Potosi authorities reported that more than 87 000 head of livestock,
specifically llamas, are currently ill, as a consequence of snowfalls
that occurred in the beginning of July [2011], which also affected
food sources for these animals.

A report issued by Potosi authorities indicated that until 15 Jul
2911, the most frequently detected disease in llamas was pneumonia, a
condition that according to its characteristics leads animals to lose
weight.

For this reason, the document recommends that institutions willing to
cooperate send barley, alfalfa, bran, mineral salts, tonics, and
antibiotics to be used in affected animals. It was also reported that
technical assistance will be available for farmers for the next 15 to
30 days.

Mr William Achu, responsible officer of the Risk Management Unit of
Potosi Provincial Government, reported that in 9 south western
municipalities affected by recent snowstorms, there are 1877 families
of llama raising farmers whose animals are at risk of dying.

"In a time period from 10 to 15 days, 87 291 head of livestock will be
at risk of dying, if we do not take appropriate care. So we are about
to send grain and vitamins to affected areas, and we are currently
requesting these resources at the Provincial and Central Government
levels," said Mr Achu.

According to data from the animal registry held by the National
Service for Agriculture Sanitation and Food Safety (SENASAG, according
to its initials in Spanish) in Potosi, 200 454 llamas are registered
in the 9 municipalities affected by the recent snowstorms, and 40 per
cent of these animals are at risk.

The Potosi Government, as a 1st measure, sent 2 truckloads of corn
husk and 1 of alfalfa; but this is not enough for taking care of all
animals affected, according to Mr Daniel Berna, mayor of San Pablo de
Lipez community. For this reason the regional government is currently
arranging the delivery of 8 truckloads of different types of grain.

"According to people in the affected communities, corn husk is not an
adequate food for llamas, so we are purchasing what they have
suggested, that is, wheat bran and barley," said the local Government
officer.

The report added that in Colcha K municipality, there are 487 families
and 16 790 animals affected by extremely low temperature; this
represents 21.25 per cent of the total llama population.

In San Agustin municipality, there are 335 families and 12 320 llamas
also affected because of extremely low temperature.

In San Pablo de Lipez municipality there are 639 families and 48 941
animals at risk because of extremely low temperature, and the
corresponding figures for San Antonio de Esmoruco municipality are 416
families and 9 240 llamas at risk for dying. Other municipalities did
not report important figures of affected families or animals.

[This is an extremely serious situation for the animals and likely for
the people who raise them. It appears the families may be in difficult
times for feeding themselves as well their animals and likely the
animals are their livelihood. Loss of this many animals would be a
substantial impact on the individual families as well as the overall
economy of the region.

Sadly, the article is short on diagnostics for us to know which
organism is causing the pneumonia. Aside from a food shortage and
brutally cold temperaturesâ€š there is no mention of offering to
assist with treatment of these animals.

Llamas, alpacas, and camels are all in the camelidae family. It is
notable that these have a 3 chambered stomach instead of a 4 chambered
stomach as other ruminants do, yet they are essentially ruminants. For
