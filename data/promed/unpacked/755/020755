Phase I Malaria DNA Vaccine Trial Yields First Data In Man
Sponsored by Vical and Pasteur Merieux Connaught (Rhone-Poulenc Group)
[Excerpted by Mod.JW]
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- April 30, 1998-- Physicians conducting the first human
trial of a DNA vaccine against malaria reported that the vaccine was well
tolerated and safe, and that preliminary analysis of specimens from trial
participants suggested a good cellular immune response with features they
believe may be important in preventing the disease. Initial data were
presented at the Third National Symposium on Basic Aspects of Vaccines by
Capt. Stephen L. Hoffman, M.D., of the U.S. Naval Medical Research
Institute, whose scientific team conducted the trial.
The Phase I clinical trial was designed to test the safety of an
experimental naked DNA vaccine against the parasite that causes malaria and
to evaluate immune responses in approximately 20 human volunteers. The
trial was sponsored by Vical Inc. (NASDAQ:VICL - news) and Pasteur Merieux
Connaught (Rhone-Poulenc Group) under their Research, Collaboration and
License Agreement. "We are pleased with the vaccine's safety profile and
acceptability to volunteers," said Dr. Hoffman, "and encouraged that
preliminary studies of the immunological responses provide support for
moving to the next phase of clinical testing which may include assessment
of protective efficacy against malaria."
Malaria is a severe infectious disease characterized by fever, headache and
joint pain, and if untreated, it can lead to death. Infection normally
occurs when the parasite enters a victim's bloodstream during a mosquito
bite. An estimated 300 million people are affected by malaria worldwide,
resulting in more than 1 million deaths each year. Some 80 percent of
malaria cases occur in Africa, with the remainder generally confined to
regions of Asia and Latin America. Protection against malaria would benefit
indigenous populations, travelers to malaria-endemic regions, and military
forces serving in affected areas. Dr. Hoffman noted, "malaria vaccine
development is the number-one-ranked Department of Defense medical
research, infectious disease, science and technology objective, because
malaria has been responsible for enormous numbers of casualties during
military campaigns."
