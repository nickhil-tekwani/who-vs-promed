Concerning David Dassey's comment on the Australian typhoid fever outbreak,
we would like to share similar experience in 2 recent outbreaks of typhoid
fever in France. During 2 foodborne outbreaks in 1997 (16 cases of typhoid
fever ) and 1998 (27 cases of typhoid fever including 15 confirmed cases
with blood or stool cultures), we also observed "an array of early
gastrointestinal symptoms".
In 1998, 90% of 147 guests reported early
diarrhea (onset within 3 days after the incriminated meal for the majority
of cases); 27 persons developed later (range:10-38 days) typhoid fever.
In 1997, 70% of 350 participants presented gastrointestinal symptoms early
after the incriminated meal; typhoid fever later developed in 26 of these
participants and was confirmed in 16 cases. Since few stool cultures (3 in
1998, and none identified in 1997) were performed during the initial
gastroenteritis we cannot exclude that another enteric pathogen was
responsible for these early symptoms. Nevertheless, the resemblance of the
2 French and the Australian outbreak suggests that _S. typhi_ infection
could be responsible for these early symptoms, which are not considered to
be typical of typhoid fever.

[Initially, we were surprised by the 3-4 week incubation period implied by
the first message in this thread. This experience as well as the prior
information supplied by David Dassey help to place the delayed onset of
typhoid fever in perspective. - Mod.ES
