Suspicions about anthrax among sheep in village in Northeastern
Bulgaria: veterinary service director.

Sheep in a northeastern Bulgarian village might be infected with
anthrax. Samples have been taken from the animals, Dr. Yordan Voynov,
director general of the National Veterinary Service, told FOCUS News
Agency. 4 or 5 sheep died. The people who were in contact with the
animals are undergoing treatment. "The Health Care Ministry denies
the anthrax possibility, but although we are not sure that this is a
case of anthrax, we have undertaken all necessary measures and all
animals in the village are being vaccinated," [Voynov] added.

Earlier FOCUS Sliven Radio reported that a 47-year-old man from the
southeastern village of Stefan Karadzhovo was admitted to the
hospital in the southeastern city of Yambol. He has been diagnosed
with the lighter, skin form of anthrax. He said he had slaughtered a
sheep of his, but claimed he had not eaten the meat. The man's farm
has been disinfected, the grazing ground around the village is under
quarantine, and all animals are being vaccinated.

[Anthrax in Bulgaria is truly sporadic. I am tempted to trust Dr.
Voynov's intuition in regard to the deaths in NE Bulgaria. And he is
sensibility using the opportunity to get the livestock in that area
vaccinated. The incident in SE Bulgaria seems to be based not on
confirmation of the sheep death but on the appearance of "typical"
lesions of cutaneous anthrax in the sheep's owner. Again the
veterinary services are getting the local livestock vaccinated. In
either case not a bad action to take. - Mod.MHJ]
