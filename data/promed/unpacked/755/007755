Clarification
-------------
It may be of interest to your readers to clarify a statement in the
ProMED-mail posting of 25 July that the USDA "... is rushing into
production an experimental West Nile vaccine (WNV) ..." While the USDA does
have responsibility for licensing veterinary biologics to ensure safety,
potency, efficacy, and purity, the USDA has no direct involvement in the
production of a WNV vaccine. [The statement referred to by Dr. Walton
appeared in a press report posted as part (3) of "West Nile virus
surveillance - USA (14)," attributed to Dr. William Jeter (see also "West
Nile virus surveillance 2001 - USA (15) 20010804.1532" for the correction
of Dr. Jeter's affiliation, which was given incorrectly in the press
report). - Mod.CP
The USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) reviews license applications
and supporting data and issues licenses for the production of veterinary
biologics, including WNV vaccines. The CVB works closely with other
agencies and biologics manufacturers to expedite review of submitted
materials regarding proposed WNV products. The following is a recent notice
on the issuance of a conditional license for a WNV vaccine: Center for
Veterinary Biologics Notice 01-09 Subject: Issuance of a Conditional
License for West Nile Virus Vaccine, Killed Virus. The Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has issued a conditional United States
Veterinary Biological Product License to American Home Products, Inc.,
Establishment No. 112, Fort Dodge, Iowa, for the manufacture and
distribution of West Nile Virus Vaccine, Killed Virus. A veterinary
biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act must be shown
to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological
product license may be issued. The regulations in 9 CFR Part 102 regarding
the licensing of biological products provide that a conditional veterinary
biological product license may be issued to meet an emergency situation,
limited market, local situation, or special circumstance. The special
circumstance addressed here is the need for a product to aid in the
prevention of disease caused by the West Nile virus in horses.
Conditionally licensed products are required to be pure and safe, and have
a reasonable expectation of efficacy. The conditional license was issued on
the basis that American Home Products, Inc., has demonstrated that the
product has a reasonable expectation of efficacy. No significant safety
concerns have been noted in preliminary results from field safety trials.
APHIS will continue to evaluate potency and efficacy data throughout the
conditional licensure period. The conditional license will expire in one year.
The product is for intramuscular use in horses; 2 doses are required, given
3 to 6 weeks apart. A USDA-APHIS press release on the vaccine can be found at:

inactivated whole virus, sub-unit, live attenuated, genetically engineered,
or whatever? - Mod.CP
