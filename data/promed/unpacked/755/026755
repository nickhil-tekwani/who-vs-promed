7 spotted deer found dead
-------------------------
The outbreak of a mysterious disease killing at least 7 spotted deer in
Orissa's Bhitarkanika National Park has apparently caused panic even as the
worried forest personnel have sent an SOS to the senior officials of the
state forest department.
Bodies of at least 7 spotted deer, including 2 horned male species, had
been sighted by grounds staff between 13 and 21 Sep 2004, official sources
said. Initially, it was feared that the species might have been killed by
poachers who could not carry their prize because of stepped-up patrolling.
However, there were neither external injuries nor strangulation marks, as
often seen in poached animals. After preliminary investigation by forest
officials and veterinary surgeons, the deaths were attributed to some form
of animal disease.

[The spotted deer is the commonest member of the deer family in India. It
is found across the entire country except in the extreme northern regions.
They are mostly seen in large herds of 30 to 50 females with a few stags,
but large herds of bachelors (up to 100) may be seen in areas such as the
grasslands of Corbett National Park. They grow to a height of about 90 cm
at the shoulders and can weigh up to 85 kg. Their life expectancy ranges
from 20 to 30 years. Despite being one of the favourite prey species of
predators such as tigers and leopards, and only giving birth to a single
fawn at a time, their population is quite abundant. Extracted from:

There is not enough evidence presented in the above article to guess at the
cause of death. If you have access to authoritative information, please
