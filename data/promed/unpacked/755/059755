A 2nd case of equine infectious anemia (EIA), also known as swamp fever, has been found in a horse in the UK this month [October 2012].

Defra confirmed today [Fri 19 Oct 2012] that a horse in Devon had been put down (euthanized) after testing positive for swamp fever. The remaining horses on the yard have been put under quarantine and are being investigated by vets.

On 3 Oct 2012, a horse in Cornwall was discovered to have EIA and was put down. "EIA a serious disease, but it is also rare in this country," said Defra's deputy chief veterinary officer, Alick Simmons. "This case was discovered following our investigations into a case of EIA in Cornwall earlier this month [October 2012]. We have no reason to believe this disease is widespread in the UK."

EIA is a virus that attacks a horse's immune system. It is passed by biting insects such as horse flies and can be fatal. There is no cure, so horses confirmed with EIA are put down to prevent the spread of the disease.
