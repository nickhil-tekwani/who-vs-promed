Agence France Presse reports today that officials of the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies say that the epidemic of
hemorrhagic fever [tentatively diagnosed as Rift Valley Fever is "out of
control". The Red Cross puts the epidemic toll at "more than 450",
although members of the Kenyan parliament announced in a press conference
that 5 thousand have died from both the epidemic and starvation.
The Red Cross says the disease can be transmitted through "breathing", as
well as by handling infected animals and mosquito bites.
The Red Cross statement said "We have to establish the magnitude of the
thing and still we are unsure precisely what we are dealing with. We are
sure there is Rift Valley fever, but is that all? We are seeing some
strange phenomena and there may be something else out there."
It called for a helicopter operation to reach inaccessible areas,
vaccination of livestock, and supply of masks, gloves, and disinfectants
for the disposal of corpses.

[We have seen no basis for the truth of the Kenyan parliamentarians' claim
for five thousand human deaths, but if one adds the >450 deaths (which
could be any number >450) to the number of dead from other causes, 5,000
might not be an unreasonable number. During the 1977-78 RVF epidemic in
Egypt, Harry Hoogstral noted that members of his research team developed
antibody titres as a result of merely observing a sick animal being bled
out and butchered, presumably from having been infected through the aerosol
formed from the blood splash. Experimentally, aerosols of RVF virus are
highly infectious for laboratory mice and could be a source of infections
for veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, laboratory workers, and people
slaughtering sick and dying livestock.
There is certainly a most urgent need for more transport and supplies.
Whether putrifying carcasses form a continuing risk is unlikely, other than
regards general public hygiene, but human corpses in the epidemic zone are
being buried promptly by relatives; this has made it difficult for the
field team to obtain tissue samples.
This situation has continued for well more than a month. Rather than state
the obvious, excuse us for pointing out to students everywhere that the
national epidemiologic and medical reactions to this emergency are not what
we would call "classical". The initial official response was slow to
non-existent until the election results were in. We do not know what is
being done now, how many cases have occurred in Somalia, whether RVF virus
arose autochthonously, or even what the Kenyan body counts are. Clearly,
this is a complex microbiological morass. We only know that the laboratory
work at the NIV, Johannesburg, has been first class and that CDC has
confirmed Bob Swanepoel's findings.- Mods.MHJ/CHC
