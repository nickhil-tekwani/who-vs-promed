According to the Bayannur City Health Commission, on 5 Jul 2020, a herdsman in Wengen Town, Wulatezhongqi, Bayannur City [Inner Mongolia], was diagnosed as a case of bubonic plague by the expert team during the consultation in the Wulatezhongqi People's Hospital. Before the onset of the disease, the patient had been active in the plague epidemic area. At present, the patient has been isolated and is being treated in a local hospital and his condition is stable. Party committees and local governments attach great importance to epidemic prevention and control, and relevant prevention and control measures have been implemented.

Experts reminded the general public to strictly follow the "Three nos" and, "Three reports" requirements for the prevention and control of plague, to effectively implement personal protection, and improve self-protection awareness and ability.

1. "Three no's": unauthorized hunting of epidemic animals, non-deprivation of epidemic animals, and unauthorized carrying of epidemic animals and their products out of the epidemic area.

2. "Three reports": marmots and other animals found to be sick (or dead) should be reported, patients with suspected plague should be reported, and patients with high fever and unexplained death should be reported.

3. Maintain good personal hygiene habits, try to avoid going to crowded places, go to a medical institution for medical treatment, or wear a mask in time when the person has fever, cough, or other related symptoms.

4. If you suspect that you have been in contact with the case, you can take the initiative to report to the local disease control department and obtain professional guidance. If you have fever, cough, lymph node pain, hemoptysis, or bleeding, you should see a doctor as soon as possible.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
