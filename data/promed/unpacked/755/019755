Cases of Foot & mouth disease in cattle in the Amur area
-------------------------------------------
According to a report by the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations, 20
head of longhorn cattle were found to be infected with FMD type Asia-1 in
the settlement of Busse, Amur province, 120 kilometers northwest of
Blagoveshchensk [the capital of the Amur oblast or province]. 5 of the
infected animals have already been incinerated. Vaccinations of livestock
and other domestic animals are now under way throughout the region.

[This media report should be supported, or refuted, officially. If
confirmed, details on the type of cattle affected, age, immunity status,
etc. will be helpful.
Recently, outbreaks of FMD, serotype Asia 1, have been confirmed in 2
eastern/central provinces of the People's Republic of China, namely Jiangsu
and Shandong. These provinces are not adjacent to the Russian border,
particularly to the Amur region. In view of the belated reporting, weeks
after the publication of unofficial rumors which -- in retrospect -- were
credible, one cannot help suspecting that the disease might be more
widespread in China than officially reported. In particular, the situation
in pigs is important; pigs are regarded as extremely efficient spreaders of
the FMD virus by aerosols.
In 2004 Russia suffered an outbreak of FMD, serotype O, in dairy cattle in
the Amur region, 15 km from the Chinese border. Subsequently (in September
2004), Russia restricted imports from China.
ProMED-mail's earlier request, in 2004, for information related to rumors
about the presence of FMD in Inner Mongolia (China), remains unanswered.
It is crucial to obtain clear information from China about its animal
disease situation in general, and, at present, particularly regarding FMD
in the northern provinces. Recently China seems to have invested
commendable -- though not yet optimal -- efforts in improving its
transparency. This involved 2 important diseases: avian influenza and FMD.
In view of the approaching Olympic games, further improvement related to a
broad spectrum of epizootics should follow. - Mod.AS]
