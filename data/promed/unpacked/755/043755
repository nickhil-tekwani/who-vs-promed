Brazil confirms 1127 cases with 331 deaths during the period 1 Jul 2017-10 Apr 2018. In the states of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and São Paulo coverage is below the goal.

The Ministry of Health is reinforcing the importance to the population to go to vaccination posts in the new areas of risk in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Bahia. According to the epidemiological bulletin published [Wed 11 Apr 2018] from the information sent by local officials, these 3 states continue with coverage below the goal of 95 percent. Coverage during the current campaign is: Rio de Janeiro at 40.9 percent, Bahia at 55 percent, and São Paulo at 52.4 percent of the target population to be vaccinated. The vaccine is available at the health posts. The high period for the disease continues until May. In total, the campaign in these states is seeking to immunize 23.8 million people.

These data refer to the 77 cities that make up part of the campaign with the fractionated dose [1/5 the normal dose] strategy and the extension to 52 municipalities in São Paulo. These municipalities must continue vaccinating the population with fractionated doses, which guarantees the same protection as the whole dose and extends vaccine coverage to prevent new cases of yellow fever in the country.

Since vaccination continues to be the most important tool to prevent cases arising this coming summer [2018], the entire Brazilian territory will be an area for the vaccination recommendation against yellow fever. This increase was announced by the Ministry of Health in March 2018. It will be carried out gradually and concluded in April 2019. This is a preventive measure that has, as its objective, anticipation of the protection against yellow fever for the entire population in case of an extension of the area of virus circulation. Currently, some states in the northeast and part of the south and southeast are not included in areas recommended for vaccination.

Cases
-----
From 1 Jul 2017-10 Apr 2018, the Ministry of Health has registered 1127 confirmed yellow fever cases. In total, 5052 cases were notified with 2806 now discarded and 1119 still under investigation. Last year [2017], considering the same period of monitoring (July 2016-10 Apr 2017) there were 712 cases with 228 confirmed deaths. The reports of yellow fever continue, since last year [2017], indicating the seasonality of the disease that occurs, mainly, in the summer season. Given this, the period for analysis is considered to be 1 Jul-30 Jun each year.

The vaccine is the only protection against the disease. The Ministry of Health calls the populace to be protected against yellow fever to go to the vaccination posts to assure their immunization.

Cases during the current monitoring period have been greater than in the past season; the yellow fever virus today circulates in metropolitan regions of the country that contain the greatest contingent of the population, reaching 35.6 million resident people, including in areas that have never been recommended for vaccination. In the past [transmission] season, for example, the outbreak reached a population of 11.2 million people.

This explains why the disease incidence in the current period is less than the past one. The incidence in the monitoring period 2017-2018, as of 10 Apr [2018], is 3.0 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. In the past season, 2016-2017, the incidence was 6.2 per 100 000 in the same period. [The population at risk is much greater this season. - Mod.TY]

[The slow but continuous increase in yellow fever cases, including in the major metropolitan municipalities, is of concern. The report above provides a good update on the current YF situation in Brazil. There is no indication that the outbreak has ended. Although there still have been no reports of cases from the urban, _Aedes aegypti_, cycle of transmission, the risk remains that spillover from the sylvan (forest) cycle could occur. _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are present in the area and responsible for the transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. It is important to note from the case numbers above that cases of YF in humans and monkeys are occurring in areas outside of the 3 states where the main outbreak is occurring. There is risk of new human cases and outbreaks in other areas, so that surveillance in a broad area of Brazil is important. Expansion of the area for vaccination to ultimately include the entire country is prudent but ambitious. No comment is made above about the availability of vaccine for the 77.5 million people to be covered, nor if a fractionated or full dose of the vaccine will be administered. - Mod.TY
