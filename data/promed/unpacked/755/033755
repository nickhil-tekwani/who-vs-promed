Confirmation of disease caused by fish puts Ribeirao on alert
-------------------------------------------------------------
The confirmation in Ribeirao of a case of diphyllobothriasis, a disease
caused by a fish tinea and contracted through ingestion of raw or poorly
cooked fish, has left the health authorities of the city in a state of
alert. According to the Department of Disease Surveillance, this is the 1st
report of the disease in the history of the city and the 1st report of the
disease this year [2005] from the interior of Sao Paulo State [earlier
reports were from cases in the capital city of the state, also named Sao
Paulo; see prior ProMED-mail postings listed below. - Mod.MPP]
In the capital, 18 patients have already been identified with this disease.
One of the patients is a resident of the city with a history of eating raw
salmon 2 times a week who sought medical attention after developing
abdominal pains. He contracted the disease in Ribeirao Preto but did not
require hospital admission. According to Clesio Sousa Soares, director of
the Department of Disease Surveillance, the city is in the midst of an
outbreak of diphyllobothriasis. "When one case of a disease is reported
that never existed in the city before, we consider this an outbreak of the
disease," he said.
Soares alerted people who have eaten raw or poorly cooked fish and have
symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea to go to a health facility to
have fecal examinations done. He also alerted consumers and owners of
commercial establishments to freeze their fish for a minimum of 7 days at a
temperature below 20 C so that any parasites present [in the fish] will be
killed.
After the 1st reports of diphyllobothriasis in Sao Paulo, business at
Japanese restaurants visited by EPTV fell by 30 per cent. Since then,
locales that are only preparing salmon sushi and sashimi have begun to
freeze the fish, according to the proprietor of a restaurant. Beyond
freezing, cooking the fish will also destroy the worm.
According to Jorge Luiz Nunes, a biomedical parasitologist, the parasite
that causes diphyllobothriasis is common in countries that consume a lot of
salmon, such as Chile and Japan. Though the organism was already present in
Brazil, this is the 1st time that an outbreak of this disease has been
detected. Hence, the biomedical alert is meant to caution people against
eating raw fish. Nunes explained that the worm of the fish is more
pathological than that found in the meat of cattle and pigs. "If you take
into account the anemia produced in [infected] patients, the disease is
sufficiently pathological," he said.

Illness caused by raw fish arrives in Rio
-----------------------------------------
The disease caused by the parasite _Diphyllobothrium latum_, found in raw
fish, has arrived in Rio [de Janeiro]. According to Sanitary Surveillance
[ANVISA], 13 cases of diphyllobothriasis were diagnosed in the past 4
months in laboratory examinations. Sanitary Surveillance [ANVISA] inspected
about 200 Japanese restaurants in the city, which serve dishes based on raw
fish.
The outbreak of diphyllobothriasis was 1st identified in Sao Paulo, where
27 cases of the disease have been reported in the past 12 months. Last week
[2nd week April 2005], it was decided that all of the salmon that was
supplied to Sao Paulo will have to be imported in an already frozen state.
This measure was taken to comply with safety recommendations from ANVISA to
prevent new infections.

Chile offers help to Brazil to fight the parasite of raw fish
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Chilean Ambassador to Brazil, Osvaldo Puccio, has made technicians and
specialists in Health and Fisheries of the [Chilean] government available
to the Brazilian government to help clarify the cases of diphyllobothriasis
(parasitosis caused by a worm that lives in the meat of raw fish) reported
in Sao Paulo, Rio [de Janeiro] and Brasilia. The announcement was made
during a meeting in Brazilia with Minister Jose Fritsch of the Special
Secretariat of Aquaculture and Fisheries.
Professor and researcher of the Federal Agricultural University of Rio de
Janeiro, and doctor of parasitology, Jose Luis Luque, said that there is no
need for panic on the part of consumers of raw fish nor for those who
frequent Japanese restaurants. Luque pointed out that, in spite of the
frightening name, diphyllobothriasis is nothing more than a worm and can be
treated by medication. The treatment is simple and cheap. Any person who
eats raw foods, not only fish but also salads, should take medications for
treatment of worms at least once a year, the parasitologist advised,
reminding consumers that the confirmed cases of the disease
[diphyllobothriasis] that have been identified as part of this outbreak
have occurred on more than one occasion. The larvae of the parasite are
encountered in fish, both freshwater and saltwater. The larvae do not
produce a toxin, according to Luque.

[The recent identification of diphyllobothriasis from multiple locations in
Brazil in recent months is a good example of "seek and ye shall find".
Since the outbreak was identified in Sao Paulo, active surveillance of
laboratories in other areas has identified the problem in more than one
city, suggesting that this outbreak is related to a common source of fish
used in food dishes made from raw fish such as sashimi and sushi. It has
been suggested that the source is salmon imported from Chile, where
diphyllobothriasis has been identified in the past. We await further
information on these investigations. - Mod.MPP
_Diphyllobothrium latum_ was 1st described by Linnaeus in 1758, long before
sushi became popular outside Japan. In the present outbreak, there have
been no firm data, such as case control studies, interviews with patients
and controls, to suggest that this is actually the route of infection.
Species other than humans can be infected -- dogs, pigs, bears, and foxes
-- but eggs shed from these species are usually less infective than eggs
shed from humans. Humans start shedding eggs about 6 weeks after infection
and, to maintain the infectious cycle, eggs from human waste must pollute
fresh water, where the intermediate host -- the copepod (_Diaptomus
vulgaris_) -- is infected and later ingested by fish. Alternatively, the
fish can be infected by eating another infected fish. - Mod.EP]
