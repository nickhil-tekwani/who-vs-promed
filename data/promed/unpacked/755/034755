The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (20 Jun 2016) investigating a case of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) O157:H7 [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ or EHEC - Mod.LL] infection, and hence reminded the public to maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene against intestinal infections.

The boy, aged 3 with good past health, has developed fever, vomiting, diarrhea, cough and runny nose since 10 Jun, and was admitted to a private hospital for management on 12 Jun 2016. He has been in a stable condition all along and was discharged on 15 Jun 2016.

His stool specimen tested positive for EHEC O157:H7 upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Initial enquiries revealed that the patient had no recent travel history. He had contact with animals during the incubation period, but did not consume unpasteurized milk or raw food. His home contacts have remained asymptomatic. The CHP's investigations are ongoing.

Preventive measures for EHEC infections are similar to those recommended for other food-borne diseases. The public are advised to observe good personal and food hygiene.

[The source of the EHEC may well be animal contact as ruminants especially cattle often have the organism on the fecal contaminated coat. - Mod.LL
