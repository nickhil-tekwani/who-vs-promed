[State Surveillance programs are running down now and weekly reporting has
virtually ceased. New York State is the only state to release an up-dated
report this week. New Hampshire Test Results were not cited regularly in
previous surveillance reports and are now brought up-to-date. All other
reports and test results remain as posted in West Nile virus surveillance -
USA (47). The United States Department of Agriculture site which records the
overall totals has not been up-dated beyond 31 Oct 2000 and remains as
posted in West Nile virus surveillance - USA (46). - Mod.CP
