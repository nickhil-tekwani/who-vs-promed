Can the earth feed two billion more people by the early 21st century? And
do it without plowing up millions of acres of tropical forests and other
fragile ecosystems?
Despite the conspicuous success of scientifically created "world crops",
the answers to these questions, experts say, will depend as much on
politics and policy as they do on progress. During the past 70 years,
agricultural research has boosted global food production by an amount
sufficient for one billion additional people, according to new estimates by
the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
consortium of 16 research centers worldwide.
Thanks in large measure to new farming techniques and to novel strains of
rice, wheat and other crops developed by CGIAR, the chronic shortages that
afflicted 75 developing countries during the 1980s have been averted in the
90s:
RICE: nine-tenths is grown in the Asia/Pacific region, where demand is
projected to jump 70% in the next 30 years; yields rose by 52% and this
crop is increasingly important in Africa and Latin America.
WHEAT: is eaten by more very low-income people than any other crop; yields
per acre nearly doubled from 1974 to 1994 in all regions, except Latin
America.
CORN: production increased in all areas (yields rose by 72%) and more than
doubled in the Middle East and Asia. In Africa, demand far exceeds supply.
CASSAVA: this starchy root is the main staple for 200 million Africans. New
"Super Cassava" strains promise to triple output per acre in Africa.
POTATO: output has risen rapidly in all regions, tripling in the Middle
East over the past 20 years and growing an average of 80% worldwide.
SWEET POTATO: is more popular than potatoes in Africa and Asia, but the
greatest increase since the early 1970s has been in the Middle East and
North Africa.
SORGHUM: like millet, this crop is on the increase only in Africa, where
production increased 37% in the past 20 years.
BANANAS: Asia and the Pacific lead the world in production, but output has
nearly tripled in the Middle East and North Africa during the past 20 years.
BARLEY: is an important staple only in the Middle East and North Africa,
although Asian production has risen 50% in the past 25 years.
FOOD LEGUMES: include peas and beans which have a high protein content and
are grown around the world. Asia and Africa have the highest production
levels, but yields have stagnated in all regions.
MILLET: world production of this cereal grass was stagnant or declining,
except in Africa, where output rose 26% in the past 20 years.
PLANTAINS: these banana-like plants are chiefly grown in Africa, but are
increasingly popular in Latin America.
CGIAR officials, who met in Switzerland in February 1995 to plan for an
ominous future are doubting that scientific innovation alone can raise
production sufficiently to keep pace with hunger. The planet's population
is projected to grow by about 85 million people a year for two or three
decades. Ninety percent of that will occur in the Third World,
approximately doubling demand for food there by 2025.
"We are in a race with time" said Ismail Serageldm, Chairman of CGIAR and
vice president of environmentally sustainable development at the World
Bank, a major CGIAR sponsor. The "nightmarish pressure of population growth
against limited resources", he said, means that the growing need "cannot
be met exclusively by yield increases. It can't be done without expansion
of agricultural land and irrigation."
"In order to do so without ravaging the environment, Serageldin said,
developing countries are going to have to work much harder to put the
lessons of recent research into practice and coax more food out of each
acre." "There is a huge gap between what is available and what is actually
being done to push up the production of the average farmer", Serageldin
said. "In rice, for example, the biological maximum is 15 metric tons per
hectare (about 7 US tons/acre. We are nowhere near that now."
According to the most recent CGIAR figures, 1994 average yields in
developing countries was 3.5 metric tons per hectare. "In addition",
Serageldin said, "there is often tremendous waste in current use of
resources. In some cases, irrigation systems are so inefficient it can take
2000 pounds of water to produce a ton of rice. Such conditions cannot
continue long in developing countries where, on average, 73 percent of all
fresh water is used for agricultural irrigation."
Serageldin stressed that wealthy nations are going to have to cooperate
more closely with the Third World, by sharing techniques and by changing
policies that keep poorer countries from developing local agriculture,
which "accounts for 60 to 80% of employment and half the national income in
low-income countries." That means ending the practice - common among some
affluent nations that subsidize agriculture - of dumping wheat, dairy and
meat surpluses on the Third World below cost. "They say we don't know what
to do with it, so let's call it food aid", Serageldin said. "That, in turn,
means keeping people dependent on food stuffs they are unable to produce
locally. In the long rim, it undercuts their self-sufficiency and they
remain insecure and locked in poverty."
Thanks to the extraordinary success of agricultural research, Serageldin
said, "some people have become very complacent and that's not justified.
The starvation disaster scenario is a possibility if we don't get our act
together."
[And, if we add the increasing rate of plant disease emergence to this
equation, then the challenge becomes even greater - Mod.PKA]
