Amid a rise in seasonal diseases in the city, doctors here claim that the most worrying trend is the increase in H1N1 (swine flu) cases. The virus seems to have returned to haunt the capital after a lull of a few years.

According to central government figures, Delhi has recorded 1507 cases (as of 26 Jul 2013) and 16 deaths. The disease had last created a panic-like situation in Delhi in 2009-10. Talking about the preparations, Delhi Health Minister A. K. Walia said: "We are concerned about the situation and are putting in place some measures to ensure that the rise is controlled. All city hospitals have been asked to follow the H1N1 protocol, including ensuring isolation wards with dedicated staff for patients coming in with the flu. The state government is also looking at ensuring enough supply and availability of Tamiflu at all centres."

Swine flu [H1N1] was at its most virulent form in the country when it spread in 2009. Till May 2010, 1035 people had died of the disease in India, and more than
10 000 were infected. "Symptoms of H1N1 influenza include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Many people with swine flu have had diarrhoea and vomiting. But these symptoms can also be caused by many other conditions. The accuracy of tests for detecting swine flu depends on the quality of the manufacturer's test, the sample collection method, and how much virus a person is shedding at the time of testing," said Delhi Medical Association member Anil Bansal. The precautions for keeping swine flu at bay include washing hands frequently to avoid infection and staying away from crowded places and those who have tested positive for the virus.

City-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) has advised people to stay alert and take precautionary measures to ward off swine flu as the H1N1 infection rate has gone up considerably this month [August 2013]. The infection rate of the H1N1 virus has touched 13 percent in July 2013 as against 1.1 percent in June 2013. This means, of the total suspected H1N1 patients, 13 percent have tested positive, scientists from NIV said here on Tuesday [30 Jul 2013]. 4 people have died of swine flu in Pune city in the last 7 days, and 7 more infected with the virus are currently critical and are on ventilator support at different hospitals.

"There has been a significant rise in the number of people testing positive for H1N1 influenza this month [July 2013] compared to last month [June 2013], with considerable rise in the number of throat swabs being sent to NIV for testing. Precaution is the key to protection from infection," said senior scientist Mandeep Chadha, deputy director of NIV. The NIV had received around 100 throat swab samples from across the state [Maharashtra] in June 2013. "The number of throat swabs tested at the NIV has already touched 150 in July 2013," Chadha said. There has been a perceptible rise in the H1N1 infection rate this year [2013] in the June to July period, as against the same period last year. "In 2012, the infection rate of swine flu was 4 percent in June and 8 percent in July [2012]. This year [2013], there was a drop in June but considerable rise in July 2013," Chadha said.

Health officials said that the rise in swine flu cases and deaths this year [2013] can be attributed to favourable climatic conditions for the spread of the virus, dipping immunity among people, and delays in treatment. The city has reported 205 positive cases and 27 deaths between January and July this year [2013] as against 384 cases and 13 deaths during the same period last year, and 13 cases and one death during the same period in 2011. "The city reported only 2 swine flu cases and no deaths in June 2013. However, the number of cases surged in July 2013 when the city recorded 21 positive cases till date," said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health (MoH), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

The H1N1 virus's frequency of causing infection is being closely monitored by the scientists at NIV. "Barring minor point mutations, there has been no significant mutation in the genetic make-up of the virus so far," Chadha said. "It is imperative to continue monitoring the genetic make-up of the H1N1 viruses to understand their adaptability and evolutionary dynamics in the country," Chadha said.

As per the Union Health Ministry's report, the country has reported 4868 positive cases between 1 Jan and 26 Jul [2013] this year. Of these, 610 people have died. 196 deaths were recorded in Gujarat, the highest number in the country, followed by Rajasthan, which recorded 163 deaths. Maharashtra follows with 413 swine flu cases and 90 deaths.

At least 76 people have tested positive for influenza A (H1N1) virus in Jammu and Kashmir in 2013, and 2 of them died, according to figures released by the Government of India. According to data released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 4868 people were affected with the H1N1 virus across India from 1 Jan to 26 Jul 2013. It said that of these, 610 people died of the deadly virus infection.

The Ministry has released a breakdown of the laboratory confirmed cases and deaths in 35 States/Union Territories of India, including J&K [Jammu and Kashmir], that took place during this year [2013] (as of 26 Jul 2013). As per the data, 76 cases of (H1N1) were detected in J&K. "Of these, 2 died." Earlier this year [2013], the J&K government had sounded a swine flu alert in Kashmir after several cases were detected at the SK Institute of Medical Sciences here. The state Health Department also published an advisory and urged people to follow a slew of measures to avoid the deadly viral infection. In 2008-2009, J&K reported more than 50 cases of H1N1 virus, and authorities had claimed that virus was carried by people coming from outside or locals who had returned to the valley after staying outside the state for some time.

Among all the states, Delhi tops the list of H1N1 affected states with 1507 cases of influenza-A virus detected in 2013. "While only 16 deaths took place in Delhi this year [2013], the death toll is highest in Gujarat, where 196 deaths occurred among a total of 1031 reported influenza A cases," the data reveals. It states also that the incidence of H1N1 virus is lowest in Uttarakhand, with only 2 reported cases of H1N1 found in the newly formed state during the year and no death reported in the state.

The states/UT [States and Union Territories] in which no cases of affected persons were found are Bihar, Assam, Arunanchal Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar, Chhattisgarh, Daman & Diu, D and N Haveli, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Lakshadweep, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Orissa, Puducherry, Sikkim and Tripura.

[According to the most recent WHO Epidemiological Update of 26 Jul 2013 (update to 16 Jul 2013) [See: http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2013_07_19_surveillance_update_190.pdf]:
"Influenza transmission in South East Asia has gradually decreased, and transmission in southern Asia remained consistently low in the past few weeks. The proportion of influenza A has also been higher compared to influenza B in both regions. In South East Asia, influenza activity remained low for most countries except for Viet Nam, with mainly circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in the past few weeks. Thailand also reported a small increase of A(H3N2) compared to the last few weeks.

In Southern Asia, in India, A(H3N2) virus remained the main influenza virus circulating in the past weeks. Sri Lanka has decreasing influenza A activity compared to the past few weeks. Iran and Pakistan also experienced low activity. In Southern China, influenza activity gradually decreased."

The preceding press reports from India indicate a marked change in the incidence of influenza virus infection in India with transition of the predominant virus from H3N2 to H1N1 -- presumably the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 strain. Increased incidence has been recorded in the capital New Delhi and the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashrashtra and Jammu & Kashmir. So far, no cases have been reported in Bihar, Assam, Arunanchal Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar, Chhattisgarh, Daman & Diu, D and N Haveli, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Lakshadweep, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Orissa, Puducherry, Sikkim and Tripura.

It is perhaps too early to conclude that these reports are indicative of a resurgence of the H1N1pdm09 strain, but they should not be ignored.
