Increase in foot and mouth cases endangers livestock
----------------------------------------------------
In response to the recent increase in foot and mouth disease [FMD] infections in livestock around the country, the government has formed 3000 local teams to follow up on the new SAT2 strain of the virus and prevent it from spreading further.

The number of confirmed FMD cases has reached 2175 since late February [2012], according to official reports.

FMD is an infectious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals. The virus causes a high fever for 2 or 3 days, followed by blisters inside the mouth and on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness.

The Agriculture Ministry has prepared a memorandum for the cabinet accusing a number of governors of failing to implement ministry decisions to protect livestock and failing to take necessary veterinary measures or close livestock auctions as instructed by the General Authority for Veterinary Services.

The provincial officials accused in the memo include the governor of Gharbiya, who failed to shut down the livestock auction market in Kafr al-Zayat on Wed [7 Mar 2012] despite the increasing number of FMD cases in the governorate.

Veterinary services head Major General Osama Salim told Al-Masry Al-Youm that despite the severity of the outbreak, the number of cases being reported is exaggerated. He pointed out the importance of committing to all preventive measures, restricting the movement of livestock between governorates, and closing livestock auction markets to limit the spread of infection.

The head of the authority's Central Department for Preventive Medicine Dr Suhair Hassan said the authority is "on high alert" due to the serious nature of the new strain of the virus. She added that the virus can spread through the air over a distance of 100 km [62 mi] and that given the lack of border controls between governorates, the state needs to immediately follow up and take the necessary preventive measures to protect livestock.

She pointed out that prior to the emergence of the new SAT2 strain, Egypt had 2 controllable strains of the virus that were dealt with in accordance with standard veterinary practices.

[The information above can be regarded as a confirmation of the suspicions included in ProMED-mail's posting 20120306.1062871 about FMD of probable exotic strain spreading into the Delta region. For background, subscribers are referred to the said posting.

FMDV SAT2 is exotic in the Middle East. All ruminants in the region, and pigs, are not vaccinated thus fully susceptible.

The other 2 FMDV strains mentioned by Dr Suhair Hassan are FMDV-O and FMDV-A, which have been circulating earlier in Egypt. The efficacy of the vaccines applied in Egypt against these 2 serotypes deserves to be checked.

An additional article in yesterday's (7 Mar 2012] "Egypt Independent" (see http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/699991), also translated from Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper, includes the following important information: "According to an official report, between 26 Feb and 5 Mar 2012, 1465 livestock were suspected to be infected with the disease, including 418 cases in Qalyubiya Governorate, 300 in Sohag, 200 in Gharbiya, and 104 in Port Said. During the same period, 64 calves died". FMD virus is known to be highly pathogenic for newborn and very young offspring of cattle, small ruminants, and pigs. In the past, another disease was involved in Egypt in abortions and high mortality of young ruminants, namely Rift Valley fever. This disease deserves to be included in the differential diagnosis.

An official notification to the OIE with additional details is anticipated. - Mod.AS
