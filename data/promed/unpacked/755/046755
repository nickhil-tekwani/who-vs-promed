The battle to slow the spread of sexually transmitted infections is seeing progress, but it's lagging where state doctors wish to see the state. "Louisiana has been in the top 3 of the United States and a lot of efforts are being done to try and decrease that, " Dr David Holcombe, Region Six Medical Director of the Office of Public Health said. "We're doing a little bit better in the state as a whole, with the exception of syphilis." Dr Holcombe said data is showing positive signs of decreased spread in other STIs [sexually transmitted infections] except for syphilis.

In May [2021], the Louisiana Department of Health released an alert to Central Louisiana asking all medical providers to increase screening for syphilis because of the growing threat. The letter states since 2017, the Alexandria region quadrupled its number of early cases. The most staggering were the cases for women. The data released showed from 2019 to 2020 the number of early cases among women jumped by 62%.

Louisiana also ranks 9th in the nation among primary and secondary syphilis cases and 5th in congenital syphilis, when an infected pregnant mother passes the infection to the fetus. Among all statewide congenital syphilis cases, the Alexandria region makes up 14%.

One issue with treating syphilis is its difficulty to diagnose. It occurs in multiple stages, and some patients do not show symptoms. "The problem with syphilis is that between your exposure and when you develop symptoms if any, there's a lag time there," he said. "Then the symptoms go away and can be gone for several [weeks] and have no other manifestations. But, the person can still transmit the disease during this time." The 1st stage of infection involves a sore on genitals or other areas of sexual contact. The sore is painless and will eventually heal. During the 2nd stage, the infected person develops a rash. "They develop a rash, and the rash can look like anything. It's sometimes very tricky to diagnose. If you do not treat it, it goes on to a 3rd form." The 3rd stage is tertiary syphilis. At that point, brain and nervous system damage can happen.

Dr Holcombe said syphilis and many other STIs are simple to treat. However, many people are not seeking care. Michael Parham, a registered nurse who treated patients at Central Louisiana Aids Support Services in Alexandria said sex being a controversial topic in Southern states leads to poor health access. "I think that lack of access can be directly tied to stigma within those communities," Parham said. "We don't want to talk about [sex] in the genteel proper south. We are still in a place where it's considered dirty and taboo."

Parham said people come into the CLASS [Central Louisiana Aids Support Services] clinic with several questions. "People often come into the clinic where I volunteer and have no symptoms of sexually transmitted infections and don't know what symptoms might be if they were there," he said. "What infections they are at risk, or increased risk for based upon the sexual activities that they participate in and don't know that the healthcare is there." The main message is to know your status by getting tested and seeking treatment.

"Well if you're in a monogamous relationship with a stable partner, then your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease is about zero," Dr Holcombe said. "But, if you have multiple partners, especially partners that you don't know well, associated with drug use or either intoxicant, you should be tested, and you should be tested regularly." STI screenings are available at the Office of Public Health in each parish.

[Alexandria is the 9th-largest city, with a metropolitan population of 153 922, in the center of the US state of Louisiana and is the parish seat of Rapides Parish (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Louisiana). A map showing the location of Alexandria can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alexandria,+LA.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2018 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/syphilis.htm), after reaching a historic low in 2000 and 2001, the rate of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most contagious stages of syphilis, "has increased almost every year since 2001. This rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis has been primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM account for the majority of P&S syphilis cases, and estimated rates are substantially higher among MSM, compared with women or men who have sex with women only (MSW). The number of cases among MSM has continued to increase, but within the last 5 years, cases among MSW and women have increased substantially as well."

"Although rates of P&S syphilis are lower among women, rates have increased substantially in recent years, increasing 30.0% during 2018-2019 and 178.6% during 2015-2019, suggesting the heterosexual syphilis epidemic continues to rapidly increase." (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis)

The increase in syphilis among women is of particular concern because it is associated with a striking and concurrent increase in congenital syphilis. "The 2013 rate of congenital syphilis (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births) marked the 1st increase in congenital syphilis since 2008. Since 2013, the rate of congenital syphilis has increased each year. In 2019, 1870 cases of congenital syphilis were reported." (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis)

In 2019, the most common missed congenital syphilis prevention opportunity was a lack of adequate maternal syphilis treatment despite receipt of a timely syphilis diagnosis (40.2%). The 2nd most common missed congenital syphilis prevention opportunity in 2019 was a lack of timely prenatal care and subsequent lack of timely syphilis testing (36.3%). (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis)

During 2014-2018, the proportion of primary and secondary syphilis cases that reported injection drug use within the past 12 months doubled among women and MSW but decreased slightly among MSM cases (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/syphilis2018/Syphilis-Surveillance-Supplement-2014-2018_Slide-Notes_January-2020.pdf). The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially cocaine crack, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification. No mention is made in the news report above of illicit drug use contributing to the outbreak of syphilis in central Louisiana.
