Zoo workers risk exposure to nonhuman primate virus
-----------------------------------------------
Zoo workers who come into close contact with nonhuman primates, such as
apes and monkeys, are at increased risk for exposure to simian virus 40
(SV40), suggest the results of a study of North American zoo workers.
However, the investigators emphasize that larger studies are needed to
determine the precise level of risk and to determine whether there are
health consequences of SV40 infection in humans. SV40 causes cancer in
laboratory animals, and SV40 DNA has been observed in some human tumors,
although possible routes of infection are unknown, Dr. Eric A. Engels, from
the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland and colleagues report
in The Journal of Infectious Diseases [see: The Journal of Infectious
Diseases, 15 Dec 2004]
They tested 254 zoo workers for antibodies to SV40. 25 of 109 of the
workers who had direct contact with primates (23 percent) tested positive
for SV40, as compared with 15 of 145 workers (10 percent) who had no direct
contact with primates. The increased rate of SV40 exposure in primate
handlers remained after an "added level of stringency" was incorporated,
the team notes, namely, a test to eliminate possible false-positive results
that may have picked up 2 SV40-related human viruses. The "mostly
low-level" of SV40 exposure observed in the workers suggests that there is
no ongoing replication of SV40, Engels and colleagues note.
They emphasize that the current study cannot provide a reliable estimate,
in absolute terms, of the risk to zoo workers of exposure to, or infection
with, SV40. The author of a related editorial also points out that, while
humans who come into contact with primates may become infected with SV40,
there is currently no evidence to suggest that SV40 has spread outside of
zoo environments or that it plays a role in the development of cancer in
humans. However, due to uncertainties in available data on SV40 in humans,
further studies are warranted, Dr. Keerti V. Shah, from The Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, concludes.

[In the 1950's, early batches of poliovirus vaccine were grown in monkey
kidney cells that harbored a simian vacuolating virus, now known as simian
virus 40 (SV40). It has been estimated that between 10 and 30 million
people received one or more doses of live SV40 in contaminated vaccine.
Many developed antibodies to SV40 proteins, but there have been no
documented negative consequences to this exposure.
SV40 is the type species of the single genus _Polyomavirus_, which
comprises the family _Polyomaviridae_. The polyomaviruses tend to have
restricted host ranges, although cells which fail to support virus
replication may become genetically transformed via the action of early gene
products. In general, the polyomaviruses spread by reactivation of
persistent infections in the mother during pregnancy, with low level
shedding of virus in urine. The polyomaviruses often exhibit highly
specific tissue-specific expression with frequent involvement of the
kidney. One of the 2 known human polyomaviruses, JC polyomavirus, may
infect and destroy oligodendrocytes, resulting in a fatal demyelinating
disease termed progressive multifocal leucencephalopathy (PML). SV40 has
been associated with a PML-like disease in rhesus monkeys. For this reason,
perhaps, there is still concern that SV40 exposure by an atypical route may
rarely result in late-developing disease in humans. - Mod.CP]
