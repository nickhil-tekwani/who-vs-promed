Dengue cases in the province surged to 463 as of 26 Nov 2007 said
Mildred Quilino, Information Officer, Provincial Health Office.

"The weather conditions these days are so conducive for dengue
mosquitoes to breed. Scattered rain showers with sunny days are
favorable to dengue mosquitoes to thrive and multiply," Quilino
added. Almost every week, Delegate Angel Salazar Memorial Hospital
reported admission of dengue suspected cases.

The municipality of Tobias Fornier has the highest number of cases
with 123, San Jose with 119, Hamtic with 51, Anini-y, 47 and
Bugasong, 14 cases. Despite surging cases, Quilino said that most
cases are being managed and treated in the local hospitals. Only few
and extreme cases are brought to Iloilo for treatment.

PHO reiterated its campaign to local government units, communities
and families to double their efforts to fight dengue mosquitoes.
"There is no substitute to cleanliness and proper sanitation. We do
not only eradicate mosquitoes but also get rid of other water borne
and contagious diseases," said Quilino. The public is also reminded
to bring dengue suspected patients to the nearest health centers for
proper treatment.

The dreaded dengue disease has afflicted 45 residents at latest
count, and the number is rising, health officials said. Nenita
Lizardo, head of the provincial health office reported this statement
saying this was alarming. Lizardo said health personnel earlier
recorded 30 cases in September [2007], but this went up to 45 in
October [2007] with 55 percent of these cases from Bontoc.

Lizardo said that there is a need to advocate the 4-S program against
dengue. The 4-S means' search and destroy' eliminating all breeding
sites for the mosquito, proper waste disposal, covering of water
containers, and cleaning of roof gutters and drains.

The program protection measures advocate use of long sleeves and
pants, installing screens on doors and windows, use of mosquito nets
and adopting a healthy lifestyle to boost resistance. Lizardo advised
constituents to seek consultation, as there was no drug or vaccine
for dengue. "Dengue suspects must be brought to the nearest health
facility immediately, and there should be no self- medication," she
said, adding indiscriminate fogging should only be done during
outbreaks and epidemics [She doubtless meant that fogging should be
focused on areas where dengue virus transmission and cases were
occurring, not indiscriminately anywhere. - Mod.TY].

The Kecamatan Kota Bondowoso Territory was not yet free from endemic
[epidemic] dengue fever. As of yesterday [2 Dec 2007], the Kota
Subdistrict contributed most to the number of dengue sufferers,
whereas dengue incidence was lower in the area of mountains like
Sempol, Wringin, or Cermee. Data from the health service indicated
that the number of residents suspected of dengue fever reached 26.
Cases were most frequent in the Kota Subdistrict territory, following
Tegalampel, Grujugan, and the Tenggarang Subdistrict.

The attack of the dengue fever in Jombang has not stopped. Yesterday
[29 Nov 2007], at least 3 sufferers who were known positive for
dengue [virus infection] were of concern. The 3 sufferers, who were
treated intensively in the Cukir Community Health Centre, were
residents of the Sentanan Desa Grogol Village, Kecamatan Diwe and
Jombang villages.

Dengue has been seen since last October [?2006 or ?2007] when rains
began. During the period from January [2007] until this October 2007,
there have been 489 dengue fever sufferers, of whom 14 died.

From January until October 2006, the numbers of dengue sufferers who
received medical treatment were 256, of whom 17 died.

[The numbers of deaths in this reported outbreak are not clear. Have
14 or 17 individuals died? The popular press in Java is currently
reporting outbreaks of febrile disease across the island attributed
to infection by chikungunya virus (see archive no. 20071201.3876)
but, unlike reports of dengue fever, without citation of official
reports of laboratory confirmation. The symptoms of disease caused by
these 5 viruses (chikungunya plus the 4 dengue viruses) can be
similar, underscoring the need for laboratory diagnosis.

The Ministry of Health has today [30 Nov 2007] received confirmation
of 2 cases of dengue in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Director of
Health Services Dr. Irad Potter says that as the Ministry of Health
continues to monitor the results of other suspected cases of dengue,
it has stepped up its vector control activities through the
Environmental Health Division's Dengue Surveillance Unit. He urges
residents to guard against mosquito bites and to reduce mosquito
breeding around homes and property in order to keep the number of
cases in the BVI to a minimum.

"Blood samples have been sent to the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre
(CAREC) to confirm the status of other suspected cases of dengue, and
we are awaiting the results. Of the 14 specimens that have been sent
off for testing, 9 have come back; 2 of the 9 are positive. The
specimens take at least 4-6 weeks to be processed. Persons suspected
of having dengue are treated based on their clinical presentation by
their doctor," Dr. Potter said.

Dr. Potter noted that in light of recent outbreaks in the region,
persons who have traveled to Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic,
Martinique and Guadeloupe and are experiencing painful flu-like
symptoms of high fever, nausea and painful body aches within 3 to 14
days of their travel should seek medical attention.

Dengue virus, which can also cause a rash in infected persons, is
spread through the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito commonly found in the
BVI. The Director of Health Services advised that due to the
heightened awareness in the sub-region related to dengue, suspected
cases are being investigated and followed up to rule out or confirm
the presence of the virus.

All _Aedes aegypti_ inspectors are up and about surveying public and
private spaces. However, mosquitoes reproduce at a rapid rate.
Therefore, surveys of private and work spaces must be completed by
residents themselves to break the mosquito cycle.

In September [2007], the Environmental Health Division issued an
advisory putting residents and visitors of the BVI on high alert in
response to dengue outbreaks in Puerto Rico and Guyana.

This year [2007], there have been 18 cases of dengue found on the
Antillean island of St. Maarten. This is the highest number of cases
of this disease ever detected on the island in a year. Therefore, a
warning has been declared.

Earlier this month [November 2007], Aruba has taken measures to
prevent a dengue outbreak.

Campinas has officially confirmed 5035 dengue cases since January
[2007]. However, the Secretary of Health is expecting cases of this
disease to total 13 000, taking into account the 8000 notified
suspected cases which are not expected to be laboratory confirmed
within the medium-term. "Despite this, we have opted to consider
these cases as positive," explained the Health Surveillance
Coordinator (COVISA), Salma Balista.

She pointed out that among these cases, some may not be dengue, but
as the absolute majority [of these cases] were notified at the peak
of the epidemic in the 1st semester of 2007, chances are that they
are really dengue. "From the point of view of [dengue] control and
prevention measures, this does not change anything, as actions are
launched based on suspected [disease], since serological results [for
confirmation] take time. But in terms of a map of the actual
situation, and the definition for the patient, [this] is important,"
observed Salma.

"It is always difficult to know the exact number of cases in a large
epidemic, such as we are facing [now]. But, with 5000, 10 000 or 15
000 cases, the logistics of preventive work is the same," affirmed
the Secretary of Health, Jose Francisco Kerr Saraiva.

He recalled that, as determined by the ministry and the Secretary of
Health, those municipalities which had an incidence of over 300
[dengue] cases per 100 000 inhabitants -- Campinas had an incidence
coefficient of 475 cases per 100 000 inhabitants -- do not need to do
more than carry out serological tests to confirm occurrences [of
dengue cases]. This disease can be confirmed on the basis of
clinico-epidemiological criteria.

Since the beginning of 2007, COVISA has received 21 000 notifications
of suspected cases of the disease. Of the 5035 officially
[laboratory] confirmed cases, 20 were DHF and 65 were dengue with
complications resulting in 2 deaths. Another 2 deaths included
[individuals] living in other cities of the region, who died in
Campinas hospitals.

An open public meeting will be held this Saturday [24 Nov 2007] with
representatives of the State Committee to Combat Dengue and the State
Public Ministry with the objective of stimulating the public to
combat, in their residences, the breeding sites of the mosquito that
transmits dengue [virus], referring to "D Day", the national [day]
for mobilization against dengue.

From January [2007] until the beginning of this month [November
2007], 11 207 classical dengue [fever] cases were registered in the
state [Alagoas - Mod.MPP]; 454 DHF cases with complications were
registered, with 12 deaths in the municipalities of Maceio, Colonia
Leopoldina, Palmeira dos Indios, Penedo and Santana do Mundau.

The municipalities in which 80 percent of the cases were concentrated
are considered priority [areas] including: Maceio, Marechal Deodoro,
Arapiraca, Penedo, Santana do Ipanema, Teotonio Vilela, Maragogi,
Palmeira dos Indios, Delmiro Gouveia, Paripueira, Barra de Santo
Antonio, Coqueiro Seco, Satuba, Barra de Sao Miguel, Santa Luzia do

A mosquito that can carry the deadly dengue fever virus is moving
north and has crossed the Swiss Alps, health authorities in the
canton of Aargau said.

They said it had not yet been determined whether the tiger mosquitoes
[_Aedes albopictus_] found so far are isolated individuals or part of
an established local colony.

_Aedes albopictus_ can also carry the chikungunya virus, which
infected more than 160 people in northern Italy earlier this year
[2007]. In Switzerland, it had only been found previously south of
the Alps, in the canton of Ticino.

The Swiss health ministry plans to make chikungunya, which was
described for the 1st time in Tanzania in 1952, a mandatory
reportable disease from next year [2008].

The mosquito is also present in southern France and parts of Spain,
as well as the United States, but the outbreak of chikungunya in
Italy is thought to have been the 1st outside the tropics.

Health experts meeting in Stockholm in September [2007] said European
countries must work to control tiger mosquito populations, but the
situation was not alarming.
