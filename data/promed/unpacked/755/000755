[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map appended to the
OIE WAHID report referenced above. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of Taiwan is available at

There was a previous instance of H5N2 LPAI last October 2010 which
followed the same pattern seen here, that is, no clinical signs, no
loss of production, and the disease detected by surveillance. There is
good news here, a rare thing in our business of early warning,
consisting of the fact that the detection of these outbreaks indicates
that the surveillance system is functioning effectively in Taiwan. -
