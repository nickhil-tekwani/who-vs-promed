An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at a North Portland apartment complex has killed one person and sickened 3 others, county health officials said.

Multnomah County health officials said Tuesday [5 Jan 2021] they told more than 100 residents of Rosemont Court on Dekum Street to leave after residents contracted pneumonia, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.

The health department said experts linked the outbreak Monday [4 Jan 2021] to the apartment's water system. County officials are working to clean the building's plumbing system and remove any remaining traces of _Legionella_, the bacteria that causes the disease.

The health department is working with Northwest Housing Alternatives, which owns Rosemont Court, to find other places for residents to stay, according to a news release. Multnomah County spokeswoman Julie Sullivan-Springhetti said residents were staying in Portland-area hotels, per a contract with the county, while health officials investigate the outbreak source.

People can contract the disease when they breathe in very small droplets of water with the bacteria. Most exposed to it don't get sick, but some people can contract severe pneumonia. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle aches and headache. More serious symptoms include cough and chest pain. The disease is not spread person to person.

As of Monday [4 Jan 2021], 20 residents had left the building and officials said more were leaving Tuesday.

[_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the disease. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis with fever, malaise, and muscle aches that is less severe than Legionnaires' disease; symptoms of Pontiac fever resolve in 2 to 5 days without antibiotic treatment (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/clinical-features.html). Risk factors for Legionnaires' disease include age 50 years or older; smoking (current or historical); chronic lung disease (such as emphysema or COPD); immune system disorders due to disease or medication; systemic malignancy; and underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/disease-specifics.html). Legionnaires' disease takes its name from an outbreak among people attending an American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in 1976.

Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Rosemont Court is described as "an older historic building" with studio, 1- and 2-bedroom apartments for residents 55 years or older in Portland, Oregon (https://www.rent.com/oregon/portland-apartments/rosemont-court-4-lnp001E000000nye2DIAQ).
