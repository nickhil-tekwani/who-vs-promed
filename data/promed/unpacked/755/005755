WEST NILE-LIKE VIRUS, AIRCRAFT SPRAYING: REQUEST FOR INFO
*********************************************************
A ProMED post

Date: Tue 19 Oct 1999
From: Jack Woodall <woodall@promedmail.org

This is a survey for reports of flights leaving New York recently that have
been sprayed with insecticide after departure, to kill any mosquitoes that
may have boarded there & could possibly be carrying West Nile-like virus.
I was told Brazil has been requiring this since 1 Sep 1999, but it may have
only been their national airlines, because a relative arrived here in Rio
on Continental on 30 Sep & didnÂ´t see any spraying. Of course, she may
have been sleeping when it was
done -- it was a night flight. Or it may have been done through the
ventilation system rather than by a steward/ess walking through the cabin
with an aerosol can.
We also had an enquiry from New Zealand as to whether planes arriving there
from NYC were sprayed.
Please send any relevant information to me at my e-mail address below.
