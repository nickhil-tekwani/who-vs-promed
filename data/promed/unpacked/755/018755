Australia: record numbers of Ross River virus cases in Perth
------------------------------------------------------------
Western Australian health authorities are alarmed at record numbers of
cases of Ross River virus infection in Perth so far in 2004. Over 1400
people have been infected, prompting them to consider more aggressive
health campaigns warning about the virus. In the metropolitan area, 466
cases have been reported, confirming the theory that Ross River virus
disease has become more urbanised, because domestic mosquitoes are
spreading the virus. It was once thought that cases recorded in Perth were
the result of people visiting the south west.
With 2 months of the season still to go, the number of cases of Ross River
virus has now surpassed Western Australia's big outbreak in 1995-96, when
about 1400 people were infected. By the end of last week [ending Fri 23 Apr
2004] over 750 cases had been reported in the south west, many from the hot
spots of Busselton and Capel. Case numbers were rising in the Kimberley,
Pilbara, and Central Wheatbelt.
Health Department scientist Sue Harrington said infection rates had dropped
off in southern areas where the nights were getting cold and mosquitoes
were less active. "We're learning more about the activity of mosquitoes and
this may help us better target our efforts," she said. "When you get 466
cases in the metropolitan area, that's a lot." Ms Harrington said public
health officials would look at ways to create more awareness of the virus.
