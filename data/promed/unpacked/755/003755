According to the agricultural organisation Confagricoltura Latina, a root disease of kiwi fruit is spreading in the province of Latina [Lazio region]. The region has 12 000 hectares [about 29 650 acres] of kiwi cultivation. Roots of affected plants rot for as yet unknown reasons. According to cautious estimates, 10% of the plants have been lost and half the harvest may be destroyed. There is little scientific knowledge about the disease so far. Trade associations, therefore, called on the Italian Agriculture Committee to take rapid action to prevent the disease from spreading further.

[A number of fungi have been reported to be associated with root and crown rots of kiwi fruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) in different areas, including species of _Phytophthora_, _Pythium_, _Armillaria_, and _Sclerotium_. Bacterial species of genus _Clostridium_ have also been found in association with kiwi fruit vine decline. Decline from waterlogging has also been reported.

In Italy, research is ongoing to identify potential pathogens and other factors associated with the national problem for which the name 'kiwi fruit vine decline syndrome' (KVDS) has been proposed (see links below). Symptoms of KVDS are being described as loss of feeding roots, blockage of vessels, root cortex breakdown, leaf necrosis, wilting, followed by plant death within 2 years.

The crop in the country is also affected by bacterial canker caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (see ProMED-mail post 20170403.4945381).
