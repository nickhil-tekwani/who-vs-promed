Tests have confirmed that a horse that died in northern New South
Wales last week was suffering from Hendra virus [infection]. The horse
died suddenly at a property at Lismore on Thursday [14 Jul 2011]. It
is the 4th case of the bat-borne disease in New South Wales in recent
months. The state's chief vet, Dr Ian Roth, says a blood sample was
taken from the horse, and tests last night [17 Jul 2011] confirmed it
has Hendra virus.

Dr Roth says there were no apparent links to the 2 other NSW
properties where horses died recently from the virus or to the
outbreaks in Queensland. He says there is another horse on the
quarantined Lismore property which is showing no sign of infection.

Dr Roth says flying foxes [_Pteropus_] were the most likely sources
of infection. The NSW Department of Primary Industries is warning
horse owners to take extra precautions to avoid flying foxes to
prevent the spread of the virus.

There have also been 6 outbreaks of the virus in Queensland in less
than a month. On Saturday [16 Jul 2011], 2 new outbreaks of the
disease were confirmed in Queensland: one at Hervey Bay on the Fraser
Coast and another at Boondall in Brisbane's north. Two sick horses
were euthanased earlier in the week. Seven horses are being monitored
as a result of the 2 new outbreaks in Queensland.

Queensland Health says it appears people who had contact with the
horses have a low risk of infection.

Almost a dozen properties are now quarantined in Queensland due to
the deadly virus. Dozens of people in NSW and Queensland are being
tested for Hendra. Officials cordoned off areas at Sydney's Randwick
Racecourse on Friday [15 Jul 2011] because of fears Hendra could
spread there for the 1st time.

A cross-border taskforce (including the chief vets of New South Wales
and Queensland), scientists, health officers and the CSIRO, met for
the 1st time on Wednesday [13 Jul 2011] to plan a coordinated response
to the virus.

[Unfortunately, this outbreak continues to smolder. Horse owners have
been advised constantly to avoid contact between their animals and
areas where flying fox fruit bats forage and roost. This may be
difficult on some properties. The only good news coming out of this
outbreak so far is that no human cases of Hendra virus infection have
yet occurred, despite attending veterinarians and others having been
in close contact with infected horses. ProMED thanks Dr. Volosinas for
passing along this report for posting.
