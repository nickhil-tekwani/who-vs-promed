On 27 Jun 2011, the Military Hospital in Santiago, Chile, received 2
male patients, who were transferred from the hospital in Esquel,
Argentina, for further diagnosis and treatment.

The patients were members of a Chilean family (father, 45 years, and
son, 15 years), who had been on vacation in Patagonia. There, the
father suffered from acute nausea and vomiting and both from acute
diplopia [double vision], which occurred 12 hours after the family had
eaten pizza in a restaurant in Rio Mayo, Chubut province of Argentina.
3 other family members, who had participated in the same meal, stayed
asymptomatic. With increasing symptoms, father and son attended the
local hospital, where they were hospitalized. The father developed
facial paralysis, difficulty swallowing, and progressive general
paralysis with respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical
ventilation.

With the suspected diagnosis of botulism, both were transferred after
48 hours to the intensive care unit of the Military Hospital in
Santiago, Chile, where they received botulism specific antiserum. The
son, who developed temporary urinary retention and constipation, had a
benign course and recovered completely after 7 days, whereas the
father required prolonged mechanical ventilation. On the day of this
report (24 Aug 2011), he is still intubated, but his neurological
dysfunctions are slowly improving. The diagnosis of foodborne botulism
was confirmed by a positive mouse inoculation test (Instituto Malbran,
Buenos Aires, Argentina) detecting botulism toxin in a blood sample of
the father.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Weitzel and colleagues for this 1st-hand report
of botulism.

Botulinum toxin is colorless, odorless, and, as far as is known,
tasteless. The toxin is readily inactivated by heat (85 deg C/185 deg
F for 5 minutes. So foodborne botulism is always transmitted by foods
that are not heated, or not heated thoroughly, before eating. It is
therefore reasonable to hypothesize that either the pizza was not
adequately heated or some ingredient containing the toxin (perhaps
home canned or bottled foods like olives, eggplant, or mushrooms or
garlic stored in unrefrigerated olive oil) was added after the cooking
of the pizza. It would be interesting to know what were the
ingredients on the pizza and whether a different pizza was ingested by
the family members who did not become ill. It is clearly important to
assess the specific vehicle as if it was commercially produced, many
more cases could occur.

The incubation period in these cases, about 12 hours, is certainly in
the range reported, 2 hours to 8 days with the typical case presenting
12 to 72 hours after the implicated meal. The toxin type is not
reported but is likely to be A or B unless anchovies are involved
(usually type E). - Mod.LL]
