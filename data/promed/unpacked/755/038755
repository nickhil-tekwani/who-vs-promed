It's called the Heartland virus disease. Since it was 1st detected in 2009, there have been only 9 reported cases in the Midwest, including 2 deaths. So scientists thought the Heartland virus was limited to a small region. That assumption was wrong.

A team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now found signs that Heartland virus is circulating in deer, raccoons, coyotes and moose in 13 states, from Texas to North Carolina and Florida to Maine.

"It was not only in these states, but it was fairly common," says biologist Nick Komar, who led the study. "It's very possible there have been many other cases that have been overlooked."

The Heartland virus causes symptoms similar to other diseases, including high fever, nausea, joint pain and severe bruising.

"Unless doctors are doing laboratory tests specifically for this infection, they'll miss it," Komar says. "This study is a way to get the word out, so the medical establishment knows there may be more infections out there. And people should be watching for it."

Komar and his colleague looked for signs of previous Heartland infections in about 1400 animals in 17 states. About 100 animals tested positive for Heartland antibodies, Komar and his colleague reported on Wednesday [16 Sep 2015] in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Since the study didn't directly detect the Heartland virus in the animals, there's a small chance another virus very similar to Heartland is circulating in some states, Komar says.

In northwestern Missouri, 2 men became ill after tick bites infected them with a previously unknown virus.

"The underlying message of this story is there are new pathogens out there," he says. "Our society is changing so quickly -- and even the climate -- that it allows for new things to develop. And we have to be on the lookout for those new things so we can protect the public health."

Scientists thought the lone star tick was the primary way Heartland [virus] spreads. But that tick isn't found up in northern New England. So there's likely a 2nd type of tick that can also carry Heartland [virus].

Riemersma KK, Nicholas Komar N. Heartland virus neutralizing antibodies in vertebrate wildlife, United States, 2009-2014.
---------------------------------------
Abstract
Since its discovery in 2009, the tickborne Heartland virus (HRTV) has caused human illness in Missouri, Oklahoma, and Tennessee USA. To better assess the geographic distribution of HRTV, we used wildlife serology as an indicator. This retrospective evaluation determined that HRTV is widespread within the central and eastern United States.

Background
Heartland virus (HRTV; family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus) is an emerging public health threat in the United States. HRTV disease, characterized by severe fever, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, was 1st reported in 2 farmers in northwestern Missouri in 2009 (1). Seven additional HRTV disease cases (2 fatal) have been reported in Missouri, Tennessee, and Oklahoma (2,3). A study of ticks and mosquitoes in northwestern Missouri detected HRTV infections only in _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick) and thus implicated this tick as a vector.

Conclusions
Our results simply indicate that HRTV or a very similar virus has circulated in the sampled regions in the recent past and that this activity began as early as 2009. Adult seropositive white-tailed deer were detected in Maine and Florida in 2009, and based on the estimated ages of affected deer (data not shown), the infections could have occurred as early as 2003. A much larger retrospective serosurvey is necessary to elucidate HRTV's history of emergence.

There are maps of state-level distribution of Heartland virus case reports in humans and seropositive wildlife, central and eastern United States, 2009-2014 and of geographic groupings of confirmed seropositive animals for Heartland virus neutralizing antibodies, central and eastern United States, 2009-2014.

[These reports indicate that Heartland virus is much more widespread geographically in the USA than previously thought. The detection of antibodies in the wild mammals tested does not prove that they are reservoirs or amplifying hosts of the virus. Experimental exposure to determine the amplitude and duration of resulting viremias and the ability to infect tick vectors would be required to establish their role as hosts in nature. The above study provides an important 1st step, and one hopes that it will stimulate additional research.
