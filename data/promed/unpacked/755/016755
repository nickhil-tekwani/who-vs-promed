African swine fever: suspected case in the state capital Potsdam (press release, 8 Jan 2021)

A cadaver of a wild boar, found in Gross Glienicke, has been found as suspected for African swine fever (ASF) by the Berlin-Brandenburg State Laboratory yesterday [Thu 7 Jan 2021] evening. The animal carcass is currently being transported to the National Reference Laboratory at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, "FLI") in Riems (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) for further tests and confirmation.

State Secretary for Consumer Affairs Anna Heyer-Stuffer, head of the ASF crisis team, said "Since September [2020] we have been fighting against the further spread of ASF from the Polish border to the west. At the same time, however, it is possible that the pathogen could, at any time, be carried on by humans even over long distances. We are in close coordination with Berlin about the suspected case in Potsdam, and the districts and authorities concerned have been informed. If the suspicion is confirmed, we will immediately take all necessary measures."

The 1st ASF outbreak in German wild boars was officially recorded in the state of Brandenburg on 10 Sep 2020.

African swine fever is an infectious systemic viral disease of swine (domestic and wild pigs), which is almost always fatal and incurable. There is no way to protect the pigs with preventive vaccination. The disease can be transmitted directly from animal to animal or indirectly via contaminated objects (clothing, shoes, vehicles) and food to other areas by humans. ASF is not contagious or dangerous for humans or other animal species.

[Gross (great) Glienike, a village located both in Berlin and Potsdam, the capital of the German state of Brandenburg, is situated nearly 100 km [62 mi] western to the German/Polish border. A map showing the location of Gross Glienike as well as the locations of infected wild boars sampled earlier in the affected territories in Germany and western Poland has been published in Twitter by Vincent ter Beek, editor of Pig Progress, and is available at https://twitter.com/vincenttb/status/1347497376886489088/photo/1.

If confirmed, this means a significant spread of ASF virus westward from eastern Brandenburg (444 cases) and northeast Saxony (17 cases), both stretched along the Polish border. Results of FLI's tests are anticipated soon. - Mod.AS
