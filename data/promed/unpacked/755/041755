[Though in the previous 2 days, 27 and 28 May 2010, the daily number
of new outbreaks decreased to 3 (compared to previous daily quota of
8-9), it seems to have returned to 6-8 per day. In any event, the
progressive destruction of the entire susceptible animal population in
and 10 km around the affected farms is expected to achieve soon the
planned eradication. - Mod.AS]

[Readers interested in why Japan is vaccinating animals slated for
slaughter are referred to the comment in (17) in this thread -- see
