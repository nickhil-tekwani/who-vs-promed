[The death of a Kansas man] from a vaping-related illness is the 2nd vaping-related death in the state, according to the Kansas Governor's office, and brings the death toll in the US to 9.

"Today [23 Sep 2019], I am saddened to announce the death of a 2nd Kansan in association with this outbreak," Kansas Governor Laura Kelly announced Monday in a press release.

The man was over the age of 50 and had underlying health conditions, according to the release. The 1st death in Kansas associated with vaping was a woman over the age of 50 who also had underlying health conditions.

Including the 2 deaths, Kansas has had 9 hospitalizations related to vaping, ranging in ages 17 to 67. 2 are still in the hospital.

Gov. Kelly said in the release the state's Department of Health and Environment (DHE) is "working tirelessly with other states and organizations to gather facts on e-cigarettes and its effects," and that Kansas is "coordinating a response to combat this epidemic, so that families can avoid such tragic outcomes."

The news out of Kansas comes amid other states' numbers of vaping-related illnesses and deaths continues to climb.

On [Fri 20 Sep 2019], it was reported there have now been 6 vaping-related deaths in Idaho, according to the Associated Press.

And as of last [Thu 19 Sep 2019], the Centers for Disease Control said there were 530 reported cases of severe lung illnesses linked to vaping in the country.

The Kansas DHE's Dr Lee Norman will testify in front of the United States House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on [Wed 25 Sep 2019] to provide his own insight into the effects vaping has on the body.

"E-cigarettes are unregulated, which means we don't know what's in them," he said in Gov. Kelly's press release. "And, of great concern to me, is that in the midst of all these illnesses being reported, the amount of young people using them is significant."

Half of the hundreds of reported cases are under the age of 25, the release said.

The Food and Drug Administration proposed a new rule on [Fri 20 Sep 2019] regulating the marketing of vaping products, Texas/Oklahoma station ABC KTEN reported [Mon 23 Sep 2019]. According to the outlet, e-cigarette products would only be allowed to be sold "after they've shown they can be marketed in a way best protecting public health."

[We are saddened by another death. While regulating what goes into the product may solve part or all of the problem, it is equally likely it will not.

There are a multitude of variables potentially contributing to the lethality of the situation. Until some of those variables can be moved up or down the scale to help determine what to focus on this is likely to continue to be a tragic situation.
