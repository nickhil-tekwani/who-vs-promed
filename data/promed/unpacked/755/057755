[Ref: N. Nejat et al: First report of a 16SrXIV, _Candidatus_
Phytoplasma cynodontis group phytoplasma associated with coconut
yellow decline in Malaysia. BSPP New Disease Reports, vol. 17]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The coconut palm (_Cocos nucifera_) is an important perennial oil
crop cultivated throughout Malaysia and is used for its aesthetic
appeal in landscapes. Symptoms of yellow decline have been observed
in a plantation in Selangor, similar to those caused by phytoplasma
groups of the lethal yellowing (16SrIV) type recorded from the
Americas, Caribbean, and Africa, and similar also to stolbur
(16SrXII) associated with Kalimantan wilt in Indonesia. Although not
widespread, this is the 1st report on such symptoms in coconut in
Malaysia. The lower canopy foliage initially turns light yellow and
eventually light brown, spreading rapidly to the younger leaves (Fig.
1). Also severe chlorosis of the emerging spear leaf, inflorescence
necrosis, premature nut fall, and gradual collapse of fronds occur,
and immature palms generally die within 5 months of initial symptom appearance.

Samples were collected from 20 symptomatic and 5 symptomless Malayan
red dwarf coconut palms. Malayan yellow dwarf and some tall coconuts
exhibited similar symptoms, but were not tested in this study. Total
DNA was extracted and assayed in a nested PCR [polymerase chain
reaction] assay with universal phytoplasma primers. Products of the
expected size (approximately 1200 basepairs and 880 bp, respectively)
were amplified from 8/20 symptomatic but not from any symptomless
coconut palms. Amplification also failed when LY (16SrIV) specific
primers were used, indicating that the phytoplasma was not from the
16SrIV group.

The phytoplasma 16SrDNA was cloned and sequenced and showed the
highest homology (99 percent) with those of Bermuda grass white leaf
phytoplasma from Thailand and Malaysia, members of the 16SrXIV
_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma cynodontis group. This group has previously
been found associated with a decline disease in date palm in Sudan.
However, this is the 1st report of a 16SrXIV phytoplasma associated
with yellow decline in Malaysia.

[Coconut palm is a vitally important subsistence and cash crop in
many poor regions, so much so that it is often called the "Tree of
Life". A number of phytoplasma diseases are known to affect this
crop. They include:

1. Lethal yellowing (LY) disease in the Americas and parts of Africa,
Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) disease in Ghana, as well as a number of
other strains or species described from different regions belonging
to the palm lethal yellowing (16SrIV) taxonomic group. LY can also
affect a number of other palm species.

2. Kalimantan wilt associated with a member of the stolbur group (16SrXII).

3. Kerala wilt (KW) in India, which is thought to belong to a
taxonomic group separate from other known phytoplasmas. Although a
recent report has placed it as a species within the lethal yellowing
group (see ProMED-mail post no. 20080225.0757), these results are now
under dispute.

4. A yellowing disease in Sri Lanka suspected to be caused by a
phytoplasma similar to sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma in the rice
yellow dwarf (16SrXI) taxonomic group. Further studies to confirm
these results are ongoing.

5. Natuna wilt caused by an as yet unclassified phytoplasma, and a
number of other coconut diseases in Asia also suspected to have a
phytoplasma aetiology.

Members of the 16SrXIV Bermuda grass white leaf phytoplasma group
(type member _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma cynodontis) have previously
been associated with 2 diseases of date palm in Northern Sudan: white
tip die-back (WTD) of young palms, and slow decline (SD) of mature
palms. The pathogens of WTD and SD were reported to have 99 percent
sequence homology (see links below).

While 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) sequences were adopted as a framework
for formal taxonomic classification of phytoplasmas, their taxonomy
is still being developed and uncertainties are reflected in the genus
name _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma. Generally, organisms with sequence
similarity of around 90 percent or higher would be considered to
belong to the same species, with any sequence variations indicating
different strains or races. However, within the major phytoplasma
groups this may not always be clear, especially if complete
nucleotide sequencing of the members has not been carried out, and
this is apparent in the report above.
