The plant pathology wing of the Uttar Banga Krishi Viswavidyalaya
(UBKV) [agricultural university] in Pundibari, has confirmed that the
pineapple disease at Bidhannagar (Kolkata) was caused by [the fungus]
_Fusarium_.
Mr Nilesh Bhowmick, horticultural officer in charge, [in the city of]
Siliguri, said the UBKV scientists who conducted tests on the
disease-affected pineapples, have verbally [communicated] their
findings to them. A detailed report is expected to reach the
horticulture department [in Siliguri] within a day or 2.
Meanwhile, the horticultural department will organise a sensitisation
camp for the pineapple growers at Bidhannagar, [to be held 23 May
2007, at Vidyasagar Mancha in Bidhannagar GP]. "Through the camp, we
would try to get further inputs from the pineapple growers on the
disease and at the same time suggest ways to tackle the situation,"
Mr Bhowmick said. In addition, considering the gravity of the
situation, a team of scientists from the Uttar Banga Krishi
Viswavidyalaya would visit Bidhannagar on 29 May 2007.

[The report does not state which species of _Fusarium_ was
identified. A number of "_Fusarium_ wilts" are known from a range of
other crop plants, which are mostly caused by different subspecies
and races of _F. oxysporum_. There is also a pineapple root rot
suspected to be caused by _F. affine_. However, symptoms caused by
these fungi differ from the ones described in West Bengal (see
ProMED-mail post 20070521.1614). Pineapple fruitlet core rot or
fusariosis is caused by the fungus _F. subglutinans_. Open flowers
constitute the main infection site for this pathogen, and the
symptoms reported from the area reflect this. Thus, it appears likely
that this is the species causing the problem.
This fungus depends on an opening on the plant surface for infection,
such as insect injuries, natural growth cracks, and mechanical
wounds. Spread occurs by wind, water, insects, or via infected
propagules. On pineapple inflorescences, _F. subglutinans_ has been
found associated with several insect species, which may be serving as
vectors. Infected volunteer plants constitute a source of inoculum.
Fusariosis may be controlled by fungicides or, in small planting
areas, by protecting the developing inflorescence from infection with
a paper bag. A range of resistant pineapple varieties is available.
Pineapple fusariosis has been reported from the Americas, Africa, and
Asia. For example, it is the major constraint of that crop in Brazil.
In addition to causing fruit losses of up to 80 percent, about 40
percent of propagative material may be infected and up to 20 percent
of the plants may die prior to harvest.
