[Please note that there may be discrepancies between the various sources of
information due to different times of "closure" of daily figures reported.
Times of daily report closures where known are listed in the table of
contents below. Newswires may mention a confirmed case in a location that
has not been on the official reporting entity list as the confirmation
arrived after closure of the day's report. As the number of reports has
been increasing, we have changed the format of the tables to give the
cumulative cases reported by the weeks ending on Fridays (1 May 2009, 8 May
2009, 15 May 2009) and then daily for the current week of reporting. The
daily summaries for prior dates can be found in all "case count" postings

ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall

[To summarize the current situation, as of 6:00 AM GMT on 25 May 2009 a
total of 12 515 cases and 91 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection have
been officially reported to WHO from 46 countries, up from 12 022 confirmed
cases and 86 deaths from 43 countries on 23 May 2009. According to a later
PAHO update (from 18:00 GMT-4) a total of 11 744 confirmed cases and 91
deaths are attributable to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in
15 countries in the Americas region. New countries confirming cases to WHO
include Iceland, Honduras, and Kuwait. According to newswires, Puerto Rico,
the Czech Republic, and Bahrain have each confirmed their 1st cases of
influenza A (H1N1) infection. In the case of Puerto Rico, the travel
history immediately preceding onset was during a cruise in the Eastern
Caribbean. Details on the number of passengers and crew on the cruise ship
and possible other cases of H1N1 infection identified on the ship were not
provided in the newswires. In addition, newswires are reporting a 2nd death
in Canada and a 12th death in the USA. Outside of Mexico it appears that
the deaths have been occurring in individuals with known pre-existing
medical conditions that are considered to be at high risk of severe disease
with influenza virus infection.

It is clear from the reports above that there is continued circulation of
influenza A (H1N1) in the North American countries (USA, Canada, Mexico)
and it looks as though transmission may be beginning to pick up
significantly in South America, with Chile having confirmed 74 cases as of
17:30 GMT-4 today (25 May 2009] (see <http://www.minsal.cl/>).
