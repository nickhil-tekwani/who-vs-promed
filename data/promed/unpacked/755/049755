The death toll linked to _Listeria_-contaminated cantaloupe in the
United States rose to 29 as another death was reported, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday [2 Nov
2011].

Whole or pre-cut Rocky Ford-brand cantaloupe from Colorado-based
Jensen Farms has been traced as the cause of what has become one of
the deadliest U.S. food-borne outbreaks in U.S. history. A total of
139 people in 28 states have fallen ill so far in the outbreak, and
the CDC has said that one woman, who was pregnant at the time she fell
ill, had a miscarriage.

The deadliest known food-borne listeriosis outbreak prior to the
current spate of illnesses in the United States was in 1985, when
Mexican-style soft cheese contaminated with _Listeria_ was tied to the
deaths of 18 adults, and 10 newborns, as well as 20 miscarriages,
according to a CDC report.

Listeriosis has a long incubation period, with symptoms sometimes not
showing up until 2 months after people consume tainted foods.

The elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems
are most at risk of falling ill from _Listeria_ infection. Symptoms
include fever and muscle aches, sometimes preceded by diarrhea and
other gastric problems.

In a warning letter to Jensen Farms last month, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration said testing turned up widespread _Listeria_
contamination at its Granada, Colorado, packing plant, which
"indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility."

Listeria outbreaks are most commonly linked to contaminated cheese or
packaged meats. The current outbreak is the 1st to be associated with
cantaloupe.

"What this shows is that these bugs are very opportunistic," food
safety attorney and advocate Bill Marler said. "As long as you have a
cool, wet environment and a product that is ready-to-eat, you're
always going to have a risk of _Listeria_ contamination, which is why
the sanitation of the plant is so critical," said Marler, who is
representing several families affected by the outbreak.

[The total number of people who have been sickened after eating whole
or pre-cut _Listeria moncytogenes_- contaminated cantaloupe from
Colorado-based Jensen Farms has risen from 133 to 139, the number of
states where cases have occurred has risen from 26 to 28, and the
number of deaths has risen from 28 to 29 since the last ProMED-mail
post, Listeriosis, fatal - USA (13): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths 20111026.3188. A discussion of listeriosis can be found in prior
ProMED-mail posts on this outbreak.

The long incubation period for listeriosis, with symptoms sometimes
not showing up until 2 months after people consumed the tainted food,
explains the continuing occurrence of new cases. On 14 Sep 2011, FDA
issued a press release to announce that Jensen Farms issued a
voluntary recall of their brand of Rocky Ford Cantaloupes because of
_Listeria_ contamination.

Initially cantaloupe from the Rocky Ford region of southeastern
Colorado was the suspected vehicle (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis,
fatal - USA (03) 20110914.2800). Subsequently, cantaloupe involved in
the listeriosis outbreak was traced specifically to cantaloupe from
Jensen Farm, which labeled its cantaloupe with the Rocky Ford name.
The FDA identified the recalled whole cantaloupes from Jensen Farm as
having a green and white sticker that reads: "Product of USA-Frontera
Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe," or a gray, yellow, and
green sticker that reads "Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords"
(http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm271879.htm). Photos of the
labeling can be seen at
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm271882.htm. Cantaloupe from
other farms in this region of southeastern Colorado have not been
implicated in this outbreak. - Mod.ML]
