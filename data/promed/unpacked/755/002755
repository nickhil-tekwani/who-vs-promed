Swine flu 'patient zero' found in Mexico
----------------------------------------
The world's 1st known swine flu victim was a 6-month-old baby girl in
northern Mexico who had no known contact with pig farms, the head of
a laboratory studying the virus said on Thursday [23 Jul 2009].

"It's a 6-month-old baby girl from San Luis Potosi who is alive" said
Celia Alpuche of the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and
Reference (INDRE) in Mexico City. The little girl 1st showed symptoms
of the new strain of the influenza A(H1N1) virus on [24 Feb 2009],
she said.

International attention has focused on 2 possible 'patient zeros,'
including a 5-year-old boy who lived near a pig farm in eastern
Mexico and a woman from Oaxaca, in the southeast, after the
government 1st raised the A(H1N1) alert 3 months ago. Both had
contracted the virus, which has now killed more than 700 people
worldwide, in April [2009].

But studies carried out on a backlog of samples show that a 1st
handful of recorded cases appeared in March [2009] in central and
northern Mexico, before any showed up further south, said Ms Alpuche.

"We have other positive samples in March from Baja California
(northwest), San Luis Potosi and Mexico City (centre)," Ms Alpuche
said, referring to results discovered around one month ago. "It's
complicated to say where it originated but the earlier samples are
not from rural areas, that's to say areas with farms (or) pigs," she
added.

Mexico's swine flu death toll now stands at 138, with almost 14 800
recorded cases, and the country has recently seen an upsurge of cases
in the impoverished southeast.

[The likelihood of this infant being the 1st case of influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in North America is next to nil, as the exposure
had to have come from another infected individual who this infant had
contact with -- and presumably there was no history of travel or
contact with travellers or this would have been mentioned by the
Mexican officials. The relevance of this finding is more directed on
exonerating the swine producing farms in Southern Mexico which have
been "blamed" for the origin of the pandemic strain, and have even
fallen victim to the litigious society north of the Mexican border.
Backtracing and trying to find the earliest cases is also helpful in
the quest to try to identify the actual origins of the pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus, since genetic studies have suggested genetic
components from European as well as Asian viruses. - Mod.MPP]
