Health officials have found the presence of _Shigella sonnei_ bacteria in the stool samples collected from 3 children who were hospitalized after being taken ill after consuming shawarma from an eatery at Cheruvathur in Kasaragod. Officials had sent the samples of children, who were hospitalized with vomiting and diarrhea, for testing to the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode.

Sudeep, Superintendent, Kannur Government Medical College Hospital (KGMCH), says the bacteria enter human body through contaminated water and food, and cause shigellosis. A 16-year-old girl died, and 31 others are undergoing treatment for food poisoning after they ate shawarma from a hotel at Cheruvathur on Friday [29 Apr 2022]. The test results of the samples taken from the girl who died and from 6 other children admitted to the KGMCH are yet to be received.

Meanwhile, the Health department initiated steps to collect water samples from the shop and nearby areas to identify the presence of _Shigella_ bacteria. They will also investigate the source from where the meat was procured and stuffed for making shawarma.

Meanwhile, officials said the condition of the children hospitalized in Kasaragod and at the KGMCH was stable. Of the 3 children in the intensive care unit at the KGMCH, 2 were shifted to wards on Tuesday [3 May 2022]. The other child would be shifted on Wednesday [4 May 2022]. The rest of the children were in observation and would be in the hospital for at least 4 more days to ensure their total recovery.

The Food Safety Department has sent a report to the Food Safety Commissioner and the District Collector on the episode. The eatery had no license. Water and food samples collected from the shop will be sent for lab analysis.

[_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea).

A relatively recent review on shigellosis follows:

"Abstract
-------
Shigellosis is a clinical syndrome caused by invasion of the epithelium lining the terminal ileum, colon, and rectum by _Shigella_ species. Although infections occur globally, and in people of all ages, endemic infections among children aged 1-4 years living in low-income and middle-income settings constitute most of the disease burden. The versatile manifestations of these highly contagious organisms range from acute watery diarrhoea to fulminant dysentery characterised by frequent scant bloody stools with fever, prostration, and abdominal cramps. A broad array of uncommon, but often severe, intestinal and extraintestinal complications can occur. Despite marked reductions in mortality during the past 3 decades, there are roughly 164 000 annual deaths attributable to shigellosis. Intercontinental dissemination of multiresistant shigella strains, facilitated by travellers and men who have sex with men, has prompted new recommendations for antibiotic therapy. Awareness of disease burden and the emerging threats posed by shigella have accelerated interest in development of shigella vaccines, many of which are being tested in clinical trials."
