1st case of rabies in 50 years found in Haywood County
-----------------------------------------
A raccoon in Haywood County has tested positive for rabies, the 1st such
case in the county in 50 years.
The raccoon was tested after the animal bit an Allen's Creek woman,
according to Bob Wood, Haywood County's health director.
The woman is in good condition and undergoing treatment, which involves a
series of 6 shots administered one every 7 days. [Usually, the shots are
administered over a 28-day period. - Mod.TG]
"This is the first animal other than a bat since 1954 to test positive for
rabies in Haywood County," Wood said. North Carolina saw a rabies epidemic
in the 1950s, but it was brought under control by vaccinating dogs and cats.
While surrounding states have been battling rabies for years, it has only
been since 1990 that North Carolina again saw a renewed rabies outbreak,
according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. Rabies is
now a naturally occurring disease in wildlife and spreads from animal to
animal over time.
Rabies travels through the nervous system, eventually inflaming the brain.
Early symptoms include irritability, headache, fever, and sometimes itching
or pain at the site of the bite. The disease eventually progresses to
paralysis, spasms of the throat muscles, convulsions, and delirium. Without
preventive treatment, it is fatal. [The preventative treatment is
Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, and most likely is the series of injections
mentioned previously. - Mod.TG]
Layton Long, environmental health director at the Buncombe County Health
Center, said there are pre-exposure vaccines for people who may come into
contact with rabid animals through the course of their job, such as
veterinarians and animal control officers. But Long said the general public
doesn't need the vaccination.
The treatment of rabies exposure has also come a long way since the time a
person had to take 21 shots in the stomach. Today, most people need 5
rabies vaccinations in the arm spaced out over a 28-day period, as well as
a one-time dose of rabies immune globulin.
Wood said it was only a matter of time before a case surfaced in Haywood
County. Buncombe County led the state in documented rabies cases in 2003
with 70, according to the state laboratory. There were also 9 confirmed
cases in Henderson County and one in Jackson County during the same period.
A majority of those cases involved raccoons.
Wood said Haywood County residents should watch their dogs and cats.
"People should beware of any suspicious acting animals, wild or domestic,"
Wood said. "Do not go near wild animals, and notify animal control if they
are behaving suspiciously."
Dogs and cats are required by law to be vaccinated against rabies. An
animal's first rabies shot is good for one year, and boosters are good for
3 years.
The Haywood County Health Department will hold a special rabies clinic from
4 to 7 p.m. Tuesday at Hazelwood Elementary School. Shots will be offered
for 5 USD. Pet owners whose pets have never been vaccinated or those that
need a booster shot are encouraged to attend. Pet owners can also visit
their veterinarians for rabies shots.
