The North Dakota State University [NDSU] Diagnostic Lab and field
scouts are reporting an increase in wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV)
this year [2009]. This disease has been reported statewide in winter
and spring wheat, plus durum. The levels of severity range from
slight to severe.

To reduce the risk of carrying this disease into winter wheat this
fall [2009] and subsequent spring crops next year [2010], management
steps must be taken now to break the green bridge that allows the
mites and virus to survive, according to Joel Ransom and Marcia
McMullen, NDSU. They say the late harvesting of wheat and corn this
year [2009] may perpetuate the risk of the mites and virus surviving
along the green bridge. It is essential that growers do the best job
possible in controlling volunteers and following the winter wheat
planting date recommendations.

Research shows the risk of mite dispersal and virus spread tends to
follow an oval-shaped pattern extending from the northwest to the
southeast according to prevailing winds. If mite populations at the
source are high and the mite source is large, the mites and virus
will be spread across entire fields. The highest risk for WSMV is
planting winter wheat into a field with remaining green wheat
volunteers or some grassy weed hosts. Barley and oats, although not
commonly thought of as good hosts, also may harbor the disease, so
these volunteers also should be controlled.

[_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_) is
prevalent in North America, Russia, Eastern Europe, and has also been
reported from Australia and Argentina. It can infect wheat, maize
(some cultivars), grasses, and also oats and barley in experimental
inoculations. Heavy WSMV infection can cause complete crop failure in
wheat. The virus is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria tulipae_.
Larvae acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants and remain
infectious for approximately a week. The virus is not transmitted
congenitally to the progeny of the vector. WSMV can also be
mechanically transmitted and seed transmitted at a low level. Control
of the mite vector is difficult but disease management may include
controlling volunteer wheat and grassy weeds to minimise inoculum.
