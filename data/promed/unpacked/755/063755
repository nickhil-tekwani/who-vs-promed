A horse in Haan/North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) was tested positive for
equine infectious anemia (EIA).

This is the 1st case in NRW in more than 10 years; the authorities
have set up a control zone of 2 km (some sources say 10 km) around
the affected farm; movement restrictions are in place, and all horses
and donkeys in the zone will be blood tested.

The horse was put down, and the authorities are investigating the
possible route of the introduction of the virus.

Cases of EIA are very rare in Germany and occur usually in horses
imported from Eastern Europe.
