[We had a question earlier as to whether the problem had appeared in
baboons stealing (poisoned) fish on the drying racks - Mod.MHJ
I have asked around about the posioning and have found that it seems
to be more in Kenya than here. The way people talk about it is like
they have known it has been going on for some time. They are not
doing it or experiencing any problems in the Entebbe region.
As to the poison, I have asked people about the name you mentioned
["Ambush" or "Pounce," trade names for the pesticide permethrin and
nobody has heard of it.
Sorry I cannot be more specific.
