A village in Madagascar has been hit by a deadly outbreak of the bubonic plague, medical experts on the island have confirmed. Tests were carried out after at least 20 people in the village, near the northwestern town of Mandritsara, were reported to have died last week.

The International Committee of the Red Cross warned in October 2013 that Madagascar was at risk of a plague epidemic.

The disease is transmitted to humans via fleas, usually from rats, and is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. Essentially a disease of wild rodents spread by fleas, plague spreads to humans either by the bite of infected fleas or rats and does not spread from person to person. Patients develop swollen, tender lymph glands (called buboes) and fever, headache, chills, and weakness. It is treatable if caught early but can be lethal.

In 2012, Madagascar had 60 deaths from the plague, the world's highest recorded number. The Pasteur Institute of Madagascar confirmed on Tue 10 Dec 2013 that tests taken from bodies in the village last week showed that they had died of the bubonic plague.

The BBC's Tim Healy in the capital, Antananarivo, says health officials have now gone to the remote area to investigate.

The Pasteur Institute said there were concerns that the disease could spread to towns and cities where living standards have declined since a coup in 2009 and the ensuing political crisis.

[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. [The following paragraph of this posting is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4: 101-4:; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm]:

"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However, since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia [presence of bacteria in the blood] can cause a coagulopathy [clotting disorder, an impairment of the blood's ability to clot] producing the purpura [red or purple discolorations on the skin] seen in the "Black Plague" and can also spread to the lungs, causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-80; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL
