The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) TSE Advisory Committee will
meet on October 6 & 7, 1997, from 8:30am to 5:00pm both days, at the
Holiday Inn-Bethesda (Maryland), Versailles I & II. On October 6, the
committee will discuss FDA regulatory controls to address transmission of
CJD by human dura mater products. On Oct. 7, the committee will discuss
appropriate FDA actions concerning CJD-implicated "secondary" products
(i.e. products in which a CJD- implicated plasma derivative was either
added as an excipient or used as a reagent in the manufacturing process).
The meeting is open to the public and oral statements/presentations from
the public will be scheduled between about 8:45am and 9:30am. If you want
to make a formal statement/presentation, call William Freas or Jane Brown
(phone: 1-301-827-0314) before October 1, 1997.
