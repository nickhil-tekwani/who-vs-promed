600 students quarantined after 25 schoolmates fall ill
-----------------------------------------------
600 students of SM Teknik Teluk Intan were quarantined, after 25 of them
fell sick a day after 90 chickens, reared in the schools compound, died on
Friday 9 Jul 2004. The order was given, as the authorities feared the
students might have been affected by the virus which killed the chickens.
State Health, Science, Technology, and Environment Committee chairman Datuk
Tan Chin Meng confirmed the incident when contacted by Mingguan Malaysia.
He was quoted as saying that the students had undergone checks at the Teluk
Intan Hospital and had had their blood samples taken for analysis.
Samples were also taken from the dead chickens and sent to the Veterinary
and Health Departments in Kuala Lumpur.
However, Veterinary Services Department director-general Datuk Dr. Hawari
Hussein ruled out bird flu as the cause of the illness. He said tests on
the blood samples showed the fever was not caused by avian influenza.

Students free of bird flu: Malaysia
-----------------------------------
25 students, who developed a fever after some 90 chickens died at a
Malaysian agricultural college, will remain in isolation despite testing
negative for bird flu, an official said Mon 12 Jul 2004. "Based on lab
findings, tests have proved negative for avian flu," Ramlee Rahmat,
director for the health ministry's disease control division told AFP.
"It is only the common cold," he said, referring to the students who came
down with fever and exhibited influenza-like symptoms over the weekend,
after the birds died on Fri 9 Jul 2004.
The students would, however, remain in isolation at the school "as a
precautionary measure, as there has been a history of chicken deaths,"
Ramlee said. They will be released as soon as they recover, he added.
There has been no bird flu in Malaysia despite outbreaks in neighboring
Southeast Asian countries.
Health Minister Chua Soi Lek, in remarks published Mon 12 Jul 2004, said
the chickens were killed by the Newcastle Virus, not bird flu.
"This virus has minimal impact on humans, and we hope the situation will go
back to normal soon," he was quoted as saying by the Star.
China, Thailand and Viet Nam have all reported new cases in recent days,
sparking fears of a resurgence of the winter outbreak that left 24 people
dead and devastated the region's poultry industry.

43 new flu cases detected
--------------------------
43 new cases of flu were detected yesterday [Tue 13 Jul 2004] among
students of Sekolah Menengah Teknik (Pertanian), and the number under
quarantine doubled to 74.
The new cases were detected among students who returned to the school on
Sunday evening [11 Jul 2004] after spending the weekend at their respective
homes, State Education, Human Resources, and Multimedia Committee chairman
Datuk Dr. Zambry Abdul Kadir said today [14 Jul 2004].
After visiting the agriculture-based boarding school, he said that the
affected students, aged 16 and 17, also included an unspecified number who
were involved in taking care of broiler chickens, which died in the school
recently.
8 students from the earlier batch had recovered from their illness and were
allowed to resume classes, he said.
A check at the school showed that 4 hostel rooms had been cordoned off to
isolate the students, with 33 boys in 2 rooms and 41 girls in the other 2.
Zambry also made assurances that there was no "cover-up."
Meanwhile, the Hilir Perak District Health Officer, Dr. Zainol Ariffin
Mohammed, said that the symptoms manifested by the students here did not
seem to be typical of avian flu, such as a high rate of deaths within a
short period of time.
Some of the students had fallen ill 2 weeks ago, although it was not
reported until the recent scare over a possible outbreak of avian flu, he
said. "Usually those with avian flu would have blocked noses, but most of
these students only had runny noses," he told reporters.
He said the Health Department took phlegm samples and throat swabs, adding
that definitive tests using cultures would be completed by 23 Jul 2004 at
the earliest.
The school is the only one in the country offering practical training in
chicken-rearing. Of the 600-odd students at the school, 121 are given
practical training on chicken-rearing. The school's principal, Mahsuri
Abdullah, said this was the 1st time the school had experienced so many
students falling ill at the same time. 2 students, Hamee Jamaluddin Alias
and Nor Azlan Shah Saban, both 16, who were in the 1st batch to be
quarantined last Friday [9 Jul 2004], said they were feeling much better.
Since the sudden deaths of 137 chickens in the past 2 months, there was
concern over the possibility of a bird flu outbreak among the dozens of
students taking care of the birds.

[From the details accumulated between 12 and 14 Jul 2004, a connection
between the unclear, undiagnosed health condition in poultry, and the
(apparently ephemeral) clinical signs seen in the students, is far from
being established. More details regarding both are needed. In reference to
the poultry, the size of the flock, morbidity, mortality, and case-fatality
rates are missing, as well as description of the clinical symptoms, PM
findings, and performed laboratory tests. It would also be interesting to
note if any (aerosol?) vaccination has recently been performed in the
poultry premises or demonstrated to students.
Newcastle disease, which is endemic in Malaysia (Peninsular and Sarawak),
and absent since 2002 in Malaysia (Sabah), may occasionally cause
conjunctivitis in humans if close contact takes place. However, the report
does not mention observed conjunctivitis in the affected students of
Sekolah Menengah Teknik. - Mod.AS].
