New bat disease found in north east Missouri cave
-------------------------------------------------
Dozens of Missouri's bat caves will be closed as a result of the recent
discovery of white nose syndrome, a fungus responsible for killing more
than a million bats in the eastern United States. Officials with the
Missouri Department of Conservation confirmed on Monday [19 Apr 2010] that
the disease was detected in a little brown bat in a cave in Pike County in
the north eastern part of the state.

The deadly disease was first discovered in New York in 2006 and has been
rapidly spreading west. With the Pike County discovery, Missouri becomes
the 12th state with a confirmed case of white nose syndrome, state
conservation officials said.

"We've been tracking it move through Tennessee and thought we might have a
little grace period, at least a year anyway," said Bill Elliott, a Missouri
Department of Conservation cave biologist. "So, it was a bit of a surprise
that it jumped this far this fast."

State and federal biologists have been on the lookout for white nose
syndrome in Missouri caves for the last few years. Elliott credits a
sharp-eyed field biologist for spotting the Pike County bat, which had a
small growth on its wing but appeared healthy otherwise. "Clearly, this
disease is spreading quickly, but we also have more eyes out there than
ever before," Elliott said. "So early detection is definitely playing a role."

Many mysteries continue to surround white nose syndrome, which poses no
risk to humans and appears to be spread from bat to bat. Affected bats have
been found with white fungus typically on their noses. Their behavior is
altered, flying outside of caves during winter or clustering at the
entrance of a cave rather than inside.

Scientists suspect people may inadvertently spread the disease when they go
into caves, perhaps through fungal spores on hair, clothes or equipment.

That's why the US Forest Service last year [2009] voluntarily closed caves
in 20 states, including Missouri and Illinois, where there have been no
confirmed reports of the disease. In Missouri, access was restricted to 600
caves in the Mark Twain National Forest.

The discovery will trigger the closure of 80 bat caves on land managed by
the Missouri Department of Conservation, according to a plan approved by
the agency the day after the Pike County case was reported in mid-April
[2010]. Judd Slivka, spokesman for the Missouri Department of Natural
Resources, said the agency is evaluating what to do with the bat caves on
property it owns. Some of Missouri's most popular caves are in state parks
such as Onondaga and Meramec. The vast majority of Missouri's 6300 caves
are privately owned and will be unaffected by state or federal closure orders.

Still, Elliott said conservation officials hope to work with private
landowners to educate them about the symptoms of white nose syndrome. Scott
House, president of the Cave Research Foundation, said he anticipates most
cave enthusiasts will obey closure orders and work with land managers to
help identify the disease. "I think organized cavers will continue to do
the right thing," House said. "I would never go into a cave again if it
meant I was helping the local bat population."

Elliott said bats play a vital role in cave ecosystems. Not only do their
droppings provide food for other animals, they eat a number of pests such
as mosquitoes, and some moths and beetles. He estimated Missouri's 775 000
gray bats eat more than 223 billion bugs -- about 540 tons -- each year.

In coming weeks, state and federal officials, conservation groups and
private cave owners will be working on a plan to address the threat of
white nose syndrome to local bat populations. Missouri is home to at least
12 species of bats, including 2 endangered species, the gray and Indiana bats.

Biologists also will continue to survey caves, looking for signs of white
nose syndrome. "My guess is, now that we've found it in one cave, it's
probably here in others," Elliott said. "It's just a matter of looking."

Bat-killing fungus confirmed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Biologists at Great Smoky Mountains National Park have received
confirmation that a bat collected from White Oak Blowhole cave [on the
Tennessee side of Great Smoky Mountains National Park] tested positive for
the fungus believed to cause the fatal white nose syndrome [WNS] that has
been decimating bat populations in the north east.

White Oak Blowhole cave contains the largest known Indiana bat hibernacula
in Tennessee. The Indiana bat is a federally listed endangered species.
White nose syndrome has killed more than 90 per cent of the bats in many of
the caves and mines in the north east, and is just now showing up in the
south east.

The fungal infection of 1 of the 2 bats collected in the park was confirmed
by the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison,
Wisconsin. In addition to confirming the fungal infection of the little
brown bat, a common bat species, photographs taken of federally listed
Indiana bats in the cave were found consistent with the early stages of WNS.

"We closed all of the Park's 17 caves and 2 mine complexes to any public
entry a year ago [2009] to prevent the possible importation of the WNS
pathogen on visitor's clothing or gear, but scientists have confirmed that
bat-to-bat transmission of the fungus occurs," Park wildlife biologist Bill
Stiver said. "We take this very seriously because national parks are often
the primary refuge that endangered species can count on for protection."

The park's caves will remain closed. Rangers are increasing their
enforcement to reduce the likelihood that visitors might transport the WNS
pathogen to uninfected colonies either in the Park or elsewhere. Violators
face fines of up to 6 months in jail or USD 5000.

White nose syndrome is named for the white fungus that forms on the faces
of many infected bats. Just how the fungus causes death in the bats is
still being investigated. "While a lot of people may misunderstand and even
dislike bats," Stiver said, "they may be hugely important in controlling
the population of many insect pests. We are very concerned about the
potential decline of bats from both an ecological and human health standpoint."
