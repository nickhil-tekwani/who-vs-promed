UK (England): Final confirmation of identity avian flu virus strain
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Deputy chief vet Fred Landeg today (Tue 13 Feb 2007) confirmed that
the laboratory analysis of the Suffolk and Hungary H5N1 avian
influenza viruses is now complete.
The Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA) analysis has revealed a very
high similarity (99.96%) between the H5N1 viruses found in Suffolk and
the Hungarian outbreaks at the whole genome level. These results
indicate that the viruses are essentially identical.
"Although other European viruses have shown close relationships to
these viruses, these levels of identity are much closer than with
other Asian lineage H5 viruses for which data are available, including
those isolated from wild birds in Europe in 2005/06," VLA chief avian
virologist Ian Brown said. "The comparison between the UK and
Hungarian viruses reveals a high level of genetic match which cannot
be said of other European virus strains."
Fred Landeg added: "I am grateful for the hard work of the VLA which
has informed our investigation and current working hypothesis that
poultry to poultry transmission is the most likely source of the
outbreak. However, I must reiterate that we are not discounting any
line of enquiry and this is an ongoing investigation."
On the public health aspects of the investigation Dame Deirdre Hutton
(chair of the Food Standards Agency) commented: "The investigation so
far has not found anything that raises the risk to public health.It is
still a possibility that infected poultry has entered the food chain
but the risk to public health remains low."

UK (England) Bird flu mystery deepens as Hungary rejects link
-------------------------------------------------------------
The mystery over the origin of Britain's avian flu outbreak deepened
today when the Government claimed that the strain of the disease found
in Suffolk was "essentially identical" to recent cases in Hungary, but
Hungarian officials denied any connection.
Since the outbreak at a Bernard Matthews turkey farm near Holton, in
Suffolk, on 3 Feb 2007, public health officials have been closely
scrutinising the movement of poultry products to and from the plant
and two facilities used by the company in Hungary.
Traces of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu were discovered at a
goose farm in the eastern Csongrad region of Hungary in the last week
of January. Since then, Bernard Matthews has imported and exported
meat from a SaGa plant it owns in Sarvar, 160 miles from the outbreak,
and an abbatoir at Kecskemet, just miles from the Hungarian exclusion zone.
The coincidence, and similarity between the genetic make-up of the two
occurrences of the virus, led the Government's chief scientific
adviser, Sir David King, to declare last week that infection from
Hungary was "the most likely scenario".
Although the Environment Secretary, David Miliband, insisted yesterday
that the investigation continues to study other possibilities, that
theory appeared to be strengthened today by Britain's Veterinary
Laboratory Agency, which said the Suffolk strain of H5N1 was
"essentially identical" to the Hungarian outbreak.
The H5N1 virus that led to the culling of 160 000 turkeys at the
Bernard Matthews plant was 99.96 per cent the same [over the whole
genome - Mod.CP] as the strain which infected geese in southern
Hungary, the VLA found."These results indicate that the viruses are
essentially identical," the laboratory's chief avian virologist Ian
Brown said in a statement.
"Although other European viruses have shown close relationships to
these viruses, these levels of identity are much closer than with
other Asian lineage H5 viruses for which data are available, including
those isolated from wild birds in Europe in 2005/06."
Britain's deputy chief vet, Fred Landeg, said the working hypothesis
was now that the virus had been transmitted from poultry to poultry
rather than through wild birds or other animals. "However, I must
reiterate that we are not discounting any line of inquiry and this is
an on-going investigation," he said.
But Hungarian officials have disputed the value of comparing the DNA
[i.e. the RNA genomes - Mod.CP] of the two strains, saying that cases
across the world only vary very slightly, and today issued a strong
denial of any link between the outbreaks. Hungary's chief vet, Miklos
Suth, reported today that no evidence had been found of how the virus
could have spread from meat products in Hungary to Suffolk. "According
to our knowledge today there is no such evidence," he said in
Budapest. "It can almost be ruled out."
Mr Suth said that the SaGa plant, owned by Bernard Matthews, had no
contact with the infected region in the south east of the country,
while none of the sources for Gall Foods, the abattoir closer to the
exclusion zone, had tested positive for the virus. Instead, Budapest
remains angry that shipments of raw meat continued to be exported from
the Bernard Matthews plant to Hungary even after the site was
identified as infected, raising the risk that H5N1 was transported
back to Central Europe.
Mr Suth pointed out today that 365 tonnes of turkey products were
moved from the SaGa site in Sarvar to England between November 2006
and February, while 622 tonnes moved the other way. He said that raw
meat exported by Bernard Matthews since the outbreak was confirmed had
now been isolated.
The European Commission gave its approval today to the Hungarian
inquiry into the outbreak and possible links to the British case. "We
are satisfied with the Hungarian investigations and are happy they
have acted accordingly," said a spokesman. "They told us at a meeting
which also included British representatives that they had carried out
tests at two Bernard Matthews plants outside of the one where bird flu
had been found in Hungary and that there was no suspicion of it there."
As the likelihood of pinpointing the route by which the H5N1 virus
entered the country appeared to recede, turkey slaughtering began once
again the Bernard Matthews plant in Suffolk. Yesterday the Meat
Hygiene Service (MHS) re-licensed the site's slaughter houses after
they had been disinfected.
Today the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
said that an MHS inspector would be on hand as birds were brought into
the qurantined "protection zone" to be killed. "They will not come
into contact with other birds or meat from the protection zone. There
will be no risk to the public. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advises
that avian flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers," Defra said.

[The 99.96% similarity of the RNA sequences of the genomes of the H5N1
avian influenza viruses isolated from turkeys in the UK and from geese
in Hungary, and the absence of an obvious precursor, justifies the
conclusion that these viruses are isolates of the same strain of H5N1
avian influenza virus. Questions which remain unresolved, and which
may not be resolved by sequence analysis alone, are firstly the origin
of this unique turkey/goose strain of virus and secondly the direction
of travel of the infection -- from Hungary to England as presently
supposed or from England to Hungary. - Mod.CP]
