The Ocean County Health Department, in collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, is currently investigating multiple reports of mumps in Lakewood Township [New Jersey]. The majority of cases is in fully immunized young adults and may have spread to household and other close contacts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all children and adults of vaccination age have 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Strict enforcement of vaccination is important for preventing and stopping outbreaks. Mumps vaccine (usually MMR) is the best way to prevent mumps. Children should be given the 1st dose of MMR vaccine soon after the 1st birthday (12 to 15 months of age). The 2nd dose is recommended before the start of kindergarten.

Symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite; followed by swelling of salivary glands. The parotid salivary glands (which are located within the cheek, near your jaw line, below your ears) are most frequently affected. While rare, other severe complications are possible -- seeking medical attention at the onset of symptoms is important.

Mumps occurs worldwide and there are still outbreaks in the United States. Humans are the only known host to mumps. Outbreaks can occur in highly immunized populations, most often in people who have not been immunized; however, there have been outbreaks in individuals who are fully immunised. Mumps virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract and is spread through direct contact with respiratory secretions or saliva. The infectious period or time that an infected person can transmit mumps to a non-infected person is from 3 days before symptoms appear to about 9 days after the symptoms appear. The incubation time, which is the period from when a person is exposed to virus to the onset of any symptoms, can vary from 16 to 18 days (range 12-25 days).

Individuals, whether they have been vaccinated against mumps or not, [who] exhibit the above symptoms, need to seek medical attention immediately to be evaluated. Anyone who is being considered [as] having a possible case of mumps needs to be appropriately excluded from social settings that may enable transmission, and should be immediately reported to the Ocean County Health Department. Anyone with mumps should not go back to child care, school or work for at least 5 days after symptoms begin. It is extremely important that individuals who may have been in contact with a suspected mumps case should be educated on the signs and symptoms of mumps and should seek medical attention if any of these symptoms begin.

[Unfortunately, this report provides little information concerning the number of cases diagnosed, the ages of the victims and their vaccination status. This information is important because the risks for transmission of measles, rubella, and mumps at post-high school educational institutions can be high because these institutions bring together large concentrations of persons who may be susceptible to these diseases. Therefore (in the United States), colleges, universities, technical and vocational schools, and other institutions for post-high school education require that all undergraduate and graduate students have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before enrolment. Students who do not have documentation of MMR vaccination or other acceptable evidence of immunity at the time of enrolment should be admitted to classes only after receiving the 1st dose of MMR vaccine. These students should be administered a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine one month later (but no sooner than 28 days after the 1st dose).

Lakewood Township is a township in Ocean County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census the township had a total population of 92 843. The township ranked as the 7th-most-populous municipality in the state in 2010 after having been ranked 22nd in 2000. The sharp increase in population from 2000 to 2010 was led by increases in the township's Orthodox Jewish and Latino communities. Lakewood is one of the hubs of Orthodox Judaism and is home to one of the largest yeshivas in the world. The large Orthodox population comprises more than half of the township's population. This may explain the occurrence of mumps virus infection in the township, since Orthodox Jewish communities in general decline to have their children vaccinated.
