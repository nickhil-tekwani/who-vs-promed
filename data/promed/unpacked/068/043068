After 3 years without causing a fatality in Maranhao, hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, a disease caused by hantavirus and transmitted by infected wild
rodents, took another victim. On 6 Jul 2006, a 26 year old farmer died in
the Sao Luis Hospital after coming down with the disease. The patient lived
in the village of Roncador, Anajatuba Municipality.
According to the infectious disease specialist Wellington Melo, coordinator
of the Hantavirosis Project of the lower western zone of Maranhao, after
the death of the worker 120 inhabitants of Roncador have been evaluated.
Blood samples from 30 people have been collected and will be sent to the
Evandro Chagas Institute in Belem. "It seems to have been an isolated case.
To be certain if an outbreak has occurred or not we will only know after
the analysis which will be issued in 30 days," he said. The municipalities
are on alert.
The infectious disease expert indicated that the 1st outbreak of hantavirus
infection in Maranhao was notified in Mar 2000. From 2000 to 2003, 7 cases
of the disease were notified, with 4 deaths confirmed, but other people may
have died as well. "There must have been double the number of confirmed
deaths," Melo estimated.
According to this infectious disease expert, transmission of hantaviruses
is by inhalation of dust containing the excrement of infected rodents. Wild
rodents are found in places that have flooded fields in the lower areas of
Maranhao; the rodents enter rural houses where the inhabitants store rice
and maize (corn). After feeding, these rodents excrete virus in feces and
urine. The feces dry and become dusty, and this dust is inhaled by the
inhabitants when the house is swept.
A serological survey for hantavirus antibodies in 6 municipalities drawn
from lower Maranhao gave positive results an all municipalities. Based on
this research, the experts concluded that 5 per cent of the population of
the 21 municipalities had contact with the virus. In order to avoid an
epidemic, the inhabitants of this area are being instructed to build wooden
platforms 40 centimetres above the ground to impede rodents feeding on the
stored grains.

interesting to know which of the South American hantaviruses was the
etiological agent in this case. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving
information on the virus type involved if available. - Mod.TY]
