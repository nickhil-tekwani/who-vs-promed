[1] Cholera - Mozambique (Sofala)

Cholera poses bigger threat in central Mozambique
-------------------------------------------------
With 4 new cases of cholera diagnosed over the weekend, the total
number of cases recorded in the central Mozambican province of Sofala
since late Jan 2005 has risen to 46, local media reported on Tue, 1
Mar 2005.
Although the disease has only claimed 1 life in the province so far,
the provincial health authorities described the situation as very
alarming. Health Director of the Marromeu district, where the new
cases occurred, Lopes Mangane expressed fears that because of the
rains, the disease may spread to other areas of the province, since
the continual downpours are worsening the already poor hygienic
conditions. Mussa Ibraimo, chief doctor in Beira, the provincial
capital, said that so far 15 activists have been working in
door-to-door prevention campaigns.

At least 51 people have died and hundreds been hospitalized following
a major outbreak of cholera in southwestern Nigeria, health officials
said on Tue, 1 Mar 2005.
5 people died in the Owan East local government area of Edo state on
Sun, 27 Feb 2005 and 46 others died in the remote mining village of
Kusa, 110 km (68 miles) north of the city of Ibadan where the 1st
case was reported 11 days ago.
The deaths come 3 months after 50 people died in a similar outbreak
in Edo. Cases of the deadly disease have been on the increase in the
past year in Africa's most populous country, where most people live
on less than a dollar a day.
"It has been confirmed that 46 people, including children, died in
the outbreak of cholera in Kusa," Lekan Kolade, Oyo state Health
Ministry spokesman, said by phone from Ibadan.
More than 1600 Africans died of cholera in 2004, an intestinal
infection spread by contaminated food and water, according to the WHO
figures. WHO said 126 people died of the deadly infection in Nigeria,
the world's 8th biggest oil exporter, between Oct-Nov 2004. 50 of
the deaths were in Edo state and 76 in the northern city of Kano.

[It is interesting to see that none of these reports specifies the strain of
cholera involved, as if that has no epidemiological significance. If anyone
can give ProMED that information, it would be most welcome. - Mod.JW]
