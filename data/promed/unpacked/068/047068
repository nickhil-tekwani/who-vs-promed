Cholera in Iraq -- 10 Sep 2007
--------------------
Between 23 Aug 2007 and 6 Sep 2007, the cumulative number of cases of
acute watery diarrhoea reported from 5 out of 11 districts of
Sulaymaniyah Governate stands at 3182 including 9 deaths (case
fatality rate, CFR: 0.3 percent). Of these reported cases, _Vibrio
cholerae_ has been laboratory confirmed in 283 stool specimens.
During the period from 29 Jul 2007 to 2 Sep 2007, the health
authority of Kirkuk Governate reported a total of 3728 cases of acute
diarrhoeal disease including 1 death (CFR: 0.03 percent). The 1st
index case of cholera, confirmed by laboratory test, was reported
from Kirkuk Governate on 14 Aug 2007. Most recently, 6
laboratory-confirmed cases of cholera were reported from Erbil Governate.
The Government of Iraq has mobilised a multi-sectoral response to the
outbreak. A high-level National Committee on Cholera Preparedness and
Outbreak Response has been established. The provincial health
authorities of Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk and Erbil Governates have
initiated a number of public health control measures to contain the
outbreak, including risk assessment, improving water safety and
sanitation, strengthening the surveillance system for diarrhoeal
disease, improving coordination and information flow, standardising
clinical case management, mobilising medical and other essential
supplies, and implementing social mobilisation and health education
campaigns. All public water supply systems in the affected districts
have been chlorinated by the provincial authorities. In addition,
water samples from the public water supply sources are being
collected and tested routinely to ensure they meet potable water
safety standards.
WHO, UNICEF, UNDP [United Nations Development Programme],
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a number of
non-governmental organisations including the International Medical
Corps (IMC), and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF - France) [Doctors
Without Borders] are supporting the Ministry of Health and local
health authorities in ongoing response operations.
In controlling the spread of cholera WHO does not recommend any
special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas.

Overview
--------
As of 8 Sep 2007, 12 districts of northern Iraq have reported
laboratory-confirmed cases of cholera putting over 2.8 million people
exposed to public health risk from this current outbreak. 5 out of 11
districts of Sulaymaniyah province, all 5 districts of Kirkuk
province, and 2 out of 7 districts of Erbil province are now affected
by this cholera outbreak in northern Iraq. This outbreak has, so far,
claimed 10 lives in northern Iraq.
So far between 23 Aug 2007 and 7 Sep 2007 in Sulaymaniyah province,
the cumulative number of cases of acute watery diarrhea [a term often
using instead of cholera - Mod.LL] reported from 5 out of 11
districts stands at 4840 including 9 deaths with an overall case
fatality rate (CFR) of 0.18 percent. In Sulaymaniyah province,
_Vibrio cholerae_ has been laboratory confirmed in 315 stool
specimens out of 1629 specimens (19 percent) collected so far.
During the period from 29 Jul 2007 to 2 Sep 2007, the health
authority of Kirkuk province reported a total of 3728 cases of acute
diarrheal disease including one death (CFR 0.026 percent). The 1st
index case of cholera, confirmed by laboratory test, was reported
from Kirkuk province on 14 Aug 2007. So far, from the Kirkuk
province, a total of 291 stool specimens [5 percent] out of 5610
samples collected so far have tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_.
Out of these, 116 stool specimens out of 3207 samples (4 percent)
collected tested positive in the month of August 2007 and 175 stool
specimens out of 2403 stool specimens (7 percent) tested positive in
the 1st week of September 2007 so far.
On 6 Sep 2007, a laboratory-confirmed case of cholera was reported
for the 1st time from one of the districts (Erbil centre) of Erbil
province. Later on, a laboratory confirmed case was also reported
from Koisnjaq district. So far 21 stool specimens from these 2
districts of Erbil province have tested positive for _Vibrio
cholerae_ serogroup O1 Inaba signifying that cholera has now spread
to 3 provinces of northern Iraq (Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk, and Erbil).
[The] cumulative number of cases of acute watery diarrhea since the
1st index case of _Vibrio cholerae_ was laboratory confirmed is still
not available.
Pattern of transmission in Sulaymaniyah
---------------------------------------
As of 8 Sep 2007 outbreak, since reported for the 1st time on 23 Aug
2007, has spread to 5 out of 11 districts in the province [a map of
the province can be seen at the source URL - Mod.LL] exposing over
1.1 million people living in this province to this epidemic risk. As
accumulation of surveillance data from the field shows signs of
improvement, the epidemiological trend of the outbreak becomes more
conspicuous.
The daily progression of cases, as shown in figure 1 [which can be
found at the original URL - Mod.LL], shows that barring some
inadequacy and incompleteness in reporting, the number of cases
reported from Sulaymaniyah province has been progressively increasing
since the outbreak unfolded on 23 Aug 2007. The reported number of
cases is still fluctuating from one reporting period to another and
no particular trend (whether upward or downward) is evident from the
curve. Nonetheless, improvement in reporting cases from the field in
consistent manner is noticeable in recent time compared to the
beginning of the outbreak.
It is also unclear (because of lack of representative data) whether
the cases are increasing or declining in any particular district
compared to other affected districts in the province. The
epidemiological trend of the outbreak, therefore, needs to be
monitored closely in order to follow its progression over time and to
assess the effectiveness of specific control measures undertaken in
the field for its containment. As has been reported, recent
information received from the field suggests that the number of
severe cases of dehydration reporting to health centres and hospitals
is decreasing with mainly cases of mild dehydration currently
reporting to the health centers for treatment. Nevertheless, due to
lack of comparable data, the epidemiological trend of the prevailing
situation needs to be interpreted with caution.
The majority of cases reported from Sulaymaniyah province belong to
the over 5-year age group. Comparable data on distribution of
reported cases by 2 broad age groups (under 5 and over 5 years),
available since 29 Aug 2007, reveals that between 29 Aug 2007 and 7
Sep 2007, a total of 3509 cases of acute watery diarrhea were
reported in the above 5-year age group from Sulaymaniyah province
compared to only 470 cases reported during the same period in the
below 5-year age group.
All evidence suggests that the transmission of _Vibrio cholerae_ is
still circulating in the province and it spread to another new
district (Garmian) in the province last week [3-9 Sep 2007]. A recent
observation report from the field has also indicated that higher
incidence of acute watery diarrhea cases is reported amongst the
people using the well water (without treatment) than either the tap
water or from the well water after treatment.
