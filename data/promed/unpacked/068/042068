From 1 to 21 Jan 2007, the Ministry of Health has reported 241
suspected cases including 16 deaths (case-fatality rate, 6.6 percent)
in Arua/Maracha-Terego, Koboko, and Yumbe districts, an area
bordering South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The
population in the affected districts consists of both refugees and
nationals living in rural, densely populated settlements. Three
cerebrospinal fluid specimens have tested positive for _Neisseria
meningitidis_ serogroup A by latex test.
Case management has been initiated, community mobilization and
education are ongoing, and surveillance is being strengthened to
ensure early case detection and monitoring of the epidemic. A
vaccination campaign is being prepared, targeting 334 124 people [an
extraordinarily accurate census! - Mod.JW] in the affected area. The
Ministry of Health is planning to request 400 950 doses of bivalent
meningococcal vaccine (A/C) from the International Coordinating Group
(ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control, along
with injection materials, oily chloramphenicol, transport media, and
rapid-test kits.

[Unlike the initial non-WHO report in ProMED ref. 20070123.0300,
there is no mention of any serogroup other than A.
