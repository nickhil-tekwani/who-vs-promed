Thailand: One of Worst Epidemics of Dengue Fever On Record
----------------------------------------------------------
Thailand will launch a week-long campaign starting next Monday to curb the
rampant wave of dengue fever, the Department of Communicable Disease
Control announced here on Friday. A statement from the Department said that
the situation concerning dengue haemorhagic fever (DHF) this year is
getting worse. From the beginning of the year until 4 Aug 2001, a total of
74 971 people fell ill and 139 died after infection [with dengue fever virus.
Of Thailand's 76 provinces [the 10 that had the highest incidence of
dengue fever [included Chon Buri, Nakhon Sawan, Phisanulok, Uthai Thani,
Sa Kaew, Yala, Songkhla, Rayong, Lopburi, and Pattani. The highest
mortality rate was recorded in another 10 provinces, namely Narathiwat,
Yasothon, Chumphon, Suphan Buri, Chainat, Prachuab Khirikhan, Nong Bua
Lamphu, Trat, Surin and Chiang Rai.
The Department said Thailand expects [to attain effective control of the
disease [as a result of the campaign; [since the current average
mortality rate of 0.2 percent is lower than the 0.5 percent average rate in
the world. It pointed out that patients who are brought to doctors in time
can be saved. At the same time, precautionary measures have to be taken in
the households by eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

[The discordance between provinces reporting highest incidence and highest
mortality suggests circulation of different Dengue virus serotypes. Further
information from the Thai authorities would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
