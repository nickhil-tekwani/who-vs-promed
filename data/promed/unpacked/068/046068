[Gordon's Bay is a harbour town in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is on the northeastern corner of False Bay, about 50 km from Cape Town to the south of the N2 (South Africa) national road and is named after Robert Jacob Gordon (1743-1795), the Dutch explorer of Scottish descent. Gordon's Bay is the smallest of 3 towns in the Helderberg region, so named after the Helderberg Mountain, which is part of the Hottentots-Holland. Its location can be found in the map at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon%27s_Bay. - Mod.CP

[The figures are confusing. It is presumed that "treatment" in the case of measles refers to administration of vaccine rather than the treatment of sick children. Clarification would be welcomed. - Mod.CP

5 children died last month [September 2014] from suspected measles virus infection, while 65 others in some remote barangays in Kabacan town in North Cotabato were reported to have shown symptoms of the illness, a local health official said.

Rural Health Unit (RHU) Disease Surveillance Coordinator Joy Cabellon said the fatalities and the cases they have documented were in September 2014 alone. Cabellon did not disclose the identities of the victims but said they were residents of Barangays Pisan, Nangaan, and Kilagasan.

Also, she said 65 residents in the 3 barangays had skin rashes -- one of the symptoms of measles -- adding that of that number, 34 were males and 31 females, mostly children aged 0-4 years old.

Barangay Pisan has the largest number of suspected measles cases, with 43, followed by Barangays Simone and Kayaga with 17 and 12 cases, respectively. "We would like to point out that despite these cases, the RHU has not declared an outbreak in the affected barangays," Cabellon said.

Efforts at giving free measles vaccines to children ages 0-59 months in Kabancan's far-flung barangays are being fast-tracked, she added.

3 more people have died from measles in the Solomon Islands, bringing the death toll from the outbreak to 6, with 2300 cases reported so far. The Emergency Operations centre in the Ministry of Health released the statistics today [26 Sep 2014] to counter misleading reports in the local newspapers that cases were on the decline. The incident controller at the [Health] centre, Dr Aaron Oritaimae, says there has been a dramatic rise in the rate of infection, with 829 cases reported in the last week alone.

200 000 additional doses of measles-rubella vaccine, which arrived in the capital, Honiara, yesterday [25 Sep 2014], are the main line of defense, and authorities are scrambling to vaccinate the population to curb the spread of the highly contagious infection.

People attending the World of Wearable Art awards in Wellington and at Queensgate Mall last week may have been exposed to measles.

Regional Public Health says a person who did not know they were in the early stages of measles was at the evening event on 24 Sep 2014 as well as the Lower Hutt mall earlier in the day. Medical Officer of Health Dr Annette Nesdale says the organisation will be trying to contact people who were sitting close to the person, who was seated in Block A, row E and around seats 12 to 31. However, she says because measles is infectious and airborne, everyone who was at the event at the TSB Arena should watch for symptoms of the illness.

Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that starts on the face and neck before spreading to the rest of the body. It can take up to 2 weeks for someone who has caught measles to show symptoms, so those infected will start to feel ill between 3 and 8 Oct 2014. Anyone who was at the mall or at the event who feels ill should contact their doctor or call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for advice. Dr Nesdale says it is important to call ahead before going to the doctor because of the measles' infectious nature.
