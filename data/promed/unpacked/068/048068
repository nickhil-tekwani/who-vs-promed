[1] Peru (Loreto)
Date: Mon 3 Jan 2011
From: Juan Celis <charapa3@yahoo.com> [in Spanish, trans. Mod.JT, edited]


For the 1st time in 20 years after the reintroduction of dengue in the
Peruvian Amazon, there is an outbreak of dengue-2, with an unusual number
of severe cases. Health services are receiving an overload of cases with
warning signs and have already reported the 1st death from dengue.

In Iquitos [Loreto region] all serotypes of dengue (1-4) have already
circulated, however only mild and sporadic cases of dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF) I-II were reported. However, in this outbreak an unusual number
of cases are being observed with warning signs (basically vomiting and
abdominal pain with ultrasonographic signs of extravasation of
plasma-ascites), mostly in children.

It is thought to be due to the introduction of dengue-2 genotype III
Asian/American [virus] in Brazil and was associated with a large number of
severe cases with increased mortality.

Health authorities are implementing contingency measures in hospitalization
and emergency services; a greater influx of cases is expected since the
reporting of the outbreak began in December 2010.

[2] Cambodia

Cambodia registered 12 347 cases of dengue fever which left 37 people dead,
mostly children, in 2010, said a health official on Friday [31 Dec 2010].

"The number of cases in 2010 increased 6 per cent, compared with 11 652
cases reported in 2009, but the death toll is the same," Ngan Chantha,
director of dengue control at the Ministry of Health, told Xinhua.

Dengue fever happens mostly in the rainy season from May to October; it is
estimated that USD 1.28 million have been spent for the medical treatment
of the disease in 2010, he said.

However, the death toll from dengue fever has declined sharply from 407
people in 2007, to 65 in 2008, and 37 each in 2009 and 2010, according to
the report from the Ministry of Health.

"This is mainly thanks to our constant education about the danger and
infectious source of the dengue fever," he said. "Moreover, we have trained
our health staff to be more aware of the symptoms of the disease and use
the right medicines to cure it."

[According to the newswire above, officials stated that the number of cases
of dengue fever in Cambodia in 2010 was 12 347 and 37 deaths. Although
there is an increase in the number of dengue cases in 2010 compared to
2009, the case fatality rate (CFR) has been a little bit lower in 2010 than
in 2009 (0.32).

According to the number of reported cases of dengue fever and dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) in the Western Pacific region by country from
WHO's Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO) dated 11 Oct 2010
(available at http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/), there were
9996 cases and 29 deaths of dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) in Cambodia in the 1st 9 months of 2010, with a CFR of 0.29.

The total number of dengue fever cases in 2009 was 11 699 cases and 38
deaths; 9245 cases and 65 deaths in 2008; and 39 851 cases and 407 deaths
in 2007 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Cambodia 20100101.0002).

India (Delhi)


- Brazil (Amazonas), 5 Jan 2010: the city of Manaus and Amazonas state
registered the 1st case of dengue virus 4 infection in a 13 year old child.
Laboratory diagnosis was made by the Instituto Evandro Chagas (reference
virology laboratory), in Belem.

- Argentina/Brazil/Paraguay (border area), 3 Jan 2011: Argentinean health
authorities have declared an "orange alert" for a possible outbreak of
dengue in Corrientes province. In Iguazu (Misiones province), one case is
confirmed and 5 are suspected. [There was a dengue outbreak in Iguazu city
and in Corrientes province in February-March 2010, hence concern by health
authorities. - Mod.TY]. In Paraguay the Ministry of Health has confirmed 13
678 cases in the year [2010] and in Brazil more than one million have been
infected [in 2010]., of which 15 000 cases are of the severe type.

- Bolivia (Beni), 8 Jan 2010: a health emergency was declared in Beni,
where at least 7 municipalities recorded 321 positive cases of classical
dengue fever up to the last week of December 2010, with another 1650

- Venezuela (Zulia), 4 Jan 2011: in the last week of 2010, the fishing
village of Barrio Adentro, has had 7 cases of DHF and the number continues
to rise. The total dengue cases is estimated to exceed 30 cases. [If there
are 7 DHF cases, the total number of dengue virus infections surely must
exceed 30, by an order of magnitude, suggesting significant underreporting.

- India (Delhi), 7 Jan 2011: Delhi reported a total of 6259 dengue cases
have been reported from different hospitals in Delhi last year (2010), of
which over 4000 were reported in October and September, with 38 cases in
December 2010 alone. Unlike the usual trend, this year [2010] dengue cases
were reported much before the commencement of monsoon season and continued
to be reported even after the winter set in. [It would be of interest to
know if the _Aedes aegypti_ dengue virus vector mosquito population has
declined during the cooler weather. - Mod.TY]
