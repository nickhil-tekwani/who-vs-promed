The bird flu virus killed another victim in South Jakarta. A
5-year-old child, a resident of RT 07/03 Kel. Tegal Parang, died
early Friday [19 Jun 2009]. Since 2005 until now, avian influenza
H5N1, or bird flu virus, has killed 11 [of] a total of 13 cases in
South Jakarta.

Head of Livestock and Marine Subservice of South Jakarta, Chaidir
Taufik, said the child was reported [to have] returned from his
relatives in Sukabumi, West Java and then visited other relatives in
Pejaten Barat [in] South Jakarta. During the stay in Sukabumi,
numbers of chickens were reported [to have] suddenly died. After
return from Pejaten Barat, the victim, the [younger] of 2 siblings,
experienced high fever [during] the next day [Mon 8 Jun 2009], and
received an antipyretic drug from a health worker. "The victim had
improved [immediately], but the fever came back on Saturday [13 Jun
2009]. The child was then admitted to Triadapa hospital", said
Chaidir, on [the same day]

Tegal Parang chieftain Abdul Khalit added that after further
examination at Triadapa hospital, the victim was then allowed to
return home. Three days later, the child's condition worsened and was
accompanied by breathing difficulty. The child was then rushed to
Triadapa hospital again. Chest X-ray revealed liquid accumulation in
the lungs, which suggested the illness was caused by bird flu
infection. "After 2 days of treatment, Triadapa hospital referred the
child to Persahabatan hospital on Thursday [18 Jun 2009]. But the
child passed away 4 hours after admission, or early on Friday. The
body has been buried in Pejaten Barat public cemetary," said vice
chieftain of Tegal Parang, Gita Puspitasari.

[Subsequent to the death of the child], Livestock and Marine
Subservice South Jakarta conducted bird sweeping [?] around victim's
neighborhood.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[This report must be evaluated with caution. So far, no human cases
of avian A (H5N1) influenza in Indonesia have been confirmed by the
World Health Organisation (WHO) since the end of 2008, when there had
been 143 cases and 115 deaths (see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2009_06_02/en/index.html>).
During 2009, reports of avian influenza cases in local Indonesian
newspapers have not been confirmed by either the Indonesian Ministry
of Health or the WHO.

In the above report, there is no mention of recovery of clinical
samples for laboratory testing. Since the child was returned to its
parents for burial, a final diagnosis may never become available.
Furthermore although the child became ill and died in South Jakarta,
it is possible that exposure to infection occurred earlier during the
visit to Sukabumi, West Java.

Jakarta on the Indonesia island of Java can be located using the
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Java available at
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?name=Jakarta,%20Indonesia&g=&v=-6.212,106.845,5>.
