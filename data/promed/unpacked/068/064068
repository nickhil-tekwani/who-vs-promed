Porto Alegre - The Rio Grande do Sul Secretariat of Health launched a
yellow fever (YF) vaccination program in Porto Xavier yesterday to cover
400 000 people in 43 municipalities, after having discovered that the cause
of the mysterious death of more than 30 monkeys in the Region of Missoes
was due to yellow fever. During the last 4 months farmers have found, near
their houses or near the forest, bodies or remains of monkeys in higher
numbers than usual, intriguing the residents and scientists.
Teams were sent to the region and, in addition to collecting monkey
skeletons, they captured _Haemogogus leucocelaenus_ mosquitoes in Santo
Antonio das Missoes, one of the municipalities (the other is Garruchos)
where they had found the dead animals. Technicians of the Evandro Chagas
Institute, Belem, the yellow fever reference center for Brazil, examined
the insects and confirmed the presence of the virus of silvan [forest
yellow fever.
According to epidemiologist Paulo Sabroza, of Fiocruz, the virus had to
have been transmitted to the monkeys through contact with other infected
monkeys. [He meant via mosquito bite -- YF is not transmitted by contact. -

Sabroza discounted the possibility of the virus reaching the monkey
population of the Mata Atlantica [Atlantic Forest, since there are no
connecting corridors of forest between the bands of coastal forest and the
those where the monkeys were found. But residents close to where the
monkeys were found do run the risk of infection. In order to avoid the
spread of the disease, the Secretary of Health, in conjunction with FUNASA
[the National Health Foundation and Ibama [the Brazilian Institute of
Environment and Natural Resources are going to vaccinate 447 233 persons
in the cities and rural areas. In Garruchos and Santo Antonio das Missoes,
the immunizations have already begun.

[The finding of dead howler monkeys (_Alouatta_ sp.; "bugios" in
Portuguese) in the same area was reported on 22 May 2001 in our parallel
list in Portuguese, ProMED-PORT; the deaths reportedly began in April 2001.
At the time, the differential diagnosis was YF or a toxin. Howler monkey
bands welcome the arrival of rain with a raucous chorus. Historically,
silence at the onset of rain because of the death of howler bands has given
warning of the arrival of YF in an area.
It is not clear why it has taken so long to confirm & then act on the
presence of YF in the area, close to the Argentina border, but we can be
grateful that it is better late than never. The International Health
Regulations require that even the suspicion of monkey deaths due to YF be
reported to the World Health Organization within 24 hours. - Mod.JW
