"Multiple Salmonella Outbreaks in Victoria, Australia"
Several correspondents have reported on recent outbreaks of food-borne
illness in Victoria, Australia. Each of these four outbreaks involved
different Salmonella species which were relatively uncommon in Victoria, and
occurred over February and March of this year. In three of the outbreaks
typing was the clue to an outbreak, while the fourth was more obvious.
Although it may be an error in classification to describe these events as
emerging infectious diseases, this posting updates the details and poses a
question.
In the first outbreak, 24 confirmed cases of _Salmonella muenchen_ infection
occurred in Victoria (most in Melbourne) with dates of isolation from early
February to mid-March. Two elderly persons from whom _S. muenchen_ was
isolated, died during this period. Epidemiological and microbiological
investigations linked cases to the consumption of factory-cooked salted beef
and ham produced by a Melbourne smallgoods manufacturer. Most of the
implicated product was distributed to small delicatessens where it was sold
sliced and unlabelled, which complicated the investigation process, the
product recall process, and the identification of the specific source of
contamination.
In the second outbreak, over five hundred persons became ill with
gastroenteritis within approximately 24 hours of consuming "Vietnamese pork
and salad rolls" from a bakery in eastern suburban Melbourne. To date,
_Salmonella typhimurium_ Phage Type 1 has been isolated from approximately
400 cases. Early reports from cases promptly identified the implicated food,
which contained pre-cooked pork, ham, pate, egg and salad vegetables. Poor
food-handling practices are suspected of contributing to the outbreak.
In the third outbreak, 6 cases of infection with _Salmonella typhimurium_
Phage Type 43 were linked to an oriental restaurant in the same suburb which
also used precooked meats. The same organism was also identified in the gut
contents of young man who died suddenly around the time of the other cases.
The fourth outbreak involved 19 cases of _Salmonella anatum_ linked to ham
and pre-cooked salted beef produced by another Melbourne smallgoods
manufacturer. Both outbreaks linked to smallgoods manufacturers were shown
to be due to post-processing contamination within the factories.
To put these events into context, there were 822 human infections with
Salmonella notified to the Victorian health department in 1996, including 61
linked to the peanut-butter associated outbreak of _S. mbandaka_. The annual
rate of notified Salmonella infection in Victoria is approximately 20 cases
per 100,000 population.
These outbreaks have attracted enormous local attention, and the complexity
of events in the chain of transmission of salmonella from animals to humans
have been a challenge to explain, via the media, to the public.
Despite the probable multifactorial dynamics of salmonellosis, distinct and
regular seasonal variation in endemic human salmonellosis occur in many
countries, including Australia, where we have a summer peak. Why?
Victoria has recently experienced one of our hottest summers on record.
Might this have contributed to the outbreaks by "stressing" animals prior to
slaughter, resulting in a higher than usual pathogen load on raw meat (to
say nothing of the subsequent "cold chain" stress)?

[Two factors spring to mind immediately ... hot weather "stresses" humans as
well as livestock thereby reducing their disease resistance when exposed to
infection. Secondly, all of the mentioned Salmonella serotypes are well
known livestock and poultry feed contaminants. MHJ]
