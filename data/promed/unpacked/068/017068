Grand Food Inc. Recalls Vending Machine Foods
----------------------------------------------
Minneapolis, MN (SafetyAlerts) - Grand Food Inc. has voluntarily recalled
all of their ready-made sandwiches, salads and bakery products sold through
vending machines because one product sample tested positive for _Listeria
monocytogenes_.
The recalled product was distributed in Minnesota and to one vender in
North Dakota and one vender in South Dakota. These products bear the Julian
date codes of 0109 to 0119.
There have been no reported illnesses associated with these products and
subsequent testing has returned negative results for _Listeria monocytogenes_.
Consumption of food contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ can cause
listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease.
Consumers with questions should call Grand Foods at 612-623-7655.
