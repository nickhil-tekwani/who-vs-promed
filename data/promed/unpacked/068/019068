[Although not specifically stated, it is likely that the organism was a member of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ group, the prototypic organism being serotype O157:H7. These are zoonotic organisms spread usually from bovines (the commonest source) to humans from undercooked ground beef, fresh produce contaminated by irrigation tainted with bovine manure, or from more direct contact such as at a petting zoo. The symptom complex of the illness in humans is usually non-febrile diarrhea with significant abdominal pain that can progress to bloody diarrhea and may be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome.

The other _E. coli_ -- that cause diarrhea, generally mild without blood or complications -- are not zoonotic and include enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, and enteroaggregative _E. coli_. - Mod.LL

_E. coli_ may also affect pets consuming the food. Most often the pet develops diarrhea or bloody diarrhea. If you notice your pet with diarrhea with or without blood, please visit your veterinarian. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning up after your pet.

Also, humans may become infected after feeding their pets the food and then failing to wash their hands. The bacteria can be on the hands or under the fingernails, providing a source of bacteria that the person consumes when eating a handheld food (sandwich, peanuts, chips, etc). Be sure to keep the pet food and water bowls clean and the utensils used to feed the pet clean, washing those items thoroughly with soap and water. It is always a good idea to be sure your pet's food and water bowls are cleaned daily. Treat the food and water dishes as you would your own, keeping them clean. The pet will enjoy the food more, and illnesses are less likely with clean feeding stations. - Mod.TG
