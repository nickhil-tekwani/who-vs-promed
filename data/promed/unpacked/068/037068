El-Aghuat: 45 cases of Malta fever
-----------------------------------
Malta fever has returned to northwestern El-Aghuat where 45 cases have been
reported there, following the consumption of [unpasteurized] goat's milk.
Many stock-owners do not report their flocks even if they know the animals
are infected. The reason for that is their fear that their animals will be
destroyed by the Veterinary Services. During 2003, there was an outbreak in
the northern area, which was more heavily infected than the south.

[_Brucella melitensis_ is endemic throughout all countries in the
Mediterranean basin; Algeria is known to be one of the most severely
affected countries. During 2002, 452 outbreaks (in animals, mostly goats)
have been reported. Tourists to this part of the world should be aware of
the risks associated with the consumption of (unpasteurized) dairy
products. -Mod.AS]
[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B
biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after
occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food
products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the United
States and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination
programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many
developing countries.
Each species of Brucella has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic
disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs
of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large
numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid.
This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians,
slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.
Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _Brucella melitensis_
(from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most
severe and acute cases of brucellosis with disabling complications. A
prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative
destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or
commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo,
and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is
rarely associated with complications. _B. canis_ has a disease course that
is indistinguishable from _B. abortus_ infection.- Mod.LL]
