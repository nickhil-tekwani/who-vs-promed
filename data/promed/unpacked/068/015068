A 4-year-old on Thursday became the latest suspected victim of "bird flu,"
forcing Hong Kong authorities to step up attempts to reassure the public.
The boy was listed in stable condition in a Kowloon hospital, medical
sources said. A Health Department spokesman said there were now nine
confirmed cases, two of whom have died since May. A domestic helper
remained in critical condition and four other victims are also
hospitalized. Two other H5N1 virus carriers had been treated and released,
he said.

Director of Health Dr Margaret Chan said at a press conference today
(Tuesday) that genetic analysis of the H5N1 virus in the first four cases
so far had shown avian gene sequences while laboratory results of the other
cases were pending. Information collected during the investigation of the
first seven cases - six confirmed and one suspected - indicated that some
patients had contacts with poultry before the onset of the disease while
others had not. "This points to the fact that the transmission of the virus
both from bird-to-human and human-to-human are possible," Dr Chan said.
"However, the efficiency of transmission from human-to-human should not be
high or there should be hundreds and thousands of such cases in the
territory by now, according to past experience with other types of
influenza. Thus, the present cluster of cases detected in Hong Kong had not
reached epidemic proportions."
The Department of Health was currently conducting four epidemiological
studies to ascertain the mode of transmission. CDC was conducting further
tests on genetic sequencing of the virus and also working at full speed on
the development of a test for blood samples taken. WHO would distribute
H5N1 virus testing kits to all of its Collaborating Centres around the
world shortly for surveillance purpose.
Of the seven cases being analysed so far, all were [shown to be] positive
[testing by Hong Kong Government Virus Unit]. Six had been confirmed by the
CDC while the remaining one was classified as "suspected" pending CDC's
independent confirmation. Two of these cases indicated exposure to poultry
within the incubation period, but the histories of the remaining five cases
were less clear. "Over 550 interviews were conducted and 2,550 laboratory
specimens were taken during the course of investigations." Follow-up on
patient contacts showed all those with flu-like illness had recovered.
Results of throat swabs taken from contacts in the first few cases were all
negative while results for the last three cases were pending. Test results
on the more than two thousand blood samples which could shed more light on
the form of transmission could not be confirmed pending development and
refinement of test by CDC.
So far, two patients had fully recovered, one under treatment in
satisfactory condition, two under treatment in critical condition and two
died. In the meantime, two more cases were classified as "suspected" by the
Department of Health, making the total number of Influenza A H5N1 cases in
human nine. The two latest cases involved a two year old boy and a three
year old girl who were cousins of a confirmed case (5 year-old girl). They
had mild symptoms only and were now receiving treatment in hospital. Their
conditions were satisfactory. Follow-up investigation of the two cases has
already begun.

Influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (Update)
A new case of influenza A(H5N1) was confirmed yesterday in a 4-year old
boy. The boy had no reported contact with chickens and no link to any of
the previously reported cases. The total number of confirmed cases is now
eight [Other reports indicate 9 cases.
-- Mod CHC], while two suspect cases are being investigated. Two of these
10 confirmed or suspected cases died, two are still in critical condition
and the remaining six are in satisfactory condition or have recovered.
Detection of new cases is probably the result of a very comprehensive
surveillance programme involving all health services catering to the 6.5
million population of Hong Kong and not an indication of increased
transmission. Although the source of infection remains uncertain in some
of the cases, it is evident that the virus transmits poorly. Surveillance
of live chicken in farms and food markets will be further intensified
within the coming days to evaluate the extent of virus circulation in the
chicken population. In response to the recognition of the first case, 2000
blood samples were collected from health workers, family members and other
contacts to investigate the extent of influenza A(H5N1) virus
infections. The results of tested samples will be available
in a week's time. There is still no indication that a vaccine is needed
but intensive laboratory work is in progress in the WHO
Collaborating Centres to produce a seed virus which would be
suitable for vaccine production should this be needed. WHO does not
recommend any restrictions of travel to Hong Kong or elsewhere. However,
visitors should be aware that at least two confirmed cases had been in
contact with live chickens.

[If the infected chickens are coming from China are there human cases of
H5N1 in China? Is the lack of reporting due to lack of cases or to better
surveillance in Hong Kong (there are more investigators than cases)?
I don't think anyone should get too smug about the paucity of cases
indicating poor or absent human-to-human transmission. This is not the
influenza season in Hong Kong and at least two of the confirmed cases have
been mild ones.
The international cooperation on this investigation thus far seems to be
outstanding. -- Mod CHC]
