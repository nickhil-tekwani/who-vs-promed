Q fever in Hessen
------------------
Ref.: Stephen A. Berger's remarks on the increase in Q fever cases in the
Sauerland region since 1990 [see end].
We have observed cases of Q fever in the Hochsauerland for more than 3
decades. This region is not only known for sheep raising but also for
tourism. It is to be supposed that many cases of Q fever in tourists
returning from their holidays, and in the local population, remain
undetected, when an etiologic diagnosis is neglected in cases of
influenza-like respiratory disease.
The increase in number of Q fever cases, which was observed during the last
decade, seems to be linked to a significant increase in the number of sheep
being kept. An increase in demand for sheep and lambs has apparently
occurred during the nineties. It may be the result of an increase in the
Turkish population [mutton eaters] but may be due even more to abstinence
from beef due to the BSE crisis. Sheep raisers have brought in sheep from
other regions, probably without previous contact with _Coxiella burnetii_.
Several proposals were made to prevent human exposure to Coxiella infection.
Vaccination of sheep may be useful, but an approved vaccine is not available
in Germany. Antibiotic treatment of sheep is probably not feasible for many
reasons. But an improvement in the hygiene of animal husbandry would most
probably prevent transmission to humans in many cases. If the sheep were to
be kept in closed stables during lambing and the placentas burnt or treated
with disinfectants, instead of leaving them to birds, dogs and foxes, this
would most probably help a good deal against the spread of Coxiella
infections. The hygiene of sheep raising should be controlled very strictly.
Persons who neglect the principles of prevention should be summoned or
should be forbidden to raise sheep.
Another problem is that cases of Q fever go undiagnosed or are diagnosed too
late, e.g. in the case of pregnant women. Therefore practitioners must be
advised to send specimens for the diagnosis of Q fever to the lab in all
cases in which this diagnosis is suspected for clinical or epidemiological
reasons. Young [medical] colleagues starting work in that region should have
knowledge about this special risk.

[We are very grateful to Prof Slenczka for these first-hand, authoritative
comments and reminder, and his response to our RFI. Indeed, elementary
hygiene measures, responsible animal husbandry methods and alertness of the
attending veterinarians and physicians are vital on the front line of
zoonosis prevention and control. - Mod. AS]
