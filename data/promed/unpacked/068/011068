A Preliminary Report of an investigation of a Fever Cases in Murshidabad
District, West Bengal
------------------
Cases of fever with respiratory symptoms were reported in the district
during the months of May and June 2003. The Rapid Response Team of the
district, a team from National Institute of Enteric Diseases, Kolkatta
National Institute of Virology, Pune, along with the National Institute of
Communicable Diseases investigated the episode. A total of 719 cases and
45 deaths were reported during the period 15 May - 14 Jun 2003. 80 percent
of the deaths were reported in children under 10 years of age. The
laboratory investigation carried out showed the possibility of influenza B
virus infection as the cause of this episode. The virus isolation results
are awaited.
Summary
In response to a news item, a team from National Institute of Communicable
Diseases investigated the fever cases in Murshidabad district of West
Bengal during 11-15 Jun 2003.
A total of 719 cases and 45 deaths have been reported during the period
from 15 May to 14 Jun 2003.
Maximum numbers of (82.2 percent) deaths were reported in children below 5
yrs. of age. No deaths were reported in the age group 10 years and above.
An overall fever rate of 14.2 percent was observed in the community during
the one-month period affecting all age groups and both genders. Maximum
attack rate (31.7 percent) was in children below 5 years of age.
The cases presented mainly with fever, running nose, cough, and diarrhea.
Respiratory distress and convulsions were also present in a few cases,
especially in those reporting to hospital. The duration of illness in
majority of the cases varied from 2-5 days.
The team collected 9 sera and clots. 4 throat swabs and 4 stool samples
were also collected. In addition, the team brought 12 sera samples
collected on 8 Jun 2003.
At NICD laboratories, the samples tested negative for antibodies against
measles and herpes. In addition, 4 blood clots were cultured for bacteria
and found sterile. High antibody titres were observed against Influenza A &
B in most of the patients. However a second sample is required for
confirmation. One patient showed the presence of Influenza B antigen in a
throat swab. In this sample high antibody titre (1:80) against Influenza B
suggest that that the case had infection due to Influenza B virus.
The clinico-epidemiological findings show that the present episode of fever
consists of respiratory tract infections and affects all age groups with
predominance among younger people. The laboratory investigations indicate
that the present episode of fever could be due to Influenza B virus.
Further tests are in progress to isolate the specific aetiological agents.

[ProMED-mail just became aware of this official report on the WHO India
Representation website today. It should be noted that this report is dated
11-15 Jun 2003, approximately one month ago, and therefore more recent
information may be available. The identification of influenza B in one
specimen is noted, but the initial descriptions of this outbreak did not
seem consistent with influenza (as per the first ProMED-mail posting, "high
fever, breathlessness, convulsion, increased salivation, followed by
stiffening of jaws within 5-6 hours of the onset of the disease and
death".) In the 12 Jun 2003 ProMED-mail posting, a direct report from a
physician in West Bengal mentioned "More than 300 have been attacked by the
disease, which killed more than 56 persons."
The above report suggests that the majority of cases in this outbreak had a
respiratory illness that could be classified as influenza-like, and that
the observed case fatality rate was approximately 6.3 percent. ProMED-mail
would be interested in additional information on further studies of this
outbreak, more information on the clinico-epidemiologic investigation, and
the results of any toxicologic studies that may have been conducted. - Mod.MPP]
