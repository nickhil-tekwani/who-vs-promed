In the USA, gonorrhea is the 2nd most commonly reported notifiable
disease, with 339 593 cases documented in 2005 (1). Since 1993,
fluoroquinolones (i.e., ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or levofloxacin)
have been used frequently in the treatment of gonorrhea because of
their high efficacy, ready availability, and convenience as a
single-dose, oral therapy. However, prevalence of fluoroquinolone
resistance in _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ has been increasing and is
becoming widespread in the USA, necessitating changes in treatment regimens.
Beginning in 2000, fluoroquinolones were no longer recommended for
gonorrhea treatment in persons who acquired their infections in Asia
or the Pacific Islands (including Hawaii); in 2002, this
recommendation was extended to California (2). In 2004, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that
fluoroquinolones not be used in the USA to treat gonorrhea in men who
have sex with men (MSM) (3). This report, based on data from the
Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), summarizes data on
fluoroquinolone-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ (QRNG) in heterosexual
males and in MSM throughout the USA. This report also updates CDC's
Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines 2006 (4) regarding
the treatment of infections caused by _N. gonorrhoeae_. On the basis
of the most recent evidence, CDC no longer recommends the use of
fluoroquinolones for the treatment of gonococcal infections and
associated conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
Consequently, only one class of drugs, the cephalosporins, is still
recommended and available for the treatment of gonorrhea.
GISP is a CDC-sponsored sentinel surveillance system that has been
monitoring antimicrobial susceptibilities of _N. gonorrhoeae_ in the
USA since 1986. Annually, GISP collects approximately 6000 urethral
gonococcal isolates from males attending 26 to 30 sexually
transmitted disease (STD) clinics throughout the country and provides
national data to guide treatment. QRNG isolates demonstrate
ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1.0
microg/mL or more; isolates with intermediate resistance to
fluoroquinolones demonstrate ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.125-0.500 microg/mL.
GISP began susceptibility testing for ciprofloxacin in 1990. Overall,
QRNG prevalence remained <1 percent during 1990-2001 but increased to
2.2 percent in 2002, to 4.1 percent in 2003, and to 6.8 percent in
2004. In 2005, of 6,199 isolates collected by GISP, 9.4 percent were
resistant to ciprofloxacin, and during January--June 2006, 13.3
percent of 3,005 isolates collected were resistant (Figure) (5).
Excluding isolates from Hawaii and California (areas that
discontinued fluoroquinolone treatment in 2000 and 2002,
respectively), 6.1 percent and 8.6 percent of isolates were QRNG in
2005 and 2006, respectively. Intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin
has remained stable, ranging from 0.4 percent to 1.1 percent from
1990 to 2006 (5).
In addition, since 2001, GISP has observed QRNG increases among
isolates from MSM, and more recently, from heterosexual males. In
2001, QRNG prevalence was 1.6 percent and 0.6 percent among MSM and
heterosexual males, respectively. The QRNG prevalence among isolates
from MSM increased to 7.2 percent in 2002, to 15 percent in 2003, to
23.8 percent in 2004, and to 29 percent in 2005 (5). Among
heterosexual males, the prevalence increased more slowly, from 0.9
percent in 2002 to 1.5 percent in 2003, to 2.9 percent in 2004, and
to 3.8 percent in 2005 (5). Preliminary data from Jan-Jun 2006
indicate that QRNG prevalence increased to 38.3 percent among MSM and
6.7 percent among heterosexual males. For isolates from sites outside
of California and Hawaii, QRNG prevalence was 24.3 percent in MSM and
2.7 percent in heterosexual males in 2005; in the first 6 months of
2006, it was 30.7 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.
Available data from GISP for 2005 and preliminary data from 2006 have
demonstrated that QRNG has continued to increase among heterosexual
males and is present in all regions of the country (Table [for table
see original URL - Mod. LL]) (5). Several cities outside California
and Hawaii have seen substantial increases in QRNG prevalence among
heterosexual males from 2004 to 2006; for example, in Philadelphia,
QRNG prevalence increased from 1.2 percent in 2004 to 9.9 percent in
2005 and to 26.6 percent in 2006, and in Miami, prevalence increased
from 2.1 percent in 2004 to 4.5 percent in 2005 and to 15.3 percent in 2006.

MMWR Editorial Note:
GISP is the only national sentinel surveillance system that monitors
emerging resistance in _N. gonorrhoeae_ in the USA; with the
decreasing use of culture to diagnose gonorrhea, GISP has become an
increasingly important source of information on _N. gonorrhoeae_ that
are resistant to antimicrobials. Findings from GISP, which is
conducted in publicly funded clinics and includes only male urethral
isolates, might not be representative of the entire American
population infected with gonorrhea.
During Jan-Jun 2006, QRNG was identified in 25 out of 26 GISP sites,
and increases in the prevalence of QRNG were observed among isolates
from heterosexual males and MSM in most regions of the country. As a
result, CDC no longer recommends fluoroquinolones for treatment of
gonorrhea in the USA; similarly, CDC no longer recommends
fluoroquinolones for treatment of other conditions that might be
caused by _N. gonorrhoeae_, such as PID.
CDC has recommended single-dose fluoroquinolone regimens for the
treatment of gonococcal infections since 1993. Although QRNG was
identified as a problem in Asia in 1991 and was 1st identified in
Hawaii in the same year, only sporadic occurrences were noted in the
continental USA during the 1990s. However, since 1999, increasing
resistance of _N. gonorrhoeae_ to the fluoroquinolones has been
observed, 1st in Hawaii, then in California and other Western states,
then among MSM, and now in other populations and regions. CDC has
changed treatment recommendations when QRNG prevalence has reached
greater than 5 percent in defined groups and locations, with
consideration given to other factors such as the prevalence of
gonorrhea, the availability of antimicrobial susceptibility data, and
the costs of diagnostic and treatment options (4,6). This threshold
has been used by CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) so that
all recommended treatments for gonorrhea can be expected to cure
greater than 95 percent of infections.
Because fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended, the options for
treating gonococcal infections in the USA are limited (4). For the
treatment of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonorrhea, CDC
now recommends a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone 125 mg or a
single oral dose of cefixime 400 mg. However, 400 mg tablets of
cefixime are not available; cefixime is only available in a
suspension formulation. Some evidence suggests that a single oral
dose of cefpodoxime 400 mg or cefuroxime axetil 1 g might be
additional oral alternatives for the treatment of urogenital and
anorectal gonorrhea (4).
Alternative parenteral single dose regimens for urogenital and
anorectal gonorrhea include ceftizoxime 500 mg, cefoxitin 2 g with
probenecid 1 g orally, or cefotaxime 500 mg. However, these
cephalosporin regimens do not offer any advantage over ceftriaxone.
For persons with penicillin or cephalosporin allergies, a single
intramuscular dose of spectinomycin 2 g is a recommended alternative.
However spectinomycin is not available in the USA. Updated
information from CDC regarding the availability of cefixime and
spectinomycin will be available at <http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/arg>.
For pharyngeal gonorrhea, CDC now recommends a single intramuscular
dose of ceftriaxone 125 mg; pharyngeal gonococcal infections often
are asymptomatic and more difficult to eradicate than urogenital and
anorectal infections (4). Spectinomycin, cefixime, cefpodoxime, and
cefuroxime axetil do not appear adequate for treating pharyngeal
gonococcal infections.
A single oral dose of azithromycin 2 g is effective against
uncomplicated gonococcal infections, but CDC does not recommend
widespread use of azithromycin because of concerns regarding rapid
emergence of resistance, as evidenced by the increase in azithromycin
MICs documented since 1999 in the USA and internationally (4,5,7-9).
However, azithromycin might be an option for treatment of
uncomplicated gonococcal infections from any site (i.e., urogenital,
anorectal, and pharyngeal) in persons with documented severe allergic
reactions to penicillins or cephalosporins.
Persons in whom gonococcal infection is diagnosed should be treated
for possible coinfection with _Chlamydia trachomatis_ with a single
dose of azithromycin 1 g by mouth or with doxycycline 100 mg twice a
day, by mouth for 7 days, if chlamydial infection has not been ruled out (4).
Test of cure is not recommended routinely for patients with
uncomplicated gonorrhea who have been treated with recommended or
alternative regimens. Persons with persistent symptoms of gonococcal
infection or whose symptoms recur shortly after treatment with a
recommended or alternative regimen should be reevaluated by culture
for _N. gonorrhoeae_; positive isolates should undergo
antimicrobial-susceptibility testing. Clinicians and laboratories
should report treatment failures or resistant gonococcal isolates to
CDC at 404-639-8373 or through state and local public health authorities.
With fluoroquinolones no longer recommended for the treatment of
gonococcal infections, only one class of drug, cephalosporins, is
still recommended and available. Therefore, state and local health
departments must remain vigilant for the emergence of cephalosporin resistance.
With use of nonculture tests to diagnose _N. gonorrhoeae_ increasing
and with local data on antimicrobial susceptibility less available,
CDC strongly recommends that all state and local health department
laboratories maintain or develop the capacity to perform culture
(10). CDC also encourages all state and local health department
laboratories to maintain the capacity to perform
antimicrobial-susceptibility testing or form partnerships with
experienced laboratories that can perform such testing. At a minimum,
antimicrobial-susceptibility testing should be performed for
ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, azithromycin, and any other regimens that
are used locally for gonorrhea treatment.

[Except for azithromycin, all recommended therapeutic interventions
involve a cephalosporin-class antimicrobial. In penicillin-allergic
individuals, the use of cephalosporins can be problematic because of
cross-reactivity or co-allergy especially for immunoglobulin E (IgE)
mediated reactions such as anaphylaxis. - Mod.LL]
