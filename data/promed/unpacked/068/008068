Severe leaf curl disease of cowpea - a new disease of cowpea in northern
India caused by mungbean yellow mosaic India virus and a satellite DNA b
-----------------------------------------------
A Rouhibakhsh, VG Malathi <vgmalathi@rediffmail.com>, Advanced Centre for
Plant Virology, Division of Plant Pathology, Indian Agricultural Research
Institute, New Delhi 110012, India. Accepted for publication 11 Aug 2004.
In the 2004 crop season, severe leaf distortion symptoms were observed in
cowpea (_Vigna unguiculata_) in agricultural fields in northern India.
Affected plants showed a yellow mosaic with downward leaf curling, vein
swelling, and vein enations.
The virus causing this leaf curl disease was easily transmitted to cowpea
seedlings by whitefly (_Bemisia tabaci_), resulting in a combination of
symptoms. Typically, a few leaves showed only mild leaf curl symptoms,
others showed a yellow mosaic without enation); the majority of the leaves
showed a yellow mosaic with severe leaf curl and enations.
In Southern analysis, total nucleic acid extracted from symptomatic plants
hybridized to radiolabeled probes specific to DNA A and DNA B of mungbean
yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV-[Cp]). As veinal enation is a typical
symptom associated with the presence of satellite DNA b, hybridization was
also performed with a radiolabeled probe to DNA b associated with cotton
leaf curl disease (CLCuD).
A positive signal obtained with extracts from leaves showing leaf curl
symptoms indicated the presence of DNA b. However, no hybridization was
seen with an extract from leaves showing only a yellow mosaic. Satellite
DNA b was amplified with universal DNA b primers b01/ b02 (Briddon et al,
2003) and the ca.1.3 kb amplicon was cloned and sequenced (Accession No.
AY728263). The nucleotide sequence of DNA b showed 59 per cent identity
with DNA b associated with cotton leaf curl Rajasthan virus (Accession No.
AY083590).
While MYMIV-[Cp] alone causes yellow mosaic symptoms, in the presence of
DNA b more severe symptom phenotypes of vein enation and leaf curl occur.
Thus, the pathogenicity of the virus is increased by the presence of
satellite DNA b. This is the 1st report of a satellite DNA b associated
with a bipartite begomovirus infecting a leguminous host.

[The gist of this piece is that the interaction between MYIMV and satellite
DNA-beta results in more severe symptoms compared to plants inoculated with
MYINV alone. Similar results have been reported for other DNA-beta
molecules and viruses. DNA-beta molecules are symptom-modulating, ss-DNA
satellites associated with monopartite begomoviruses belonging to the
_Geminiviridae_. Cotton leaf curl Multan virus causes Cotton leaf curl
disease (CLCuD), a major constraint to cotton production on the Indian
subcontinent. It has been shown to be caused by a monopartite begomovirus
(Cotton leaf curl Multan virus [CLCuMV]) and a novel single-stranded DNA
satellite molecule termed CLCuD DNA-beta. The satellite molecule is
trans-replicated by CLCuMV but does not possess the iteron sequences of
this virus. Field surveys across all the cotton-growing regions of Pakistan
indicate that dual and multiple infections are the norm for CLCuD with no
evidence of synergism. Despite the diversity of begomoviruses associated
with CLCuD, only a single class of DNA-beta has been detected, suggesting
that this satellite has the capacity to be recruited by unrelated
begomoviruses.
As of 2003, an 26 additional DNA beta molecules, associated with diverse
plant species obtained from different geographical locations, have been
cloned and sequenced. They were shown to be widespread in the Old World,
where monopartite begomoviruses are known to occur. Analysis of the
sequences revealed a highly conserved organization for DNA-beta molecules
consisting of a single conserved open reading frame, an adenine-rich
region, and a region of high sequence conservation [the satellite conserved
region (SCR)]. The SCR contains a potential hairpin structure with the loop
sequence TAA/GTATTAC, similar to the origins of replication of
geminiviruses and nanoviruses. 2 major groups of DNA-beta satellites were
resolved by phylogenetic analyses. One group originated from hosts within
the _Malvaceae_ and the 2nd from a more diverse group of plants within the
_Solanaceae_ and _Compositae_. Within the 2 clusters, DNA-beta molecules
showed relatedness based both on host and geographic origin. These findings
strongly support coadaptation of DNA-beta molecules with their respective
helper begomoviruses.
The begomovirus-satellite disease complexes are associated with
economically important diseases and have been isolated from vegetable and
fiber crops, ornamental plants, and weeds throughout Africa and Asia. Their
widespread distribution and diversity, coupled to the global movement of
plant material and the dissemination of the whitefly vector, suggests that
these disease complexes pose a serious threat to tropical and sub-tropical
agro-ecosystems worldwide.
