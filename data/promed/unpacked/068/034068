African swine fever outbreak recorded in the Stavropol region
-------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) was recorded on Saturday [10 Jan
2009] in a swine-breeding [collective farm] "Rostovanovsky" in the Kurskiy
district of the Stavropol region, said the press-service of the Southern
regional centre of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Russia.

As of Saturday evening [10 Jan 2009], 66 pigs had died and the carcasses
were burnt. There are a total of 6377 pigs on the 3 swine breeding
[collective farms]. All pigs were vaccinated in October-November 2008
against classical swine fever.

At present, the entire territory of the Kurskiy district is under
quarantine. Disinfection roadblocks have been established and are operated
on the border with North Ossetia. Trading and slaughtering of animals in
the territory of the Kurskiy district have been stopped. Clinical
supervision of the animals has been organized.

The previous ASF outbreak of ASF in the Stavropol region, affecting the
territories of 4 districts, was recorded in the middle of October 2008,
leading to the destruction of 12 000 animals. The total losses, as
estimated by specialists, are 100 million rubles [USD 3 213 781].

[Following its initial introduction into Georgia, probably through the
Black Sea Georgian harbour of Poti, during the 1st quarter of 2007, ASF has
been continuously spreading in the Caucasus region, continuing its
northwards march in south Russia. Initially affecting the territories of
Georgia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, ASF
penetrated Russia in November 2007.

The Russian epizootic has, by now, been reported from the territories of
Chechnya, North Ossetia-Alania, Ingushetia, Orenburg (outside the Caucasus;
reportedly, wildlife affected), the Stavropolskiy Kray (Stavropol), and the
Krasnodarskiy Kray (Krasnodar). As of 12 Nov 2008, the total number of
outbreaks reported to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) by
Russia since the start of its epizootic on 5 Nov 2007, had reached 45. An
additional follow-up report was submitted on 29 Dec 2008, informing the
absence of additional outbreaks. This intermission has now been terminated
with the current reappearance of the disease in the Kurskiy district of the
Stavropol region.

For an OIE summary, with a map including all said outbreaks, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6546>.

Russia's declared policy addressing the control of ASF has undergone
evolutionary changes during the 2008. The 1st and 2nd follow-up reports,
related to the Chechnya outbreaks, did not mention applied or planned
stamping out. The 3rd and 4th follow-up reports, related to Ossetia,
mentioned "modified stamping out" as a planned (=future) control measure,
informing about a limited number of slaughtered animals but no animal
culling. Follow-up reports 5-9, related to the outbreaks in Ingushetia,
Orenburg Stavropol, and Krasnodar, mentioned "stamping out" as a planned
control measure; no stamping out is mentioned among the applied control
measures. Follow-up report 9, dated 12 Nov 2008, informed that out of a
total of 6798 susceptible animals, 298 were infected, of which 245 died and
538 were destroyed. It may be assumed that the 53 surviving infected pigs
were included among the destroyed animals. Information on the selection
criteria of the other destroyed animals, requested in ProMED-mail posting
20081114.3596, is anticipated.

A Reuters-sourced picture of dead pigs, as prepared for burning by sanitary
workers at the village of Rostovanovskoye, is available at
