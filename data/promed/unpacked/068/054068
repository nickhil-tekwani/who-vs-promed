Mysterious mass die-off of vultures solved
-------------------------------------------
The catastrophic decline of griffon vultures in south Asia is being
caused not by a mysterious disease, as had been thought, but a common
painkiller given to sick cattle.
If the treated animal dies and is eaten by vultures, a single meal
can be enough to kill the bird. The scientists who made the discovery
now want the drug banned from veterinary use and are holding a
meeting next week with officials from Nepal, India, and Pakistan.
Griffon vultures are huge scavengers and used to be ubiquitous in
south Asia. But their population has declined drastically since the
mid-1990s, and one species is near extinction. As a result, animal
carcasses rot outside villages, attracting rabies-ridden packs of
dogs. The Parsee religious community in India is also in crisis, as
it disposes of its dead by feeding them to vultures.
Lindsay Oaks, a veterinary microbiologist at Washington State
University in Pullman, and colleagues looked for pathogens or toxins
in freshly dead vultures from breeding colonies in Pakistan and Nepal
by sending tissues back to US laboratories for analysis.
Efforts by Andrew Cunningham of the Zoological Society of London, UK,
and colleagues to establish the cause of the vultures' decline in
India were hindered by that county's laws banning the export of
genetic material.
Vultures that have died in the decline have kidney damage and uric
acid crystals throughout their bodies, but Oaks's group could find no
disease germs or environmental toxins. Vultures that died following
pesticide poisoning or collisions had no uric acid.
"We started wondering whether they could be exposed to any veterinary
drugs in the dead livestock they eat," says Oaks. They discovered
that diclofenac, which can cause kidney damage, is very heavily
prescribed by local vets, and its use increased over the same time
period as the vulture decline. The cheap drug is used to treat
lameness and injury -- common conditions before a buffalo or cow dies.
Analysis of the kidneys of dead vultures with uric acid symptoms
revealed diclofenac residues, while no residues were found in other
birds. The researchers also gave diclofenac, and meat from animals
treated with diclofenac, to 20 non-releasable vultures rescued from
nesting colonies. "We hated to do it," says Oaks. The diclofenac --
even at very small doses -- killed these vultures, producing the same
symptoms as those seen in the dead wild vultures. Furthermore, the
higher the dose of the drug, the more likely the vultures were to die.
Vultures come from miles around to feed on a carcass, so each gets a
small bit of many animals. Rhys Green of the UK's Royal Society of
the Protection for Birds calculates that only one in 250 dead cattle
needs to have been recently treated with diclofenac to cause a
decline in vultures of 30 percent per year -- about what has been
observed.
Cunningham is now trying to find out whether diclofenac is also
responsible for the decline in India. "This may be a breakthrough",
he told New Scientist. "We hope so, as this would greatly improve the
chances for an eventual recovery of the species."
