Bird Flu Said Not Behind Chicken Illness
-------------------
Authorities have ruled out bird flu as the cause of a mysterious
respiratory illness that prompted the slaughter of 17 000 chickens in a
central western Brazilian state, an official with the Agriculture Ministry
said Wednesday.
"We know it's not bird flu," Jamil Gomes, coordinator of the ministry's
animal sanitation division, said in a telephone interview from Brasilia,
the capital. "It has not arrived in South America."
Testing was still under way to identify the disease, but Gomes said
authorities suspect it may be exotic Newcastle disease, which paralyzes and
kills all species of birds, but isn't a threat to humans.
The slaughter was ordered last week at a farm in Mato Grosso do Sul state,
where 5000 chickens had died, but officials did not make the news public
until Tuesday and initially refused to describe the symptoms that the
chickens were suffering from.
Millions of chickens and other fowl have been slaughtered across Asia in
attempts to stem bird flu since the disease was discovered in late 2003. A
strain of the disease has jumped to humans, killing 54 people in Asia, with
Vietnam accounting for 38 of those deaths. The Brazilian farm in the town
of Jaraguari where the chickens were slaughtered was surrounded with road
blocks, and 107 chicken farms were quarantined in the town 20 miles from
the Mato Grosso do Sul state capital of Campo Grande. Campo Grande is about
750 miles northwest of Sao Paulo.
Brazil is the world's largest chicken exporter. Production in South
America's largest country rose 8 percent inj 2004, with exports
skyrocketing 26 percent, in part because of the outbreak of bird flu in Asia.

[Data on the tests which enabled the Brazilian authorities to rule out
avian influenza as a possible cause of the respiratory disease in Mato
Grosso do Sul should be made available if rumors are to be convincingly
refuted. The stamping-out of 17 000 affected chickens while implementing
severe control measures, reportedly including road blocks, demonstrate the
great concern of the authorities, particularly in view of Brazil's status
as a major poultry exporter. The absence of diagnosis, 5 days later, is
disconcerting. Hopefully, final diagnosis will be forthcoming soon. - Mod. AS]
