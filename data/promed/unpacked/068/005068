Your comment on the posting above about healthy cows with acute
injuries straining credulity [my interpretation of your comment. - Mod.MHJ]

I can personally attest to seeing enough healthy cattle with broken
legs, dislocated hips, etc. in abattoir holding pens, vet clinic
squeeze tubs, sale barn holding pens, owner pens, etc. A slippery
concrete surface, a leg through the slats in a cattle panel followed
by the right 'push', or a combination of various and sundry factors
allows these unfortunate events to occur. With only 3 years in mixed
animal full time practice, I admit my numerator for this field
observation is small, but so would be my denominator. I can only
guess that potential beef wastage from acutely injured cattle in a
large facility would be potentially significant.

[All I can say is that it is a matter of perception. Clinicians deal
primarily with numerators and thus the world can seem to be inhabited
by the sick and the lame. As an epidemiologist I deal in population
denominators, which provides a very different viewpoint. We can agree
to differ. But, be that as it may, the current FSIS (Food Safety and
Inspection Service) rules have been the following for years:

1. Downers (non-ambulatory animals) cannot and will not enter the food chain.
2. Injured but otherwise ambulatory and healthy animals can enter the
food chain after an ante-mortem inspection by a FSIS Public Health
Veterinarian. This, of course, is always subject to post-mortem
inspection assuming the animal had passed the ante-mortem inspection.

By definition an animal with a broken or badly sprained limb is
non-ambulatory. This subthread is now cut.

The California Department of Public Health <http://www.cdph.ca.gov>
has listed some 3000 restaurants and other businesses that may have
received over the past 2 years some of the Hallmark/Westland Meat Co
beef subject for recall. This list may be somewhat inflated as some
food distributors say that they gave the CA PH office their entire
customer list rather than a specific roster of the restaurants that
purchased their recalled beef.

plus,

The good news is that in the short-term there are as yet apparently
no ill effects from the distribution of these meats. The bad news is
that if a bovine TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalitis) were
involved it will be some 5-10 years before any human cases might be
seen. One must always be aware of Sherlock Holmes' comment on the
difference between seeing and observing. The wide distribution of
these meats will confuse future investigations and retrospective
studies because of the uncertainty and possibility of a past
exposure. As an epidemiologist I am all too aware of the shortcuts
taken by my colleagues in ascribing cause. It has definitely muddied
the waters. - Mod.MHJ]

The Department of Agriculture has suspended at least 2 federal meat
inspectors after the largest beef recall in the nation's history, a
union head said Friday [29 Feb 2008].

The official, Stan Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of
Food Inspection Locals, said that the department had confirmed that
it had placed a veterinarian and a floor inspector from the
Westland/Hallmark Meat Company in Chino, California, on paid
administrative leave. A department spokeswoman said the agency could
not comment on the investigation or on personnel matters.
