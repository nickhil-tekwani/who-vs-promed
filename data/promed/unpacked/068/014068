Death Due to Generalized Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 Infection
--------------------------------------------------------------
The cause of the patient's death was a fatal fulminating hepatitis due to a
generalized Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. HSV-1 was
detected by PCR and sequencing, as well as viral isolation and electron
microscopy performed on liver sections. HSV serology is negative. There
is evidence of at least one concomitant parasitic infection, the nature of
which has not yet been elucidated. There is no direct evidence of a
pre-existing immunodeficiency of the patient. We would greatly appreciate
comments on similar cases of primary generalized HSV infections after
travel in Africa.
