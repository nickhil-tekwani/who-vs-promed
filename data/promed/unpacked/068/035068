The death of a resident of Villa Arguello [Buenos Aires Metropolitan Region] in the early hours of [Sat 21 Dec 2013], after being hospitalized with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency, raised [alarm] about the possibility that a hantavirus has taken a new victim in the region.

The individual is a 36 year old man, who, according to family members, worked for the YPF [Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales/Treasury Petroleum Fields] contracting company in the Petroquimica General Mosconi facilities.

Born in Lima, Peru, the man had lived for 4 years in Berisso in an area of precarious dwellings, where basic services and pavement are scarce, and that is advancing explosively across marshlands and rural areas.

Health Region XI of the Buenos Aires Ministry of Health warned today [22 Dec 2013] that "while the medical report speaks of 'a probable' case of [a] hantavirus [infection], based on the symptoms of the person who died, [a] hantavirus [infection; pulmonary syndrome] as well as leptospirosis are suspected. Accordingly, samples were taken to send to the Instituto Malbran, which will have the final word." The results [of the laboratory tests] will become known at the end of the day tomorrow [23 Dec 2013] or after [the Christmas holiday].

Both hantaviruses and leptospirosis are diseases [pathogens] transmitted by rodents.

[There have been previous cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Buenos Aires province this year (2013), so occurrence of the current case, above, is not surprising. The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about the specific virus involved when laboratory tests have been completed.

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems very unlikely in this case, which may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
