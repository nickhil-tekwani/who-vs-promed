The spread of a plague outbreak in Madagascar may finally be slowing down.
The epidemic, which began in August 2017, has taken the lives of 133 people and resulted in 1836 suspected or confirmed cases. However, the occurrence of new cases is finally decreasing, according to a report released [Wed 1 Nov 2017] by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The week of 9 Oct 2017, there were 477 new cases, compared with 161 during the week of 23 Oct 2017. The report says 1044 patients have been cured, and 83 others are receiving treatment. The number of hospitalizations because of the plague has also decreased, according to the WHO. Although the number of total cases has continued to increase, this is because of "enhanced surveillance and ongoing investigations," the WHO said; some of the cases were not actually infected, upon inspection.

The epidemic remains active in 12 districts, and among the total cases reported, 61 percent are said to be the pneumonic plague, according to the UN office. This is faster-spreading and more transmittable than bubonic plague, noted Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the WHO; "compared with past outbreaks, this year [2017] there is a higher portion of pneumonic plague cases."

Since plague is endemic (or regularly found) in Madagascar, its "spread to non-endemic areas which were not used to handling plague cases, including densely populated cities," may have caused a more severe outbreak, according to Jasarevic. The unusual spread of pneumonic plague in this outbreak was due to one infected person who traveled to find care early in the outbreak, infecting people along the way. These individuals infected others, leading to several chains of transmission, added Nyka Alexander, a representative of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.

Ongoing efforts to control the spread of bubonic and pneumonic plague include seeking out and treating new cases, identifying the method of disease contact, disease follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and "safe and dignified burials," the WHO said in a statement.

The calm of the plague has been broken by the suspicious death of 3 people in Antananarivo, [Tue 31 Oct and Wed 1 Nov 2017]. Unlike the cases reported recently, they all died at the community level with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positive for plague, as reported by the Municipal Bureau of Health (BMH) of the Urban Commune of Antananarivo (AUC), which supports the deceased outside health facilities and burial of plague victims in the city of Antananarivo. These deaths were recorded in Andohamandry Manjakamiadana at Andrainarivo and Ampahibe. The first 2 were on [Tue 31 Oct 2017], and the last [Wed 1 Nov 2017]. The Ministry of Health has not yet confirmed cases in Andrainarivo and Amparibe.

One of Andrainarivo victims was homeless. "He bowed out on the street," reports a source at the BMH. It would, thus, the 1st homeless victim of the plague in the capital. "If the response is not reinforced, the disease will spread quickly to his family and all those who came into contact with him," says a doctor. The BMH took his body for burial in the grave of Anjanahary last night [Wed 1 Nov 2017].

The deaths at community level should be alarming indicators for the Department of Public Health. People probably think that the danger is past, with the decline of the victims. So, they will not join the health facilities, despite the presence of symptoms, namely high fever, chills, fatigue, chest pain, cough with sputum streaked with blood. The active case, awareness and all response activities should be strengthened.

Yesterday, [Wed 1 Nov 2017], the Secretary General of Public Health, Dr. Joséa Ratsirarson emphasized that the plague patient who escaped the anti-plague hospital in Ambohimiandra (CHAPA), last [Thu 26 Oct 2017], has not been found. "We do not know what has become of him. The last time we joined him on the phone, he agreed to come back to the hospital for treatment, so far he has not showed up, "he says. We do not know until yesterday [Wed 1 Nov 2017], if it is one of those who died in Antananarivo.

On [Tue 31 Oct 2017], 83 people were under treatment at the facility level, a thousand people have been cured since the beginning of the epidemic and 7 new cases were recorded throughout Madagascar. With these 3 cases, the number of deaths would amount to 129 (now 133).

[There continues to be substantial variation in the numbers reported in this significant outbreak of plague, making interpretations of control difficult to make. This posting reports "more than 1800 suspected, probable and confirmed" cases, yet the post from 3 days earlier reported 1554 cases. These up and down numbers make it quite difficult to assess the state of this unique outbreak. Additionally, it is still difficult to see how the case fatality rate could be as low as it is with over 60 percent of the cases said to be pneumonic plague.
