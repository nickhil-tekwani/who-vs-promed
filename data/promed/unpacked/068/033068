Potato farmers are warning their crops are rotting in the fields. The Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) said it was one of the "worst potato harvests in living memory". Waterlogged fields have left as much as 50 per cent of harvest still in the soil.

[A farmer] who had decided to abandon harvesting, said: "A wet summer made it almost impossible to get onto the fields at the 7 day intervals required to keep the disease blight out of the crop." There are also reports that small amounts of rot are being found in harvested potatoes in storage.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material and fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks and seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are vital. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen. Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide with new strains emerging frequently (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

The postharvest rot mentioned above may also be due to _P. infestans_ carried over into storage facilities by tubers infected in the ground before harvest. Other postharvest rots of the crop include bacterial soft rot (_Erwinia_ spp.) and fungal dry rot due to _Fusarium_ species.
