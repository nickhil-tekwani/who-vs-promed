Four Azeris die, 90 sick from botulism
----------------------------------------------------
Four people have died and 90 others, including 10
children, are in hospital after eating contaminated fish at a wedding
reception in Azerbaijan, official media reported.
Doctors in the former Soviet republic diagnosed the food poisoning as
severe botulism, a paralysing nerve and muscle disease caused by toxins
produced by a bacterium sometimes found in home-canned food.
Sources at the state prosecutor's office said a criminal case had been
opened against the owners of a restaurant outside the Azerbaijan capital
Baku.
