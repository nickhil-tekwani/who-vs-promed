A mystery disease continues to create mayhem in backward Malkangiri district of Odisha. While 11 children have already fallen victim to it as per the report of the Chief District Medical officer (CDMO), unofficial sources, however, have put the toll at 20. The disease continues to spread at an alarming rate in Korkonda, Kalimela and Padia blocks.

"The disease is seen among children aged between one and 15. It starts with fever and causes vomiting, joint pain and muscle aches. The patients usually die within a day or 2," said Ghenu Madhi from Patrel village.

Health Department Odisha specialist medical teams from Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Berhampur have now reached the affected villages, such as Materu, Patrel, Aerbanpalli, Rangamatiguda, Chimtapali, Buduri and Chintalwada to collect blood samples.

Speaking to Oisha Sun Times, Irma Kabasi of Aerbanpalli said: "The villagers are really scared and have sent the kids away to their relatives. The entire village is now deserted. There are only 33 doctors in different community health centres out of 97 granted positions. The villagers have no choice but to turn to the local priests and herbal doctors, which makes matters worse," added Bhakta Madhi of Rangamatiguda.

"Mobile medical teams have reached the spot and are treating the patients in the affected villages. Blood samples of infected children have also been sent to the laboratory, and the test report is awaited. However, from the primary symptoms, we suspect it to be Japanese encephalitis," said Uday Shankar Mishra, CDMO of Malkangiri.

[Because Japanese encephalitis is suspected from the primary symptoms noted (presumably encephalitis), ProMED requests information concerning the results of the laboratory tests on the blood of the children when they become available.

Previous reports from northeastern India have indicated that only a small proportion of encephalitis cases are due to infections with Japanese encephalitis virus. Others have associated some encephalitis cases with contaminated water. However, in revisiting the comments made by Dr T Jacob John, he mentioned that cases in this area early in the year may be due to a Reye-like syndrome. In a 24 Jun 2014 comment (ProMED-mail archive no 20140625.2563561) concerning the Reye-like syndrome, he stated that "the disease is undoubtedly hypoglycemic encephalopathy (with blood glucose levels below 40 in about half the children in whom testing was done), and lower than 80 in 80-85 percent. The lesson was to give 10 percent dextrose infusion as soon as possible after drawing blood for glucose measurement. Pediatricians who did this tell me that children given 10 percent dextrose within a short period of onset tend to recover within a few hours and are well to go home the next day."

In another comment on 3 Aug 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140804.2656983), he noted, "I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region, and some AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] may indeed be West Nile encephalitis." He indicated that JEV cases occur later in the year during the typical JEV transmission season.

A 7 May 2014 report of a recent study from Odisha and Jharkhand states (ProMED-mail archive no 20140508.2459977) indicated that cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) were caused by infections with viruses of dengue and measles. However, this study indicated that although herpes simplex virus (HSV) was a dominant agent for acute encephalitis, in some cases the viral agents were those of dengue and measles. Over 16 per cent of cases were found to be caused by viral agents identified to be either HSV I or II, while another 2.6 per cent of cases were due to measles virus infections. Similarly, Japanese encephalitis virus caused 1.5 per cent of cases, followed by 0.57 per cent by dengue virus. This still leaves nearly 80 per cent of the cases without a diagnosis.

The report above provides no information about the JEV vaccination status of the population in the affected areas or the specific dates of occurrence of these cases.
