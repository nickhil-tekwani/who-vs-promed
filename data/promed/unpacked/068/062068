[There are several possible etiologies of the reported hemorrhagic disease cases that could be caused by a variety of viruses such as hantaviruses, including Hantaan virus and Seoul virus, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, for example. Bacteria could be involved as well. ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about the pathogens responsible for these cases of hemorrhagic disease.
