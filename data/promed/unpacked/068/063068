Detection of citrus canker (_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_) in Louisiana
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 21 Jun 2013, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the identification of _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_, the bacterial causal agent of citrus canker (CC), from citrus leaf samples collected from 2 trees in City Park, New Orleans, Orleans Parish. This is a new state record.

APHIS and the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF) are working together to survey citrus trees in City Park and the surrounding area for CC symptoms. To date, 3 trees at City Park and a tree in a residential area nearby have been confirmed positive for CC.

Currently, APHIS regulates Orleans Parish for citrus greening. There is no commercial production in this urban area or commercial citrus packing houses or commercial citrus nursery stock operations in the Parish. Following the completion of delimiting surveys and an analysis of the information, APHIS and the LDAF will determine the extent of the quarantine boundaries. Prior to this detection, the disease had only been confirmed in Florida.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_). The disease originated in Asia but is now present in most citrus growing areas worldwide, except Australia where an outbreak was successfully eradicated (ProMED-mail post 20090206.0528). CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family _Rutaceae_, and a number of different strains specialise in infecting different hosts. The disease can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves, and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacterium can be transmitted by mechanical means, water or insects within groves while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting material, but may also include planting of windbreaks to reduce insect numbers and wounds serving as ports of pathogen entry, bactericidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties.

A group of strains of the related _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_ originating in South America causes a similar disease in some locations but it is much less widespread and of lower economic significance.
