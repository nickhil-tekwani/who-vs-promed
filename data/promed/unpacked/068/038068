[1] Enhanced vaccination
Date: Mon 10 Jan 2011

The government yesterday [9 Jan 2011] intensified its response to the
outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD), extending the use of
vaccines to all animals in infected regions in an effort to protect
the last 4 virus-free provinces in the country: North and South
Jeolla, South Gyeongsang, and Jeju Island.

According to the government, 2.17 million cows and 611 000 pigs will
be vaccinated nationwide [These mean about 60 per cent of South
Korea's cattle population (2009 OIE data: 3 079 353 head in 181 404
establishments) and less than 10 per cent of the swine (9 584 903
animals in 7962 establishments). - Mod.AS]

The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries held an
emergency meeting yesterday [9 Jan 2011] and said it will conduct
vaccinations on all farms in Gyeonggi, Incheon, North and South
Chungcheong, Gangwon, and even FMD-free North Jeolla.

"We found additional confirmed cases of FMD at a hog farm in Bonghwa,
North Gyeongsang, and a cattle farm in Cheongwon, North Chungcheong,"
the ministry said. A cattle farm in Daegwallyeong, Gangwon was also
found to have the virus, it said.

To prevent the highly contagious disease from spreading to uninfected
regions, the government demanded that cities in neighboring
virus-free areas vaccinate all of their livestock.

The North Jeolla government also held a meeting yesterday [9 Jan
2011] and said that it will vaccinate all of its healthy animals
within a week.

"We will finish vaccination for 194 600 cows and 69 400 pigs in our 6
cities, Gunsan, Iksan, Jeongeup, Gimje, Buan, and Muju within a
week," said governor Kim Wan-joo.

Kim said the vaccination is needed to protect not only the region but
South Jeolla as well.

Since a cattle farm in Andong, North Gyeongsang was found to be
positive for the virus on 28 Nov 2010, the government has been unable
to curb the relentless spread of the disease.

The central government said about 1.28 million animals have been or
will be culled, and it is now thinking of allocating about 1.3
trillion won (USD 1.1 billion) as compensation for farmers.

[2] Culling and animal welfare issues
Date: Sun 9 Jan 2011

Pigs are being culled by the hundreds of thousands to halt the spread
of infections.

Sky News quoted a spokesman of an animal protection organisation,
Compassion in World Farming, as saying: "This is totally contrary to
international guidelines on humane culling, which the Korean
government endorsed 5 years ago. We urge the Korean government to end
this horrendous practice at once and to ensure that, if animals are
culled, it is done humanely."

The outbreaks of the disease threaten to keep pushing up prices of
beef and pork in Asia's 4th-largest economy. Hundreds of thousands of
officials have been working day and night to slaughter the animals
and vaccinate more than 1.2 million more.

About 1.1 million animals have been destroyed, or about 8 per cent of
South Korea's pigs and cattle [This statement is in need of further
clarification, since culling figures have not become available for
each species separately. - Mod.AS]

The government said: "[The] beef supply is getting unstable as
slaughter places are shut down, and the transfer of animals is
blocked due to foot and mouth disease."

The government said that, with the Chinese New Year being celebrated
from 2 to 6 Feb 2011, beef prices were "expected to continue rising
through a high-demand season," the country's largest holiday. Retail
prices of beef and pork on Thursday [6 Jan 2011] soared 10 and 11 per
cent respectively from Wednesday.

President Lee Myung-bak on Thursday [6 Jan 2011] called an emergency
cabinet meeting to discuss the disease, which affects sheep, cows,
and pigs. However, the disease and meat from infected animals are not
harmful to humans.

[re: ProMED-mail Foot & mouth disease - S. Korea (02): update 20110106.0072]
-------------------------------------------------------------
It is possibly interesting that, so far, there seems to be limited
solid information emerging to clarify the primary 'drivers' of the
observed spread, particularly the longer range spread. A similar
situation seemed to occur during the recent Japanese outbreak.

Have there been movements of:
- exposed animals;
- contaminated feedstuffs;
- contaminated animal products;
- contaminated people, and/or vehicles, and/or equipment (fomites),
and/or wildlife such as birds (mechanical vectors) or susceptible
species such as deer or antelope or wild boar, or people, vehicles,
and equipment involved in the investigations, stamping out, and/or
vaccination activities;
- airborne from affected premises, especially if very cold weather is
forcing affected animals (other than intensively-farmed pigs) to also
huddle or be housed densely, thereby leading to the generation of
potentially infectious 'plumes' (in which case, it could be possibly
valid to question whether 500 meter [0.3 mi] contiguous stamping-out
is adequate distance, and/or what may be needed for effect, and/or is
an effective distance really feasible/affordable, etc.);
- 'organized' malicious dissemination;
- etc.?

Has delayed detection and/or responsiveness played any part at all?

It might be quite premature and a moot point to try to discuss things
like the relative merits of vaccination versus preemptive contiguous
stamping out strategies without this type of information being more
readily and openly available.

With regard to preemptive contiguous stamping out, I suspect that it
might also be relatively important to consider its resource demands
and impact reducing the rate of geographical/focal spread (as much as
preventing spread) when dealing with a multifocal outbreak response
for a disease like FMD during the cooler months (which are more
favorable to the disease), versus the resources and time to fully
vaccinate more than 70 per cent of susceptible livestock, and it
possibly won't be a case of one size fits all outbreak foci in this
regard.

Vaccination doesn't provide instantaneous suppression or protection.
It can mask infection if the vaccine is not well matched to the
circulating strain; however, modern vaccines have come a long, long
way in reducing this phenomenon.

In case vaccination is applied in incubating animals, some of them
will continue to develop infection to the point of shedding virus
while clinical manifestation may be unnoticeable. If appropriate
surveillance and biosecurity measures are applied in addition to
vaccination, one should not, however, expect significant numbers of
vaccinates to be incubating at the time of vaccination.

Another point in need of clarification: should vaccination of cattle
(known to be more readily infected with FMDV) be prioritized, or
rather pigs (more likely to disseminate FMDV, especially via
aerosols), etc.?

With regard to vaccination, a degree of caution is in place if anyone
might perceive this to be some kind of low cost panacea solution. I
am critical of communicating vaccination as a "solution-in-a-needle"
to perceived wastage associated with stamping out strategies or when
vaccination is portrayed as an almost total replacement for stamping
out in any form; vaccination should be applied in addition to other
classical biosecurity and surveillance measures within available
resources. Possibly interesting is the ongoing aftermath of
vaccination in pigs in Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), as just one
contemporary example, which merits further study.

Then, what are the additional and/or changed demands on surveillance
and how long should it be continued once vaccination has been applied?

The main point of my comment is to draw attention towards the local
drivers of spread in South Korea, because they are what matter most
for risk assessment and ultimately determine whether or not
vaccination will be a net positive or a net negative with all its
associated complications and short and longer term resource
implications. In that sense, drawing parallels between the major,
2001 UK outbreak and what is happening in Korea at present could be
quite a stretch unless the local drivers respectively involved are
the same or quite similar. We've heard quite a lot about the spread,
but have yet to hear much more about the local drivers involved.

It all adds up to some very difficult technical and logistical
balancing and decision-making that, I think, can really only be done
well by people on the ground.

[The queries and views raised by Dr Thomson are valid and
appreciated. In particular, his call for more disease data and
epidemiological information, involving "somebody on the ground"
merits responses. It will help to note if international experts and
organisations have also been involved in the appraisal and analysis
of the epizootic throughout its evolution, and if information could
be obtained from such sources.

According to South Korea's reporting to the OIE (most recent
follow-up report, no 8, submitted 7 Jan 2011), during the period 29
Nov 2010 - 7 Jan 2011, the infected 97 localities included a total of
244 231 swine (77 cases, 0 dead) and 4278 cattle (147 cases, 0 dead).
All 248 509 animals on the affected farms were destroyed. That means
that "automatic contiguous pre-emptive culling", applied within a 500
metre [0.3 mi] radius of the infected farms, has already involved the
destruction of at least 800 000 susceptible animals. Most of them
were swine, but accurate figures for each species have not become
available.

Also, the genotyping results of the currently circulating serotype O
FMD virus strain have not become known, though it may be assumed that
it is the same strain identified during the earlier 2010 outbreak as
topotype SEA, genotype/strain Mya-98.

Information on the virus strain included in the applied vaccine will
help as well.

The epidemiological data, included in the OIE reports, are also in
need of clarification: apparent FMD morbidity rates of 2.52 per cent
(in cattle) and 0.03 (in swine) are regarded as exceptionally low for
fully susceptible populations.

Similarly puzzling is the absence of even one single dead animal
reported since the start of the epizootic to present. Has mortality
on affected holdings, in particular within offspring, been monitored?
