Malaria Imported from West Africa by Flight Crews
-------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notified the
Florida and Pennsylvania departments of health of 4 _Plasmodium
falciparum_-associated malaria cases among employees of a single
commercial airline. All 4 employees had traveled to Accra, Ghana,
during 25 Aug -- 2 Sep 2010, 2 of whom were on the same flight. Their
duration of stay in Accra ranged from 48 to 80 hours. All had stayed
at the same hotel and spent time outdoors near the swimming pool, in
restaurants without air conditioning, and in other locations during
the evening and night.

Of those cases, 2 were in female flight attendants aged 20-40 years,
and 2 were in male pilots aged 40-60 years. All had fever, headache,
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea approximately 2 weeks after their most
recent exposure in Accra. Three of the 4 received diagnoses of acute
_P. falciparum_-associated malaria on the basis of trophozoites
observed on microscopic examination of thin and thick blood films.
Malaria was diagnosed for one patient by blood smear, but the species
(_P. falciparum_) was determined by positive polymerase chain reaction.

One flight attendant was hospitalized for treatment, recovered
uneventfully, and was discharged after 2 days. The 2 pilots and the
other flight attendant were severely ill, were hospitalized, and
required intravenous treatment. Both pilots had respiratory distress
and required intubation. All recovered and were discharged after 6-15
days with diagnoses of acute malaria infection and acute respiratory
failure for the pilots.

None of the 4 airline workers had used antimalarial chemoprophylaxis,
despite company-paid atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone, GlaxoSmithKline)
being an element of this airline's malaria prevention strategy. All
reported having used insect repellent most of the time. Accra is
recognized as a high-risk area for malaria transmission (1). The CDC
advises travelers to West Africa, an area of intense transmission, to
use chemoprophylaxis as well as to take measures to avoid mosquito
bites, because even brief exposure can result in transmission (2).
Travelers to malaria-endemic countries, even for brief periods,
should be aware of the risk for malaria and of prevention measures
that can be taken.

[The cases underline that West Africa, even the capital of Ghana,
remains a high risk zone for malaria. Visitors to Ghana including
Accra are always recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis and had the
recommendations been followed, these malaria infections would have
been prevented. - Mod.EP]

[It is also noteworthy that even short time stays in a known malaria
endemic area -- in this case 48-80 hours -- can be associated with
malaria transmission.
