Russia: fatal case of CCHF reported in Ingushetia
-------------------------------------------------
A man has died as a result of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus
infection in Ingushetia, according to a primary care physician in the
Nazr-Kort district. Currently the medical authorities in Ingushetia are
striving to alert the general population to the dangers of CCHF virus
infection and are working to increase awareness of protective measures and
risk avoidance.
The first outbreak of CCHF in Ingushetia occurred in September-October
2004. At that time between 3 and 6 people died as a result of CCHF. The
virus is showing up again this year [2007].
CCHF is an infectious disease characterised by fever, severe general
discomfort, a hemorrhagic rash in skin and mucous membranes, and
hemorrhage. Sporadic cases occur in the southern parts of Russia, Ukraine,
Moldova, parts of Central Asia, the southern part of Kazakhstan, and parts
of Asia, Africa and southern Europe. The sources of infection are cows,
goats and some wild mammals. The reservoirs of infection are ixodid ticks.

[The Republic of Ingushetia in the Russian North Caucasus borders on
Georgia to the south. Its neighbours within Russia are Chechnya and North
Ossetia. A diagram of its location and a short description are available at
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3829691.stm>.
CCHF is caused by infection with a tickborne virus (genus _Nairovirus_) in
the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was first characterized in the
Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then
later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus
resulting in the current name of the disease.
CCHF virus is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet
Union. It is also distributed throughout the Mediterranean, in northwestern
China, central Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the
Indian subcontinent.
Ixodid (hard) ticks, especially those of the genus, _Hyalomma_, are both a
reservoir and a vector for the CCHF virus. Numerous wild and domestic
animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep and hares, serve as amplifying hosts
for the virus. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected
animal blood or ticks. CCHF can be transmitted from one infected human to
another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids. Documented spread
of CCHF has also occurred in hospitals due to improper sterilization of
medical equipment, reuse of injection needles, and contamination of medical
supplies. - Mod.CP]
