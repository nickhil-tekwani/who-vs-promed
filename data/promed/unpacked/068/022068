[These are cases of sylvan yellow fever occurring in an enzootic
area.There is a risk of the virus being carried [by such patients] to
urban areas where competent _Aedes aegypti_ vectors occur (dengue
virus is transmitted in Peru by these same vectors). One hopes that YF
vaccine coverage is adequate to prevent urban YF outbreaks.

distribution of YF cases can be accessed at the above URL. - Mod.TY]
