700 000 killed by bad food, water in Asia each year
----------------------------------------------------
More than 700 000 people die from consuming contaminated food or water in
the Asia-Pacific region every year, a United Nations conference heard Mon,
24 May 2004.
"The death toll of food-borne illnesses is staggering," said Hartwig de
Haen, assistant director-general of the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organization. He was addressing food safety policy-makers and specialists
from 40 countries in the region on global efforts to reduce the risk of
large-scale food-borne disease outbreaks and their public health and trade
ramifications.
The average estimated cost in each outbreak of food-borne illness is 100
dollars per person per year, and the cost could be much higher in
developing countries, De Haen said. Outbreaks of food-borne diseases can
badly strain health care systems and reduce productivity, said Han Tieru,
the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) representative for Brunei,
Malaysia, and Singapore.
Even though avian flu and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -- which
recently caused major public health crises in Asia -- were not food-borne
diseases, "they are all in some way related to either the way food is
produced or how food animals are handled," he said.

Toxic foods killing thousands, UN told
--------------------------------------
Industry officials and consumer activists from 42 Asian and Pacific Rim
countries met in Malaysia on Mon, 24 May 2004 to counter the threat of
food-borne diseases.
Countries must try to ensure food is produced, handled, and distributed
more safely to prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide each year
from food-borne illnesses, officials told the UN-backed conference.
Recent reports of toxic maize that is believed to have killed dozens of
people in Kenya and the possibility of salmonella in raw almonds exported
by a US company have underscored fears about how contaminated food can
threaten people's health and disrupt international trade, said Hartwig de
Haen of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
"From the farm to the final consumer, the risk of food-related outbreaks
needs to be reduced," de Haen told government regulators, food industry
officials and consumer activists from 42 Asian and Pacific Rim countries at
the launch of a food safety conference.
De Haen, the FAO's assistant director-general, noted that the US Food and
Drug Administration has in the past week recalled 13 million raw almonds
distributed by California-based Paramount Farms Inc because of the
possibility of salmonella. The almonds were distributed nationwide and in
the UK, France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, and Taiwan.
"From the farm to the final consumer, the risk of food-related outbreaks
needs to be reduced."
De Haen said the death toll of food-borne diseases globally was
"staggering," especially in developing countries, where poor governments
lack funds to monitor food safety and people's choices of food sources are
often limited.
Severe diarrhea kills 1.8 million people annually, de Haen said. High
casualties can also surface from smaller, sporadic outbreaks such as a
suspected mold contamination of maize in eastern Kenya that is believed to
have killed up to 40 people so far.
Outbreaks linked to food production can badly strain health care systems,
as demonstrated by recent regional health emergencies such as bird flu and
SARS, said Han Tieru, the World Health Organization's representative for
Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore.
"Our region is not immune from food safety concerns," Tieru said. "Even
though avian flu and SARS are clearly not food-borne diseases, they are all
in some way related to the way food is produced or how animals are handled
in the food market," he said.
Avian flu originated in chickens, while scientists suspect that SARS was
passed to humans from civet cats and other mongoose-like animals sold in
live food markets in southern China.
Malaysian Deputy Health Minister Abdul Latiff Ahmad said his country was
concerned about "the globalization of food trade," which has triggered
international health scares in recent years over cases of dioxin
contamination, mad cow, and foot-and-mouth disease.
Delegates are also expected to discuss measures to curb the impact of
pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables, antibiotics in seafood and
poultry, and other weaknesses in food quality control.

Food-borne diseases pose a serious threat to densely populated areas of
Asia and the Pacific, 2 UN agencies said today. "So far, food contamination
incidents and food-borne disease outbreaks in the region have been
relatively isolated, but the potential danger is just round the corner.
Already an estimated one in 3 people worldwide suffer annually from a
food-borne disease, and 1.8 million die from severe food and waterborne
diarrhea."
Seeking to head off future threats to public health and international trade
posed by potentially unsafe food in Asia and the Pacific, food safety
officials and experts from some 40 countries in the region are meeting this
week in Seremban, Malaysia at a 4-day Regional Conference on Food Safety,
under the auspices of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and
the World Health Organization (WHO).
"The danger of food-related outbreaks is particularly acute in Asia and the
Pacific, because of the instances in which animals and people live in
proximity and the way in which some food is produced and distributed," says
Dr Kerstin Leitner, WHO Assistant Director-General responsible for Food
Safety. The avian influenza epidemic, as the most recent example of a
disease linking food, animals and human health, has been historically
unprecedented and of great concern for human health as well as for
agriculture, with 23 fatal human cases and about 100 million birds died or
culled. However, in the region, more than 700 000 people die and many more
are debilitated every year from single cases of food- and water-borne
disease -- single cases that most often do not hit press headlines.
On the trade side, disruptions due to shortcomings in food quality have
also been on the increase. "Since 2001, unacceptable pesticide residue
levels in fruits and vegetables, chloramphenicol and other antibiotic
residues in seafood and poultry, pathogens in seafood and mycotoxins in
crops and peanuts have been the cause of rejection of food export from the
Asian region,'' according to Hartwig de Haen, FAO Assistant
Director-General, Economic and Social Department. A ban on fish imports
into the EU cost one Asian country $335 million of lost export opportunities.
The export of peanut meal by one Asian country to the European Union
dropped by more than $30 million per year since the EU introduced new
mycotoxin regulation in the early 1980s. Recent scandals with
life-threatening sub-standard or chemical contaminated food are just the
tip of the iceberg of a widespread and growing public health problem. They
are symptomatic of food safety systems not properly working and of the lack
of integrated mechanisms in the region -- and often within individual
countries -- to predict potential outbreaks and organize rapid responses to
prevent them.
The Food Safety Regional Conference is the response to the urgent need for
countries in the region to work together to develop harmonized and
coordinated food safety systems, resulting in uniform emergency responses
to such threats, the UN agencies say.
The Conference is part of a series of regional meetings that FAO and WHO
are jointly organizing to meet the needs of member countries for policy
guidance and capacity-building in food safety. A practical action plan is
expected to emerge from this meeting to help the region overcome the
difficulties and problems it faces in improving food safety, including
surveillance and response systems. Particular attention is devoted to
covering the full food production chain, with a special focus on the
segments that are best suited for interventions to significantly lower the
food-borne disease risk.
