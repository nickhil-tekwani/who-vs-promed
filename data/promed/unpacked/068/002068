British Columbia: first probable human WNV infection is travel related
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An Okanagan resident is the first person in British Columbia to test
positive on initial screening for West Nile virus infection, reported the
Interior Health Authority (IHA) and BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC)
today. The woman probably became infected while traveling in Colorado in
August. Colorado has significant West Nile activity, with multiple human
cases reported in 2003. "West Nile virus is known to be active in the
Colorado area, and our extensive surveillance in BC has not shown West Nile
virus activity anywhere in the province to date", said BCCDC epidemiologist
Dr Murray Fyfe.
The case is currently classified as probable, based on initial screening
tests conducted at BCCDC. Over the next 2 weeks, further testing will be
performed at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg to confirm whether
West Nile virus conclusively caused this infection. "This patient is now
recovering at home," said Dr William Moorehead, medical health officer,
IHA. "The patient did require hospitalization for several days but has
since been discharged."
IHA has been working with BCCDC to monitor for West Nile virus in dead
corvids and mosquitoes since late spring. As of 27 Aug 2003, more than 1700
birds and 5800 mosquitoes from across the province had been tested for West
Nile virus, with no positive results. "So far, all surveillance test
results in the Interior have been negative," said Moorehead. "In this
patient, given the travel history, infection must have occurred while
outside of BC."
While no West Nile virus has been detected in BC birds or mosquitoes yet,
Fyfe advises the BC public to be aware of the steps they can take to
prevent infection. "This is particularly important when traveling to areas
where West Nile is known to be present, such as the Prairie Provinces in
Canada and most states in the US," said Fyfe. It is important to remember
that the risk from West Nile virus is very low. In areas where West Nile
virus is present, less than one per cent of mosquitoes are infected. Of
those bitten by an infected mosquito, only one in 5 (20 per cent) goes on
to develop any symptoms at all. Symptoms are usually mild and flu-like,
lasting a week or less. Of those who are symptomatic, less than one per
cent experiences severe illness.
BC has a comprehensive and coordinated West Nile virus surveillance program
in place. The BCCDC and regional health authorities continue to monitor for
the virus in crows, mosquitoes, and humans. The public can report sightings
of dead crows on the BCCDC website at <http://www.bccdc.org> or through
their regional health authority.
