Malaria diagnosed in 12 people in Mardin district
-------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health reports that 12 cases of malaria were found during a survey in Mardin district.

The Ministry of Health stated that malaria was carefully surveyed and a few cases were found over the last 2.5 years. Other cases had been infected abroad. The Ministry of Health had assigned spraying teams [indoor residual spraying we presume]. All patients were in good condition and receiving appropriate treatment.

[Plasmodium vivax malaria is well known in southern Turkey. Turkey reported 84 345 probable and confirmed cases in 1994, but only 84 cases in 2009 (World Malaria Report, WHO 2010. http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/index.html).

If the report signals an increase in southern Turkey, it could reflect an increase in Syria with increased transmission in the border areas from refugees who fled to Turkey. - Mod.EP
