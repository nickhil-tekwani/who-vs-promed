Tick paralysis is a rare disease characterized by acute, ascending, flaccid
paralysis that is often confused with other acute neurologic disorders or
diseases (such as Guillain-Barre syndrome or botulism). Tick paralysis is
thought to be caused by a toxin in tick saliva; the paralysis usually
resolves within 24 hours after tick removal. During 26-31 May 2006, the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment received reports of 4
recent cases of tick paralysis. The 4 patients lived (or had visited
someone) within 20 miles of each other in the mountains of north-central
Colorado. This report summarizes the 4 cases and emphasizes the need to
increase awareness of tick paralysis among health care providers and
persons in tick-infested areas.
Case 1. On 15 May, a girl aged 6 years from Weld County awoke with symptoms
of bilateral lower extremity weakness. She attended school as usual but
needed assistance from a friend to walk outside for recess, where she fell
down and was unable to get up. Her mother took her to an outpatient clinic,
and a neurology appointment was arranged for the next day. She awoke the
next day with a tingling sensation in her hands and feet, an inability to
sit or stand on her own, and difficulty swallowing. She was taken to a
local emergency department (ED) and transferred to a regional children's
hospital. A physical examination revealed ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of
muscles controlling eye movement), dysarthria (slurred or abnormal speech),
and areflexia (absence of neurologic reflexes); nerve conduction studies
indicated decreased velocities. The girl was admitted to the intensive care
unit on 16 May with a presumed diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome and
subsequently required intubation. On the evening of 17 May, a nurse who was
bathing the girl found a tick along her hairline. Investigators later
learned that the tick had been visible on magnetic resonance imaging of the
girl's head earlier that day. The tick was removed immediately, and the
girl's symptoms improved; she was discharged home a week later. The tick
was identified as a female _Dermacentor andersoni_. The girl often had
visited her grandmother in the mountains in Larimer County and frequently
hiked in the area. Seven days before symptom onset, the girl had visited
her grandmother and played outside in the yard.
Case 2. On 22 May, a man aged 86 years from the mountains in Larimer County
began to have increased difficulty standing and transferring to and from
his motorized scooter. The man was homebound as a result of chronic
polyneuropathy and weakness from spinal stenosis. The next morning, his
weakness worsened, and he was unable to walk or grasp objects. He called
for emergency services and was admitted to the local hospital with a
diagnosis of progressive worsening of his chronic neuropathy. Physical
examination revealed normal cranial nerve function but generalized
weakness; deep-tendon reflexes were absent. On the evening of 23 May, a
nurse who was changing the man's gown noticed a tick on his back. After
tick removal, his symptoms improved during the next 4 days, and he was
discharged home on 27 May, although 2 weeks later he did not feel he had
yet recovered to his baseline condition. The man did not report any recent
travel or spending any time outd oors, with the exception ofdaily visits to
his mailbox using his scooter. He owned a dog that was often outside, and
he believed this was the likely source of the tick; the dog had no signs of
tick paralysis.
Case 3. On 22 May, a woman aged 78 years from the mountains in Grand County
had generalized weakness and difficulty walking. During the next few days,
her signs and symptoms progressed to facial weakness, slurred speech,
decreased taste, and confusion. While the woman was preparing to go to the
ED on 25 May, her roommate noticed a tick on the back of the woman's neck
below the hairline. Physical examination in the ED revealed normal cranial
nerve function and no appreciable weakness, but the patient did have
decreased deep-tendon reflexes. The ED physician removed the tick by
cutting the surrounding tissue with a scalpel. The patient was discharged
home to recover. The patient subsequently reported that within 24 hours her
weakness, alteration in taste, and confusion were resolved; however, 3
weeks after discharge, she still became tired easily. The woman reported
that she hiked or walked outside daily.
Case 4. A man aged 58 years from Larimer County with a history of chronic
renal failure traveled to southern Texas on 20 Apr. On 24 Apr, he had a
tingling sensation in his hands and perioral numbness. Three days later, he
collapsed while trying to stand and was unable to get up. While helping him
off the floor, his wife discovered a tick on the man's back. She removed
the tick before transporting him to a local ED. He was transferred and
admitted to an intensive-care unit but did not require intubation. Several
hours later, he began to regain feeling in his hands and was able to walk
with assistance. He was discharged home on 5 May, but 6 weeks later he
still reported residual subjective weakness. The patient reported that he
frequently performed yard work and various outdoor recreational activities.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The 4 cases described in this report illustrate the importance of
considering tick paralysis in the differential diagnosis of persons with
ascending paralysis who live in or visit tick-endemic regions. Diagnosis is
confirmed by finding a tick embedded in the skin and observing for signs of
improvement after tick removal; no other test exists for confirming tick
paralysis. Although rare, cases of tick paralysis have been identified
worldwide; most cases in North America occur in the western regions of
Canada and the United States. The species most often associated with tick
paralysis in the United States and Canada are the Rocky Mountain wood tick
(_D. andersoni_) and the American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_);
however, 43 tick species have been implicated in human disease around the
world (1). Most North American cases of tick paralysis occur during
April-June, when adult Dermacentor ticks emerge from hibernation and
actively seek hosts (2).
Tick paralysis is thought to be caused by a toxin secreted in tick saliva
during feeding that reduces motor neuron action potentials and the action
of acetylcholine, depending on the species of tick (1,3). Symptom onset
usually occurs after 4-7 days of tick feeding. Ascending flaccid paralysis
progresses over several hours or days; sensory loss does not usually occur,
and pain is absent (4,5). Resolution of symptoms usually occurs within 24
hours of tick removal. When the tick is not removed, the mortality rate
resulting from respiratory paralysis is about 10 per cent
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00040975.htm>6,7).
Although tick paralysis is not a reportable disease in the state, the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment receives, on average,
a report of one case per year. The geographic and temporal clustering of
cases described in this report is unusual. No explanation exists to account
for this clustering; the risk for acquiring tick paralysis has been
widespread in the western United States and Canada.
The cases described in this report also differ in other respects from
previous reports. For example, the majority of patients have been children,
particularly girls (2,7). However, in this cluster, only one patient was a
child, and 2 patients were aged >70 years. The ticks removed from all 4
patients were on the neck or back; in previously reported tick paralysis
cases, ticks were predominantly on the head and neck (7). Although outdoor
exposure, such as hiking or camping in wooded areas, is usually associated
with tick paralysis, one of the 4 patients was homebound with limited
outdoor exposure.
Health care workers discovered the ticks incidentally on 2 of the patients
whose conditions had received alternative diagnoses. Health care providers
should consider a diagnosis of tick paralysis in any patient living in or
visiting a tick-endemic area who has acute, symmetric paralysis and should
perform a complete examination for ticks, particularly on the head, neck,
and back. Ticks should be removed by grasping the tick close to the
patient's skin with forceps and pulling with a steady, even pressure (8).
Persons in tick-endemic areas should be educated regarding tickborne
diseases and should perform routine checks for ticks after possible
exposures. Insect repellents should be applied to skin, and
permethrin-containing acaricides should be sprayed on clothing to help
prevent tick bites. Additional information regarding prevention of
tickborne diseases is available at <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/ticktips2005>.
