The Republic of Korea had been free from highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI), until a suspected outbreak was reported on 10 Dec 2003. The cases
were reported at a parent stock farm for broilers, which was located in
Eumsung county, Chungbuk province. The farm was immediately placed under
movement restrictions. Laboratory confirmation was obtained on 12 Dec 2003
at the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service.
A total of 19 farms were confirmed with HPAI. They were located in a total
of 7 provinces/metropolitan cities. The last case of the disease was
confirmed on 21 Mar 2004.
All 19 farms were restocked with sentinel animals. None of the sentinel
birds showed clinical signs of avian influenza. The final serological
testing of the sentinel birds was conducted on 13 Jul 2004. All results
were favorable.

[A link to an informative table, summarizing event dates, as well as
number, and types, of birds involved in the outbreak, is provided in the
original OIE posting.
With the exception of South Korea, this posting contains details of more
reports indicating that the Avian influenza situation is hardly resolved.
Again, we must remind everyone that time is not in our favor, when viruses,
especially influenza strains that can affect humans, are waxing and waning
in animal populations. - Mod.PC]
