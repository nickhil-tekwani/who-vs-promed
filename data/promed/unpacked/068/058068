Senasa confirms that 6 people were infected with Anthrax in Lambayeque
-----------------------------------------------
At least 6 people got infected with anthrax after being in close contact
with infected cattle in Monsefu district (northwest Peru) as reported by
SENASA, the Agricultural Ministry.
The chief of SENASA (Esmilda Arevalo) in Lambeyeque said that 6 people were
observed with anthrax signs after a screening in 2 towns in the area. The
outbreak was detected last Friday [30 Jun 2006], after SENASA workers were
warned about cattle dead due to anthrax by residents of Pompape and Villa
Hermosa de Monsefu. Arevalo said that the outbreak is very contagious [sic]
and could be passed to farmers if they don't follow SENASA recommendations
to bury dead animals at 7 meters deep in the ground.
She also stated that SENASA experts have gone to those towns in order to
detect other cases in cattle and that vaccination has started in the
cattle. The director of Animal Health of SENASA, Oscar Rodriguez, indicated
that some producers (farmers) will not vaccinate their animals due to old
beliefs that the animals are pregnant and could die due to the vaccine.
Dominguez exhorted the producers to vaccinate their animals and to notify
SENASA of the existence of anthrax cases or any other contagious disease.

SENASA reports that at least 6 people were infected with anthrax in Monsefu
district, Lambayeque department (North of Peru) after working with sick
cattle. Arevalo (chief of SENASA in Lambayeque) said that 6 people were
observed with anthrax signs after a screening in 2 towns in the area. The
outbreak was detected last Friday [30 Jun 2006] after SENASA workers were
warned about 12 cattle dead due to anthrax by residents of Pompape and
Villa Hermosa de Monsefu.
Arevalo ... also indicated that SENASA experts have gone to those towns in
order to detect other cases in cattle and that vaccination has started in
the cattle. A resident of Pompape asked the authorities to get more
involved with the affected people that don't show complications. He said
that their neighbors were sick due to working with sick animals. He also
said that they need more attention, because although they are vaccinating,
some animals are still dying. SENASA stated that there are 900 animals in
Pompape and Villa Hermosa and that 830 were vaccinated. The Chief of Animal
Health of SENASA warned that the bacteria causing anthrax could remain for
more than 40 years in the site if not adequately controlled. There are
endemic areas in Peru, where human cases of anthrax in skin are commonly
seen. Since the end of the last decade, there has been a policy of
vaccination of cattle in order to eradicate the disease.

[Firstly, anthrax is infectious; it is not contagious. Secondly, if at all
possible, carcasses should be burnt, not buried. Traditionally, the advice
was to bury in quicklime, not agricultural lime, but I doubt whether folks
can find that nowadays. And 7 meters strikes me as a gross typo error for 2
meters. If the carcass has not been opened, decomposition results in a
rapid drop in pH, and this is lethal to the vegetative cells. But if the
animal has been necropsied or opened up by scavengers, there will be
extensive sporulation. Burying such a carcass just ensures problems on
another day, thus the advice to burn.
Yet again, we are seeing cattle deaths immediately post-vaccination. If one
can, whenever there is a suspicion that some animals might be incubating
disease, it is best to treat them 1st with long-acting antibiotics, and
then vaccinate them 7-10 days later.
Bovine anthrax is reported annually in Peru and occurs in about 5 out of 10
of the coastal departments. Lately, it has been reported in the following
departments: Ancash, Cajamarca, Huanuco, Ica, La Libertad, Lima, Moquegua,
and Tumbes. The high frequency of human cutaneous cases indicates that it
is extensively underreported. To find Lambayeque, go to:
