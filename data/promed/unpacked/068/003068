[The numbers of deaths from encephalitis in eastern Uttar Pradesh state in 2012 continue to climb from 129 on 12 Jul 2012, to 146 as of 30 Jul 2012, to 241 on 3 Sep 201, and now to 275 in the report above on 11 Sep 2012. The etiology of the encephalitis cases mentioned in the report is not specified. The previous reports concerning the etiology of these cases are confusing, sometimes mentioning Japanese encephalitis virus infections for some or all of the cases and at other times associating the cases with contaminated water suggesting enteroviruses. Still another report proposes heat stroke as the cause of these cases. If effective control and prevention measures are to be taken, it is essential to know which pathogens are involved.
