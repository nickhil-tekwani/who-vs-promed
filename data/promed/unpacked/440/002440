[1] Cholera - Namibia (Ohangwena) ex Angola (Cunene)
Date: Wed 18 Apr 2007

There is a diarrhea outbreak in the Ohangwena Region, which has
claimed 4 lives. Health authorities have detected 33 diarrhea cases
and 2 cholera cases have also been reported. The disease outbreaks
are suspected to have been spread through handwashing rites at
funerals where all mourners are required to wash their hands in a
single dish containing herbs after the burial.
According to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health and
Social Services, Dr Kalumbi Shangula, on 3 Apr 2007, a villager of
Onaame near Okatope Clinic in the Engela District died of a chronic
illness. Two days later, the widower of the deceased and 14 other
mourners contracted diarrhea. It is suspected that mourners who came
from Xangongo and Ondjiva in [Cunene (Kunene) Province] of Angola
could have spread the disease.
The 14 people have recovered after receiving treatment in Okatope
clinic. [An additional 19] mourners received treatment at Engela
Hospital; 8 of them were discharged while 11 were admitted. Of those
admitted, 4 have died and the others are reported to be in
satisfactory condition.
Shangula stressed, "Special attention is given to the practice where
all mourners have to wash their hands in one bowl after burial. This
can facilitate transmission. The community is urged to use
alternative ways of cleansing."
He appealed to the public especially those in areas where the disease
has been reported to ensure that people do not wash their hands in
the same water.
Regarding cholera cases, the Permanent Secretary reported that,
"_Vibrio cholera_, the causative agent was isolated in 2 patients. In
some specimens, salmonella was isolated."
Since February 2007, there had been no new cases reported, until now.
During the period November 2006 to early March 2007, 6 instances were
confirmed as cholera cases but in all the cases, the victims were
discharged after receiving treatment.

[3] Cholera - Angola (Cabinda)

The municipal director of public health, Fernando Puna reported to
ANGOP (Angola Press) that 58 cases of cholera were registered in Buco
Zau district, northern Cabinda province, since early April 2007.
According to a source, 12 of these patients are still under medical
care in the municipal hospital, 2 of whom are in [serious condition].
In Puna's opinion, the poor quality of water and the deficient basic
drainage associated to the rains that have been falling in the past
days, are some of the main causes of the reappearance of cholera in
that northern part of Cabinda.

The joint report by the semi-autonomous south Sudan government and
the World Health Organization (WHO) said 5218 people had exhibited
cholera-like symptoms of acute watery diarrhea, and of those 140 died.
Hundreds of thousands of south Sudanese returning home after the
peace deal are especially at risk because they often live in crowded
camps where infectious diseases can thrive.
