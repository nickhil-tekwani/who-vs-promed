The following is a summary of clinical guidance for evaluation and
management of persons potentially exposed to XDR TB on 2 recent
transatlantic flights. If you have any questions on these or other clinical
issues, please write to us at <coca@cdc.gov>.
A person with recently diagnosed culture-confirmed, extensively
drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (XDR TB) traveled on the following 2
extended flights (more than 8 hours in duration) in May 2007:
Date Depart Arrive Airline/Flight number
12 May 2007 Atlanta, GA (ATL) Paris, France (CDG)/ Air France #385 / Delta
#8517
24 May 2007 Prague, Czech Republic Montreal, Canada/ Czech Air #0104
For purposes of this XDR TB contact investigation, all USA residents and
citizens who were on the flights listed above are to be considered contacts
of the XDR TB patient.
If a person identifies themselves as a passenger on one of these flights,
we are requesting your assistance to perform TB evaluation and testing, or
to refer the passenger to the appropriate state or local TB Control office
so TB testing, evaluation and follow-up can be performed:
TB Controller Officers - State:
<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/xdrtb/pdf/tbcontrol-state.pdf>
TB Controller Officers - City:
<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/xdrtb/pdf/tbcontrol-city.pdf>
Specific information must be collected on each passenger as part of this
contact investigation. Please access the XDR TB Contact Investigation Form
(PDF) and enter the requested information.
Please keep a copy of this completed form for your records, give a copy to
the person tested, and also please contact your State or Local TB Control
office. Below on this update are the latest algorithms for evaluation and
management of both non-immunocompromised and immunocompromised contacts of
this XDR TB patient.
Summary of post-exposure TB evaluation and testing
--------------------------------------------------
All USA residents and citizens who traveled on either of the flights listed
above are to be considered contacts of the XDR TB patient. Among persons
who are infected with _M. tuberculosis_ (that is, latent tuberculosis
infection), it can take 8 to 10 weeks following exposure until the
tuberculin skin test (TST) result or QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) becomes
positive. A 1st-round TST or QFT-G, not both, should be performed as soon
as possible following exposure to the XDR TB patient.
If the 1st round of symptom screening and TST or QFT-G result is negative,
a second TB evaluation and TST or QFT-G is performed 8-10 weeks following
the last known exposure to the XDR TB patient on the flight (that is, Round
2 testing).
A 2nd round of TB evaluation and testing should be done because a negative
TST or QFT-G result obtained less than 8 weeks after exposure may be
considered unreliable for excluding latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).
For purposes of a contact investigation, a TST result of at least 5 mm in
duration is positive for any contact.
Persons with a documented prior positive TST or QFT-G result, or those who
have been previously diagnosed with TB disease, do not need to be retested.
However, these persons should still undergo TB evaluation, which may
include signs and symptoms screening and chest X-ray.
Persons with a history of BCG vaccination should also undergo TB evaluation
and testing. Use of TST or QFT-G can be used in BCG-vaccinated persons. In
persons previously vaccinated with BCG, a TST result of at least 5 mm
induration is also considered a positive result and warrants further
evaluation.
Consultation with a TB expert, especially one with experience in managing
MDR or XDR TB, is strongly recommended. This is recommended especially for
any contact suspected of having active TB disease who has a positive TST or
QFT-G result or who is immuncompromised, regardless of TST or QFT-G result.
