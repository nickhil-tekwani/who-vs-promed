Seasonal rise in meningococcal disease: chief medical officer writes to all
doctors
A significant rise in meningococcal disease has been seen since the start
of 1999. A provisional total of 325 notifications (meningitis and
septicaemia) was received during the first two weeks of 1999. The
laboratory reports have also risen. The notifications are higher than for
the corresponding two week period in 1998, although the overall incidence
for the 1998/99 season so far is similar to that observed in recent years.
The recent increase has been seen in most regions. All age groups have been
affected, but the highest attack rate has been in children aged 0 to 4
years. Serogroup B infections predominate. Several clusters have occurred
in schools and in the wider community, but most cases have been sporadic.
The incidence of meningococcal disease is greatest in the winter months,
and peak rates usually occur in January. The chief medical officer (CMO)
for England has this week written to all doctors, reminding them of the
symptoms and signs of meningococcal disease and of the importance of early
treatment with benzylpenicillin in suspected cases. The CMO's letter
advises general practitioners to be prepared to reassess children whose
clinical condition is deteriorating and urges staff in accident and
emergency departments to treat suspected cases of meningococcal disease as
emergencies. It offers advice on obtaining appropriate diagnostic
specimens, including a blood specimen in EDTA for polymerase chain
reaction.
Finally the letter reminds all doctors that the current PHLS guidelines,
including advice on the use of meningococcal vaccines, remain unchanged.
