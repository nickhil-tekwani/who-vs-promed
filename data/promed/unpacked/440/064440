Feds look ahead to next-generation COVID vaccines
-------------------------------------------------
As the nation grapples with surges of omicron subvariants that evade immunity from vaccination and previous infection, officials and pharmaceutical companies are starting talks on how to improve the shots and make them easier to administer.

In a related development, federal officials have signaled that 2nd boosters for those under 50 are on hold to speed production of new bivalent shots.

Wish list: broader protection, easier administration
----------------------------------------------------
The White House tomorrow [26 Jul 2022] will host a summit on the future of COVID-19 vaccines, which will be streamed online. One of the main topics is speeding development of a more broadly protective COVID-19 vaccine.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine advisory group recently recommended a bivalent booster shot that includes the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and an omicron variant, and at the meeting, several members aired concerns that officials will more frequently face the challenge of tweaking the vaccine to keep up with the quickly evolving virus.

At the global level, researchers are working on a roadmap for developing a new coronavirus vaccine to broadly protect against the most dangerous ones. [https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/cidrap-develop-vaccine-roadmap-future-coronavirus-threats ...the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota announced today (26 Jul 2022) that it has received USD 1 million in grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to create a Coronavirus Vaccines Research and Development (R&D) Roadmap.]

At tomorrow's summit [26 Jul 2022], experts will also discuss new options for delivering the vaccines, especially ways to make them easier to administer, such as intranasal or patch formulations. Participants will also tackle vaccine equity at both the domestic and global levels.

Second booster holding pattern for under-50 adults
--------------------------------------------------
As the BA.5 variant fuels outbreaks in several parts of the country, with hospitalizations also on the rise, federal officials have urged eligible groups to get their booster doses, especially those over 50 who are recommended to get a 2nd booster. However, officials still haven't recommended 2nd boosters for adults younger than 50.

Health officials are waiting to see if vaccine makers can more quickly deliver the updated boosters, by the middle of September [2022], unnamed sources told the Washington Post. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid= hp_pandemic_gfx/&state=US]

At a recent FDA advisory committee meeting, company officials said the updated boosters might be ready only in October [2022].

In other COVID developments:
- President Joe Biden's COVID-19 symptoms have almost completely resolved, except for residual nasal congestion and minimal hoarseness, his doctor, Keven O'Connor, DO, said today [25 Jul 2022]. Biden completed his 4th full day of Paxlovid treatment and is working remotely.
- US COVID-19 patterns are in flux, with new daily cases down 2% last week, hospitalizations up 4%, and deaths level, according to the Washington Post. Health officials have cautioned that it's difficult to gauge trends due to scaled-back testing policies and increased use of home-based rapid tests. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic_gfx/&state=US]
- Nearly 87% of the US population lives in locations with medium to high COVID community levels, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a [22 Jul 2022] update.
- In the European region, COVID-19 cases declined slightly last week, by 4.4%, but deaths rose 8.8%, with about 90% of the deaths in those ages 65 and older, according to the latest surveillance update from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Pooled hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates were up slightly. [https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/euro-covid19/]

[2] Antivirals

COVID-19 antivirals may cut risk of hospitalization, death
----------------------------------------------------------
A study today [25 Jul 2022] in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests that use of the oral antiviral drugs molnupiravir and Paxlovid in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 lowered the risk of hospitalization and death without raising the risk of adverse events. [Tyler Pitre, Rebecca Van Alstine, Genevieve Chick, et al. Antiviral drug treatment for nonsevere COVID-19: a systematic review and network meta-analysis. CMAJ Jul 2022, 194 (28) E969-E980; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.220471]

McMaster University researchers in Ontario led the systematic review and network meta-analysis of 40 randomized clinical trials that included 17 563 patients comparing the effectiveness of 16 different antiviral drugs or drug combinations, including molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid), and remdesivir, with standard care or a placebo in adults with non-severe COVID-19 up to 25 Apr 2022.

The researchers noted that most antiviral trials to date have included hospitalized patients with severe or critical disease rather than those with milder illnesses. "Furthermore, although efficacy data from trials of molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir are promising, no head-to-head trials have compared these drugs," they wrote. "This is particularly important as health care systems attempt to prioritize access to effective COVID-19 treatments in the early stages of the disease."

No death reduction with remdesivir
----------------------------------
Most trials in the meta-analysis involved unvaccinated patients and were conducted before the emergence of the highly transmissible omicron variant. Most patients were 36.5-65.5 years old, and proportions of men and women were comparable.

A total of 32 trials with 10 837 patients reported 291 deaths over a median follow-up of 29 weeks. The researchers assumed a baseline risk of 13.3 deaths per 1000 patients based on median risk in the standard-care and placebo groups.

Molnupiravir and Paxlovid each lowered the risk of death beyond standard care or placebo with moderate certainty (10.9 fewer deaths per 1000 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6 to 4.5 fewer for molnupiravir and 11.7 fewer deaths per 1000; 95% CI, 13.1 fewer to 2.6 more for Paxlovid).

A total of 10 trials with 5575 patients reported 252 hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 21 weeks. The researchers assumed a baseline risk of 54.4 hospitalizations per 1000 patients. Paxlovid lowered the risk of hospitalization by 46.2 admissions per 1000 (95% CI, 50.1 to 38.9 fewer) with high certainty, while molnupiravir likely reduced the risk of hospitalizations by 16.3 per 1000 (95% CI, 27.2 to 0 fewer) with moderate certainty.

Relative to molnupiravir, Paxlovid likely reduced the risk of hospitalization (27.8 fewer admissions per 1000 patients; 95% CI, 32.8 to 18.3 fewer) with moderate certainty. Remdesivir, on the other hand, likely had no effect on risk of death but may have lowered hospitalizations (39.1 fewer admissions per 1000; 95% CI, 48.7 to 13.7 fewer), but that finding had low certainty.

Results may help guide treatment recommendations
------------------------------------------------
A total of 14 trials with 3972 patients reported that 123 required mechanical ventilation over a median follow-up of 21 weeks. The researchers assumed a baseline risk of 22 mechanical ventilation events per 1000.

Relative to standard care or placebo, molnupiravir likely reduced the need for mechanical ventilation by 13 events per 1000 (95% CI, 18.3 to 0 fewer) with moderate certainty, and remdesivir may have lowered the need for mechanical ventilation by 11.8 events per 1000 (95% CI, 18.9 fewer to 12.1 more), but with low certainty.

The hepatitis C drug combination sofosbuvir-daclatasvir, however, likely raised the risk of needing mechanical ventilation over standard care or placebo by 11.1 events per 1000 patients (95% CI, 5.9 fewer to 45.9 more) with moderate certainty.

Twenty-two trials including 7465 participants reported 190 adverse events that led to discontinuation of antiviral therapy over a median follow-up of 29 weeks. The researchers assumed a baseline risk of 20 adverse events per 1000 patients.

Molnupiravir had similar rates of adverse events leading to drug stoppage as Paxlovid (5.1 more events per 1000; 95% CI, 3 fewer to 13.2 more) with moderate certainty. Compared with standard care or placebo, molnupiravir was tied to 4.4 fewer adverse events per 1000 (95% CI, 11 fewer to 2.1 more) with high certainty while, at 9.5 fewer events per 1000 (95% CI, 14.3 to 4.8 fewer) with high certainty, Paxlovid did not increase adverse events that led to stopping the drug.

"Our findings suggest that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be superior to molnupiravir for some outcomes, which has implications for organizations, such as the WHO [World Health Organization], that are in the process of developing recommendations addressing molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir," the researchers wrote. "Health care systems deciding on drug procurement and cost issues need to consider the relative efficacy of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir over molnupiravir."

In a related commentary, Corinne Hohl, MDCM, and Andrew McRae, MD, PhD, both of the University of British Columbia, said that the best methods of rapidly assessing the effectiveness of antiviral drugs against severe COVID-19 in the setting of viral and population dynamic evolution are large observational studies using linked administrative healthcare data and adaptive platform trials.

"These studies can be completed in Canada, but need to be supported by Canadian research funders, health care institutions, data custodians, health care providers and patients," they wrote. [Corinne M. Hohl, Andrew D. McRae. Antiviral treatment for COVID-19: ensuring evidence is applicable to current circumstances. CMAJ. 25 Jul 2022;194(28):E996-E997. DOI: 10.1503/cmaj.221012.

"...Applying available evidence to clinical and policy decisions as the virus and population characteristics evolve is challenging. This is reflected in current Canadian guidelines for the use of novel antiviral drugs, which vary by province in terms of the age groups and comorbidities that define "high risk" to determine eligibility for publicly funded oral antiviral therapy. These therapeutic decisions would benefit from additional evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but this evidence is unlikely to emerge soon."]
