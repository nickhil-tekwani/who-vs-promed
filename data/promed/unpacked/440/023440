The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported 2 Nov [2016] that a horse residing in Highlands County, Florida, has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

"The 2-year-old grade gelding had never received any type of vaccination and had no recent travel history," the EDCC said. "Clinical signs began on 25 Oct [2016] and the horse was euthanized for humane reasons the following day. This is the 2nd confirmed EEE case in Highlands County and Case 22 in Florida for 2016."

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2-3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[It is indeed unfortunate that this horse was not vaccinated -- an inexpensive and effective way to prevent EEE virus infection. The virus is endemic in Florida, where it is maintained in a bird-mosquito transmission cycle and is transmitted to horses and humans by mosquitoes that are bridge vectors. Even in areas where mosquito control is feasible and especially where control of vector mosquitoes is not possible, animals should be vaccinated. Equine animals should be revaccinated every 4 months in areas of high incidence. Mod.TG outlines vaccination recommendations in ProMED-mail archive no. 20161020.4573611.
