Further to the serotyping of the virus responsible for the epizootic in
Israel as EHDV-7 (see 20061214.3513), we have been informed by a reliable
source that the outbreak in Israel, initially recorded in late August 2006,
seems to have waned towards the end of November. During the epizootic, at
least 60 clinically affected cattle farms have been added to the first 55
included in Israel's official report of 23 Sep 2006.

According to information from another reliable source, clinical cases in
cattle, demonstrating typical EHD symptoms, were observed in the Kingdom of
Jordan, in several locations along the river Jordan, during September 2006.

[As a reminder to subscribers, the following description is copied from the
23 Sep 2006 notification of the Israeli Veterinary Services to the OIE
(<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_77.HTM#Sec8> and 20060925.2739): "A
bluetongue-like disease has been observed in more than 55 cattle farms
situated along the eastern border of Israel in an area 80 km long along the
Jordan rift valley from the Arava valley in the south to the north of
Galilee in the north. The morbidity has been 10 to 40 per cent, with very
low mortality. No cases have been observed in adjacent sheep and goat farms.

"The clinical signs reported are:
- general symptoms: reduced milk production, anorexia, reduced rumination,
fever, weakness, dyspnoea;
- oronasal symptoms: clear to purulent nasal discharge, salivation, nasal
and lip redness and scaling, tongue swelling and erosions;
- ocular symptoms: conjunctival hyperaemia, redness and oedema;
- gait symptoms: stiff gait, lameness, muscle tremor, recumbency."

To try being prepared for next year's developments, one would expect a
follow-up (or final) report from Israel, an official notification from
Jordan (hopefully also forwarding samples to the reference laboratory), as
well as information from other Middle-Eastern countries on the presence (or
absence) of similar symptoms in their respective cattle populations. - Mod.AS]
