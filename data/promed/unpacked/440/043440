[Earlier posts in the "confirmed" thread only confirmed that the virus was a
European bat lyssavirus. The report below confirms that it was, in fact,
EBLV 2. - Mod.JW]

Identity of Infectious Agent Confirmed as European Bat Lyssavirus 2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Veterinary Laboratories Agency confirmed on Sun 24 Nov 2002 that the man
in Scotland with a rabies-like illness was infected with a European bat
lyssavirus (EBLV) -- ref. (1). Unfortunately he died later that day.
The virus [species], EBLV 2, was the same as that isolated from a
Daubenton's bat in Lancashire earlier this year (2).
This is the fourth confirmed human EBLV infection (3, 4, 5). Since the case
in Lancashire, the advice that all bat handlers be vaccinated has been
reiterated. Preventive vaccine is provided both for licensed and voluntary
bat handlers free of charge by the PHLS (6). The PHLS also provides vaccine
for anyone who is bitten, scratched, or comes into some other types of close
contact with bats. Only those coming into such close contact are at any risk
at all of acquiring infection with EBLV. Vaccination is extremely effective,
and there are no recorded cases of EBLV infection in anyone who has been
fully vaccinated before or after exposure. Once symptoms of rabies develop
however the disease appears to be inevitably fatal.
The risk of infection with EBLV to the general public and to domestic
animals, including cats, is thought to be minimal. All bats are protected
species by law and should not be disturbed. Anyone who finds a bat should
avoid handling it and seek help from the Bat Conservation Trust (Helpline
number: 0845 130 0228).

[The genus _Lyssavirus_ comprises the type species _Rabies virus_ and 6
species of rabies-related viruses. The rabies-related viruses comprise the
African viruses _Lagos bat virus_, _Mokola virus_, & _Duvenhage virus_; the
European viruses _European bat lyssavirus 1_ & _European bat lyssavirus 2_:
and the Australian virus _Australian bat lyssavirus_). These have narrower
geographic distributions than the classical rabies virus, and although they
occasionally infect humans and domestic animals, they appear to
preferentially infect specific animal hosts.
EBLV 1 has been shown to be antigenically and genetically more closely
related to Duvenhage virus than to EBLV 2, and it has not been recorded in
the UK. The UK was free of rabies virus or rabies-related viruses from 1902
until May 1996, when a sick
Daubenton's bat (_Myotis daubentonii_) was recovered from the cellar of a
public house in Newhaven, East Sussex. Its condition deteriorated rapidly,
and it was euthanized. Histochemical and phylogenetic analysis confirmed
infection with EBLV 2. At that time it was believed that the infected bat
might have come from near the Franco-Swiss border. It would appear now that
EBLV 2 may be widespread in the Daubenton's bat population
of the UK. So far it has not been recorded in any other species of bat in
the UK. - Mod.CP]
