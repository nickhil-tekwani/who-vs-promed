Outbreak of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever - Uganda, August 2000 - January 2001
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 8 Oct 2000, an outbreak of an unusual febrile illness with occasional
hemorrhage and significant mortality was reported to the Ministry of Health
(MoH) in Kampala by the superintendent of St Mary's Hospital in Lacor, and
the district director of health services in the Gulu district. A
preliminary assessment conducted by MoH found additional cases in Gulu
district and in Gulu Hospital, the regional referral hospital. On 15 Oct
2000, suspicion of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) was confirmed when the
National Institute of Virology (NIV), Johannesburg, South Africa,
identified Ebola virus infection among specimens from patients, including
health care workers at St Mary's Hospital. This report describes
surveillance and control activities related to the EHF outbreak and
presents preliminary clinical and epidemiological findings.
Control activities were organized around surveillance and epidemiology,
clinical case management, social education and mobilization, and
coordination and logistic support. An active EHF surveillance system was
initiated to determine the extent and magnitude of the outbreak, identify
foci of disease activity, and detect cases early. Ill people were
encouraged to be assessed at a hospital and, if indicated, to be [admitted
to hospital to reduce further community transmission. Targeted prevention
activities included follow-up of contacts of identified cases for 21 days,
establishment of trained burial teams for all potential and confirmed EHF
deaths, community education, cessation of traditional healing and burial
practices, cessation of large public gatherings, and updates of hospital
infection control measures, including isolation wards. Laboratory testing
was performed at a field laboratory [set up at St Mary's Hospital by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and supplemented by
additional testing at CDC and NIV. Sequence analysis revealed that the
virus associated with this outbreak was Ebola-Sudan and differed at the
nucleotide sequence level from earlier Ebola-Sudan isolates by 3.3 per cent
and 4.2 per cent in the polymerase (362 nucleotides sequenced) and
nucleocapsid (146 nucleotides sequenced) protein encoding genes, respectively.
During the third week of October 2000, active surveillance was established
and included 3 case notification categories: alert, suspect, and probable.
The alert category comprised [people with sudden onset of high fever,
sudden death, or hemorrhage, and was used by community members to alert
health care personnel. The suspect category comprised [people with fever
and contact with a potential case-patient; persons with unexplained
bleeding; persons with fever and 3 or more specified symptoms (headache,
vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, weakness or severe fatigue, abdominal pain,
body aches or joint pains, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and
hiccups), and all unexplained deaths. The suspect category was used by
mobile surveillance teams to determine whether a patient required transport
to an isolation ward. The probable category included [people who met these
criteria and were assessed and reported by a physician. Laboratory tests
included virus antigen detection and antibody ELISA tests and reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Laboratory confirmed case-patients
were defined as patients who met the surveillance case definitions and were
positive either for Ebola virus antigen or [for Ebola IgG antibody.
From 5 Oct to 27 Nov 2000, among 62 [patients with confirmed EHF admitted
to Gulu Hospital, symptoms included diarrhea (66%), asthenia (64%),
anorexia (61%), headache (63%), nausea and vomiting (60%), abdominal pain
(55%), and chest pain (48%). Patients presented for care a mean of 8 days
(range: 2-20 days) after symptom onset. Bleeding occurred in 12 (20%)
patients and primarily involved the gastrointestinal tract. Thirty-six of
the 62 confirmed case-patients (58%) died; 4 of 5 patients aged less than
15 years died (case fatality: 80%). Spontaneous abortions were reported
among pregnant women infected with EHF. Patients who died usually exhibited
a rapid progression of shock, increasing coagulopathy, and loss of
consciousness.
As of 23 Jan 2001, 425 presumptive case-patients with 224 (53%) deaths
attributed to EHF were recorded from 3 districts in Uganda: 393 (93%) from
Gulu, 27 (6%) from Masindi, and 5 (1%) from Mbarara. The combined area
comprises [about 11 700 square miles (31 000 square kilometers; combined
population in 2000: 1.8 million). Although the cluster of cases in early
October 2000 triggered identification of the outbreak and response
measures, investigations (case-record review and interviews with surviving
patients or their surrogates) identified cases occurring in the community
and patients [admitted to hospital several weeks earlier. The [dates of
onset of illness of presumptive cases [were between 30 Aug 2000 and 9 Jan
2001. The ages of presumptive case-patients ranged from 3 days to 72 years
(median: 28 years); 269 (63%) were women. Mean time from symptom onset to
death was 8 days (95% confidence interval: +/- 5 days); 218 (51%)
presumptive cases were laboratory confirmed.
Epidemiological investigations identified the 3 most important means of
transmission as attending funerals of presumptive EHF case-patients where
ritual contact with the deceased occurred, and intrafamilial and nosocomial
transmission. After establishing the isolation wards, 14 (64%) of 22 health
care workers in Gulu were infected; these incidences led to the
reinforcement of infection control measures. Movement of infected contacts
of EHF cases from Gulu to Mbarara and Masindi districts initiated 2 distant
focal outbreaks. National notification and surveillance efforts led to the
rapid identification of these foci and effective containment.
MMWR Editorial note:
EHF is caused by infection with viruses of the genus _Ebolavirus_ in the
family _Filoviridae_. The zoonotic reservoir for the viruses is unknown;
however, outbreaks of EHF are associated most often with the introduction
of the virus into the community by one infected person followed by
dissemination by person to person transmission, often within medical
facilities. This is the largest reported EHF outbreak and the third known
Ebola-Sudan virus-associated outbreak. The first occurred in 1976 in the
southern Sudan towns of Nzara and Maridi and was concurrent with an
Ebola-Zaire outbreak in Zaire (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The
second Ebola-Sudan outbreak occurred in 1979 in the same locations. Similar
to the 1976 and 1979 outbreaks, the 2000 outbreak had a case fatality of
[about 50%. Also similar to the earlier outbreaks, the 2000 outbreak
seemed to [begin with the introduction of the virus into Gulu District
followed by transmission into the community and health care facilities.
However, the first cases associated with this EHF outbreak remain obscure,
which has limited the ability to investigate possible reservoirs of the virus.
Community transmission was eliminated by recognition of the outbreak,
initiation of case finding, case isolation and other infection-control
practices, and [admission to hospital of identified case-patients in
medical facilities where barrier nursing (eg, wearing personal protective
clothing) and other infection control procedures were implemented.
Decreased transmission also resulted from community education about the
dangers of contact with symptomatic and deceased EHF patients, the
establishment of specialized burial teams, and heightened awareness of the
disease among health care staff. Although transmission to health care
workers occurred during this outbreak, the use of isolation facilities
remains the most effective means of controlling EHF outbreaks. During the 4
month outbreak and response period, [about 5600 contacts in Gulu District
were under surveillance for 21 days by [about 150 trained volunteers. The
goal of ongoing prevention efforts is to identify specific risk factors for
disease acquisition in the community and hospitals, examine virological and
clinical parameters of infection, and increase the reporting of potentially
epidemic diseases into a national surveillance system.
