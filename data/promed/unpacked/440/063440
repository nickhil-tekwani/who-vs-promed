The Ross River virus that causes fatigue, joint pain, and rashes has been detected in Sydney mosquitoes after the New South Wales (NSW) floods. The virus was detected on Monday [28 Mar 2022] at the popular Narrabeen Lagoon on the Northern Beaches, through a mosquito trap surveillance program that uses honey to collect mosquito saliva. The Northern Rivers Local Health District said heavy rain and strong winds triggered the "perfect" breeding ground for mosquitoborne viruses.

The virus can be transmitted to humans through a bloodsucking bite. There are no vaccines against the virus, with symptoms occurring between 3 and 11 days after being bitten. In some incidents, recovery can take up to 6 months.

The warning comes amid Australia detecting cases of deadly Japanese encephalitis, which is also transmitted by mosquitoes. The deadly virus was detected around the time of last month's [March 2022] floods. The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals. In animals, it mostly occurs in pigs and horses.

Clinicians across Australia have been urged to watch out for the virus in people presenting with brain swelling or similar symptoms [sic]. Most human infections cause mild symptoms but someone with severe disease may present with inflammation of the brain, characterised by sudden onset of vomiting, high fever and chills, sensitivity to light, and neck stiffness.

Authorities have urged residents to avoid going outside during dawn and dusk when the insects are most active. Residents are encouraged to wear long-sleeved clothing and wear mosquito repellent as a preventive as flood clean up begins.

[Apparently, the NSW Arbovirus Surveillance and Mosquito Monitoring program has been active again this year (2022), reporting the presence of Ross River virus in mosquitoes but without human cases reported so far. Vector mosquito populations have increased due to flooding having increased mosquito breeding sites. Ross River virus infections can be significant in humans, causing fatigue and arthritis that can persist for weeks to months. Since there is no vaccine for this virus, avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. Mosquito surveillance can help to define areas of greatest risk.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) continues to be a public and animal health problem in the state. Surveillance of mosquitoes and pigs can help detect hot spots of JE virus transmission. Recent information from a reliable source confirmed that vaccination is already well under way in the state. NSW Health experts have prioritized vaccination according to risk of exposure, working with the larger piggeries to vaccinate their workers. Smaller piggeries (those with fewer than 10 workers) can access vaccines through their general practitioners. Vaccination efforts continue to be constrained by not having many doses of either Imojev or JEspect vaccines in the country. Avoidance of mosquito bites by the general NSW human population is prudent to avoid JE virus infections. - Mod.TY
