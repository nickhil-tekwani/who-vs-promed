A [human] anthrax case has been reported in the settlement of Istemas in
Russia's Orenburg region, the press service of the regional department of the
Rospotrebnadzor consumer rights watchdog reported on Tuesday. According to the
press service, a local villager contacted anthrax from a sheep he had
slaughtered. The disease was confirmed by lab tests. The man was hospitalized.
In 2004, 10 people got ill with anthrax in the settlement of Istemas after
eating meat from a local marketplace. The meat was from the neighboring town
of Orsk.
People can get infected when they take care of ill animals, when cattle are
slaughtered or when meat is [butchered]. That is why the situation in Istemas
is being monitored by specialists. All animals are subject to vaccination. In
this case, the sheep was slaughtered before reaching the age of 3 months, when
animals are vaccinated. The rest of the family had no contact with the animal
and were not infected.

[The index case was apparently a sick lamb under 3 months of age. Anthrax in
young stock is unusual, so I suspect that there is more to this story than has
been reported. That "all animals are subject to vaccination" suggests that
they might have a proactive vaccination control programme in place now. One
hopes so.

and lies along the Kazakhstan northern border. - Mod.MHJ]
