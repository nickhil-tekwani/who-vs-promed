[The concerning leap of BTV-8 from its (so far) most southern
location in Europe, namely south-west France/Catalonia to Andalusia,
a distance exceeding 900 km (560 miles), would have surprised us if
it were not BTV-8 -- a rather enigmatic bluetongue serotype. It would
be interesting to note if this invasion was related to animal
movement or to (less likely) windborne transmission by culicoides.
The large, susceptible sheep population in southern Spain; the
presence of another serotype there, namely BTV-4; the presence of
_Culicoides imicola_ in this part of Spain (an efficient BTV vector,
so far not involved in the dissemination of BTV-8 in Europe); and the
proximity of the outbreak (see map at the above URL) to Morocco and
Portugal, underline the complexity of this development. - Mod.AS]
