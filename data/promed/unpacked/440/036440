Under reporting of legionnaires' disease in France: the case for more
active surveillance
A major objective of the surveillance of legionnaires' disease is to
identify clusters in order to implement control measures. Complete case
reporting is essential because clusters are often small, and clusters of
travel associated cases are often diagnosed after travellers have
returned home, in scattered facilities, which hampers the identification
of common exposures.
In France, surveillance of legionnaires' disease started in 1987 with a
mandatory clinician-based notification system. An average of 54 cases
were reported yearly between 1988 and 1995 and six non-nosocomial
clusters were identified. In 1995 the surveillance systems for
infectious diseases in France were reviewed and a reappraisal of the
surveillance of legionnaires' disease was considered a priority. We
surveyed public hospital laboratories to estimate the level of
under reporting and to evaluate the feasibility of a laboratory based
reporting system. The cases identified through this survey were matched
to cases identified in the notification system and at the National
Reference Laboratory in order to estimate the number of cases diagnosed
in France in 1995_
Discussion
In this study, we used two routinely available sources of information
and the results of a survey to perform a capture-recapture analysis. The
use of three sources allowed us to exclude major interactions between
sources and to control for the variable [infectivity according to the
type of laboratory confirmation. The higher proportion of culture
confirmed cases reported to the notification system compared with those
diagnosed in the other sources may be due to the long delay for results
of serology.
The laboratories that took part in the survey (60%) represented 67% of
all admissions in acute medical wards in France and 66% of the estimated
number of cases diagnosed in France. This suggests that it was
reasonable to consider them as representative for the purpose of our
study.
Only one out of eight laboratory confirmed cases of legionnaires'
disease was reported in France in 1995. Under reporting was much higher
for legionnaires' disease than for AIDS, meningococcal disease, and
tuberculosis. To our knowledge, the completeness of reporting of
legionnaires' disease has not been evaluated in other countries. In the
United States, where legionnaires' disease is notified by clinicians, it
has been estimated that only 3% of total incident cases are reported,
but the proportion of cases diagnosed was not estimated. With such
levels of under reporting it is very likely that a substantial proportion
of community acquired clusters will not be identified through reporting,
therefore missing a major objective necessary for the timely control of
sources of infection.
According to our estimate, the incidence of legionnaires' disease in
France in 1995 would be of the order of 0.6 cases/million if based only
on reporting, 5 cases/million if based on our estimate of laboratory
confirmed cases, and 9 cases/million if cases diagnosed on the basis of
single high antibody titres were included_
Since May 1997, as a complement to clinician notification, local public
health doctors are informed of each confirmed case of legionnaires'
disease diagnosed at the reference laboratory. They are required to
obtain notification forms from clinicians who have treated cases of
legionnaires' disease who have not already returned the forms. These two
systems together, which represent an estimated 63% of laboratory
confirmed cases in France, should allow better detection of community
acquired and travel related clusters of legionnaires' disease.
