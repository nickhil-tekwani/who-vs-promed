WEST NILE VIRUS, EQUINE, CAMEL - UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (02): COMMENT

There are serious problems with the report: West Nile virus, equine, camel
- United Arab Emirates 20080121.0257
1. The paper published on the web site of "Wildlife Middle East"
<http://wmenews.com/> contains many errors of commission. For one, the
title of the article, "West Nile fever in the United Arab Emirates", is
misleading.
2. Apparently, much of the testing was done at Cornell University, which
screened samples from equines (horses, I presume) from 6 Emirates.
"WNV-specific IgM" and "serum neutralization test (SNT)" were done at
Cornell and "IgG capture" ELISAs were done at the Central Veterinary
Research Laboratory in Dubai, using a commercially-available (flavivirus
cross-reactive) kit. Both IgG and IgM antibodies to flaviviruses are
cross-reactive at some level with heterologous flaviviruses, that is,
viruses other than the one responsible for the infection. Indeed,
cross-reactivity (with other virus antigens), whether by IgG or IgM ELISA,
by neutralization, or by other tests indicates relatedness, the raison
d'etre for the flaviviruses being considered a "group". I know of no one
who uses a capture assay for IgG antibody. Capture IgM, but not IgG,
antibody ELISAs generally are used because of the possible presence of
rheumatoid factor. Whether camels have rheumatoid factor or not is unknown
to me.
3. The paper indicates that "IgG antibodies are associated with the memory
aspect of the immune response and appear after repeated exposure to the
infection". Not correct on 2 counts. (a) IgG antibodies to flaviviruses
appear after even a single infection with one of these viruses and (b) they
appear after exposure to the virus, not to the infection. That "a positive
IgG test generally indicates an infection in the past" is true only insofar
as the "past" might be as little as a week before the blood was collected.
IgM antibody to West Nile virus (WNV) may be detected on the day of onset
and for 1-3 months thereafter or, in some individuals, longer. IgG antibody
to WNV can be detected a few days after IgM antibody is detected, so that
testing single acute-phase or late convalescent-phase samples from an
individual does not definitively provide information regarding the timing
of the infection.
4. The authors state that "the reason for this investigation was a horse
from Ghantoot (Abu Dhabi) which demonstrated clinical signs consistent with
WN encephalitis". What were the specific signs that would suggest that this
illness was "compatible with WN encephalitis"?
5. The website did not allow me to see more than the 1st page of the report
but I saw no evidence that "West Nile fever" (as stated in the title) was
observed. The paper does suggest that West Nile encephalitis occurred,
perhaps in the single horse, but I saw no evidence of cases of
uncomplicated West Nile virus infection, that is, West Nile fever (unless
reported later in the article).
6. There are other concerns.
West Nile virus was discovered in Uganda in 1937 and has been isolated
since then from South Africa to Egypt and Israel, in Europe, Asia, and now
in the Americas. It is likely that WNV has been circulating in the United
Arab Emirates for at least decades but that it has been undetected there to
now. Perhaps even now it does not circulate there; the authors have not
provided evidence one way or the other, except for the single horse with
IgM antibody. Perhaps this antibody was to another flavivirus. If these
published results mark the beginning of an adequate survey of arboviruses
in the United Arab Emirates, that would be a good thing. Nonetheless, this
report, in "Wildlife Middle East" and now on ProMED-mail, does not provide
definitive information as to the presence of WNV in the United Arab
Emirates. Antibody to WNV in humans in New York City in 1999 was
cross-reactive with St Louis encephalitis virus antigen and the first cases
of WNV there were misdiagnosed. I hope the folks in the United Arab
Emirates are not making a same, if mirror image, error.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Calisher for his comments. One hopes that the equine
encephalitis case will stimulate further work in the area. Given the
diagnostic problems caused by serological cross-reactivity among the
flaviviruses, the ideal situation would be to isolate the virus, or show WN
virus-specific genomic sequences by PCR. - Mod.TY]
