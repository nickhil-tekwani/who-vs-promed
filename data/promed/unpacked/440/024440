The spread of the foot and mouth [FMD] epidemic continues across the country, affecting 18 wilayas [departments, out of the country's 48] until yesterday [Sat 9 Aug 2014], especially in the east and center of the country, since its inception on 25 Jul 2014, according to Boughalem Karim, Director of Veterinary Services in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The most affected wilayas are Setif, Bouira, Bejaia, Tizi Ouzou and Bordj Bou Arreridj. The 1st outbreak was recorded in Bir El Arch (Setif) following the fraudulent introduction of fattening calves from Tunisia. Two weeks later, the virus caused 192 recorded outbreaks out of the 200 000 cattle holdings; 964 cows and bulls affected by this disease, which is very dangerous for ruminants, have been slaughtered.

"These numbers are not catastrophic," said Karim Boughalem during a press conference at the headquarters of the ministry. Since its detection, the government has implemented a series of measures: sequestration of farms, banning the movement of animals, closure of livestock markets nationwide and vaccination of infected households.

"These measures are temporary. They will be lifted as soon as the disease is under control," said the Secretary General of the Ministry, Fodhil Feroukhi. The annual vaccination campaign, which was terminated on 30 Mar 2014, covered 850 000 cattle. In addition, some 757 000 animals have been vaccinated by the veterinary services since the appearance of the disease in May 2014 in Tunisia. Both vaccination programs have reached 75 to 80 percent of the cattle, a total of 1.6 million head [see comment regarding vaccine strain]. Veterinary services await the arrival this week of 900 000 doses of vaccine imported to expand the operation to all cattle.

To prevent the spread of disease and mortality of animals, the Department requires farmers not to move their animals except to the nearest abattoir, not to attend livestock markets, not to introduce new animals in their farms and to systematically quicklime at the entrance of the farms, banning the entry of foreigners on their holdings. The department has mobilized nearly 10 000 veterinarians to monitor the said preventive activities on farms.

After denouncing the attitude of some irresponsible breeders and horse dealers attracted by "greed," the 2 officials have launched an appeal to all stakeholders to strictly implement the prescribed measures and to inform the nearest veterinary office of any suspected cases. "The disease could be confined to Bir El Arch, in Setif, if farmers had made the necessary declarations," said the Director of Veterinary Services.

Animal owners whose livestock is affected will be compensated for 80 percent of the real price of slaughtered animals, provided they have duly declared. The rest (20 percent) will be covered after the slaughter and sale of the meat approved edible and safe for consumption. Questioned further about the impact of this disease on milk production and quality of meat, Fodhil Ferroukhi said production may drop due to the killing of a number of dairy cows. However, this epidemic will, according to him, have no impact upon either the quality or the price of red meat.

FMD continues to spread in half the provinces of the country, particularly in the Centre and East. Although no outbreaks have been detected in Oran, farmers in this region are concerned. For the latter, the epidemic has reached alarming proportions, but the Algerian authorities are slow to respond, especially with regard to vaccination of livestock. The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that a million doses of vaccine against this destructive virus have become available last week.

From the veterinary inspection of Oran, we learn that the quota of Oran has not yet been received. According to Ms. Bencheikh, head veterinary inspector, "the vaccine needs of Oran are estimated at nearly 12 000 doses. Once the vaccine has arrived, we will launch the vaccination campaign, and all farmers benefit from this operation for which all veterinarians will be mobilized."

Pending the arrival of the quota of Oran, prophylactic measures have been taken to deal with this contagious disease that starts to seriously challenge the farmers. Among the measures is the closure of the cattle market of El Kerma. The movement of livestock is controlled on the road network by the gendarmerie and ranchers. Transported cattle must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate stating their health.

The Veterinary services also urged farmers in the Western region of the country, currently free of the disease, not to introduce animals from the Centre and East of the country, not to mention the obligation to report to the relevant departments any suspected cases. This is a measure that is valid until further notice and the extinction of suspected outbreaks of FMD in other provinces of the country.

Transport of animals to slaughterhouses is only allowed with the presentation of a vaccination certificate duly issued by the departments concerned. "Movement of animals to other sites without permission of our services," she insisted, "is prohibited."

Oran currently has approximately 300 farmers for a herd of 4324 dairy cows.

[Oran is in west Algeria. Maintaining its freedom of FMD is also of importance to Morocco.

Readers may be referred to the fact that "stamping out" in Algeria does not mean the destruction of the culled animals but their slaughter for human consumption. This policy will require severe sanitary measures in and around the slaughterhouses to prevent them from becoming a source of infection, either by contamination of the people and vehicles passing through them or due to complexities in the treatment of offal and skins.

The current FMD epizootic in Tunisia and Algeria is caused by the serotype O virus strain "O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage." As reported in posting 20140804.2659287, the EU has now made 1.1 million doses of a vaccine available to the 2 countries; the O vaccine strain in the said batch was chosen following vaccine matching results on the said circulating O India 2001 topotype.

ProMED-mail requested, in the said posting, information on the vaccine strain used in Algeria for the earlier vaccinations (annual and emergency) during 2014 (apparently, 1.6 million doses altogether). We are most grateful to Intervet India (MSD), the manufacturer of the vaccine, for their kind and most helpful response, reporting that the serotype O vaccine strain included in the bivalent vaccine was FMDV "O1 Manisa."

The sequencing results of recent samples from Tunisia, genotyped as "topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d" are available on the web-site of WRLFMD (see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2014/WRLMEG-2014-00010%20O%20Tunisia%202014.pdf). The long known and widely applied vaccine strain O1 Manisa is not included among the 10 "most closely related reference viruses" spelled out in the report. See, in the said report, the dendogram, which includes "O1/Manisa/TUR/69 (AY593823)," rather distant from "O/TUN/1031/2014 (IZSLER)" and "O/TUN/1054/2014 (IZSLER)," the Tunisian samples, and from other ME-SA topotype strains presented. This may mean that earlier cattle vaccinations, though applying a potent, tested vaccine, may have conferred partial protection due to the difference between the field and the vaccine strains.

Algeria's sheep and goats (there are about 31.5 million of them!) have not been vaccinated at all. - Mod.AS
