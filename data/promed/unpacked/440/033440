More than 500 suspected chikungunya cases were detected in the
district [of Mangalore, Karnataka state].

Statistics available at the District Health and Family Welfare
Department (DHFWD) warn of an 'uncontrollable outbreak of the disease
in the district', if not checked at the earliest.

As per data available with the DHFWD, around 530 suspected
chikungunya cases were reported from Sullia and Puttur taluks. [A
taluk is an administrative and fiscal unit that has jurisdiction over
villages and municipalities. - Mod.TY] It was found through
door-to-door survey and surveillance records that around 1787 people
were suffering from high fever in Sullia and Puttur taluks.

The absence of a clinical diagnosis process in the district to
confirm chikungunya as early as possible has the administration
sitting astride the horns of a dilemma.

DHFWD officer Dr H Jagannath told this website's newspaper that the
department could not confirm chikungunya as there was no laboratory
facility in the district to diagnose the disease. He said that the
government had promised 100 rapid chikungunya test kits before
Wednesday [16 Apr 2008].

"INR 4.5 lakh [450 000 rupees equivalent to USD 11 261] had been
sanctioned under the vector borne disease control programme for the
district," he said, adding that necessary steps would be taken to
check the spread of disease.

Dr Jagannath said that 2 nodal officers were appointed for Sullia and
Puttur taluks. The department has also deputed 3 doctors to the
taluks, he said and 3 mobile medical teams with ambulances were also
sent to the taluks.

Jagannath said that a joint survey by the entomology experts and the
joint director of the Malaria and Filaria Cell was conducted on 13-15
Apr [2008]; a total of 12 drug distribution centres were functioning
in the 2 taluks.

Precautionary measures including fogging, spraying, and awareness
programmes were started in the taluks for the effective prevention of
the spread of chikungunya, but proper diagnosis is still a necessary
1st step that can no longer be delayed.

[This report underscores the importance of obtaining timely, accurate
laboratory testing to establish the etiology of the disease involved
in the outbreak. Nevertheless, rapid and aggressive vector control is
very prudent in this situation, even in the absence of laboratory
confirmation.
