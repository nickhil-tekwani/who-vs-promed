Farmers warned to take care with _Salmonella_
[South Island] Aug 28 - The epidemic of _Salmonella_-related abortions in
sheep throughout Otago and Southland has grown to worrying proportions.
Pockets of farms in Otago and Southland have been affected by _Salmonella
brandenburg_ which causes sheep to develop a fever, abort lambs, and
possibly die. Some farmers have also been affected by the disease,
suffering from abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea and fever.
The strain broke out in Canterbury last season, and has spread further
south, Invermay Animal Health Laboratory vet Marjorie Orr told NZPA today.
"It was at a very low level up until last year, and then there was a big
outbreak in Canterbury. This year it suddenly appeared down here, and it's
just taken off like wildfire." She said clusters of adjacent farms were
affected. "It won't spread if people take really good care to wash hands
and vehicles so it doesn't spread from farm to farm. If they treat it
early, it will be contained." It was uncertain how the disease spread, but
Ms Orr said it was likely "anything that carries mud and faeces, like boots
and vehicles and seagulls' feet, will take it from paddock to paddock."
Sheep could also carry the bacteria without showing symptoms. "That may be
how it arrived here (in Otago) -- it may have been brought in by sheep from
some other area, like Canterbury." Gore vet Ewen Miller said farmers were
advised to remove aborted lambs as soon as possible, isolate the ewes, and
take care of personal hygiene. It appeared to be a seasonal problem, as
sheep were affected close to lambing.
The disease was recorded a few years ago but in very low levels. A
broad-spectrum antibiotic could be used if the disease was spotted early,
but a salmonella vaccine would not be effective. Antibiotics were needed
very early, "but really it's too late to save the lambs," Ms Orr said. "You
can't prevent it but you can treat it if you catch it very early."

Fears sheep _Salmonella_ outbreak spreading
[South Island] Aug 31 - Farmers fear the sheep-killer disease caused by
_Salmonella brandenburg_ is spreading north through the South Island after
a fresh case was reported in Darfield, Canterbury.
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry spokeswoman Debbie Gee said today 21
mobs of sheep from 19 Mid Canterbury farms had been tested. Twelve were
confirmed as having the disease. Nine more were awaiting confirmation, but
indications were "highly likely" that they would also test positive. Ms Gee
said eight cases had been confirmed in Ashburton, three in Rakaia and one
in Darfield.
Ashburton Veterinary Centre marketing manager Chris McCarthy said up to
1,200 sheep had died in Mid Canterbury. Methven farmer Hugh Weir said 100
of his ewes had aborted and 20 had subsequently died. He felt for the
affected sheep, which were obviously suffering. "I wouldn't like to be as
crook as some of the sheep," he said. Mr Weir said he first noticed the
disease four weeks ago. Most of his dead ewes were scanned and had been
carrying twins. "When we took samples to the vet they said it could be
salmonella but no one seemed to be getting too panicked at that stage," he
said. He vaccinated his 3,000 ewes last week.
South Canterbury medical officer Dr John Holmes said eight cases of the
disease had been reported in humans in South Canterbury this year but he
was unsure if they had contracted the disease from stock. Five farmers in
Southland and Otago had been diagnosed with the disease.
Meanwhile, seagulls in Mid Canterbury were being shot and collected for
examination. Mr McCarthy said the dead birds would be sent to the animal
health laboratory in Lincoln, near Christchurch, for examination. Ms Gee
said scientists "strongly suspected" seagulls were spreading the disease on
their feet or beaks. Tests were being made to discover whether seagulls
played a part in spreading the disease and if they were carriers.
Ashburton vet Jonathan Grant urged all farmers to maintain strict hygiene
when dealing with stock and to ensure the chances of further spread were
minimised. "Farmers should control dogs so they don't wander on to other
properties and bring the disease on to their own property," he said.
Farmers should [clean and] disinfect their boots and wash clothing after
dealing with stock. If they thought their stock had the disease they should
contact their vet. Farmers had been encouraged to vaccinate stock or
administer antibiotics to help fight _Salmonella brandenburg_. Mr Grant
said there had been some debate about the effectiveness of vaccinations but
he believed two shots were effective. Each vaccination cost 40 cents..

[Sounds very like _S. abortusovis_ outbreaks that used to occur (and still
might) in central Devon in the UK every year. As reported, the vaccination
advice appears confused. Blaming seagulls is one thing, proving it
something else. This infection probably makes use of many routes besides
the 'obvious'. - Mod.MHJ]
