2000/029 Situation of tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus in Florida (US)
In the early 1990s, tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (TYLCV, EPPO A2
quarantine pest) appeared in the Caribbean, in Cuba, Dominican Republic and
Jamaica. It is thought that it entered USA in Dade county, Florida in late
1996 or early 1997 (see EPPO RS 97/169). Sequence analysis showed that the
virus in Florida was 99% identical with TYLCV-Is from Dominican Republic.
Recently, TYLCV has also been detected in south Georgia (see EPPO RS
99/077). In July 1997, in Dade county, infected tomato plants were found in
two retail production sites of transplants. In 1997/1998 diseased plants
were detected in almost all counties which commercially produce tomatoes
(Broward, Collier, Dade, Hillsborough, Lee, Manatee, Marion, Palm Beach, St
Lucia). It is thought that the movement of infected transplants is the most
important means of dissemination of the disease, in particular via retail
garden centres. Infected tomatoes planted in private gardens appear to be a
source of TYLCV for nearby commercial nurseries and tomato production
fields. Highest rates of infection in 1997/98 were recorded in Dade and
Palm Beach counties (up to 15% in some fields), but elsewhere the incidence
was low. Measures are taken in Florida in particular to prevent spread to
other states. Since the first findings, growers have been informed and
encouraged to manage the disease (e.g. roguing of infected plants,
implementation of integrated pest management programmes against
whiteflies). Movement of plants such as tomato, tobacco and lisianthus
(_Eustoma grandiflorum_) from Florida to other states is regulated. These
plants must have been found free from whiteflies (inspected twice a week)
and strict control measures should have been taken during their production
to exclude whiteflies from the production house. In Florida, eradication is
not considered feasible.

[Introduction of TYLCV into Florida is inevitable given that Miami is an
important port of entry for "people, plants, and produce". A wide variety
of fruit trees, vegetables, and ornamentals (all of which may harbor
viruliferous whitefies [_Bemisia tabaci_ enter through the normal
channels, but illegal importation may also be a factor. Dade County, which
includes Miami, is an area of intensive agricultural
production, and it is obvious that once plants are introduced into the
commercial stream, rapid spread can be expected, especially by movement of
infected transplants. The authors are correct and realistic, in my opinion,
to state that eradication of the disease from Florida is unlikely. - Mod.DH
