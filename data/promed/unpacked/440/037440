[1] PAHO prevention
Date: 23 Jan 2015
From: Ronald St. John <ronaldstjohn@gmail.com> [edited]


Although the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO, Regional Office of the World Health Organization) and its member states in the Americas were closely monitoring the expanding Ebola outbreak in the 3 affected countries in early 2014, a shift to a more proactive approach occurred in August 2014 when the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa to be an event of international public health importance. The Director General convened the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations (IHR) that prepared recommendations for countries in which there was no transmission of the disease. The PAHO Director instructed the Secretariat to increase technical cooperation to enhance preparedness for a possible introduction of a case of EVD in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The detection of cases in countries outside those originally affected by the outbreak in West Africa (Spain and the United States of America) added a new sense of urgency to expand the Secretariat's preparations for responding in the region and for coordinating technical cooperation. In late October 2014, the Director activated the PAHO Emergency Operations Centre and initiated the implementation of the Incident Management System, with a designated Incident Manager, supported by a technical Task Force. In addition, efforts were initiated to obtain funding for responding to the multiple requests for assistance by Member States of the Organization. Supported by regular funds from the Director, along with assistance from Brazil, over USD 3 million was quickly mobilized and committed in support of technical missions, essential workshops, procurement of personal protection equipment (PPE) and immediate country needs.

The Organization immediately implemented a Framework for Strengthening National Preparedness and Response for Ebola Virus Disease in the Americas. The Framework consists of 3 phases:

1) preparation, in which a WHO "checklist" was circulated to all Member States through the representative offices in the countries;
2) consultation with national authorities, in which technical missions were sent to 26 countries over a 3-month period; and
3) follow-up, during which identified individual country needs would be addressed through a series of longer term projects.

The technical missions addressed 4 basic capacities:
1) ability to quickly detect and report;
2) ability to rapidly isolate and safely treat;
3) ability to contain the virus through active case finding and contact monitoring; and
4) ability to communicate with the public to allay fear and maintain trust.

Analysis of the 26 missions carried out under Phase 2 is underway to better understand the findings and main recommendations of the 1st 2 phases. Phase 3 will be developed during the last week of January 2015 to identify special projects. In addition, with support by CDC, US National Institutes of Health, Emory University and the Carlos III Hospital in Spain, 3 clinical management and infection prevention and control workshops for national trainers were completed (one in Antigua and Barbuda for the Caribbean and 2 in Chile for Latin America), and 3 risk management workshops were organized in Barbados, Panama and Ecuador. In early December 2014, an expert consultation on virology, laboratory diagnostic protocols and biological risk management was held in Mexico with all regional BSL3 and BSL4 (Canada and US) laboratories. Another significant achievement was the preparation and approval of a Rapid Response Team Plan (RRT) for the immediate deployment of international technical experts should a suspected case appear in the Region.

While nearly all countries require some fine tuning of their Ebola and emergency management protocols, these improvements will remain for future responses to emerging infectious diseases. In general, there are reasonable levels of preparedness in this Region. It is unlikely that the importation of a case of Ebola in Latin America or the Caribbean will result in a major chain of Ebola transmission.
