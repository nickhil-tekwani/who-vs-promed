Anthrax is suspected to be the cause of death of a one-and-a-half-year-old bull in Dagana [Daga district] on 15 Sep 2012.

A calf belonging to one of the farmers in Kalizingkha village under Tseza gewog [In Bhutan, a gewog is a group of rural villages which form an administrative division below the district level. - CopyEd.MSP] died around 11 PM. Its bloated carcass and raw, un-clotted blood coming from natural openings were indications, livestock officials said, of possible anthrax as the cause. The carcass was buried using proper anti-septic sodium bicarbonate [lime].

District Livestock officials said a sample examined in the district veterinary hospital tested positive for anthrax and that it would be sent to the national centre for animal health for further examination.

Veterinary officer Dr Kuenzang Gyeltshen said that there is community awareness and that the case is still under strict observation. He said the calf owner's herd has been being treated with penicillin injections since 17 Sep 2012. "The course is normally for 3-5 days," he said, adding that anthrax is a sporadic disease and will grow whenever climatic conditions favor it. "Therefore, it's always important to take remedial measures," he said.

A notifiable bacterial disease of sheep and cattle typically affecting the skin and lungs, this was probably the 1st case of the disease in the dzongkhag. It can also be transmitted to humans, causing severe skin ulceration.

[The 2 previous Bhutan outbreaks this year (2012) were in Trashigang and Mongar in the eastern region of the country. Dagana, or Daga, is in SE Bhutan.

As this is reported as "suspect," I think we can assume that the initial veterinary diagnosis was based on M'Fadyean stained blood smear. This test can be depended upon, if done correctly. Anyway, it has gone for "further examination" at the national centre, and confirmation is awaited.
