DoD Reports Progress in Pneumonia Investigation
------------------------------------------------
"From what we have learned so far, it appears there are a series of unusual
pneumonia cases that have occurred in Southwest Asia. These cases do not
represent an epidemic, and it is not being spread through person-to-person
contact. We are making significant progress in eliminating a number of
possible causes, such as SARS and vaccines. Our investigatory process is
helping to determine whether there is a single explanation or whether there
are multiple cases," said Dr. William Winkenwerder, assistant secretary of
defense for health affairs. "Understanding the cause[s] is important to
prevent future cases."
Col. Bruno Petruccelli, director, epidemiology and disease surveillance at
the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine,
said, "There is evidence that 10 of the cases have shown a higher-than-usual
number of blood cells of one specific type called eosinophils. An increase
in this type of white blood cell can occur in a variety of medical
conditions, for example, infections, asthma, hay fever, and allergies.
Medical personnel are trying to determine why some of the 19 patients with
severe pneumonia showed an increase in these cells."

[The presence of eosinophilia in a patient with pneumonia can be suggestive
of a number of disorders; infectious, inflammatory, or allergic. It is not
stated whether the increase in eosinophils was found in the blood,
respiratory secretions, or both -- or whether there was a prominent
eosinophilic reaction in the lungs at postmortem examination of the fatal
cases. Although they do not necessarily relate directly to the cases
above, 2 citations with acute eosinophilic pneumonia are given below, the
latter in the wake of 9/11:
Buchheit J, Eid N, Rodgers G, et al: Acute eosinophilic pneumonia with
respiratory failure: a new syndrome? Am Rev Respir Dis 1992;145:716-8
Acute, noninfectious, eosinophilic pneumonia with respiratory failure has
been described in adults. This new form of eosinophilic lung disease
differs from the previously described types of eosinophilic pneumonia.
Patients with this entity develop rapid progressive respiratory failure,
which seems to respond to corticosteroid therapy. Eosinophilia in lung
biopsy specimen, or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid seems to be a common
denominator. We present the first pediatric case of this new, distinct form
of eosinophilic lung disease and review the pertinent literature.
Rom WN, Weiden M, Garcia R, et al: Acute eosinophilic pneumonia in a New
York City firefighter exposed to World Trade Center dust. Am J Respir Crit
Care Med 2002;166:797-800
We report a sentinel case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia in a firefighter
exposed to high concentrations of World Trade Center dust during the rescue
effort from September 11 to 24. The firefighter presented with a Pa(O2) of
53 mm Hg and responded to oxygen and corticosteroids. Computed tomography
scan showed patchy ground glass density, thickened bronchial walls, and
bilateral pleural effusions. Bronchoalveolar lavage recovered 70 percent
eosinophils, with only 1 percent eosinophils in peripheral blood.
Eosinophils were not degranulated and increased levels of interleukin-5
were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage and serum. Mineralogic analysis
counted 305 commercial asbestos fibers/10(6) macrophages including those
with high aspect ratios, and significant quantities of fly ash and degraded
fibrous glass. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare consequence of acute
high dust exposure. World Trade Center dust consists of large particle-size
silicates, but fly ash and asbestos fibers may be found in bronchoalveolar
lavage cells.
