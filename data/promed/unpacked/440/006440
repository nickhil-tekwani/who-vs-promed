China reports new bird flu outbreak
------------------------------------
China has announced a new bird flu outbreak at poultry farms in its
northern province of Shanxi. Samples taken after the chickens died in
Changzi county tested positive for the H5N1 strain, the official Xinhua
news agency quoted the agriculture ministry as saying Monday [19 Jun 2006].
The local government has quarantined the area, and experts and
veterinarians have started disinfection and culling, it said. A campaign to
teach residents how to protect themselves against the virus has been launched.
China has recorded 35 outbreaks of bird flu since last October 2005. The
last was in the remote Xinjiang Autonomous Region early this month [June 2006].
A human case of bird flu was confirmed on 15 Jun 2006 in the southern
province of Guangdong, bringing the country's total human infections to 19,
of whom 12 have died. More than 120 people worldwide have died from bird
flu since it reemerged as a threat in 2003, with most of the victims in Asia.

New bird flu outbreak in Shanxi
-------------------------------------
A new bird flu outbreak has been reported in north China's Shanxi Province
said sources with the Ministry of Agriculture here Monday [19 Jun 2006].
The outbreak was identified after chickens died in poultry farms in Changzi
County of Changzhi City. Samples of the dead poultry were sent to the
national bird flu laboratory, and the H5N1 virus was identified in them,
said the ministry.
The local government has launched an emergency response and quarantined the
infected area. Experts and veterinarians have started disinfection and
culling poultry in the area to prevent possible new outbreaks. The local
veterinarian department has stepped up publicity campaigns to teach
residents how to protect themselves against the virus. The Ministry of
Agriculture has also sent a team of experts to Changzi and reported the
case to international organizations.
China has recorded more than 30 outbreaks of bird flu since last October
2005. The last outbreak occurred in remote Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
early this month [June 2006], and the government said it was contained 2
days after the confirmation. A human case of bird flu was confirmed on 15
Jun 2006 in south China's Guangdong Province, bringing the country's total
human infections to 19.
China's chief veterinary officer Jia Youling warned last week that the
virus was on the rise among migratory birds this year [2006]. A total of
1168 migratory birds had been found dead in Qinghai and Tibet by 1 Jun
2006. The disease was striking more species of birds than last year 2005,
Jia said, noting the Ministry of Agriculture would target migration paths
for future supervision, especially in areas with a record of infection.
