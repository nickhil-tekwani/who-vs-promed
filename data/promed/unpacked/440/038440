_Salmonella_ outbreaks linked to backyard poultry
-------------------------------------------------
Fast facts
Illnesses: 219
Hospitalizations: 27
Deaths: 1
States: 38
Investigation status: active

CDC and public health officials in many states are collecting different types of data to investigate multistate outbreaks of _Salmonella [enterica_] infections with serotypes Enteritidis, Hadar, Infantis, and Typhimurium. Epidemiologic data show that contact with backyard poultry is making people sick.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 2 Jun 2022, a total of 219 people infected with one of the outbreak strains have been reported from 38 states (see map https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-06-22/map.html).

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 15 Feb 2022 to 19 May 2022 (see timeline at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-06-22/epi.html).

Sick people range in age from less than 1 to 89 years, with a median age of 29 years, and 56 (26%) are young children under 5 years. Of 213 people with information available, 116 (54%) are female. Of 95 people with information available, 27 (28%) have been hospitalized. One death has been reported from Tennessee.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 2 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the animals they came into contact with in the week before they got sick. Of the 87 people interviewed, 61 (70%) reported contact with backyard poultry before getting sick. Of 56 people with information available, 16 reported eating eggs from backyard poultry, and 2 reported eating meat from backyard poultry.

Laboratory data
---------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of these outbreaks. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause gastrointestinal illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in these outbreaks likely got sick from the same type of animal.

WGS was also used to identify any predicted antibiotic resistance for bacteria from 219 sick people's samples. Of the 219 samples, 72 (33%) were predicted to be resistant to 1 or more of the following antibiotics: ampicillin (0.9%), kanamycin (0.5%), streptomycin (30.6%), sulfamethoxazole (0.9%), tetracycline (31.5%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (0.9%). Testing of bacteria from 2 sick people's samples using standard antibacterial susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) confirmed these results (streptomycin and kanamycin were not tested by this method).

Most people with salmonellosis recover without antibiotics. However, if antimicrobials are needed, this resistance is unlikely to affect the choice of therapy used to treat most people.

Public health action
--------------------
CDC always advises everyone to take steps to stay healthy around backyard poultry. CDC is working with hatcheries and stores that sell poultry to educate new poultry owners and control the spread of _Salmonella_ at hatcheries.

[Having a flock of backyard fowl can serve a number of purposes, including home-raised meat, fresh eggs, and companionship, but care must be taken to avoid the zoonosis salmonellosis.

The following recommendations are from the CDC: What backyard flock owners should do (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-21/index.html):

"Wash your hands
- Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after touching backyard poultry, their eggs, or anything in the area where they live and roam.
- Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Consider having hand sanitizer at your coop.

"Be safe around backyard flocks
- Don't kiss or snuggle backyard poultry, and don't eat or drink around them. This can spread _Salmonella_ germs to your mouth and make you sick.
- Keep your backyard flock and supplies you use to care for them (like feed containers and shoes you wear in the coop) outside of the house. You should also clean the supplies outside the house.

"Supervise kids around flocks
- Always supervise children around backyard poultry and make sure they wash their hands properly afterward.
- Don't let children younger than 5 years touch chicks, ducklings, or other backyard poultry. Young children are more likely to get sick from germs like _Salmonella_.

"Handle eggs safely
- Collect eggs often. Eggs that sit in the nest can become dirty or break.
- Throw away cracked eggs. Germs on the shell can more easily enter the egg through a cracked shell.
- Rub off dirt on eggs with fine sandpaper, a brush, or a cloth. Don't wash them because colder water can pull germs into the egg.
- Refrigerate eggs to keep them fresh and slow the growth of germs.
- Cook eggs until both the yolk and white are firm, and cook egg dishes to an internal temperature of 160 deg F (71 deg C) to kill all germs." - Mod.LL
