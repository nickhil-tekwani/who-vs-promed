South Korea: Hepatitis A virus infection on the increase
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities are on high alert, as the number of patients suffering
from hepatitis A virus infection reached a record level in June 2004,
according to a report from an official health center. The Korean Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) stated, on Tue 13 Jul 2004, that the
number of patients who contracted hepatitis A in June 2004 was 76, the
highest monthly figure since Jan 2001, when the KCDC began a new method of
calculating disease cases based on electronic data interchange (EDI). The
figure is the highest compared to the [previous] monthly record of 53
people in March 2003, and 50 people in June 2002. The number of patients
infected with hepatitis A was 105 in 2001, 319 in 2002, and 311 in 2003.
South Chungchong Province topped the list with 45 hepatitis A cases
followed by Kyonggi Province with 15. These 2 regions reported the majority
of cases, followed by Seoul with 8, Inchon with 5, Taejon with 2, and Taegu
with one. The KCDC, however, conducted a separate survey showing that a
total of 63 people were confirmed to have contracted hepatitis A in Kongju,
South Chungchong Province, in June 2004.
A KCDC official said that: "It is a rare phenomenon that hepatitis A has
broken out on such a large scale in an area which has no large-scale
restaurant or eating facility. The [KCDC] sent out a research team,
comprising around 10 experts, to Kongju. The survey showed that almost 80
percent of patients who had contracted hepatitis A in June 2004 had been to
the same restaurant, where the landlord and his son were also found to have
contracted the disease. The underground water supply that the restaurant
used is a highly possible source of the trouble." The official added that
the [KCDC] is trying to determine the real cause.

[Most recent hepatitis A outbreaks worldwide have been attributed to either
water-borne or food-borne infection. The current widespread outbreak in
South Korea is unusual in that both water-borne and food-borne routes of
transmission of infection may be involved. - Mod.CP]
