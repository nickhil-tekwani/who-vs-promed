The provincial health office in Iloilo is monitoring more than 100 suspected cases of chikungunya [virus infection] in at least 4 towns. Residents of Igbaras, Tigbauan, Carles, and Guimbal are manifesting chikungunya-like symptoms such as fever, skin rashes, and joint pain.

Health experts have conducted blood tests to rule out chikungunya [virus infection], which is a rarely fatal, dengue-like disease. Results of the tests will be available after 2 weeks.

Meanwhile, health officer Dr. Soccoro Quinon appealed to residents to continue cleaning their surroundings and destroy possible breeding places of mosquitoes to avoid chikungunya [virus transmission].

[The newswire above reports additional suspected chikungunya cases, this time in Iloilo province, that also need to be confirmed. There was a recent report from Ilocos province that mentioned an outbreak in 2 locations on 14 Jul 2014 that had not been confirmed by laboratory tests.

Last year (2013), chikungunya virus outbreaks continued in several localities of the Philippines.

The number of cases of the mosquito-borne viral disease eclipsed 1600 cases during the 1st 11 months of 2013, and the number of cases, 1609, was nearly triple the total of 561 cases recorded in 2012 http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/chikungunya-fever-cases-top-1600-in-the-philippines-nearly-triple-2012-numbers-30092/.

The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya. An effective public education effort will be necessary to enlist public collaboration for elimination of vector mosquito breeding sites.

PRO/MBDS and ProMED-mail would appreciate further information about any additional cases in this outbreak and on the results of the laboratory tests.

The latest figures from the Samoa Ministry of Health say 8 people have been diagnosed with chikungunya virus after the 1st 20 specimens were sent overseas for tests.

The Director General of Health and CEO, Leausa Toleafoa Dr Take Naseri has also confirmed that as of Monday night [11 Aug 2014], 96 new suspected cases of chikungunya virus were reported, with blood samples from the patients being sent for further medical tests.

The Director General says a mass cleanup campaign is being planned for areas around Faleata and Vaimauga districts, from where most of the cases in the Apia urban area are reported.

[This is a follow-up to the 1st ever ProMED-mail report of a chikungunya outbreak in Samoa, now with chikungunya virus infections confirmed. Samoa is clearly experiencing an outbreak of chikungunya fever. One hopes that the avoidance of mosquito bites and the elimination of mosquito breeding sites will help to reduce transmission in the coming days.
