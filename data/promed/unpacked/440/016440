Jamaica: Outbreak of Rotavirus Infection In Montego Bay
-------------------------------------------------
A severe outbreak of intestinal rotavirus infection has claimed 2 lives and
is threatening hundreds of others in western Jamaica, mostly children,
officials said on Wed 18 Feb 2004. Most of the cases are in the resort town
of Montego Bay and the 2 who victims died have been afflicted with
gastroenteritis, a severe form of diarrhea often caused by rotavirus
infection, Health Ministry epidemiologist Janice Alexander said. Both of
the deaths occurred in Montego Bay; one was an adult and one was a child,
Alexander said. She couldn't provide more details about the victims.
The latest report shows that 1350 people have contracted the virus since
the outbreak began more than a month ago, with children under age 5
accounting for 935 cases, Alexander said. "It is more severe in young
children because they can get dehydrated very quickly; they get very
serious levels of dehydration which can even cause death," she said.
During 2003, more than 28 000 cases of gastroenteritis were reported in
this Caribbean country of 2.6 million residents, up from about 20 000 in
2002. There were at least 14 children who died from the illness in 2003,
compared to 5 in 2002. The Health Ministry is warning parents to practice
good hygiene with their children to help prevent infection.
Rotavirus kills some 600 000 children under age 5 worldwide every year,
mostly in poor countries, according to UNICEF. Rotavirus is found in feces
and can be spread through food and human contact. Symptoms include
diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and sunken eyes. There are no approved
vaccines for rotavirus.

[2] USA (Maryland): Suspected norovirus, hospitals

USA: Suspected Norovirus Outbreaks at 2 Hospitals in Baltimore
-------------------------------------------------
Carroll Hospital Center had no new cases yesterday of an infectious
[gastroenteritis] virus that sent 10 people to the hospital and sickened a
dozen of the staff over the holiday weekend. "By late Sun evening, things
seemed really bad," said Brenda Kitchen, infection control coordinator at
the Westminster hospital. "We had a lot of staff calling in sick and 10
patients with symptoms."
In addition to dealing with an "unusual number of patients at the same
period of time and on the same unit," the hospital also had 12 employees
out sick on Mon 16 Feb 2004, Kitchen said. The staff affected by the
gastrointestinal virus seemed to be those who worked in the 24-bed
progressive care unit of the hospital. The number of staff absentees was
down to 6 yesterday -- Tue 17 Feb 2004 -- but 3 of those were new cases,
Kitchen said. By late yesterday, 6 of the 10 patients had improved, and
most of them had been discharged, she said.
The symptoms of virus infection begin with nausea, which leads to severe
vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the patients admitted Mon with the virus
were elderly. "It is not life-threatening, but certainly uncomfortable for
the patient," Kitchen said. "But everyone seems to be recuperating." The 4
patients still experiencing gastrointestinal problems yesterday remained
hospitalized and were isolated from other patients, she said. The staff is
wearing masks, gowns and gloves while treating them; their visitors also
must don protective gear. The hospital will continue to take measures to
prevent transmission of the virus for at least 24 hours after the last
patient's symptoms disappear, Kitchen said.
A similar viral illness that spread to dozens of workers at Good Samaritan
Hospital during the past 3 weeks also appears to have peaked, a hospital
official there said on Mon 16 Feb 2004. A few additional employees called
in sick Mon with gastrointestinal symptoms, far fewer than the several
dozen who had reported the illness in recent weeks, the official said. An
emergency notification system had alerted hospitals across the state about
the outbreak at Good Samaritan. Carroll Hospital Center saw 2 patients with
the virus in its emergency room Sat. "We had been alerted about Good Sam,
so we knew something was going on with us when our patient numbers started
to increase," said Kitchen. "10 would definitely be a lot for us."

symptoms, and circumstances are consistent with an outbreak of norovirus
infection, otherwise known as "winter vomiting disease". Confirmation of the
presumptive diagnosis from an authoritative source would be appreciated. -

USA: Suspected Norovirus Outbreak at University of Georgia
----------------------------------------------------------
More students continue to report symptoms of a viral [gastroeneteritis]
outbreak at the University of Georgia. Almost 200 students have been
infected by the virus, including 22 who visited the University Health
Center on Wed 18 Feb 2004, complaining of severe vomiting, diarrhea, and
nausea. University and regional health officials say the [infectious agent]
is likely to be a norovirus, a typically short-lived intense
gastroenteritis virus. They also say reported cases of the virus normally
taper off quickly.
More than 120 students checked into the Health Center and St. Mary's
hospital during the first week of the outbreak, followed by 24 students who
reported symptoms Mon 16 Feb and 21 on Tue 17 Feb 2004. University of
Georgia and local health officials said earlier this week there was no
evidence linking the sick students to each other that would suggest
food-borne illness. The students live in different residence halls and eat
at different locations.
