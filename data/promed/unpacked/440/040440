RABIES -- ECUADOR (6)
=====================
Ecuador leads Latin America in rabies, reaching the highest mortality rate
of 26 deaths per 100,000 population. So says a report from the University
Vicente Rocafuerte de Guayaquil's research center which has confirmed that
so far this year there have been 14 deaths from rabies: 11 in Pichincha, 1
in Guayas and 2 in Loja out of about 50 positive cases observed and treated.
The Ministry of Health maintains a continuing program of vaccination of dogs
and cats, along with extermination of stray dogs. The increase in rabies
cases is due, among other causes, to the increase in the canine population,
the failure to meet vaccination goalsand limited resources for effecting
disease controls.
