[ref: WA Maitlo, et al. Fungi associated with sudden decline disease of date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_ L.) and its incidence at Khairpur, Pakistan. Pak J Phytopathol. 2014; 26(01): 65-71]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is considered one of the most important horticultural crops of the world and holds a very significant position in the district of Khairpur, Sindh, Pakistan. The sudden decline disease [SDD] of date palm is one of the major problems of the region and has destroyed hundreds of orchards in dispersed areas of Khairpur that resulted in huge economic losses.

[SDD symptoms appeared] similar to the widely known Bayoud disease of date palm caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ (ProMED-mail post 20080909.2817]. [Bayoud] has destroyed millions of trees in North Africa. The aim of the current study was to investigate the incidence of SDD and [palm] mortality by survey of 17 different locations in Khairpur, [as well as] fungal pathogens associated with SDD.

SDD incidence greatly varied at different locations and ranged from 0.25 to 50 per cent. 6 fungi namely, _Fusarium solani_, _Phoma ucladium_, _Helminthosporium sativum_, _Alternaria alternata_, _Aspergillus niger_, and _Penicillium chrysogenium_ were isolated from different plant parts collected from affected date palm trees in various orchards.

[SDD has] emerged as a real threat for date palm cultivation in Sindh, and its intensity is increasing day by day. In view of the gravity of the problem, the present study to determine the etiology as well as the incidence [of SDD] will help to find effective control [measures for] this devastating disease.

[Date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is cultivated in many hot, dry regions as a staple food source. Trees can live for more than 100 years. A large number of fungi and a number of other pathogens, as well as several diseases of unknown aetiology have been reported for this crop. Date palm production is facing serious problems worldwide, including lack of research, pests and spread of diseases. Productivity of the crop has declined globally. Environmental stress factors may predispose the trees to pathogen attacks. A global date palm network was established by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) to promote research and exchange of information. Tissue culture programmes for crop improvement that could be used to produce disease-free replanting material have been established in some countries (for example Pakistan, see ProMED-mail post 20090806.2776).

Bayoud disease is one of the most serious diseases of the crop in North Africa and has destroyed around two thirds of date palms in Morocco over the last century. It is caused by the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _albedinis_. Symptoms may include bleaching and subsequent drying off of fronds, followed by death of the tree. The fungus can survive for several years on plant debris or in the ground. Bayoud kills many of the popular older cultivars and has led to a major decline in production wherever it is present. Disease management relies on exclusion, phytosanitation and the use of new resistant cultivars, which are being developed. Another strain of the pathogen, _F. o._ f. sp. _canariensis_ causes a similar disease in ornamental date species in the USA ("Texas Phoenix decline"). Related species such as _F. proliferatum_ in Saudi Arabia and _F. moniliforme_ have been reported to cause similar diseases.

An unknown disease attacking date palms in Sindh has been reported since about 2008 (see ProMED-mail posts 20100503.1435, 20090806.2776, and 20080730.2323]. The results above identify pathogens involved in this disease. As such, they are an important contribution, since reliable diagnosis of pathogens is necessary to be able to design effective disease management strategies (as mentioned in this report).
