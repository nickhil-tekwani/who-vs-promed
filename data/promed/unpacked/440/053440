Cattle in areas of Queensland, New South Wales [NSW], and the Northern Territory that have been exposed to solid rain over the past month are already being impacted by heavy external parasite and disease challenges.

Three-day sickness, or bovine ephemeral fever [BEF], is being reported across wide areas of central, northern, and southern Queensland, and buffalo fly populations have exploded in many areas fortunate enough to get rain since mid-January [2020]. Heavier cattle appear to be the most susceptible to 3-day, judging by social media comments this week. Some suggested this was because they were not exposed to the BEF virus at a young age, building resistance, because drought conditions held the disease at bay.

Three-day sickness, or bovine ephemeral fever, is a viral disease of cattle that is spread by mosquitoes and biting midges. It occurs across northern Australia and along the eastern seaboard south to the NSW-Victorian border.

Queensland veterinarian Alan Guilfoyle has had a number of clients reporting 3-day outbreaks this month [February 2020] across a wide area. Dr Guilfoyle said he had lost cattle in his own herd earlier this week.

"As soon as buffalo fly numbers start to breed up after rain, the _Culicoides_ midges carrying 3-day virus also start to breed up, and cattle start to succumb," he said. "The outbreaks always follow the insects, wherever there are hatchings going on."

He said buffalo fly and other insect infestations were "savage" this month [February 2020], since the rain.

"But in fact, we haven't got into the peak season for 3-day yet. From my experience, it is not a mid-summer disease, but a spring and autumn disease, because of the heat factor. So there could be worse to come."

Dr Guilfoyle said many producers failed to recognise the sub-clinical impact of buffalo fly, sandflies, and 3-day on weight gain and herd productivity. Rather than vaccinating annually, some producers tended to vaccinate weaner bulls only for 3-day, and then rely on natural immunity later in life.

A few years ago, he did some sums, based on a mob of 500 steers, vaccinated for botulism, tick fever, 3-day, and 5-in-one [a vaccination with 5 serotypes or diseases in 1 vaccine. - Mod.TG].

"At current market prices, you've only got to [lose] 5-7 grower cattle from a mob of 500 to cover the cost of vaccination. It's cheap insurance, and that does not account for lost productivity and weight loss from the cattle surviving," he said.

Dr Guilfoyle said buffalo fly since the rain this year [2020] were likely to be worse than normal because of the decline in beneficial dung beetle populations during the drought.

"I haven't seen a dung beetle for ages on my block. Everything has to go through a recovery period after extended drought, and dung beetles are no different. Until then, fly challenge is likely to be worse than normal."

Tick populations also are likely to build up during 2020, having been held in check for the past 2 years by extremely dry conditions.

Toowoomba-based buffalo fly back-rubber manufacturer Keiran Gentry says demand for his products has been "unbelievable" since the rain started last month [January 2020].

His AC back-rubbers business has been "run off its feet" since January [2020], he said.

"Because it's been so dry for so long, there's been no real buffalo fly challenge. But the recent high temperatures and prolonged wet, humid conditions have been perfect for numbers to rapidly breed up."

Demand for back-rubbers and application products was coming from all over Queensland, the Northern Territory, and into northern NSW, Mr Gentry said.

"Some areas further south started to get some fly challenge back as far as November [2019] after they had a few storms, especially closer to the coast. But since January [2020], demand has spread everywhere. We literally cannot pack enough of our oil-based Cattle Coat product to keep up with demand."

[Three-day sickness, or bovine ephemeral fever, is a viral disease of cattle spread by mosquitoes and biting midges. It occurs in northern Australia and along the eastern seaboard south to the NSW-VIC border. It is called 3-day sickness because the clinical signs of the disease usually last for 3 days.

Conditions when 3-day sickness is likely to occur:
- Young stock are more commonly affected because infection provides life-long immunity.
- Wetter northern regions (more sporadic in southern cooler regions).
- Following big wet seasons, especially if it follows several dry years (under these conditions a much higher proportion of older animals will become infected).

Identifying and diagnosing 3-day sickness

Diagnosis of 3-day sickness will require assistance from a veterinarian. Clinical signs leading producers to suspect 3-day sickness include the following:
- Depression.
- Lameness, muscle stiffness, shivering, twitching, droopy ears.
- Drooling saliva, watery eyes, runny nose.
- Recumbency.
- Reduced water and food intake.
- Abortion.
- Heavier and older animals are more severely affected because long periods of recumbency leads to muscle damage.

Prevention strategies for3-day sickness

- Prevention strategies for 3-day sickness rely largely on vaccination.
