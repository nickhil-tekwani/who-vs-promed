Another town in Sao Paulo state has registered a case of yellow fever
[YF]. This Monday [6 Apr 2009], the Institute Adolfo Lutz confirmed
the disease in a youth of 20 years [who became infected with YF virus]
at a the Avare resort ranch, 249 km [155 miles] from Sao Paulo [city]
and 68.8 km [42 miles] from Piraju, where 7 deaths from yellow fever
have been confirmed. The youth was on a fishing trip on 22 Mar [2009]
and, last Friday [3 Apr 2009], was admitted to the town hospital on
suspicion of having the disease. At the request of the family, he was
transferred to the Hospital Emilio Ribas in Sao Paulo [city]. His
condition is serious.

According to Marta Brandi, coordinator of Avare Epidemiological
Surveillance, this is the 1st case of the disease contracted in the
town. Another suspected [YF] case is a woman who had gone to a farm
in the town of Itatinga, which had registered a [YF] death. The woman
is already back home and is fine. Another town on the list of risk
areas for the disease is Sarutaia, where one victim died of the
disease.

Around 70 000 doses of YF vaccine have been applied to the population
of Avare, which has 86 000 inhabitants. Since this is a tourist town
with many farm-hotels, Epidemiological Surveillance has recommended
that tourists take the precaution of receiving the vaccine against the
disease if [they are going to] rural areas or [sites of] YF
reservoirs. The vaccine only takes effect starting on the 10th day
following application. Therefore, one must be immunized 10 days prior
to the departure date.

There are also 42 other suspected cases of the disease in Piraju. The
population of the town, estimated by the IBGE, is 29 282 people; 28
719 were vaccinated as of 2 Apr [2009].

From October 2008 to March this year [2009], 1 980 000 doses of
vaccine against yellow fever were distributed in the state. With the
deaths in Sarutaia, Piraju, and Itatinga, 17 neighboring
municipalities were included in the vaccination area.

In [the neighbor state of] Parana, vaccination is being held in 22
municipalities. The Secretariat of Health is stepping up immunization
in Sao Jose da Boa Vista, Ribeirao Claro, Carlopolis and the District
of Alemoa in Siqueira Campos. These locations are around the Chavantes
dam, on the border between the 2 states, where there is a large
concentration of tourists, mainly from the region where the cases of
the disease were recorded.

Since December 2008, there are now 13 confirmed yellow fever cases in
the state, with 6 deaths.

reported this Tuesday [7 Apr 2009] that the Sao Paulo state
Secretariat of Health confirmed the 1st YF case outside of the
Botucatu region, where 8 people have died of the disease. This most
recent case was recorded in the Buri municipality, more than 150 km
[93 mi] from Piraju, where 6 people have died of YF. The state
Secretariat of Health indicated that all cases so far have been a
result of the sylvan (jungle) YF virus transmission cycle, since they
were contracted in the rural outskirts of these towns.
