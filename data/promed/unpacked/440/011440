[The description of the population affected highlights for us once
again just how devastating a disease H5N1 avian influenza really is.
One day, the farmer had a normal flock of 2000 65-day-old turkeys who
were healthy and productive. The next day, much higher than baseline
mortality, with 50 birds dying, and over the course of the next 2
days, all the rest of the 1950 turkeys died.

Of course, it is hoped this is an isolated event and the reasonable
control measures taken (quarantine, stamping out, serological
monitoring, etc.) will prevent further spread. With such a volatile
disease, however, it is difficult to predict the future.

For the location of the village Silat al Harithiyah in the northern
part of the West Bank, Jenin district, about 3 km from the boundary
with Israel, see map at <http://healthmap.org/r/0xKm> or the map
appended to the OIE report referenced above. - Mod.PC]
