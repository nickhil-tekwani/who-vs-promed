As an aside to the subject of aflatoxins in wheat, I would like to comment
that it is somewhat of a mistake to say that the fungus, _Aspergillus
flavus_ (among several species) is found to occur [only in spoiled crops.
My lab was a federal licensed operation that specialized in aflatoxin
testing on peanuts, and we found that aflatoxins were common on many grains
and the fungus was considered a normal contaminant. The toxins themselves
were expressed primarily due to stress on the plant product. The stress
could be as simple as heat (which was especially relevant in Texas and
Oklahoma where we were based) or extreme dryness. The products (these could
be peanuts, corn or any grain) were tested, and based on total aflatoxin
levels, were rated as edible for humans, animals or inedible.
Interestingly, the producers can dilute a high aflatoxin value down by
adding clean material until levels are safe. Human toxic values in peanuts
were found to be from 16-20 ppb and animal levels (we called this pig food)
were up to 100 ppb. The important issue here was that the foods had the
toxins but were still considered "good".
Aflatoxins may occur in very good foods (we did a study on peanut butter
once and it was noted that very low values have been found on occasion in
some jars, but these were well within safe levels) and one must watch for
this problem in most raw grains. Currently, only peanuts are required to be
tested in the U.S., but many corn producers also test, and much work is
done in other grains on the fumanosins which are made by the genus
_Fusarium_ (e.g. DON or Zearalenone).
