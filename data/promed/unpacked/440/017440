[Due to a technical problem, the full report was not received and posted in archive no. 20120802.1225107. The complete report is posted below, with apologies for any inconvenience that may have resulted. - Mod.TY]

Since the beginning of July 2012, 2 chikungunya cases imported from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have been diagnosed by the French Reference Laboratory, IRBA Marseille.

The 1st case is resident in Kinshasa, DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo]. She presented onset of symptoms (fever, headache, joint pains) on 1 Jun [2012], travelled to France on 3 Jul [2012] and attended an outpatient department on 10 Jul [2012] in Laveran military teaching hospital in Marseille (South of France) with persisting arthralgia. ELISA tests were unambiguously positive for both IgM and IgG anti-chikungunya

The 2nd case spent 3 months in DRC (Kinshasa). Before heading to Kinshasa, she spent one day in the city of Brazzaville (Republic of Congo). She presented onset of symptoms on 25 Jun 2012 and returned to France on the same day. She attended the outpatient department of Villeneuve St George's hospital (Paris suburbs) on 5 Jul [2012] with severe headache, polyarthritis with liver damage. Her serology (ELISA) was strongly positive for [CHIK] IgM. For both cases additional tests (dengue, West Nile and Rift Valley fever were negative)

In DRC, the last large chikungunya outbreak was described in 1999-2000 with more than 50 000 cases. In 2011, an outbreak with more than 11 000 cases was reported in the neighboring Republic of Congo (Brazzaville).

Chikungunya virus is known to be present in many countries in Africa but its magnitude and circulation remain poorly documented. As for most arboviruses, very few countries have implemented specific surveillance. The occurrence of cases of chikungunya in the DRC is not unexpected but demonstrates a persistence of virus circulation in the region. In a context of high malaria incidence and of limited arbovirus diagnostic capacities the circulation of chikungunya virus in Africa is likely to be underestimated. In this regards, cases diagnosed among travelers provide indirect indications of the viral circulation.

[ProMED thanks the above contributors for this 1st-hand report. The 1st reported infection above was acquired before 1 Jun 2012 and the patient traveled to France on 3 Jul 2012, well after the viremic period. However, the 2nd case returned to France on the day of onset of symptoms, so likely was viremic on arrival but with no potential risk of ongoing transmission since _Aedes albopictus_, a vector mosquito competent for chikungunya virus transmission, is present in southern France but not in the Paris area.

In addition to the information about both cases, this report provides a significant amount of new information about the large chikungunya virus outbreaks in the DRC in 1999-2000. However, ProMED has received previous reports of smaller outbreaks in the Republic of the Congo in 2011, (see archives listed below), as mentioned in the above report. The above contributors are very likely correct about the under-reporting of chikungunya cases in Africa. One hopes that this report will lead to inclusion of chikungunya virus and its antibody in routine diagnostic tests of febrile disease, particularly those with significant arthralgia that is typical of chikungunya virus infections.
