There are 3 Victorians in hospital suffering from Japanese encephalitis after the virus was found in animals in the state's north.

Victorian health officials issued a warning about the disease on Sunday [27 Feb 2022], after evidence was found in pigs in Echuca, near the New South Wales border.

Since then, 4 Victorians have contracted the virus, believed to be the 1st cases reported in Australia's south. All 4 were admitted to hospital and one has since been discharged.

Japanese encephalitis virus spreads through mosquito bites and people in regional areas who are in contact with pigs may be at particular risk.

The disease is not transmitted from person to person and cannot be caught by eating pork or pig products.

Australia's health department confirmed the disease had been found in one piggery in Victoria's north, 6 piggeries in NSW and one in Queensland.

"This is the first time the virus has been detected in southern Australia, and biosecurity authorities are working with their human health departments to understand the implications and risks of human exposure," Australian chief veterinary officer Dr Mark Schipp said.

Federal, state and territory authorities are meeting regularly to "work through the next steps of this situation".

Anyone who works with pigs or horses, even if they're back yard pets, is urged to keep an eye out and report any possible signs of the disease.

Australia's acting chief medical officer, Sonya Bennett, said 2 vaccinations were available for protection against JEV in Australia.

Older people and those aged under 5 who are infected have a higher risk of developing a serious illness.

"Encephalitis is the most serious clinical consequence of JEV infection. Illness usually begins with symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache and vomiting," she said. Bennett said anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek urgent medical attention.

She encouraged people to avoid exposure to infected mosquitoes, with those in high mosquito areas encouraged to use repellent and cover up with loose-fitting clothing.

There are 3 Victorians in hospital with suspected cases of Japanese encephalitis after health authorities discovered a massive outbreak at pig farms across Australia's south-east that had gone undetected for weeks.

Japanese encephalitis is generally harmless but in the fewer than 1% of cases where symptoms do develop, one patient in 3 will die. A vaccine is available, but there is no treatment.

Globally, the mosquito-borne virus, which spreads between waterbirds, pigs and humans, kills about 17 000 people a year, but it has never been seen south of Cape York. Experts say the deadly disease was brought here by the warming climate and is now here to stay.

"We never expected to see it in southern regions of Australia. This has taken a lot of us by surprise," said Associate Professor Cameron Webb, an expert in the virus, based at the University of Sydney.

The unexpected arrival of the disease explains why, when several pig farms reported a mysterious and concerning rise in piglet stillbirths, it took authorities several weeks to even consider testing for Japanese encephalitis.

When they got the results back on Friday [25 Feb 2022], they discovered an enormous outbreak. Biological sampling revealed the virus at 9 piggeries, which stretch more than 1000 kilometres from Goondiwindi in south-east Queensland all the way down to Lockington in Victoria's north.

Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer, Mark Schipp, said those piggeries housed about 150 000 pigs. There are probably twice that number of feral pigs living nearby, so "we are unlikely to be able to eradicate the virus", Dr Schipp said. Another 5 piggeries are under investigation.

Victorian health authorities issued a warning on Saturday [26 Feb 2022] following the discovery of the virus at the piggeries. At that point, there were no confirmed cases in humans. Since then, 4 human cases have been identified in Victoria, with 3 people now in hospital.

Other types of virus that cause encephalitis in Australia include Murray Valley encephalitis and West Nile virus.

Health authorities are also aware of several encephalitis cases of unknown cause across NSW, Victoria and South Australia over the past month. Japanese encaphalitis is not habitually tested for because, until now, no one thought it was here. The NSW and South Australian health departments said on Wednesday [2 Mar 2022] that they did not have any confirmed cases.

Fewer than 1% of people who are infected develop clinical illness, but in those who do, the virus can be deadly as it moves into the spinal cord and brain. Children face extra risks and are often left with significant brain injuries.

"It's pretty dangerous. You don't want to get it," said Scott Ritchie, an adjunct professor at James Cook University, who has published several papers on the virus.

"It can kill you, or it can induce long-term neurological effects. You might be in a coma, paralysis. It is a nasty disease."

On Wednesday [2 Mar 2022], Victoria's Health Department said it did not have any detail of the condition of the 3 people in hospital.

In a statement issued on Saturday [26 Feb 2022], Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton warned Victorians of the dangers of the virus.

"Most people will have no, or very mild, symptoms, but anyone who develops a sudden onset of fever, headache and vomiting should see their doctor immediately," Professor Sutton said.

"People with these symptoms can deteriorate over just a few short days, including suffering a loss of co-ordination, disorientation, generalised weakness and, in some cases, issues with movement which can last for years."

Japanese encephalitis is spread by infected mosquitoes and waterbirds, which pass the virus between each other. The problem comes when mosquitos carry the virus into pigs, who can generate extremely high viral loads. Mosquitos can then carry the virus from pig to human. It cannot be spread from human to human.

Health authorities are considering rolling out the vaccine to pig workers.

Tim Kingma, the president of the Victorian Farmers Federation's Pig Group told the ABC he wasn't particularly worried about the virus. "It was a bit daunting on the morning to hear about it. Our 1st thoughts go to the people we employ, our communities, our kids," he said. "In terms of worry, there are a lot worse exotic diseases out there. This one has no effect on meat. The issue purely is a mosquito can transfer this from a pig to a human."

Exactly how the virus came to infect pigs across eastern Australia is unclear, and might never be known for certain.

The virus has been genomically linked to fatal cases in the Tiwi Islands in March 2021 and Papua New Guinea. That suggests it was carried to the Australian mainland by migrating waterbirds -- or mosquitoes blown by monsoon rains.

The virus probably landed before La Nina's huge summer rains created a "conveyer belt" for infected waterbirds and mosquitoes to head south, said Professor Webb. Murray Valley encephalitis tends to move in much the same way, he said.

Professor Webb said the climate crisis "certainly plays a role" in the spread of the virus by increasing the likelihood of extreme rainfall.

Ongoing rain and flooding means conditions will be perfect for the virus for several months, but as they recede the risk is likely to fall, though infected mosquito eggs can survive for years, hatching again in the next La Nina season.

Authorities will try to control the virus by cutting mosquito numbers in infected areas, and limiting the movement of pigs. A pig cull is off the table as there are too many feral animals -- and too many waterbirds.

The federal health department is asking people who live in areas of eastern Australia with large numbers of mosquitoes to take steps to avoid being bitten by wearing long clothing and using mosquito repellent.

[A 3 Mar 2022 report from HealthMap Alerts in the Brisbane Times stated, "JEV is spread through an opportunistic mosquito called _Culex annulirostris_, which feeds on a range of animals, including birds, pigs and humans. Associate Professor Greg Devine, the head of QIMR Berghofer's Mosquito Control Laboratory, said the recent wet weather caused by the La Nina weather system was likely to blame for the spread of the disease through Queensland.

"There is precedent -- in the past a similar virus, Murray Valley encephalitis, saw widespread outbreaks in 1974 and 2011," he said. "Obviously there were big floods in those years, but it's not the floods themselves, the floods and the virus are both symptoms of the fact that those years saw months of very wet conditions, which is conducive to mosquitoes spreading the virus."

Public Health Alert - Confirmed human case of Japanese encephalitis virus
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A public health alert is being issued following a confirmed human case of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in Queensland.

The confirmed case had recent travel in regional southern Queensland and is currently being treated in a Brisbane hospital.

JEV is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals. In animals, it mostly occurs in pigs and horses.

Clinicians at Queensland hospitals have been asked to be alert to the possibility of JEV in people presenting with encephalitis or a similar illness.

Most human infections of JEV cause no symptoms or mild symptoms such as headache or fever. A person with severe disease may present with inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), characterised by sudden onset of vomiting, high fever and chills, severe headache, sensitivity to light, neck stiffness and nausea/vomiting.

Children aged under 5 years and older people who are infected with JEV are at a higher risk of developing more severe illness.

We encourage Queenslanders to take necessary steps to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes, especially given the recent flooding event which may lead to an increase in mosquito numbers in coming weeks.

Measures to prevent mosquito bites include regularly applying insect repellent containing Diethyl Toluamide (DEET), Picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus; wearing loose, light-coloured clothing to cover up arms, legs and feet; and using other insecticide-based mosquito control devices where possible when outside.

Mosquito bites can be experienced at any time of day, but some species are most active at dusk and dawn.

Around your home, it's important to inspect for common mosquito breeding sites, clean up debris and make sure to empty, wipe out and store any outdoor containers in a dry place.

It's also important to ensure flyscreens are in good order so mosquitoes can't enter your home easily.

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a nationally notifiable disease in both humans and animals.

The human case follows a detection at a piggery in southern Queensland last week. There have also been detections in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.

There is no risk to humans from consuming pork or pig products. Pork products are safe to eat.

The virus cannot be spread directly from person to person.

Queensland Health is working collaboratively with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and industry, as well as state, territory and national counterparts to discuss a national response. Support is also being provided to intensive livestock industry workers.

[ProMED thanks Irene Lai for submitting the official report in item 3 above.

The recognition of the presence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in mainland Australia and the response to it is an excellent example of a comprehensive, one health approach to a new emerging disease situation. Pig farmers in several localities recognized that something was wrong with their animals. Their veterinarians collected appropriate samples from the pigs. Timely laboratory support identified JE virus in those samples. The presence of wild, feral pigs was taken into account in the decision not to cull affected domestic piggeries. Knowing that JE is a zoonotic disease, public health authorities issued an alert to health care providers. Human cases were quickly diagnosed. Vaccination of humans was made available. The environmental conditions favoring proliferation of vector mosquito populations, ample rainfall and flooding, was assessed. The occurrence of JE virus transmission over a wide geographic area raises the question of whether the virus now has become established in mainland Australia in areas where it has not been detected before. Doubtless, intensified, ongoing surveillance for human and pig disease and for presence of the virus in vector mosquitoes will be ongoing in eastern and southern Australia. - Mod.TY
