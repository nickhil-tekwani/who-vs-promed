Natural infection of maize by Pennisetum mosaic virus in China

In mid-2002, a potyvirus was isolated from maize (_Zea mays_) showing mild
mosaic symptoms in northern Xinzhou District of northern Shanxi Province,
China. This isolate was mechanically transmitted to maize (cultivar Ye-Dan
No.2) and _Sorghum bicolour_ (4 cultivars: Atlas, Xin-Liang Nos. 7 and 52,
and Xiong-Yue 191). All inoculated plants developed systemic mosaic symptoms.
In serological tests, the virus was distantly related to sugarcane mosaic
virus (SCMV), the prevalent potyvirus infecting maize across China (1), but
it is closely related to the newly identified Pennisetum mosaic virus
(PenMV) isolated from a perennial grass (_Pennisetum centrasiaticum_) (2).
The nucleotide sequence of the putative coat protein (CP) gene of the
isolated virus has been determined (accession number AY543166) and is
comprised of 909 nucleotides, encoding 302 amino acid residues. Sequence
comparisons among all potyviruses reported to date showed that this isolate
was most closely related to PenMV (accession number AY172336) (2). The
sequence identity between the putative CP genes of the maize isolate and
PenMV was 92 per cent, while between the CPs it was 99 per cent at the
amino acid level, thus identifying the virus isolated from maize as PenMV.
This is the first report of PenMV in maize in China. Previously SCMV had
been the only potyvirus infecting maize in the country. It occurs in most
maize-growing areas of China, and its symptoms, on most cultivars of
sorghum, are mosaic followed by reddening and necrosis of the lamina. In
contrast, the distribution of PenMV appears limited, as maize from only 1
region of China has been found to be infected and the symptoms it caused,
especially on sorghum, were significantly milder when compared to those of
SCMV.

[Zaifeng Fan stated to me in correspondence that the provisionally
designated PenMV is restricted to Shanxi Province in northern China.
Because it is a potyvirus, PenMV can be expected to spread via several
aphid species, and seed transmission should be examined in maize and
perhaps other species such as _Panicum_, _Eleusine_, and _Setaria_.
Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed 3 distinct groups of
Chinese SCMV sequences (sugarcane isolates from Zhejiang province, a maize
isolate from Guangdong and maize isolates from other provinces). It will be
interesting to know more about the genomic relationships between PenMV and
other maize-infecting potyviruses such as Maize dwarf mosaic, Johnsongrass
mosaic, Sugarcane mosaic, and Sorghum mosaic. - Mod.DH]
