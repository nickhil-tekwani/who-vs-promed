The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 12 newly confirmed cases in China, 3 of which were imported and 9 acquired locally (7 in Beijing municipality and 2 in Hebei province). No new deaths were reported. 16 new cases were reported in Hong Kong. A total of 1888 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, which may change with the significant increase in newly reported cases.

The 1st case in Beijing was reported on 11 Jun 2020; as of today, 23 Jun 2020, there have been 255 cases reported from Beijing, 20 in Hebei, and 3 in Liaoning most likely associated with this outbreak. Slight increases in serious cases have begun to be reported.

There were 7 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 5 were imported.

There were 3 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 1 was imported. There was 1 case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 21, and 22 Jun 2020, when 1 conversion was reported each time, and 2 cases were reported on 14,18, and 20 Jun 2020. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327). More in-depth follow-up information on the ongoing outbreak in Beijing can be found in section [1] of COVID-19 update (262): China (Beijing) superspreaders, WHO, global 20200616.7473860.

The Hong Kong Center for Health Protection has press releases on the newly confirmed cases: On the 16 cases reported in the past 24 hours, 9 males and 7 females aged between 11 and 48. All of them had travel history during the incubation period. The CHP's epidemiological investigations and relevant contact tracing on the confirmed cases are ongoing. https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202006/23/P2020062300624.htm. All 16 had a travel history from Pakistan, 14 of the 16 cases were asymptomatic https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202006/23/P2020062300624_344126_1_1592904705272.pdf). Yesterday's [22 Jun 2020] 30 newly confirmed cases involve 15 males and 15 females aged between 1 and 61. All of them had a travel history during the incubation period (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202006/22/P2020062200675.htm). 29 of the 30 came from Pakistan, 1 came from the Philippines. 23 of the 30 were asymptomatic. (https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202006/22/P2020062200675_344025_1_1592820494329.pdf). These findings help booster the need for testing of contacts even when asymptomatic as they too can serve as transmitters of the virus (silently), confirming the stealth mode of this virus.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 51 cases with 0 new deaths, compared with 46 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (22 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 75 consecutive days. Today's (23 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: by Region, positive cases only: airport quarantine (12), Seoul (11), Daejon (8), Gyeonggi (7), Incheon (3), Busan (2), Daegu (2), Ulsan (2), Gangwon (1), Chungnam (1), Jeonbuk (1), Gyeongbuk (1). Total newly confirmed cases (51). Unfortunately the breakdown of cases by type of transmission (imported vs locally transmitted was not available at the time of preparation of this update.

According to data from the 'ncov' website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative positive testing rate has been 1.1% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 238 833 cases, including 34 675 deaths, up by +122 cases and 18 deaths in the past 24 hours. Our calculation has an increase of +113 newly confirmed cases -- the website mentions Sardinia has removed 9 cases found to be duplicates which would explain the 9 case discrepancy. The previous day's (22 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +218 cases (+221 by our calculation, with 3 additional cases from Marche not previously reported) and 23 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 62 newly confirmed cases, up from 128 the previous day -- possible weekend reporting artifact.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4929_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4929_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (62). Also, 18 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (8 provinces reported no new cases), with only 2 other provinces reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases (Emilia-Romagna 17 cases and Campania 10 cases). The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 50 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 34 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[As of 23 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 209 970, including 99863 deaths, an increase of 2445 cases and 121 deaths since 22 Jun 2020. No mention was made over the number of provinces currently considered as "red zone". Another media report

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having overtaken the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a recrudescence (a challenge as to whether to call this a continuance of the 1st wave with transmission never having been interrupted, or to acknowledge there while had been relative control of the outbreak that was lost due to restrictions being lifted too early. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2-3 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran about 4-6 weeks after the lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while major active transmission was continuing.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 424 168, including 123 473 deaths, an increase from 2 388 153 cases and 122 610 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 209 893 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 23 Jun 2020, including 17 657 confirmed deaths and an additional 4686 probable deaths, representing an increase of 331 newly confirmed cases and 21 deaths in the past 24 hours (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and New York. With the exception of New York, this list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia. A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of today the percent positive testing results nationally is 10%, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country.
