2003/056 First report of beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus (rhizomania)
in Egypt
------------------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat was informed by Professor Abdel-Salam (University of
Cairo) that Beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus [BNYVV] (causing rhizomania
-- EPPO A2quarantine pest) was found for the first time in Egypt. The virus
was detected in some sugarbeet crops in the governorates of El-Fayoum and
Giza. The situation of BNYVV in Egypt can be described as follows: present,
reported in 2002 in the governorates of El-Fayoum and Giza.

[Rhizomania is caused by Beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus (BNYVV), which
is transmitted by the soil-inhabiting fungus _Polymyxa betae_. There are 3
pathotypes of the virus (A, B, and P), with P being the most pathogenic.
BNYVV infects all types of beet, causing severe damage and reducing root
and sugar yields. Once a production field is infested, fungal spores remain
viable for up to 30 years. Strict phytosanitary measures must be used to
restrict movement of farm equipment from infested fields to virus-free
fields. There are apparently no resistant cultivars but some expressing
partial resistance have been recently developed. In 2002, France was the
leading sugarbeet producer followed by China, Germany, Italy, Poland,
Russian Federation, Turkey, Ukraine, UK, and USA. - Mod.DH]
