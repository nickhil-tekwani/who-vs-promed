[Although they resemble raccoons, raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_) belong to the family Canidae (as dogs, foxes, wolves) (raccoons are procyonids). For a picture of a raccoon dog go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_dog#/media/File:Tanuki01_960.jpg.
Wild carnivores are known to be susceptible to common pathogens of dogs and cats. Raccoon dogs have been reported with canine distemper, rabies and sarcoptic mange.
