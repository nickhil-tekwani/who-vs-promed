Nearly 200 children in Somalia have been paralysed with polio since the
disease re-emerged in July [2005], and the virus is spreading in the
lawless country, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday [24 Mar
2005].
A nationwide vaccination campaign is being launched on Sunday [26 Mar 2006]
to try to reach 1.4 million Somali children aged under 5 [years of age],
the United Nations agency added.
"The polio outbreak in Somalia, which occurred in July 2005 with an
importation of polio virus, has affected a total of 199 children to date,"
the WHO said in a statement.
Polio, caused by a viral infection involving the brain and spinal cord, can
paralyse a child for life within hours. In about 10 percent of cases there
is a full recovery.
Since July [2005], 4 in 5 of the cases were recorded in the capital
Mogadishu, where the virus now seems to be on the decline after
immunisation campaigns, but it has spread to Lower Juba in the south and
Mudug in the northeast, the WHO said.
In all, the crippling virus is now been reported in 8 of Somalia's 19
regions. "It is a big outbreak," WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer said.
Somalia is the 19th country reinfected with polio since Nigeria's northern
state of Kano suspended immunisations in 2003, allowing the virus to spread
to neighbouring countries.
Vaccinations resumed after a 10-month ban imposed after religious leaders
said they could cause sterility or spread HIV/AIDS.
The WHO launched a worldwide campaign in 1988 to wipe out polio, but failed
to reach its target of halting transmission worldwide by the end of 2005.

From 2 new regions, 2 new cases of poliomyelitis have been reported: Lower
Juba, southern Somalia and Mudug region, northeastern Somalia. These
regions, with security-related restrictions, present a risk to neighbouring
countries.
The cases also threaten the progress made in Mogadishu, formerly the
epicentre of the outbreak which has affected a total of 199 children to
date, but which appears to be on the decline in the city.
A nation-wide polio vaccination campaign is to be launched on 26 Mar [2006]
and aims to vaccine 1.4 million children in an effort to halt further
spread of the virus and protect the gains made in Mogadishu.

Polio appears to be on the decline in Mogadishu, formerly the epicentre of
the outbreak. However, the virus has spread to 2 new regions in Lower
Shabelle, southern Somalia, and Mudug region, Northeast Somalia. Both areas
were previously unaffected by the current outbreak in the country. This
comes at a time when a nation-wide polio vaccination campaign to be
launched on Sunday, 26 Mar [2006], aims to vaccinate 1.4 million children
in an effort to halt further spread of the virus and protect the gains made
in Mogadishu.
In 2005, 82 percent of the polio cases recorded in Somalia were from
Mogadishu; following repeated vaccination campaigns there, only 3 of the 14
cases reported in 2006 are in the city. The progress made against the
poliovirus in the capital, with its difficult security environment,
indicates that polio outbreak response strategies are starting to take effect.
Both new cases, coming from regions with security-related restrictions,
present a risk to neighbouring countries and threaten the progress made in
Mogadishu. The polio outbreak in Somalia, which occurred in July 2005 with
an importation of poliovirus, has affected a total of 199 children to date.
Public health officials remain optimistic, however, aware that Somalia has
previously stopped polio, even against the backdrop of political
instability that has plagued the country. With repeated vaccination
campaigns that delivered oral polio vaccine to all children under the age
of 5 [years], overcoming serious security challenges, Somalia recorded its
last case of indigenous polio in 2002.
"Somalia has been polio-free before," reminded WHO representative for
Somalia, Dr. Ibrahim Betelmal. "With safe access for our vaccinators and
the support of the community, Somalia can stop polio again." The global
polio eradication strategies of mass and repeated vaccination campaigns
have reduced worldwide incidence of the disease by 99 percent, across a
wide variety of political, financial and cultural contexts.
The additional immunization activities required have stretched the
resources of the 18-year USD 4 billion effort to eradicate polio worldwide.
"To carry out these additional campaigns," UNICEF Representative, Christian
Baslev-Olesen said, "we will need an additional USD 11 million in Somalia
alone." The release of these funds is paramount for supplemental
immunizations activities supported by WHO and UNICEF.
Led by a public-private partnership, the Global Polio Eradication
Initiative has reduced the number of countries with indigenous poliovirus
from 125 to just 4. Outbreaks of imported polio currently affect 8
countries beside Somalia. Health officials warn that until the poliovirus
is eradicated everywhere, all countries run the risk of importations.

Somalia - 23 Feb 2006
Latest case count
-------------
Current situation:
Somalia is the only country in the world with a geographically expanding
polio outbreak. A polio case was recently confirmed in Gedo province, which
borders Kenya. The risk of continued spread -- within the country and
beyond -- remains high. A nationwide immunization campaign with monovalent
oral polio vaccine is currently ongoing, in coordination with neighbouring
countries.
Background:
Somalia, a country plagued by ongoing conflict, insecurity, the lack of a
health infrastructure and low rates of population immunity, is at the top
of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative's list of acute challenges.
Recognizing the threat of poliovirus importations due to polio outbreaks in
nearby Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen, Somalia had previously conducted three
NIDs before the first polio case of the outbreak in July 2005. These
preventive campaigns have been instrumental in limiting the spread of the
virus following importation.
Response:
Since the start of the outbreak, 6 National Immunization Days (NID) have
been conducted and have limited the geographic spread of the virus. 5 of
these campaigns used the powerful new monovalent oral polio vaccine.
A review of management and operations in the country was conducted in
November [2005] in order to guide action and limit the outbreak. To
overcome the constant constraints of insecurity and inaccessibility, WHO
and UNICEF work in close collaboration with communities and local officials
on the polio eradication effort. The programme employs 198 national and 10
international staff. During immunization campaigns, additional community
members are recruited to assist in vaccination, logistics, social
mobilization and security.
With sufficient funding, additional immunization activities will be
conducted in early 2006 and the outbreak could be stopped by the end of the
1st quarter.

[According to the polio eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>, the date
of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 21 Jan 2006, albeit today's
WHO CSR report suggests there are 2 new cases from regions outside of the
capital city (a good map of Somalia with regions is available at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/somalia_pol02.jpg>). It should be
noted that the region of Mudug borders Ethiopia, raising concerns of
possible spread into Ethiopia as well (there were 22 cases of polio
confirmed in Ethiopia in 2005 with date of onset of most recent case 6 Dec
2005 <http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>). As
transmission has been ongoing in Somalia since July 2005, it is now 8
months into re-established transmission related to the importation. There
were no cases of polio reported in Somalia during 2003 and 2004. This
current situation is disheartening, and of concern given the political and
civil unrest in the country. - Mod.MPP]
