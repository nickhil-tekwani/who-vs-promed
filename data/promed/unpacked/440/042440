Experts are urging owners to continue to be vigilant over equine flu as 32 cases have been confirmed in less than 2 months. The latest update from the Animal Health Trust shows 20 outbreaks in May [2019], including 9 in a week. This follows 12 cases confirmed in April [2019].

Of the outbreaks reported at the beginning of May, 8 involved horses who had recently been imported from Ireland, and one a horse who had recently arrived from Europe.

Two of the affected horses were vaccinated against flu, the vaccination status of 2 more is not known and the rest had not been vaccinated. In a statement, the British Equestrian Federation (BEF) said it "continues to closely monitor the equine flu outbreak", noting the latest figures from the Animal Health Trust. "This outbreak is no longer making headlines but the BEF urges owners to maintain their vigilance and ensure their vaccination records are up to date," the statement said. "We strongly recommend that if it has been longer than 6 months since the last vaccination, owners should discuss a booster with their veterinary surgeon. It is also vital that unvaccinated horses do not mix with other equines due to the increased risk of such an infectious disease spreading. Our recommendations are based on advice from experts in equine flu and epidemiology with experience in managing previous outbreaks."

The BEF also "continues to strongly recommend" that all competition and event organisers check the passports of all horses to ensure they comply with vaccination rules. The May [2019] outbreaks, in Yorkshire, Cheshire, Manchester, Shropshire, Northamptonshire, Essex, Northumberland, Norfolk, Gloucestershire and central Scotland, take the number confirmed this year so far to 93 in total.

[Equine influenza (EI), an OIE-listed disease, is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi-2) of influenza A virus within the genus _Influenzavirus A_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae. According to OIE's Manual, chapter 3.5.7 (last adopted May 2016), EI viruses [EIV] of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.07_EQ_INF.pdf).

While normally confined to equids, EIV H3N8 has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Infections of dogs have been reported in North America, generally producing mild fever and coughing, but fatal pneumonias have been recorded. Although EI has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described, primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus.

EI is endemic in the UK. The current event, starting early 2019, has been caused by a newly introduced strain, Florida clade 1 H3N8 which has recently been recorded in several other western European countries. It has been suspected to cause clinical disease in some vaccinated animals.

EI is not reportable in the UK; the cited number and locations of the published cases is based upon information from non-governmental sources. - Mod.AS
