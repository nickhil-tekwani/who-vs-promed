GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of the International
Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM) wishes to report 23 cases of
probable zoonotic sarcocystis infection in returning travelers seen at
9 different clinics in 6 countries. All travelers, some traveling in
groups, had vacationed on Tioman Island off the east coast of
Peninsular Malaysia between June and August 2011. Most but not all of
these travelers visited Perhentiau Island. All patients had fever,
myalgia or musculoskeletal complaints, and marked eosinophilia.

The largest cluster of 8 cases is reported by Dr. August Stich of the
Missionsurztliche Klinik in Wurzburg, Germany. The travelers were a
group from Southern Germany, who visited Tioman Pulau in July 2011
during a month long trip in Malaysia. At the end of the trip, all had
mild diarrhea, and one week after return, they developed fever and
myalgias, which became severe during the 2nd week of August 2011.

On presentation in mid-September 2011, all of the 5 who were directly
examined had elevated CPK (muscle enzymes) and marked eosinophilia.
Some had cardiac involvement (right bundle branch block,
tachycardia).

These 5 patients had completely negative serologies for trichinellosis
and toxoplasmosis performed at the reference laboratory at the Munich
Tropical Medicine Institute. Extra serum dilution and serum incubation
conditions were performed to rule out any possibility of
trichinellosis. Patients were treated with albendazole and
corticosteroids because of suspicion of sarcocystosis. Only one
patient consented to muscle biopsy, which was histologically
diagnostic of sarcocystosis. The patients continue to be followed, but
apparently all have improved.

The remaining 15 cases were seen by GeoSentinel sites in Hamburg
[Bernhard-Nocht] (3), Paris [Begin] (3), Munich [Tropical Institute]
(2), Geneva [CHUG] (2), Singapore [Tan Tock Seng] (2), Amsterdam [AMC]
(1), Vancouver [Victoria General] (1), Marseille [Laveran] (1). 11/15
had negative trichinellosis serologies performed at national reference
laboratories. Serology is pending in the other 4. At least 2 other
patients had EKG abnormalities.

Tioman is the only location in Malaysia shared by all 23 travelers.
Many received empiric albendazole and steroid therapy for presumed
trichinellosis and are improving, but this may be due to the steroids
and not albendazole. Muscle biopsy results are pending on 4 additional
patients in Hamburg and Wurzburg.

_Sarcocystis hominis_ naturally infects the human intestinal tract,
and secreted oocysts are ingested by predominantly porcine and bovine
intermediate hosts. Cysts develop in muscle, and the lifecycle is
completed by human ingestion of undercooked pork or beef. Over 100
zoonotic _Sarcocystis_ species exist in many animals, including
snakes.

As in the present outbreak, humans can become accidental intermediate
hosts for zoonotic species by ingesting fecally-contaminated material,
which occurs, for the most part, in the Far East, including Malaysia.
The life cycle and definitive host are not known for any species of
_Sarcocystis_ that forms sarcocysts in human muscle. The clinical
picture in the 100 or so previously reported clinical cases matches
exactly what has been seen in the 23 patients reported here.
Asymptomatic infection in individuals living in endemic areas is
likely common according to autopsy studies and sero-surveys (Clin
Microbiol Rev, Oct. 2004, p. 894-902).

The largest previous outbreak of symptomatic cases involved 15 US
military cases from Malaysia (Am J. Trop Med Hyg 1999: 61;548-53).
Because GeoSentinel sites provide only a sampling of relatively few
clinical locations (55 in total), the implications are that a much
larger number of visitors to Tioman have been infected and may remain
with undiagnosed eosinophilic myositis at present. At the same time,
an undetected outbreak may be occurring in the local population.
Further epidemiologic investigation by reporting sites into possible
sources of highly contaminated ingested material is underway.
GeoSentinel has worked through official channels to inform relevant
public health authorities of its findings. We would appreciate
information about additional cases.

[ProMED thanks David Freedman, August Stich and Frank von Sonnenburg
for reporting these cases.

Sarcocystis is a rare and uncommon course of eosinophilia and
myositis. The most recent review of Sarcocystosis (Fayer R.
Sarcocystis spp. in Human Infections. Clin Microbiol Rev 2004;17:
894-902) cites an experiment with infection of volunteers (reference
2, 42) who also developed eosinophilia.

Humans acquire intestinal sarcocystosis from eating
Sarcocystis-infected meat, and cattle are the most common source,
although any mammal may host _Sarcocystis_. Systematic questioning
about the food ingested by the patients and uninfected companions
could help identify the source.

Other infections which may cause myositis and eosinophilia, especially
trichinellosis, have been excluded by a negative serology, and the
reporting of _Sarcocystis_-like structures in muscle biopsies from
some of the patients almost certainly excludes other etiologies.
