Hong Kong S.A.R.: Avian Influenza Virus Alert
-----------------------------------------------
3 people have been taken to hospital in the Hong Kong S.A.R. of China
for observation, after having contact with a chicken feared to have
had avian influenza. The 3, who had contact with the bird after it
was brought to Hong Kong from China, are in an isolation ward. They
have shown no signs of infection, as further tests are carried out.
Hong Kong saw the 1st human cases of bird flu in 1997, but it has not
reported any human infections in the latest outbreak.
The 3 people live in a village near the border with China, and
officials said it was not clear whether the chicken contracted the
H5N1 virus in China or in the Hong Kong S.A.R. "So far, they have not
shown any symptoms of influenza -- no fever -- but we will have the
results of preliminary tests tomorrow," Thomas Tsang, director of the
government's Centre for Health Protection, told the Agence France
Presse (AFP) agency.
The bird flu alert came as people across the region celebrate the
lunar New Year, when families get together for special meals, often
involving chicken. The disease cannot be contracted by eating cooked
poultry, but those in close contact with sick birds are at risk. More
than 70 people in Southeast Asia are known to have died of bird flu
since late 2003

Hong Kong S.A.R.: 3 in Hospital Amid Bird Flu Fears
-----------------------------------------------
3 people have been admitted to hospital in the Hong Kong S.A.R. of
China after eating a chicken believed to have been infected with the
H5N1 strain of bird flu. The 3, including a 79-year-old woman, were
placed in an isolation ward after it was found a chicken they had
eaten during a family feast had nested with an infected bird smuggled
in from China, the health department said on Wednesday [1 Feb 2006].
The 3 live in a village in the mainly rural New Territories, which
border mainland China. "We have placed the 3 into an isolation ward
as a precautionary measure," said Thomas Tsang, director of the
government's Centre for Health Protection. "So far, they have not
shown any symptoms of influenza -- no fever -- but we will have the
results of preliminary tests tomorrow [Thu 2 Feb 2006]," Tsang added.
Officials also ordered a cull of poultry flocks, after another
migratory bird was found to have died of the killer disease. The new
H5N1 detections follow the discovery last week of 2 wild birds that
had died of the H5N1 virus. Acting agriculture chief Thomas Sit said
he would order a cull of poultry on farms in a 5-km (3-mile) radius
of the public park where the latest wild bird was found dead. "We
will also ask people who keep household poultry to check their
animals," Sit said, adding that all walk-in aviaries and the city's
sprawling Mai Po Nature Reserve would be closed as a further precaution.

[It is unlikely that these 3 patients will be found to have
contracted bird flu, as infection cannot contracted directly from
heat-processed chicken, and it is not certain that the bird itself
was infected (only in contact with a diseased bird). However, the
discovery of H5N1-infected wild birds within the Hong Kong S.A.R.
(see references below) suggests that the human population may be at
risk. - Mod.CP]
