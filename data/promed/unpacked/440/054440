We need to find out what test methods were run and where. If PCR has been run and negative, then it is likely not parvovirus or possibly a new variant of parvo.

Last year (2021) in Kentucky, we had a large outbreak of watery diarrhea in very young foals. Epidemiologically and clinically, it appeared to be rotavirus. However, our PCR tests on all the specimens were negative. Electron microscopy showed that the viruses were probably rotavirus. A metagenomics analysis showed the virus was rotavirus B, a new variant.

The classic virus for foals is rotavirus A, first seen in the US in about 1994. The rotavirus B has never been seen clinically in horses at the time. New primers were made for PCR and cases were then easily diagnosed.

I have copied in Dr Erdal Erol, our head of microbiology and our Director Dr Alan Loynachan. Dr Erol established a metagenomics lab in the University of Kentucky Vet Diagnostic Lab and approved for canine fecal specimens to be sent to our lab on these cases.
