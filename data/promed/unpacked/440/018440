Health authorities are preparing for a spike in mosquito-borne viruses following a population explosion of the blood-sucking insects. A long, dry spell mixed with recent rains has set off eggs dormant in the ground.

Queensland Health has warned holidaymakers to take precautions because the mozzies could be carrying disease [viruses]. While the mosquitoes that plagued northern Brisbane recently have started to die off, the Brisbane City Council fears high tides this weekend could mean more outbreaks. The council's entomologists will start spraying to kill the larvae if needed.

Meanwhile, Queensland Health has already reported an increase in cases of the mosquito-carried diseases Ross River virus [RRV] and Barmah Forest virus [BFV] in Brisbane. There have been 23 RRV cases this year [2014], including 9 in the past month [approx. 21 Mar to 21 Apr 2014], as well as 16 BFV.

QH public health physician Heidi Carroll said while it was only slightly above average for this time of year, they were preparing for more cases. "What we worry about is when there's significant rain events," she said. "More mosquitoes means they're more likely to bite people and that leads to increases in Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus [infections]."

Symptoms of RRV and BFV [infections] include painful and swollen joints, sore muscles, skin rashes, fever, fatigue and headaches, which can last from weeks to months. Dr Carroll said there were no treatments for it, other than rest.

A council spokeswoman said insect repellent, mosquito coils and lanterns can be used outdoors, while 240V plug-in devices can be used indoors.

[Ross River virus has been actively transmitted in Western Australia this year (2014). RRV transmission to humans, although sporadic in Australia, occurs during the wet season, when vector mosquitoes are abundant. RRV is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. Although not fatal, it causes acute polyarthritis in humans.

An extensive summary of Barmah Forest virus epidemiology in Australia and the disease it produces can be found in ProMED-mail archive no. 20130417.1653395. BFV is endemic in the country, and future outbreaks can be expected when there are periods of higher than usual rainfall that often bring an increase in mosquito populations, with corresponding increases in transmission of endemic arthropod-borne viruses, including BFV, in those areas. This is the cause of concern for Queensland health authorities currently.

No vaccines are commercially available for either of these viruses. The only preventive measures available are vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
