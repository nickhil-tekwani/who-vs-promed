More than 270 Canberrans have been diagnosed with pertussis (whooping cough) this year [2015], with 3 cases reported at the Hawker Primary School this month [August 2015]. Parents at the northside school were alerted by management this week with whooping cough also reported at the Turner School and Orana Steiner School in both April and May of 2015.

An ACT [Australian Capital Territory] Health spokesman said an increase in notifications was recorded between March 2015 and May 2015, although new cases had declined since then. "Schools are encouraged to distribute information and place notices in school newsletters if a case of whooping cough occurs in the school," he said.

An ACT Education and Training spokesman said parents were required to notify schools as soon as they believed their child may have whooping cough. "Schools must then notify the Chief Health Officer," he said. "Principals advise parents or carers of confirmed outbreaks at the school by newsletter or letter to parents or care deliverers." The ACT Health spokesman said vaccination was the most effective way to avoid the whooping cough infection. "However, immunity does fade over time and it is still possible to get whooping cough even if you have been vaccinated in the past," he said.

The infection is cyclical in nature with the last outbreak in the ACT occurring in 2010-11.

"Vaccination is recommended for all Australian children with the 1st dose of pertussis-containing vaccine given from 6 to 8 weeks of age, followed by doses at 4 and 6 months, a booster from 3-4 years of age, and a further booster at 12-17 years of age," the health spokesman said. "A booster dose of pertussis containing vaccine for 18-month-old children is to be added to the national immunisation program schedule later this year [2015]."

The whooping cough outbreak in the south is continuing to spread. Over 200 people have reported having whooping cough in the last month, and the number is expected to rise. The outbreak is spreading across the South Island, after being centered in Central Otago. An increasing number of cases are being detected in Southland and further afield in Otago, including Dunedin.

Historically, a whooping cough outbreak happens once every 4 years -- with the last taking place in 2011/12. While the number of daily reports of patients believed to have whooping cough is declining, health officials expect the numbers to rise again in weeks to come.

Naomi Gough, the public health physician for the Southern District Health Board, said the total number of notifications of whooping cough has been 200 over 4 weeks. Over the last week there had been less than 5 notifications per day of people having whooping cough. At the peak of the outbreak, it was about 15 people per day. A notification included suspected cases, and only about 1/3 of notifications have been confirmed as whooping cough. She said the difference between suspected and confirmed cases highlighted the fact it was a "difficult disease to diagnose and doctors are being vigilant for possible cases".

In about half of the cases, the patient had not been immunized against whooping cough, or their vaccinations were not up-to-date.

A recently published paper in PLoS Computational Biology suggests waning immunity from the acellular pertussis vaccine as the main reason for the dramatic increase in pertussis cases:
Gambhir M, Clark TA, Cauchemez S, et al: A change in vaccine efficacy and duration of protection explains recent rises in pertussis incidence in the United States. PLoS Comput Biol. 2015; 11(4): e1004138. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004138; http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004138:

Abstract
--------
Over the past 10 years, the incidence of pertussis in the USA has risen steadily, with 2012 seeing the highest case number since 1955. There has also been a shift over the same time period in the age group reporting the largest number of cases (aside from infants), from adolescents to 7-11 year olds. We use epidemiological modelling and a large case incidence dataset to explain the upsurge. We investigate several hypotheses for the upsurge in pertussis cases by fitting a suite of dynamic epidemiological models to incidence data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) between 1990-2009, as well as incidence data from a variety of sources from 1950-1989.

We find that:
1. The best-fitting model is one in which vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine is lower than that of the whole-cell (wP) vaccine, (efficacy of the 1st 3 doses 80 per cent [95 per cent CI (confidence interval): 78-82] versus 90 per cent [95 per cent CI: 87-94]);
2. Increasing the rate at which disease is reported to NNDSS is not sufficient to explain the upsurge; and
3. 2010-2012 disease incidence is predicted well.

In this study, we use all available USA surveillance data to:
- fit a set of mathematical models and determine which best explains these data, and
- determine the epidemiological and vaccine-related parameter values of this model.

We find evidence of a difference in efficacy and duration of protection between the 2 vaccine types, wP and aP (aP efficacy and duration lower than wP). Future refinement of the model presented here will allow for an exploration of alternative vaccination strategies such as different age-spacings, further booster doses, and cocooning." - Mod.LL]
