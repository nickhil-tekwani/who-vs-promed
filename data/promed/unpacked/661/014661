A child from Macon County [North Carolina] has been diagnosed with La Crosse viral encephalitis, according to Macon County Health Director Jim Bruckner.

The child is home and recovering from symptoms, but Bruckner said it is important for everyone to take necessary precautions to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses.

"La Crosse encephalitis is actually the most common mosquito-borne illness in North Carolina, and is found predominantly in the western part of the state," said Bruckner.

Two other mosquito-borne diseases, eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus [infections], are also found in North Carolina. While eastern equine encephalitis is found largely in the eastern part of the state, West Nile virus is found statewide.

Donald Dewhurst, M.D., of Macon County Public Health said symptoms of La Crosse [virus infection] occur from a few days up to 2 weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. These symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. There may be neurologic symptoms such as confusion or loss of balance and in more severe cases, convulsions or coma may occur. Children and the elderly are the most susceptible to the disease.

[The above North Carolina case occurred in one of the focal La Cross virus (LACV) endemic areas. Clinical encephalitis caused by La Crosse virus is most common in pre-school aged children. It is seldom fatal, but significant hospital stays may occur and there may be neurological sequelae. Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus, without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. The mosquito involved mainly is day-biting _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the reservoir of the virus maintained through transovarial transmission.

LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas (1) in the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html). There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA. The CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution and clinical characteristics (http://www.cdc.gov/LAC/index.html).
