The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 4 Jun 2018:
- a total of 58 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 37 confirmed, 14 probable and 7 suspected;
- 5 new suspected cases, including 2 in bikoro and 3 in Iboko. These are all known contacts;
- 4 samples were negative;
- death of a confirmed case in Bikoro;
- death of a suspected case in Iboko whose family refused to take samples.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on [21 May 2018], 1369 people have been vaccinated, including 597 in Mbandaka, 299 in Bikoro, and 473 in Iboko.

Support
- All trials of experimental treatments in the Democratic Republic of Congo must follow strict procedures of validation and administration, under the supervision of the National Institute of Biomedical Research.
- A joint scientific committee has been established at the national level to evaluate existing experimental treatments for Ebola. This committee is composed of experts from the National Institute of Biomedical Research, the University of Kinshasa and partners such as WHO, MSF, UNICEF, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and UCLA. After validation of 5 treatments whose results were promising during the 1st phases of research, the scientific committee then submitted an application for approval to the ethics committee.
- On [Fri 1 Jun 2018], the National Ethics Committee gave a favorable opinion to the request made by the Scientific Committee.
- A group of Congolese and international clinicians was deployed in the field to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the criteria for administering one or other of these treatments to patients hospitalized at Ebola treatment centers.
- To date, no experimental treatment has been given to hospitalized patients. Discussions on how to administer treatment in the context of the current epidemic are still ongoing between the different stakeholders.
- Given the evolution of the epidemiological curve, it is very likely that very few patients are eligible to receive either of these molecules.

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 3 Jun 2018:
- a total of 56 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 37 confirmed, 13 probable and 6 suspected;
- 6 new suspected cases, including 5 in Bikoro and 1 in Wangata. These are all known contacts;
- the 3 samples of [2 Jun 2018] were negative;
- no new cases confirmed today;
- no new deaths reported today.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on [21 May 2018], 1199 people have been vaccinated, including 577 in Mbandaka, 299 in Bikoro, and 323 in Iboko.

Support
- In an epidemic situation, the financial barrier should not in any way constitute a barrier to access to health care. Thus, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo decreed free health care in all affected health areas on [16 May 2018].
- This [Mon 4 Jun 2018], free care is effective in all 40 public health facilities in Mbandaka. The minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, will preside over an official ceremony to hand over 65 tons of medicine to these health facilities during his trip to Mbandaka this week.

[The DRC Ebola situation report for 4 Jun 2018 above is notable for the government decision to offer free health care, including medicines, at all of the hospitals and clinics in Mbandaka. This sounds like an excellent opportunity to build public trust in these healthcare institutions, teach patients and families the facts about Ebola, and (last but not least) attract anyone who might have symptoms and signs of Ebola infection. By report, all identified contacts in Mbandaka have now been reached and vaccinated, so this free health care incentive provides another layer of insurance to help prevent Ebola spread within Mbandaka and then elsewhere. - Mod.LXL]

[2] DRC traveler screening at points of entry
- 5 Jun 2018. Ebola virus disease -- Democratic Republic of the Congo: points of entry
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/05-june-2018-ebola-drc/en/


In response to the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO in collaboration with the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and other partners, has developed a comprehensive strategic response plan for points of entry. The aim of the plan is to avoid the spread of the disease to other provinces or at the international level. The plan includes mapping strategic points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and therefore are at risk of Ebola virus disease transmission based on population movement. The plan also includes implementing health measures at the identified points of entry/traveller congregation points, such as risk communication and community engagement, temperature checks, provision of hand hygiene and sanitation materials, and the development of alert, investigation and referral procedures.

As of 18 May 2018, a total of 115 points of entry/traveller congregation points have been listed and mapped along [sanitary cordons] in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, larger Equateur Province, and Kinshasa. Of these, some 30 points of entry have been prioritized for in-depth assessments and for implementing relevant prevention, detection and control measures. These include major ports and congregation points along the Congo River, as well as the 2 airports and the international port in Kinshasa. Areas of large gatherings such as markets are also being assessed.

Entry and exit screening measures have been implemented at the Mbandaka airport, as well as in some terminals of the Kinshasa international airport. These include travel health declaration, visual observation for symptoms, temperature check and travel health promotion measures, as well as procedures for referral of suspect cases.

WHO is monitoring travel and trade measures in relation to the current outbreak. As of 28 May 2018, 23 countries have implemented entry screening for international travellers coming from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but there are currently no restrictions of international traffic in place.

Travellers going through the exit screening from the Democratic Republic of the Congo
---------------------------------------------------------------
Effective exit screening helps prevent the exportation and spread of disease to other areas. During exit screening at international airports and points of entry, travellers will be assessed for signs and symptoms of an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease, or identified as contacts potentially exposed to Ebola virus disease.
- travellers with a possible exposure to Ebola virus and who are sick should postpone international travel and seek immediate medical assistance if there is a possible exposure to Ebola virus disease;
- any person with an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease will not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation (see link below);
- travellers should plan to arrive early at the travel facility and expect delays related to public health screening;
- travellers will be required to complete a Traveller Public Health Declaration, and these will be reviewed prior to clearance to board;
- temperature measurement will be required, in addition to normal security provisions;
- boarding may be denied based on public health criteria.

[WHO, together with the DRC government and other partners, has now developed a comprehensive travel screening and travel restrictions plan to help control the spread of Ebola. This will include not only numerous points of entry within the DRC, but also exit screening of travelers. In many ways, systematic screening travelers from the DRC at the point of embarkation is more sensible and effective than ad hoc and variable screening procedures developed by different countries. Nevertheless, the WHO report notes that as of 28 May 2018, 23 foreign countries have already implemented such procedures from travelers arriving from the DRC. - Mod.LXL]

[3] Children and the DRC Ebola outbreak
- 4 Jun 2018. Children and the DRC Ebola outbreak: 4 things you need to know
[UNICEF, edited]
https://www.unicef.org/stories/children-and-drc-ebola-outbreak-4-things-you-need-know [Byline: Leah Selim]


Nearly 500 000 children living near the latest outbreak of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) face the deadly risk of infection, as well as the fear of losing parents and loved ones.

Children are some of the hardest hit by the virus
-------------------------------------------------
The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the worst in history, with more deaths than all other outbreaks combined. Nearly a fifth of those infected were children. Mortality rates are particularly high among children who have been infected -- as high as 95 per cent for those under one year old.

The effects on children are not just physical
---------------------------------------------
The emotional scars of Ebola can take years to heal. More than 30 000 children lost one or both parents in the 2014-2016 outbreak, and many more saw a loved one die. In some communities, the fear surrounding Ebola is stronger than family ties, and children are rejected by surviving family members. This stigmatization can be isolating for children who are already struggling to cope with incredible hardship and loss. And there are other invisible effects. In Liberia, more than 70 000 children did not officially exist because their births were not registered during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak. And because there was no record of them on paper, they were deprived of essential services like school enrolment, access to health and social services, and protection by the State.

Children are an essential part of the response
----------------------------------------------
One of the most important things we learned from the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak was the importance of communities. In DRC, doctors, health workers, religious leaders, journalists, and local radio stations are all playing a part to raise awareness on recognizing early signs and symptoms, and early treatment options. Children also have a critical role to play. Schools are where children learn how to protect themselves from Ebola through handwashing and avoiding unnecessary contact. Children then talk about what they've learned with their families and neighbours, further reinforcing the awareness raising work already taking place in the community.

UNICEF is on the ground reaching families at risk
-------------------------------------------------
Children are at the heart of UNICEF's response, and we are scaling up prevention efforts in schools across all of the affected areas. This includes installing handwashing units in more than 270 schools and supporting activities to raise awareness for more than 13,000 children. UNICEF is establishing 2 child protection committees to help affected children and families. The committees are coordinating counselling and providing psychosocial support kits, which include cloth material, cooking utensils, clothes, soap, mats, buckets, mosquito nets, and food. They are also working to create a network to support children whose families are affected by Ebola. UNICEF has also shipped over 80 tonnes of supplies, including soap, tarpaulins, generators, purification tablets, buckets, and chlorine to support water, sanitation, and hygiene activities.

[We have included a special focus on children and Ebola from UNICEF. Children are especially affected by an Ebola outbreak, even if they themselves do not have Ebola infection. It is astonishing that more than 70 000 Liberian children born during the West African epidemic do not even exist on official rolls! That epidemic apparently led to a breakdown of not just government health services, but all sorts of routine government tasks and responsibilities. - Mod.LXL
