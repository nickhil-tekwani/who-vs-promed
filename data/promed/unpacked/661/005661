Sixth BSE case in Belgium
-------------------------------
Wednesday 30 Sep 1998 the Belgian Minister of Agriculture, Karel
Pinxten, made public that a sixth case of BSE has been found in the
northwest of the country.
It was a 6 years old dairy cow from a farm in Wervik, western
Flanders. At the end of August the farmer, Dirk Vannevele, contacted the vet
because 1 of his 81 cows had a limp. Because the symptoms remained after an
intervention of the vet he contacted the veterinary service of the Ministry
of Agriculture 14 days later, on September 14. This collected the cow, brought it
to a destruction company [renderer/knacker where the brains were taken out
for research [diagnostic tests and the rest of the cow was burned.
Laboratory tests proved that BSE was the diagnosis.
The Agriculture Ministry said it had notified the European Union and
meanwhile the diseased animal and the other 81 cows from the
farm had been destroyed. The diseased cow had been born at the Wervik farm.
[The two reports were edited together. The increasing numbers of affected
Belgan cows is beginning to suggest that they might be a second
