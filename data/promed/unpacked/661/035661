Plague-Infected Cats Cause Worry in Wyoming
--------------------
A local cat was diagnosed with plague Friday -- the 4th in southern Wyoming
this year -- and public health officials warned that people should take
precautions to protect their pets and themselves.
Gus Lopez, director of the Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department, said
the latest case occurred west of the city, in the same general area where 2
other cats contracted the disease. A 4th cat, in neighboring Albany County,
also was diagnosed with plague.
"Getting 4 of them in southern Wyoming in a short period of time is
unusual," said Ken Gage of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in Fort Collins, Colorado. "It's not cause for panic, or anything,
but it is cause for some concern."
In many parts of the West, plague is endemic in the fleas infesting rodent
populations. The disease can jump to other animals, including humans, if
they come into contact with infected fleas. Researchers speculate that the
infected cats probably caught or ate infected rodents.
Human cases remain extremely rare. A southwest Colorado woman who caught
plague from infected fleas is the region's only human case this year.
Wyoming has had just 5 human cases since 1978.
But state health officials also point out that they hadn't recorded any
feline cases in more than 20 years.
"I think this is just going to be the tip of the iceberg," Lopez said. "And
what really concerns me is these cases with cats right now really increase
the risk of human exposure."
That's because handling infected animals is much riskier than simply being
exposed to infected fleas. In the 5 recorded human cases since 1978 in
Wyoming, each had handled an infected animal, Gage said.
An infected cat might bring infected fleas into a home; it might also
infect people by biting, scratching or coughing. "That's very, very
dangerous, because the disease progresses very rapidly in that situation,"
Gage said.
Dr. Tracy Murphy, Wyoming's state epidemiologist, said rodent populations
appeared to be up in Wyoming and much of the West this year, in part
because of increased rain and snow during winter and spring. As rodent
populations increase, so does the chance that rodents will infect each
other, spreading plague.
Health officials are warning people to avoid contact with rodents or with
any sick or dead animals. If such contact is unavoidable, people should
wear gloves and insect repellant. Pets or people showing plague symptoms --
swollen glands, fever, chills, pain and extreme exhaustion -- should get
immediate medical attention.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_ and transmitted most often by flea
bites.
When sylvatic outbreaks occur in rodent populations, domestic cats can be
infected by fleas on the rodents or by direct contact with infected rodent
tissues -- as they chomp on squirrels or other rodents. The incubation
period in cats may be short, a day or 2, and marked by a fever of up to
41.5 C and lymphadenopathy. Typical buboes often occur in the head and
neck, and can be mistaken for cat fight abscesses. Dogs are considered to
be less susceptible.
Bubonic plague, one form of the disease, is of zoonotic concern, as
individuals may contract disease from either infected fleas or contact with
purulent discharges or blood from the cat. An even greater threat occurs
when the disease in cats progresses to pneumonic plague. This has been
documented in cats, including transmission to veterinarians and owners.
Antibiotic treatment is effective in cats, but the threat of plague is only
one of many reasons that people should keep their pets free of fleas.
There are many good flea control products and methods of eliminating fleas
from the animal as well as the yard. If an animal owner is having trouble
with fleas, a visit to the veterinarian may be in order. If an animal has a
swelling, extra caution should be taken by the animal owner as well as the
veterinarian. The swellings may rupture and expose the owner and/or the
veterinarian to the plague agent. The disease is treatable with
antibiotics, so a trip to the veterinarian may be in order. - Mod.TG]
