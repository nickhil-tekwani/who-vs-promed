As testing continues for patients of W Scott Harrington's dental surgical practice, the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) and Tulsa Health Department (THD) have a 3rd round of results to report.

Four new cases of hepatitis C have been identified since the last situation update, for a cumulative total of 69 individuals who have tested positive for hepatitis C. One new case of hepatitis B has been identified, for a cumulative total of 4 individuals who have tested positive for hepatitis B. Fewer than 3 positive HIV infections have been identified thus far.

[This story continues and is unlikely to have reached its conclusion. The dental practice in Tulsa is being investigated for serious breaches of normal surgical and dental procedures over a considerable period of time. The investigation of the dental clinic was initiated because one of the dentist's patients recently tested positive for hepatitis C and HIV without known risk factors other than having received dental treatment. By 19 Apr 2013, 57 people among the 3122 tested by that date had contracted hepatitis C virus infection as a result of attendance at this particular dental practice. Genotyping of these isolates had established their genetic relatedness, supporting the epidemiologic findings and indicating a common source of infection.

Tulsa, the 2nd-largest city in the US state of Oklahoma, can be located in the map of Oklahoma at http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/usstates/ok.htm. - Mod.CP
