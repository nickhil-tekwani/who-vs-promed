Hagyard Equine Medical Institute in Lexington [Kentucky] issued an alert [Tue 5 Jul 2016] regarding 2 cases of Potomac horse fever confirmed this week in one racehorse and one broodmare. Both had diarrhea and fever.

Symptoms of Potomac horse fever include depression, anorexia, colic, diarrhea, fevers, and signs suggestive of laminitis (inflammation of the feet). The horses diagnosed had a history of fevers, and when routine blood work was performed an extremely low white blood cell count was noted. If the symptoms are caught early, the horse can be treated with intravenous tetracycline. If caught early most horses will respond to treatment in 24 hours and have a dramatic recovery.

Potomac fever made headlines in the 1980s when an outbreak of diarrhea in the Potomac River area of Maryland drew attention to the disease. The causative agent, a bacterium named _Ehrlichia risticii_ (recently renamed _Neorickettsia risticii_), has been linked to parasites of fresh water snails.

During hot weather, such as what Central Kentucky has experienced the last 2 weeks, the bacteria-infested juvenile parasites are released into the water and consumed by aquatic fly larvae such as mayflies, caddis flies, dragon flies, and 14 other aquatic insects. These flies are now infected.

Horses can inadvertently consume these flies while grazing or eating feedstuffs. Horses kept near freshwater streams or ponds are more likely to be at risk for the disease because of the close proximity of the aquatic insects. Horses cannot get the disease from drinking water infested with juvenile parasites or eating the snails because the juvenile parasites will easily die in the horse's stomach acid.

However, a horse does not have to be near water to contract the fever. Some horses diagnosed last year [2015] were stabled and did not have access to a stream or pond.

There is a vaccine on the market, but its efficacy is questionable in the Midwest as there appear to be numerous strains of the fever.

[As previously commented by my colleague Mod.TG: This disease has been referred to in the past as equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, or equine ehrlichial colitis. It is best known for its gastrointestinal signs such as enteritis and diarrhea. This disease is caused by _Neorickettsia risticii_, an intracellular organism which is a member of the Erlichiaea family.

According to the isolates obtained from clinical cases, there is diversity in the organism, and each isolate has a different pattern of antigenic proteins. Therefore, Potomac horse fever (PHF) is caused by more than one strain of _N. risticii_.

_N. risticii_, _N. sennetsu_, SF agent, and _N. helminthoeca_ are antigenically cross-reactive, and inoculation with _N. sennetsu_ protects horses from Potomac horse fever.

Current vaccines are only made using one strain, which likely explains its lack of efficacy in some cases.

Cases of PHF have a seasonal presentation with the highest number of cases with clinical signs in July, August, and September.

Several studies have been conducted to determine the route of infection and have revealed that a parasite, living in freshwater snails and aquatic insects, is a reservoir for _N. risticii_. The parasites and _N. risticii_ have been found in adult and immature forms of aquatic insects, such as caddisflies, mayflies, damselflies, dragonflies, and stoneflies. Therefore, the seasonality of PHF is likely related to the seasonality of the flying insect.

But how does an equid become infected? These types of insects do not feed on warm blooded mammals, so it is likely that an equid may ingest an aquatic insect or snail while grazing, or consume a flying insect that has landed in drinking water. It has also been suggested that the insects might be attracted to the barn area by outdoor lights during the night.

The typical clinical signs observed in horses with PHF include: fever, anorexia, colic, depression, ileus (nonmotile gastrointestinal tract -- the horse does not defecate) or diarrhea, and laminitis [inflammation of the hoof - Mod.SH].

Clinical signs and severity vary, but common to all cases of PHF is the manifestation of colitis. The onset of colitis can result in depression and anorexia and may or may not be accompanied by a fever and/or diarrhea. However, some horses with PHF can pass normal-looking feces without showing any signs of colitis.

The 1st prominent sign of PHF often observed by owners is a decrease in feed intake. In fact, some horses may not initially show any other clinical signs except not eating. Usually, this anorexia is followed by dehydration and toxemia characterized by very bright looking mucous and a bright red/purple line on the mucosal surface above the teeth (toxic line).

Many equids, upon becoming infected with PHF, will develop a fever with an initial rise in temperature of about 103-106 degrees F [39-41 degrees C], but the presence of this fever may go unnoticed as this initial fever resolves within hours. However, it is often followed by 3-7 days of persistent fever, along with other clinical signs.

Laminitis often develops in cases of severe endotoxemia, but in some occasions it can be the only clinical sign. Laminitis in most cases results in euthanasia of the equid within days of the onset.

_N. risticii_ can cause abortions, and it is related to placentitis and retained placenta in most cases. The aborted fetus will show signs of the infection as well.

The drug of choice to treat _N. risticii_ infection in equids is oxytetracycline. The organism is inside the cells and is, therefore, difficult to treat. Oxytetracycline is able to interfere with the control mechanisms of _N. risticii_ and allows the macrophage to eliminate the organism. Oxytetracycline should be administered by a licensed veterinarian once a day for 3 to 5 days, and it is most effective when given in the early stage of the disease.

Several vaccines are commercially available in the United States, but their efficacy is questionable. Research has shown that once an equid develops an infection with _N. risticii_, the equid can develop an immunity to that particular strain for as long as 20 months.

In contrast, vaccination has been associated with a poor immune response. Research has shown that only 50 per cent of the vaccines are protective at 6 months after vaccination, and protection decreases to 33 per cent after 9 months. Vaccination may decrease clinical signs, but it will not prevent infection and illness.
