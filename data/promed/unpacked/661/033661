Diagnostic Tests: Request for Information
-----------------------------------------
The report entitled 'Hantavirus infection - Taiwan' implies that the 2
individuals in question died of a pneumonia-like disease, something not
characteristic of Seoul virus infection. The correlation with hantavirus
infection appears to be in question, since the method of testing was not
stated and [it was stated that further testing [was needed to confirm
hantavirus infection.
A quick (and perhaps superficial) search of clinical literature regarding
respiratory infections in Taiwan yielded some interesting results. There is
a very high rate of antibiotic resistant streptococcal and pneumococcal
infections in Taiwan, some of which are associated with rapidly progressing
pneumonia (Hsueh PR. Invasive _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ infection
associated with rapidly fatal outcome in Taiwan. J Formos Med Assoc - 1996
May; 95(5): 364-71).
Several cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been
documented in Taiwan (Jerng JS. Clinical spectrum of acute respiratory
distress syndrome in a tertiary referral hospital: etiology, severity,
clinical course, and hospital outcome. J Formos Med Assoc - 2000 Jul;
99(7): 538-43), with no link to a particular infectious agent.
It is unclear to me why hantavirus infection was suspected as the cause of
ARDS in these patients. Further testing (or clarification on the tests
performed so far) is needed before more speculation is warranted on whether
hantavirus infection is the cause of these 2 cases of ARDS.
