- 22:54 GMT -- No deaths in Australia's Victoria for 1st time in 2 months
Victoria, the Australian state at the centre of Australia's latest coronavirus outbreak, has reported no deaths from COVID-19 for the 1st time in 2 months. The state confirmed 42 new cases in a 24-hour-period, compared with 35 the previous day.

[Transmission continues but at a much lower level than several weeks ago when some daily case reports were over 400. 9 Sep 2020 was the most recent day reporting more than 100 cases. - Mod.MPP]

- 22:40 GMT -- Brazil registers 15 155 new cases
Brazil registered 15 115 new cases of coronavirus, totalling 4 345 610, the health ministry said. Deaths rose by 381 to 131 625 according to ministry data.

[Daily case reports from Brazil have been much lower than previously. I suspect the numbers of the past few days have been the result of weekend artifact. On 11 Sep 2020, there were over 44 000 cases reported in the 24 hour period. - Mod.MPP]

- 20:40 GMT -- Turkey's virus deaths rise to levels not seen since May [2020]
Turkey's daily coronavirus deaths have topped its numbers from early May [2020], with 63 fatalities in the past 24 hours. The number of positive COVID-19 cases stands at nearly 293 000 since March [2020]. The death toll now is 7119, but experts say all numbers undercount the true impact of the coronavirus pandemic due to limited testing and missed mild cases, among other factors. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that the rate of infections was not slowing and urged people to take precautions. Turkey eased restrictions like temporary weekend lockdowns at the end of May [2020] and reopened businesses and travel routes in June [2020].

[Turkey has been reporting 1500+ cases a day since mid-August 2020 (according to our files from Worldometer daily reports). An increase in mortality suggests an increase in cases and the possibility of undercapture/identification of cases is being discussed. - Mod.MPP]

- 20:25 GMT -- US officials: 500 000 counterfeit N95 masks seized in Chicago
About 500 000 counterfeit N95 respirator masks have been seized in Chicago by Customs and Border Protection officers, federal officials said. The shipment of masks from China was seized [10 Sep 2020] at O'Hare International Airport, according to the federal agency. It said the masks were headed to a company in Manalapan, New Jersey. The masks are used to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. "These masks did not meet the safety standards outlined by the CDC, which puts the public at risk, jeopardizing the health and well-being of everyone," said Shane Campbell, port director for the Chicago area.

[The N95 respirator masks are the masks reserved for front-line workers with probable daily exposures to infected individuals. - Mod.MPP]

- 19:30 GMT -- Jordan to close mosques, restaurants, and schools for 2 weeks
Mosques, restaurants, street markets, and most schools will be closed for 2 weeks starting Thursday [17 Sep 2020] in Jordan, amid an "unprecedented" increase in coronavirus infections and deaths in the kingdom. These measures will help to avoid a total lockdown, government spokesman Amjad al-Adaileh said. In recent days, Jordan has reported more than 200 cases and several deaths every day, a record high it has avoided earlier in the year due to a tight lockdown. "Despite previous warnings, we have seen recklessness and complacency that unfortunately led to dozens of cases in different provinces across the kingdom. So, concerned authorities will take very strict measures against those who violate" the rules, al-Adaileh said in a televised address.

[A common observation when restrictions are lifted. - Mod.MPP]

- 19:00 GMT -- Canada's Trudeau worried about uptick in virus cases
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned that Canada was "not out of the woods" with the coronavirus, urging citizens to be vigilant as more than 1300 cases were recorded over the weekend [12-13 Sep 2020] -- a level not seen since early summer. "One of the things we're seeing is, with numbers rising across the country, we are not out of the woods," Trudeau told a press conference in Ottawa. He said the resumption of classes and the reopening of the Canadian economy, meaning more people are back to work, had led to an increase in case numbers.

[It is a common observation: lift restrictions, cases increase. - Mod.MPP]

- 18:30 GMT -- UAE announces emergency approval for use of COVID-19 vaccine
The United Arab Emirates has granted emergency approval for use of a coronavirus vaccine, 6 weeks after human trials in the country started. A phase III trial of a COVID-19 inactivated vaccine developed by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical company Sinopham began in the UAE in July [2020] and is yet to be completed. "The vaccine will be available to our 1st line of defense heroes who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus," said the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority in a tweet.

[We await published results on this candidate vaccine. - Mod.MPP]

- 18:00 GMT -- Testing positive: half of Argentina's coronavirus checks yield infection
Argentina's coronavirus "positive rate," the number of daily infections to the number of tests carried out, has topped 50 percent, underscoring how much work the South American country has to do to bring the virus under control. Health ministry data showed the country carried out 17 955 tests the day before, when it recorded 9056 confirmed COVID-19 cases. That indicates a positive rate of 50.4 percent, one of the highest in the world. The country, which has been trying to open its hard-hit economy, has a total of 555 537 confirmed cases, the 10th-highest case load in the world, with 11 412 fatalities.

[A 50% positivity rate is indicative of reduced testing, prioritizing most likely symptomatic cases. - Mod.MPP]

- 17:30 GMT -- Egypt to allow wedding ceremonies, cultural events in open-air venues
Egypt will allow wedding ceremonies and cultural events to be held in open-air venues from [21 Sep 2020], after months of banning them in an attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the cabinet said. Open-air weddings would be allowed in tourist and hotel facilities that obtained health safety certificates, with a maximum of 300 invitees, it added in a statement. These facilities would also be able to host meetings and conferences with not more than 150 participants, it said. Cultural exhibitions, including book fairs, would be allowed in open-air venues with a maximum attendance of 50 percent of capacity, the statement said.

[Good luck! - Mod.MPP]

[Daily newly confirmed cases have been ranging in the 2500-3500 range since 6 Sep 2020, having been below 2000 since 24 May 2020 (data from Worldometer files we maintain). - Mod.MPP]

- 16:35 GMT -- World dangerously unprepared for next pandemic: monitor
In a new report, the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB), an independent body created by the World Health Organization and the World Bank, decried that the coronavirus pandemic had revealed how little the world had focused on preparing for such disasters, despite ample warnings that large disease outbreaks were inevitable. "The COVID-19 pandemic is providing a harsh test of the world's preparedness," the report said, concluding that little progress had been made on any of the actions it had called for in its initial report last year [2020] before COVID-19 struck. "Failure to learn the lessons of COVID-19 or to act on them with the necessary resources and commitment will mean that the next pandemic, which is sure to come, will be even more damaging," it warned.

[How sadly true these observations are. - Mod.MPP]

- 15:45 GMT -- Bayern Munich offers free virus tests to fans
German football club Bayern Munich has offered free coronavirus tests to fans with tickets for next week's Super Cup in Hungary. The Hungarian authorities require fans arriving for the traditional European season opener to have a certified negative result from a recent test for the virus before they are allowed into the country. The club says 3000 Bayern fans with tickets for the game can be tested on [21 and 22 Sep 2020] at a parking lot next to the stadium.

[The game will be on 24 Sep 2020, and the stadium will be open to 30% capacity -- approximately 20 165 spectators. (https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2020/8/25/21401200/uefa-supercup-2020-bayern-munich-sevilla-fans-in-the-stadium-budapest-puskas-arena)

- 15:15 GMT -- Russia completes volunteer recruitment for COVID-19 vaccine trial
Russia has recruited sufficient participants for its large-scale COVID-19 vaccine trial, known as a phase III trial, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, which is backing the vaccine, said. "In just 2 weeks, 55 000 volunteers have already been recruited in Moscow," Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Said. Russia began recruiting for what was billed as a 40 000-strong phase III trial on [26 Aug 2020]. Initial results are expected in October or November this year [2020], officials have said.

- 14:50 GMT -- At least 1.7 million jobs lost in Kenya due to coronavirus fallout
The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics estimated that around 1.7 million people have been made redundant due to the outbreak during this time. According to the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE), a total of 604 firms in Kenya have sent workers home due to the coronavirus fallout. Speaking to Kenya's local daily the Nation, the FKE said at least 33 jobs were lost in every modern sector company between March and August 2020. "The worst is yet to come as workers continue to grapple with the impact of the pandemic, especially the consequences of the abrupt shutting down of economic activities," Jacqueline Mugo, the FKE executive director, said.

[Serious economic hardships related to the pandemic are impacting many countries. - Mod.MPP]

- 14:20 GMT -- Romania reopens schools under strict rules as coronavirus cases rise
Romania has reopened more than 17 000 schools for 2.8 million children after a 6-month closure to fight the coronavirus outbreak, ordering pupils to wear face masks as infections rise. With 104 000 cases, and new infections jumping above 1000 a day since July [2020], millions of teachers, students, and parents face a tough challenge to adapt after months of online teaching at home. President Klaus Iohannis urged students "to become super-heroes who wear the mask, wash hands, and listen to their teachers, protect parents and grandparents, the most exposed to the danger of getting sick."

[No further information on how schools are opening, if 100% daily attendance or if reduced daily attendance. - Mod.MPP]

- 10:45 GMT -- Eli Lilly's rheumatoid arthritis drug helps recovery in COVID-19 patients
Eli Lilly and Co said its rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant [baricitinib] helped reduce the time taken to recover from COVID-19 in hospitalized patients in a clinical trial. The US drugmaker said the drug, in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc's remdesivir, met the main goal of shortening recovery when compared to remdesivir alone.

[Discussion of the results from Eli Lily is available at https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/eli-lilly-coronavirus-anti-inflammatory-drug-414478. The results have not been published yet, nor is a pre-peer review publication available. According to the company (and confirmed by NIAID), the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir reduced recovery time by one day. - Mod.MPP]

- 09:28 GMT -- Italy's schools finally reopen after 6-month closure
After a 6-month shutdown, the longest in Europe, Italy reopened most of its schools, testing the organisational skills of the government, the nerves of teachers, and the self-control of excited students. Schools in 13 of the country's 20 regions cautiously resumed face-to-face lessons, calling back 5.6 million students to their desks. The remaining 7 regions have decided to delay for another week. Battling to halt the spread of coronavirus, the government shut the nation's schools in early March [2020]. Efforts to make classrooms safe again and limit the possibility of fresh contagion have been mired in controversy. "At the beginning, there are going to be problems," Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. In Italy, about 35 500 people have died of COVID-19, the largest death toll in the European Union, and the number of new cases has picked up recently raising fears of a 2nd wave.

[Following the comparative 7-day averages for this week and 8-18 days preceding this past week, over the weekend the daily case count changes for Italy have markedly decreased (?weekend artifact influencing these figures); there is an increase of 4.4% in newly confirmed cases and an increase of 1.4% in daily reported deaths. On Fri 11 Sep 2020, the comparative 7 day average changes were an 8.6% increase in newly confirmed cases and a 71.7% increase in daily reported deaths (data from spreadsheets we maintain on daily reports from the Italian MOH http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=5351&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto). - Mod.MPP]

[The Philippines has been the dominant country in the Western Pacific region with respect to ongoing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Our daily WHO reports highlight this (except on Mondays...). - Mod.MPP]

- 07:28 GMT -- Crowded Marseille soccer celebrations condemned by French minister
French interior minister Gerald Darmanin criticised Olympique Marseille's (OM) fans for celebrating en masse on the streets of the city after Marseille beat Paris Saint Germain (PSG), given the risks from the COVID-19 virus in France. "One can only condemn the images that we are seeing," Darmanin told LCI television when shown TV footage of hordes of Marseille supporters partying after the win in close proximity to one another, with many not wearing masks. Last week [week of 7 Sep 2020], French Prime Minister Jean Castex singled out Marseille and Bordeaux as among the mainland French cities hardest hit by the resurgence of the COVID virus in France. Marseille's hospitals have also been put back on a crisis footing as the virus has started to spread again in France, which has the world's 7th-highest COVID-19 death toll.

[With the current ongoing upsurge in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Marseille, the street partying may be like adding fuel to a fire and further increase the virus transmission. Time will tell. - Mod.MPP]

- 05:00 GMT -- Doctors in Indonesia fight spread of fake news on COVID-19
The Doctors Without Borders (also known as MSF) has called on the Indonesian government to step up education regarding the spread of the coronavirus in the country, saying that the spread of rumours and fake news is creating "panic" in many communities. "We needed to help them find a way to educate and inform the community quickly and on a large scale. Fear can be just as harmful as COVID-19," said Dr Dirna Mayasari, the MSF deputy medical coordinator in Indonesia. MSF said that in one community in South Jakarta, for example, villagers "were so confused" after receiving inaccurate information, some of which are "defined as fake news" regarding the spread of the deadly disease.

- 04:10 GMT -- Coronavirus panel slams failure to head warnings
The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, a panel reviewing the response of the coronavirus pandemic, has denounced the collective failure by political leaders that led to the current "disorder". "Financial and political investments in preparedness have been insufficient, and we are all paying the price," according to the report prepared by the panel organised by the World Bank and the World Health Organization. "It is not as if the world has lacked the opportunity to take these steps," it added. "There have been numerous calls for action... over the last decade, yet none has generated the changes needed."

- 03:35 GMT -- Doctors oppose easing of social-distancing rules in the Philippines
Doctors in the Philippines have expressed opposition to the government's plan to easing physical distancing regulations in the country, saying it is too early to relax the rules. In an online forum on Monday [14 Sep 2020], Dr Antonio Dans, a leading expert on the country's university healthcare law, said that the department of transportation should not change its rule of one metre between passengers, as it could lead to more transmission. The government plans to gradually reduce social distancing rules on public transportation to just half a metre [almost 2 ft] on [28 Sep 2020] and 0.3 meters [1 ft] on [12 Oct 2020] to increase the capacity of trains and buses. The country has over 261 000 cases and at least 4371 deaths due to the pandemic.

- 02:50 GMT -- Israel to reinstate lockdown
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that the country will reinstate a strict new countrywide lockdown this week amid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Starting on Friday [18 Sep 2020], schools, restaurants, malls, and hotels among other businesses will shut down and restrictions on movement will be imposed.

- 01:25 GMT -- Trump indoor rally plan prompts virus warning
US President Donald Trump was due to hold his 1st fully indoor rally in months in the state of Nevada, but authorities warned the gathering could violate coronavirus restrictions on crowd sizes. Indoor rallies during the pandemic have proven problematic for Trump, who was heavily criticised after one in June [2020] that was later linked to a spike in virus cases. Plans for the rally in the Nevada city of Henderson on Sunday [13 Sep 2020] drew a rebuke from local authorities who noted events with more than 50 people are not allowed due to the coronavirus, according to Reuters news agency.

The government has said the real number of infected people is likely higher than the confirmed cases, and the country has also reported over 120 000 in excess deaths in recent months.

[Mexico has been in the top 20 countries vis-à-vis daily newly confirmed cases for several months now and is the 9th highest country in terms of cumulative case counts. The figures on excess deaths are sobering as they include COVID-19 directly related deaths (those who die at home) and indirectly related (those who die of other causes that weren't followed by the health sector). - Mod.MPP]

- 00:10 GMT -- Australia's Victoria sees lowest rise in COVID-19 cases
Victoria, the 2nd-most populous state in Australia and the centre of the country's coronavirus outbreak, has reported its lowest number of new cases in 3 months.

COVID-19 can ravage the body, targeting the lungs, heart, and blood vessels. To curb this wide-ranging attack, scientists are focusing on another part of the body: the nose. The virus that causes the illness, SARS-CoV-2, gains its foothold by infecting certain nasal cells, studies suggest. As a result, the nose has emerged as a key battleground in the war against COVID-19. Slowing or stopping that nasal invasion might ultimately be powerful enough to change the course of the pandemic, some scientists suspect.

So far, no such therapies exist. But people who study the nose and its contents bring fresh perspectives about the early stages of COVID-19 infections. Scientists are developing and testing ways to prevent the virus from settling into prime nasal real estate. These include a nose spray that smothers and inactivates a key viral protein, disinfectants that are commonly used before sinus surgeries, and even dilute baby shampoo misted up the nose.

"I'm a nose person," says Andrew Lane, an otolaryngologist and rhinology specialist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. But to most people, noses don't usually spark a lot of interest, he says. "Now it's the center of people's attention."

This nasal gazing makes perfect sense. "The nose is a place where the virus is setting up shop," Lane says. In a recent study, he and colleagues measured levels of a protein on human cells called ACE2 that's thought to be one of the ways the virus can infect the cells. Among a collection of human tissues taken from the noses and throats of people, the upper back part of the nasal cavity, known as the olfactory epithelium, was packed with ACE2. (This spot is also where smell cells dwell; SARS-CoV-2 infections there have been linked to loss of smell).

"You would just see this incredibly bright signal coming from the olfactory epithelium," Lane says. That ACE2 signal suggests that those cells might be key entry ports that allow the virus to move into the rest of the body, and even perhaps back out again to infect other people, the researchers report in the [1 Sep 2020] European Respiratory Journal.

To interrupt the infection in the nose, some scientists are turning to specialized immune proteins found in camels, llamas, and alpacas. Called nanobodies, these proteins help fight off invaders in the body, but are smaller and thought to be hardier than their human antibody kin. In lab studies of proteins and cells in dishes, biochemist Aashish Manglik and cell biologist Peter Walter, both at the University of California, San Francisco, have shown that custom-designed nanobodies can smother the spike protein that the coronavirus can use to break into cells.

The researchers haven't yet tested the nanobodies in people. But their preliminary results suggest that once neutralized with nanobodies, the virus "cannot enter human cells," Walter says. "It cannot establish that beachfront in the nasal cavity." These nanobodies were stable when dried and aerosolized, the researchers found, suggesting that they could be made into a nose spray. The most recent results, which haven't been peer-reviewed, were posted [17 Aug 2020] at bioRxiv.org. The team hopes to begin tests in laboratory animals and eventually, in humans. Walter and Manglik hold patents on the specially designed nanobodies.

A simpler approach would be to wash away or kill the virus in the nose.

The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 am CEST, 13 Sep 2020

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
In the week from [7 through 13 Sep 2020], there were over 1.8 million new cases of COVID-19, comparable to the previous 7 days (Table 1: Newly reported and cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths, by WHO Region, as of [13 Sep 2020]); while deaths increased slightly as compared to the previous week, with over 40 600 deaths reported. The Region of the Americas has consistently registered the greatest number of reported cases for many weeks. It continues to account for nearly half of the global total of cases even as cases have declined in the reporting week. The African Region also showed a decline in reported cases this week and was the only region to report a decline in deaths.

Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases reported weekly by WHO Region and global deaths, [30 Dec 2019] through [13 Sep 2020].

The European region reported the 3rd-highest number of new cases, amounting to 16% of the global total, and is the region with the 2nd-highest cumulative number of cases per million population (5172 cases per million population).

In recent weeks schools have been re-opening in a number of countries throughout the 6 WHO regions. WHO has published both a Question and Answer and guidance on considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19 [links available at the source URL above].

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
The African Region has witnessed declining trends in the number of new cases reported (a 14% decrease in cases and a 15% decrease in deaths in the past 7 days), with 26 of the 47 affected countries reporting decreases in the past week. While this is encouraging, vigilance is still essential as many factors may be influencing these trends such as testing capacity and strategy, along with delays in reporting in some areas.

While South Africa continues to account for the greatest number of cumulative reported cases in the region (Table 2: Number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths reported in the last 7 days by countries, territories, and areas, as of [13 Sep 2020]), disease incidence by 1 million population is highest in Mayotte (12 367 per million). Cumulative deaths per million population remain the highest in South Africa (260 per million population).

Elsewhere in the region, WHO has donated life-saving equipment and medical supplies and helped established a new WHO-supported COVID-19 testing molecular laboratory in Makeni City, northern Sierra Leone, to facilitate scaling up of testing capacity for the disease in the country. Sierra Leone has continued to report COVID-19 cases throughout the pandemic amidst other ongoing communicable diseases outbreaks. Sierra Leone reported 53 cases and 1 death this week, resulting in a cumulative total of 263 cases per million population and 9 deaths per million population.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [13 Sep 2020]

- Region of the Americas
As cases in the Region of the Americas continue to rise and social dynamics change, the WHO Regional Office has compiled infographics covering a range of issues related to COVID-19, including tips on how to stay safe and healthy during the pandemic for different ages, risk groups, and settings.

While the numbers are relatively low (Table 2: Number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths reported in the last 7 days by countries, territories, and areas, as of [13 Sep 2020]) as compared to other countries in the region, Guadeloupe has reported its highest number of cases this week, rising from 428 new cases in the previous weekly update to 1717 new cases this week, and the transmission pattern has now moved from clusters of cases to community transmission. Cumulative cases and deaths have increased relative to the territory's population, over 100% in cases (3406 to 7698 per million population) and a 20% increase in cumulative deaths (50 to 60 per million population) in the past 7 days.

In the past week, Curaçao has shown the highest weekly increase in the number of cases since the start of the outbreak in the country, a 250% increase in weekly new cases reported which translates to a 73% increase in cumulative cases from 475 to 823 per million population.

While cases reported this week in Costa Rica are in line with the average for the country in the past few weeks, the number of deaths reported has increased by 84% and a 24% in the incidence of deaths relative to the country's population (92 to 114 per million population) in the past week.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [13 Sep 2020]

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
Cases in the Region continue to rise, an increase of 14% in the past 7 days, and currently account for 6% of global cases. Seasonal religious and cultural mass gatherings, wedding celebrations, and other social events have contributed to the upsurge of cases in different countries in the region. Upticks of cases reported in Tunisia and Jordan have been linked to ceremonies and celebrations.

Cases in Morocco have reached a peak at approximately 2000 per day, an increase of 41% in weekly new cases, resulting in 2288 cases per million population. The majority of new cases (42%) are being reported in the Casablanca-Settat region, where public health and safety measures are being scaled up in response. In Jordan, the number of weekly new cases has increased by 54%, increasing the cumulative cases per million population from 231 to 300. Deaths have remained stable at 2 per million population. Additionally, the 1st 2 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in a refugee camp hosting Syrian refugees. In Libya, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 has more than doubled over the past 2 weeks; both the cumulative cases and deaths per million population in Libya has increased by 30% in the past 7 days. Given the acute shortages of tests and laboratory capacity, the real number of cases is likely to be much higher. WHO is supporting the efforts of Libyan authorities to increase the number of COVID-19 tests and trace all contacts.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [13 Sep 2020]

- European Region
The European Region accounts for 16% of global COVID-19 cases and 25% of the deaths. While France reported the highest number of new cases in the past 7 days, the top 3 countries in the region reporting the highest cumulative cases per million population are San Marino (21 834 cases per million population), Andorra (17 395 per million population), and Israel (16 430 per million population). The countries reporting the highest cumulative number of deaths relative to their population are San Marino (1238 per million population), Belgium (856 per million population), and Andorra (686 per million population).

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [13 Sep 2020]

- South East Asia Region
In the South East Asia Region, India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh continue to report the highest number of cases, although the Maldives accounts for the highest number of cumulative cases relative to its population (16 746 per million population). The region recorded 22% of all new deaths in the last 7 days but retains low overall cumulative deaths relative to the region's population (46 per million population).

Myanmar is continuing to show increasing case numbers, with a greater than 250% increase in weekly new cases, resulting in more than a doubling of cumulative incidence from 24 to 51 per million population. An influx of local travelers from Rakhine State to Yangon Region occurring since the end of August [2020] has contributed to increasing trends; as incidence rises, there are concerns of spread of cases from Myanmar across its border with Thailand, where cases have remained low (50 per million population) since peaks in early April [2020].

Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO South-East Asia Region, as of [13 Sep 2020]

- Western Pacific Region
Overall, the Western Pacific Region has the lowest cumulative cases (278) and deaths (6) per million population. The Philippines, Japan, and the Republic of Korea have the greatest number of new cases in the region; however, Singapore holds the largest number of cumulative cases per million population at 9804. Malaysia showed an increase in weekly new cases of nearly 650%, averaging about 68 cases per day. Prior to this, Malaysia had been reporting fewer than 20 cases per day since the end of July [2020]. In the last 7 days the cumulative cases per million population rose by 5% to 305 cases per million population).

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (81 911), followed by the USA (40 831) and Brazil (19 089) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.4%) and 55.5% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4382 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (13-14 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (17 033), Argentina (9909), France (6158), Colombia (5573), and Russia (5509), and 29 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 7 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region and 7 are from the European region. Spain reported the 4th highest daily cases globally today and on 11 Sep 2020.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 5.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 14.9%.

Impression: Cases are increasing globally, with Europe showing major increasing transmission in many countries. - Mod.MPP]
