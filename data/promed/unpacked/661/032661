A rapid increase in the rodent population in the South Atlantic Autonomous
Region/Nueva Guinea area (as well as Jinotega) has been reported nearly a
year ago. See the following web site:

[The epidemiology and epizootiology of leishmaniases are very complex and
there are many reservoirs and situations. The situation and form and
transmission, including reservoirs and vectors, must be studied in each
place. Certainly Dr. Zeledon, from Costa Rica, could inform us on the
situation in Nicaragua, so near and similar to his country.
It is impossible to generalize, blaming rodents as reservoirs and proposing
their control. For Central America, there are several publications on
leishmaniases in Belize, mostly by P. Williams, and from Panama, involving
Christensen, Herrer and others. For general methods of investigations and
reviews of epidemiology, Lainson's and Shaw's papers must be read.
