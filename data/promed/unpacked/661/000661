First report of pepino mosaic virus on natural hosts. C Jorda, A Lazaro
Perez, PV Martinez Culebras. Dpto. Ecosistemas Agroforestales, Patologia
Vegetal, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Cno. de Vera, 14 Spain; A
Lacasa. CIDA, Murcia, Spain. Plant Dis 2001; 85: 1292. Published online as
D-2001-1029-02N, 2001. Accepted for publication 11 Jul 2001.
Pepino mosaic [potexvirus (PepMV) is ... the causal agent of a new disease
occurring in protected [crops of tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill.)
... in the Netherlands (2). PepMV has been subsequently identified in
England, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Portugal, and Spain. The new disease has
become a serious problem for tomato production in Europe.
Most infected tomato plants expressed leaf distortion, chlorosis, and
yellow mosaic. Other plants expressed mosaic and bubbling of the leaf
surface. Tomato fruits showing severe discoloration and mosaic were
observed in protected tomato crops. Signs attenuated in tomato plants as
the ambient temperature increased.
At present, only _Solanum muricatum_ Ait. (Peruvian pepino) and _L.
esculentum_ are [known to be naturally affected by PepMV. To determine
possible reservoir hosts for this virus, 70 samples from [11 wild plant
species ... were analyzed. The plants were collected around greenhouses
affected by PepMV from different regions in Spain (Murcia and Canary
Islands). The samples were analyzed for PepMV by ... DAS-ELISA with a
commercial antiserum (DSMZ AS-0554, Biologische Bundesantstal,
Braunschweig, Germany).
Only [5 species, _Amaranthus_ sp., _Malva parviflora_ L., _Nicotiana
glauca_, _Solanum nigrum_, and _Sonchus oleraceus_ tested positive [for
PepMV. The presence of PepMV in these weed species was confirmed by
electron microscopy and ... reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) using degenerate primers for potexvirus (1).
None [of the 11 test plant species ... showed signs of infection, but
signs were reproduced by mechanically inoculating tomato plants with sap
from naturally infected weeds. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of natural infection of weeds by PepMV.

[PepMV is highly contagious and spreads rapidly by contact, especially in
protected crops. Only one of the known potexviruses, Papaya mosaic virus,
is transmitted by an invertebrate vector. The fact that infected tomato and
weedy host plants become symptomless with increased ambient temperature
confounds disease management.
