A slaughtered 1.5-year-old animal has been preliminarily diagnosed
with anthrax in the settlement Kiren in the Tanukin region of
Buryatia. The final diagnosis will be available in 10 days, as the
biological tests are finalized. Preventive measures are being taken
in the settlement. The [slaughterhouse] is fenced and the land is
disinfected. Veterinary doctors control the animals in the 3
neighboring streets. All the people who could get infected are being
followed up. There are no new cases up to this date [3 Sep 2007].

[There are more than 200 cattle burial places of anthrax animals in
the 19 regions of Buryatia. This constitutes a constant risk for new
cases, both among animals and humans. As in the other regions of the
country the exact places are often not known. Currently in Buryatia
the animal products are being supplied to customers directly by
producers and the only control mechanism is the veterinary service,
which is not available everywhere, see
<http://pressa.irk.ru/number1/2006/33/001004.html> (in Russian). - Mod.NP
Taking 10 days to confirm a diagnosis of anthrax indicates that the
oblast veterinary diagnostic system is creaking, as it should only
take 2-3 days at the most. Of course this delay might reflect the
condition of the carcass or meat when the situation was discovered.
You will note that a number of people are under medical supervision.
So, unfortunately, this is probably the same-old, same-old Russian
story. One day we may read a veterinary report from Russia of an
anthrax outbreak, which does not involve humans. Another interesting
aspect is that animals in the 3 neighbouring streets are under
surveillance. This suggests that the affected animal was in someone's
backyard in Kiren, not unlikely with an animal this young but as it
is summer it should be out grazing on pasture. But it could have been
grazing in a common field next to the village, as in Bavaria. - Mod.MHJ]
Buryatia is located in the South-Central region of Siberia along the
eastern shore of Lake Baikal and bordering Mongolia; it can be
located on the map at
