The swine flu [A/H1N1pdm09] cases continue to take lives in the country, as 184 deaths and 1721 [cases have been reported in 2018]. The latest Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), a report by the Health Ministry, reveals 10 new cases of swine flu in the national Capital in the week ending on [13 May 2018]. The increased number of cases has caused new isolation wards being open at several hospitals, whereas some hospitals are still using their swine flu wards as dengue/chikungunya wards. New cases started to appear in January [2018] when 6 cases were reported in the 1st week itself.

[Influenza cases continue to be reported during the inter-seasonal period, which is currently ongoing in the northern hemisphere. However, 'swine influenza' as mentioned in report can be misleading, since it is now a seasonal influenza virus known as influenza A/H1N1pdm09.
Isolation of the seasonal influenza cases is also not a requirement. -Mod.UBA

The number of people diagnosed with flu has tripled since last year [2017] as a full-scale epidemic hits the country.

So far this year [2018] 4315 people just in Queensland have been diagnosed with the virus despite many Australians rushing for vaccinations.

Figures show that 100 more people have been diagnosed with the flu in May this year when compared to last year [2017], according to the 2018 Queensland Health's Influenza Surveillance Report.

Reports show that this is over 100 more than the flu cases in May [2017], causing growing concern over this year's flu season. However, Queensland Health added that the increased numbers of testing could likely be the reason as to why reported flu cases have grown significantly at this time of the year.

Queensland Health also reports that it has released new flu testing technologies in at least 15 Queensland hospitals in order to address the health concern.

The new flu testing technologies have also been reported to deliver results in at least 30 minutes in order to ensure an early diagnosis and faster treatment of flu patients.

Queensland Health releases weekly reports on influenza cases and compiles them every year.

Influenza cases in Queensland tend to peak between May and October during Australia's winter season.

Last year [2017], Queensland Health's Influenza Surveillance Report showed that there were 56 094 influenza cases, with 6070 Australians hospitalised, along with 753 people in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The 2017 flu season is known to be one of Queensland's worst flu records.

[The influenza season has just started in the southern hemisphere which includes Australia. As mentioned in the report, the increased number of reported cases can be attributed to better surveillance and detection capacity. However, as the season gets underway, monitoring of the cases, particularly the associated morbidity and mortality trends, will be helpful to gauge the impact of the influenza viruses in the 2018-19 season. - Mod.UBA
