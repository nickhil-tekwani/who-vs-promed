Outbreak brief 3: Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak
----------------------------------------------------
Outbreak update: Since the last brief (3 Mar 2021), 1 new confirmed case, 2 new deaths, and no new recoveries of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in Nzerekore, Guinea. This represents a 91% decrease in the number of new cases reported this week compared with new cases reported in the last brief. Cumulatively, 29 EVD cases, 13 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 45%), and 4 recoveries have been reported from Democratic Republic of Congo (11 cases; 4 deaths; 2 recoveries) and Guinea (18; 9; 2). Seven health care workers are among the confirmed cases: DR Congo (2) and Guinea (5).

- DR Congo updates: Since the last brief, no new cases, deaths, or recoveries from EVD have been reported. Cumulatively, 11 confirmed cases, 4 deaths (CFR 36%), and 2 recoveries have been reported. See Table 1 [at the source URL] for the breakdown by health zone.

- Guinea updates: Since the last brief, 1 new confirmed case, 2 new deaths, and no new recoveries have been reported in Nzerekore. Cumulatively, 18 cases (14 confirmed, 4 probable), 9 deaths (CFR 50%), and 2 recoveries have been reported. See Table 1 for the breakdown by region and subprefecture.

- Cross-border updates: Between 15 Feb and 8 Mar 2021, 17 EVD-related alerts were reported in Sierra Leone. All alerts were investigated and tested negative for EVD by PCR. As of today [9 Mar 2021], no confirmed case has been reported from Sierra Leone.

[2] Origin of outbreak: persistent virus

An Ebola outbreak in Guinea that has so far sickened at least 18 people and killed 9 has stirred difficult memories of the devastating epidemic that struck the West African country between 2013 and 2016, along with neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone, leaving more than 11 000 people dead.

But it may not just be the trauma that has persisted. The virus causing the new outbreak barely differs from the strain seen 5-6 years ago, genomic analyses by 3 independent research groups have shown, suggesting the virus lay dormant in a survivor of the epidemic all that time. "This is pretty shocking," says virologist Angela Rasmussen of Georgetown University. "Ebolaviruses aren't herpesviruses" -- which are known to cause long-lasting infections -- "and generally RNA viruses don't just hang around not replicating at all."

Scientists knew the Ebola virus can persist for a long time in the human body; a resurgence in Guinea in 2016 originated from a survivor who shed the virus in his semen more than 500 days after his infection and infected a partner through sexual intercourse. "But to have a new outbreak start from latent infection 5 years after the end of an epidemic is scary and new," says Eric Delaporte, an infectious disease physician at the University of Montpellier who has studied Ebola survivors and is a member of one of the 3 teams. Outbreaks ignited by Ebola survivors are still very rare, Delaporte says, but the finding raises tricky questions about how to prevent them without further stigmatizing Ebola survivors.

The current outbreak in Guinea was detected after a 51 year old nurse who had originally been diagnosed with typhoid and malaria died in late January [2021]. Several people who attended her funeral fell ill, including members of her family and a traditional healer who had treated her, and 4 of them died. Researchers suspected Ebola might have caused all of the deaths, and in early February [2021] they discovered the virus in the blood of the nurse's husband. An Ebola outbreak was officially declared on 13 Feb 2021, with the nurse the likely index case.

The Guinea Center for Research and Training in Infectious Diseases (CERFIG) and the country's National Hemorrhagic Fever Laboratory have each read viral genomes from 4 patients; researchers at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, Senegal, sequenced 2 genomes. In 3 postings today [12 Mar 2021] on the website virological.org, the groups agree the outbreak was caused by the Makona strain of a species called Zaire ebolavirus, just like the past epidemic. A phylogenetic tree shows the new virus falls between virus samples from the 2013-2016 epidemic.

Until recently, scientists assumed Ebola epidemics start when a virus jumps species, from an animal host to humans. Theoretically, that could have happened in Guinea, says virologist Stephan Gunther of the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, who worked with one of the 3 teams. But given the similarity between viruses from the epidemic and the new ones, "It must be incredibly unlikely."

Outside scientists agree but say it hasn't been proved that Ebola lay dormant in one person for 5 years. "From the tree, you'd conclude that it is a virus that persisted in some way in the area, and sure, most likely in a survivor," says Dan Bausch, a veteran of several Ebola outbreaks who leads the United Kingdom's Public Health Rapid Support Team. But it is hard to rule out scenarios such as a small, unrecognized chain of human-to-human transmission, Bausch adds: "For example, a 2014 survivor infects his wife a few years after recovery, who infects another male, who survives and carries virus for a few years, then infecting another [woman], who is then seen by a nurse who dies" -- the index case in the new outbreak.

The nurse was not known to be a survivor herself, but she could have had contact with a survivor privately or through her job, or she might have been infected herself years ago with few symptoms. "Figuring out what exactly happened is one of the biggest questions now," Bausch says.

Another ongoing outbreak of Ebola in North Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was also started by transmission from someone infected during a previous outbreak, Delaporte notes. (The survivor had tested negative for Ebola twice after his illness in 2020.) Taken together, that suggests humans are now as likely to be the source of a new outbreak of Ebola as wildlife, he says. "This is clearly a new paradigm for how these outbreaks start." Outbreaks sparked by survivors may even become more likely, now that increasing mobility and other factors have caused each eruption of Ebola to become bigger, resulting in more survivors, says Fabian Leendertz, a wildlife veterinarian who was involved in the sequencing.

The cases raise important new research questions, Bausch says: "How do we need to change our response to escape from the cycle of outbreak-response-reintroduction-outbreak?" he asks. "Can we use new therapeutics to clear virus from survivors?"

But the most immediate question is what these results mean for Ebola survivors, who face a lot of hardship already. Many have not only lost friends and family to the virus, but also struggle with long-term aftereffects, such as muscle pains and eye problems. In a study published in February [2021], Delaporte found that about half of more than 800 Ebola survivors in Guinea still reported symptoms 2 years after their illness, and one-quarter after 4 years.

On top of this, survivors have faced intense stigmatization. Many conspiracy theories swirled in the aftermath of the epidemic, including the claim that survivors had sold family members to international organizations to save themselves, says Frederic Le Marcis, a social anthropologist at the Ecole Normale Superieure of Lyon and the French Research Institute for Development, who is working in Guinea. One man, he says, was the only one to survive out of 11 family members and when he came back, no one wanted to work with him. "He was seen as someone untrustworthy." News that a survivor likely touched off the current outbreak could cause further problems for survivors, Le Marcis says: "Will they be highlighted as a source of danger? Will they be chased out of their own families and communities?"

Alpha Keita, a virologist who led the sequencing work at CERFIG, worries about stigmatization and even violence against survivors have occupied him since he first got the surprising results a week ago. One important message to the public should be that some people infected with Ebola show few symptoms, meaning people may be survivors without knowing it. "So don't stigmatize Ebola survivors -- you don't know that you are not a survivor yourself," Keita says.

Bausch calls for an educational campaign explaining that unprotected sex with an Ebola survivor may pose a risk, but casual contacts such as shaking hands and working together do not. And although there needs to be some medical monitoring of survivors, it cannot just be about testing them for Ebola virus, he says. "We need to recognize and assist with all the other challenges, physical, mental, and social, that survivors and their families face." The key, Bausch says, is to "not just treat survivors as some hot potato risk of starting another outbreak." It also presents a challenge to the country's healthcare system if every patient with fever and diarrhea has to be a considered potential Ebola case, Le Marcis says.

Fortunately, Ebola vaccines and treatments have become available in recent years. Already, several thousand contacts of the new Ebola patients, and contacts of these contacts, have been vaccinated. Healthcare workers are being immunized as well. Vaccinating survivors might even help clear latent infections, Rasmussen says. And the fact that viral samples were sequenced in Guinea this time around shows the country's scientific capabilities have improved, Delaporte says: "Seven years ago, when the epidemic started, there was no infrastructure in Guinea to be able to do this."

[As Eric Delaporte, University of Montpellier wrote, "This is clearly a new paradigm for how these outbreaks start."

Also see this 12 Mar 2021 report in STAT by Helen Branswell (https://tiny.cc/wfiutz), titled Bombshell analysis traces new Ebola outbreak to survivor of West Africa crisis. On Twitter, Branswell wrote: "It wasn't a surprise that the current DRC Ebola outbreak was a resurgence of one from 2 years ago. But news that the outbreak in Guinea links back to the 2014-2016 West African outbreak dropped like a bombshell for those who study this deadly virus."

The following 2 previously published papers, communicated by Mary Marshall, identify the occurrence of persistent infection in male survivors of Ebola:

ref: Christie A, Neatherlin JC, Nichol ST, et al. Ebola response priorities in the time of COVID-19. N Engl J Med. 2020; 383: 1202-4. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2025512

"On 10 Apr 2020, a total of 53 days after the last patient with Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been isolated and more than 23 months since the start of the 10th EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a new confirmed case was reported in the Beni health zone. This case, and the 6 that followed, brought the total to 3462 cases -- the 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak in history. Although the outbreak was declared over on 25 Jun 2020, additional cases attributable to persistently infected survivors may occur. Therefore, surveillance and rapid-response capacity should be maintained, not only for a duration equivalent to 2 incubation periods (42 days) after the last confirmed case tested negative, but also for at least 90 additional days of enhanced surveillance.

"In the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, there were at least 8 flare-ups from persistently infected survivors, which extended the required response for 11 months after the 1st declaration of Ebola-free status by the Liberian Ministry of Health. During the 10th DRC outbreak, a single relapsed case of EVD resulted in at least 74 additional infections in 13 health areas in 6 health zones, extending the need for the full response effort by several months."

The authors recommended: "new close contacts of EVD survivors should be vaccinated. The potential for sexual transmission of EVD from male survivors continues for at least 500 days after disease onset. In addition, EVD relapse has been documented. Since survivors may have different sexual or household contacts over time, their contact networks should be continually reassessed at survivor clinics. Vaccination of new close contacts of survivors would increase their level of protection and reduce potential onward transmission. Depending on vaccine availability, this effort could be narrowed to sexual contacts of male survivors with a positive PCR test."

This recommendation regarding vaccination cited above and their other recommendations not included here because they were not relevant to this particular event, are none the less important to read. See the citation URL.

ref: Diallo B, Sissoko D, Loman NJ, et al. Resurgence of Ebola virus disease in Guinea linked to a survivor with virus persistence in seminal fluid for more than 500 days. Clin Infect Dis. 2016; 63(10): 1353-6. https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciw601

"Abstract: We report on an Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivor who showed Ebola virus in seminal fluid 531 days after onset of disease. The persisting virus was sexually transmitted in February 2016, about 470 days after onset of symptoms, and caused a new cluster of EVD in Guinea and Liberia."

"We report...the longest reported period of filovirus persistence in an individual. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the persisting virus remains viable and infectious during the long-term persistence. Evidence for sexual transmission of the persisting EBOV in February 2016, about 470 days after onset of symptoms in the survivor, is compelling. The absence of other cases in Guinea around this time, the epidemiological link between the survivor and case, and the identity of strains in the survivor's seminal fluid and the acute cases strongly argue for the survivor being the source of the new infections. EBOV persistence in seminal fluid is a known phenomenon, and previous reports have also indicated that persisting virus may be sexually transmitted. However, so far the longest reported period of virus RNA persistence in semen was 284 days, and reported likely transmission events have been observed a maximum of 179 days after onset of acute illness."

The finding of long-term persistence over 5 years, with survival of infectious virus that is transmissible is a highly significant finding. It will impact how we proceed after an outbreak "ends," as it doesn't absolutely and totally end. The findings also have serious repercussions for survivors (especially male) of Ebola, who already suffered from the disease and then from the stigmas that follow them. Vaccination of survivors may help prevent persistence of virus or at least prevent transmission. It is important that this be evaluated. Education is essential so people understand the risk of sexual contact following recovery from acute infection, and take appropriate precautions to prevent virus transmission. And this transmission event highlights how important it is to maintain intensive surveillance followed by vaccination of contacts. Once again, the power of sequencing of isolates is evident. - Mod.LK
