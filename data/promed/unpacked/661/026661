A 48-year-old man with a history of good health and who has spent his life around dogs was forced to have all of his limbs amputated after contracting a rare blood infection that likely came from his own pooch. The man of West Bend, WI landed in the emergency room last month [June 2018] with what he thought was the flu, Fox 6 Now reported.

"It hit him with a vengeance," his wife, told the news outlet. "Just bruising all over him. Looked like somebody beat him up with a baseball bat."

Subsequent testing revealed that the man had contracted an infection from a bacterium identified as _Capnpcytophaga_, which is found in dog saliva. The bacterium can cause severe infections in people with weakened immune systems and is spread through bites or close contact with infected dogs.

Patients infected with the bacterium may exhibit blisters around the bite wound, redness or swelling, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, headaches and muscle and joint pain. According to the CDC, symptoms will typically appear within 3 to 5 days. Severe infections can be fatal within 72 hours after symptoms appear.

"This infection in his blood triggered a very severe response on his body," Dr. Silvia Munoz-Price, an infectious disease specialist, told Fox 6 Now. "More than 99 percent of the people that have dogs will never have this issue. It's just chance."

The man has undergone several surgeries to amputate his legs and arms. The infection caused his blood pressure to drop, and the circulation to his limbs decreased, causing those limbs to turn black. The patient's wife said that within one week, her husband's legs were gone, followed by more surgeries to remove portions of his hands, and then half of both forearms.

"Furthermore, all areas of his body and tissue were affected by the bacterium and the sepsis; the [doctors] say his nose will need extensive repairs, which means he will need plastic surgery to rebuild a new healthy nose," a post on the family's GoFundMe page said. "He is going to need several more surgeries, lots of time and his family by his side to get [through] this life-changing event."

[_Capnocytophaga canimorsus_, a Gram-negative bacillus (rod-shaped) previously classified as CDC Group Dysgonic Fermenter-2 (DF-2), is a slow-growing bacterium that requires carbon dioxide for growth. This organism has been isolated from the saliva of healthy dogs and cats as a component of the normal flora. In most (77 percent) human cases, infection with this organism is preceded by a bite or other exposure to dogs; since 1961, 200 human isolates of _C. canimorsus_ have been sent to CDC for identification http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019514.htm.

This organism causes self-limiting cellulitis following a dog or cat bite that can progress rapidly to fulminant sepsis, septic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with a case-fatality rate of 25 percent. Gangrene of the extremities, as well as gangrene of skin, the tip of the nose and ears can be a consequence of sepsis, septic shock, and DIC. Necrotizing fasciitis has been rarely described as a consequence of _C. canimorsus_ infection. Most fatal infections have occurred in persons with a history of asplenia [absence of normal spleen function], alcoholism, or hematologic malignancy. This organism is susceptible to many antimicrobials (e.g., penicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, cefoxitin, and clindamycin). Empiric treatment has been recommended for this bacterium following an animal bite in these high-risk patient populations.

No risk factors for more severe infection were stated regarding this case but such severe infections have been reported in patients with what appeared to be normal immune systems. - Mod.LL
