A case of autochthonous malaria [see moderator comment below] was reported
yesterday [12 Nov 2010] at the Regional Health Agency (LRA) Alsace.

This patient was infected a month ago by mosquitoes that escaped from a
parcel of food from Cameroon.

The 1st clinical features appeared 15 days later, and the patient was
examined on Wednesday [10 Nov 2010] at the University Hospital of
Strasbourg, where the diagnosis was made. The patient is well. He lives in
the district of Neudorf, Strasbourg, near the airfield of the Polygon.

Other mosquitoes escaped and were able to bite other people near his home,
although the risk is very low. That is why the LRA asks those involved to
consider a diagnosis of malaria based on the 3 phases of symptomatic
illness: chills, headache, vomiting; fever of rapid ascent (40 C) with
malaise; profuse sweats accompanied by a drop in temperature and fatigue.

People with an unexplained fever, especially if they reside in the area of
the airfield Polygon, must also have their diagnosis confirmed by a thick
smear.

[This case cannot be called "autochthonous malaria", which would require
the mosquitoes to have been infected from a malaria-infected person in
France. Rather, this case is equivalent to what is called "airport
malaria", where mosquitoes infected in a malaria-endemic country escape,
for instance, from an airplane, and in this case a parcel, and bite a
person close by. - Mod.EP
