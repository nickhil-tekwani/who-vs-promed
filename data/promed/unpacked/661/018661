Democratic Republic of Congo health department chief Kininga Mba said
Monday that in the Ituri region, in the east, around 300 cases of
bubonic plague have been recorded this year.
Ituri is in the hands of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD)
splinter group.

are no implications for international travel, since no tourists enter
this war-torn area. - Mod.JW
