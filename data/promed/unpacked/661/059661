[1] Pakistan, 1 new case KP (Bannu): media / End Polio Pakistan

An 11-month old girl in Bannu [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] fell prey to polio on [Sat 1 Jun 2019], taking Pakistan's polio case count to 21 so far this year [2019].

Of the 21 confirmed cases in Pakistan, 11 have been reported from Bannu division (7 from district Bannu and 4 from district North Waziristan), informs a press statement issued by the National Emergency Operation Centre.

The latest victim is a resident of Sedgai, UC Takhti Khel, tehsil sub-division Wazir, district Bannu. She has zero history of routine immunisation but is reported to have had 7 doses of oral polio vaccine during the sub-national immunisation days; this information is currently being investigated.

According to the mother, the child was alright when she developed fever. Initial weakness in both lower limbs was followed by the upper limbs also being subsequently affected due to rapid progression of paralysis. The child belongs to a poor family with no history of travel. She had had her last dose of oral polio vaccine on [24 Apr 2019] before onset of symptoms.

"Parents are requested not to believe in fake propaganda against polio vaccine and to get their children immunised in each campaign," the PM's Focal Person on Polio Babar Bin Atta stated, adding that a special polio campaign has been scheduled in Bannu division immediately after Eid [Eid ul-Fitr is the ending of the Ramadan fasting month].

"Technical experts are of the view that if poliovirus circulation was not controlled, it will soon engulf the neighbouring divisions as well," added Babar, who has startlingly predicted that Pakistan will close 2019 with more than 50 cases.

[As stated in the media report above, with the confirmation of this current case, the number of cases of polio attributable to WPV1 infection in Pakistan since 1 Jan 2019 is now 21, with 7 of the cases having been reported from Bannu district. This case has been posted on the official End Polio Pakistan website as well (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces, and http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019.)

As for the prediction of more than 50 cases, only time will tell. The challenge here are the many facets of the antivaccination movements; some politically motivated, some part of the global antivaccination movement. If the country will be able to counterbalance the antivaccination movements, transmission of the WPV1 can be interrupted before there are 50 cases.

Sewage samples collected from gutters of 11 sampling sites in the metropolis have confirmed prevalence of polio virus in Karachi.

The World Health Organization (WHO) had collected samples in Karachi to assess prevalence of the crippling virus in the city. According to sources, the samples were collected from gutters in Karachi during the period from [5 Apr to 16 May 2019].

The WHO gathered samples from 11 localities in the city to examine the situation of polio virus.

The samples were collected from sampling sites of Hijrat colony, Machhar colony, Khameso Goth, Rashid Minhas Road, Korangi, Bakhtawar village Landhi, Haji Mureed Goth, Sohrab Goth, Mohammad Khan colony, Orangi Nallah, Orangi colony, and PIDC colony.

The samples collected from all areas confirmed presence of the polio virus in sewage water, sources further said.

A 6-month-old child tested positive for the polio virus recently, raising the total number of reported cases of the crippling disease in Karachi this year [2019] to 2, the 3rd case in Sindh province and the 17th case [now there are 21 cases, see above] of the country in the current year [2019] .

The extensive environmental surveillance established by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme in previous months detected the polio virus in sewage of 12 cities.

According to result shared by the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), the presence of virus was confirmed in sewage samples collected in March 2019 from cities of Peshawar, Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi, Mardan, Bannu, Waziristan, Hyderabad, Kambar, and Sukkur.

[The 6-month-old child is most likely the case reported in Poliomyelitis update (37): Pakistan, Nigeria 20190523.6484392, with date of onset of paralysis 29 Apr 2019.

Reviewing the weekly global reports from the GPEI (Global Polio Eradication Initiative, just in the month of May 2019, there were reports of 12 positive environmental samples from Karachi in Sindh province, supporting this media report. It's important to highlight that while the most recent case reported from Karachi had date of onset of paralysis at the end of April 2019, there are positive environmental samples from 11 different locations in the city, most likely not all related to the one reported case but representing continued transmission in the city.

Karachi is located on the Arabian Sea, in Sindh province Pakistan. It is the largest city in Pakistan population wise, with an estimated population of almost 16.62 million in 2016 (http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/karachi-population/).

[3] Nigeria: military aiding in polio vaccination - media
Date: Mon 3 Jun 2019

The Nigeria army will henceforth conduct polio vaccination in locations in Borno state made inaccessible to health workers by the Boko Haram insurgency, the Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai, has said.

This decision was taken as the world looks up to Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa to do the needful for the eradication of poliomyelitis in the world. It is expected that if no new case of polio virus is detected in Nigeria by August [2019], Africa will attain the wild polio eradication goal, thereby making the entire world polio-free. But for the 2016 outbreak of polio virus in Borno state, Africa would have long ago celebrated the kicking out of poliomyelitis in its continent.

With Boko Haram holding several territories in the state and making health workers unable to get the polio vaccine to children in those community, it appeared that the August 2019 deadline may not be realised unless something extraordinary is done. It is against the background that Nigeria looks up to its military to help Africa realise that goal.

To this end, Mr Buratai on [14 May 2019] re-inaugurated what he called The Theatre Command Buratai Initiative Task Force (TCBITF). The task force was set up to help eradicate polio in Borno state. It could be recalled that the BITF was in 2016 inaugurated but its activities later went down.

According to the chief of army staff, "Nigeria being one of the 3 countries in the world, with Borno as the only state with the last known case of wild polio virus," warranted the establishment of the BITF. Mr Buratai, a lieutenant-general, spoke in a keynote address at the opening of sensitisation training for soldiers on polio eradication. The programme on Saturday [1 Jun 2019] was organised by the Nigerian army in collaboration with the Borno State Primary Health Development Agency and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The army chief said in the last 3 years, the initiative has reached many insecure communities with the oral polio vaccine, thereby enhancing the progress in polio interruption in the northeast. Despite that achievement, Mr Buratai, who was represented by the Theatre Commander of Operation Lafiya Dole, Benson Akinroluyo, said "there still remain areas where children were not reached with the vaccine due to the insurgency by the Boko Haram terrorists." The National Primary Healthcare Commission [NPHC] on [14 May 2019] urged the army to step up the activities of the BITF in the unreached areas "in order to deescalate the risk of polio transmission.

In response, Mr Buratai instructed that a task force be set up at the Headquarters of the Theatre Command and replicated in all the sectors, brigades and units level across the theatre.

"This is to ensure deep penetration of all settlements which were hitherto inaccessible are reached within three months as against 6 months proposed by the NPHC," said the Theatre Commander. With this development, Mr Akinroluyo said the Theatre Commander BITF becomes the central coordinating task for the polio eradication in Northeast Nigeria. Headed by Augustine Omogbethai, the commander 7 Division medical services and hospital, the BITF is charged to liaise and collaborate with the Borno state PHCDA [Primary Healthcare Development Agency], to ensure the inaccessible settlements are reached, and also collate the implementation sectors' reports.

Mr Akinrolyo said the task forces at the Brigade, units, divisional, brigade, and battalion levels, are to be headed by the respective medical commanders with the support of their medical personnel and teams from the state and local government areas. He said the idea is to ensure prompt and effective administration of polio vaccines to the unreached settlements.

Premium Times gathered that since [14 May 2019] when the task force was set up in Maiduguri, the BITF has mapped out its strategies which include clustering of the theatre environment into 6 zones, establishment of 4 levels of engagements to get the vaccines to the unreached settlements and further composition of the BITF at formations and unit levels.

The Theatre commander said he is optimistic that the sensitisation programmed for soldiers on polio will add impetus to the drive for the eradication of polio in Nigeria. Earlier, the Executive Director, Borno state PHCDA, Sule Mele, said it was as a result of the commitments of the theatre Command that the state was able to achieve 32 months without any case of wild polio outbreak. Mr Mele said about 37 per cent of the Borno state unreached settlements is still inaccessible due to the activities of the Boko Haram.

"We've also been able to reach 63 per cent of our inaccessible settlements with life-saving oral polio vaccines," he said. "Our civilian vaccination teams were able to visit inaccessible settlements due to the improved security situation in the state. Despite the successes; there is still more work to be done." According to him, there are still an estimated 60 484 unreached children trapped in 2622 settlements in the state. "We need to reach these children and communities before October this year [2019]."

Commending the Chief of Army staff for reinvigorating the BITF, Mr Mele said his directives would enable Nigeria to reach the children in those isolated communities by August [2019]. He said "the country and Africa are looking up to the military to access these settlements to achieve polio-free certification.

Head of the BITF, Mr Omogbethai said the task before him and his men is very clear. "The training seminar is to equip the military officers who will be in the forefront of the final administration of polio vaccines in unreached locations with the adequate knowledge and technicalities of administering the vaccine," said Mr Omogbethai, a medical doctor. "The officers being trained will further down step the knowledge gained at their various units and it is so designed so that we can get this done with within three months."

[That 37 per cent of the population of Borno lives in areas that are still inaccessible due to the civil unrest or, better put, that approximately 60 484 children have not had access to vaccinations, is a sobering reminder of the challenges facing Nigeria. The susceptible population is large enough to support transmission of the polio virus, and if these settlements have been inaccessible, it is possible there is continued circulation of the WPV ongoing but as yet undetected. Hopefully the teams that will be entering the area will also be trained to identify AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases and be equipped to collect adequate specimens.
