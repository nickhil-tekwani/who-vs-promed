Advances in modern science has made the job of post exposure prophylaxis
(PEP) much easier to prevent rabies. Till a few years back when safe and
potent tissue culture vaccines were not available and one had to depend
upon nervous tissue derived vaccines with prolonged course (>14 injections
) of huge amounts (5-10 ml) causing not only pain but associated with
severe, and at times, life threatening neurological complications, the
treating physician (and even the potential vaccinee) used to wonder to
vaccinate or not. Many a times it was difficult to decide which was
heavier: the risk of administering the treatment or withholding it.
Chances of getting hydrophobia after being bitten by a known rabid animal
has never exceeded 20%.
We have now reached the other extreme. Availability of safe and potent
(patient-friendly painless) vaccines have now made patients DEMAND vaccine
even in the absence of any evidence of transcutaneous transmission of
rabies virus.
There is a great need for educating the medical professionals as well as
general community about the proper use of PEP. Dogs may be a major
reservoir of this disease in developing countries like India and Nepal,
other animals such as cats, wolf, mongoose and cattle are also known to
transmit this dreadful infection. Our experience shows that in most parts
of India about 95% mortality and morbidity associated with rabies are due
to dog bites. The remaining 5% is due to other animals (the percent points
may look small but must be viewed in the background of almost 1 million
people who get PEP every year in India).
