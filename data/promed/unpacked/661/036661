Yesterday [Fri, 17 Aug 2007], Hefei Center for Animal Disease
Prevention and Control said that bovine epizootic fever [see
commentary] of dairy cows -- which occurred at the beginning of this
month [August 2007] in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other areas -- has now
spread to Nanjing [Jiangsu province], as well as Ma'anshan and other
parts of Anhui [province]. As a result, this Center and Hefei Dairy
Association are advising all dairy farmers to pay close attention to
the epizootic and take early precautions.
Bovine epizootic fever of dairy cows is an epizootic disease, which
is a relatively serious threat to dairy production. It does not harm
people and other animals. The disease can cause a sharp reduction in
dairy cow milk volume, miscarriage, and paralysis. Once infected,
morbidity in a farm's herd can reach 80 percent.
Experts say that dairy cow farms (households) should implement
separation and environmental disinfection; when necessary, adopt
emergency immunization, and as soon as clinical cases appear, carry
out timely symptomatic treatment.

[Bovine epizootic fever is one of the names given to the viral
disease generally known as bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), 1st
described in South Africa in 1906. The disease is now known to exist
in a broad belt of tropical, subtropical, and temperate countries in
Africa, Asia, and Australia. Other names include three-day sickness,
three-day stiff sickness, and dragon boat disease. BEF is known to be
endemic in China. The disease has not been recorded in Europe or the Americas.
The prevalence, extent, and severity of the disease vary from year to
year, and epidemics occur periodically. During epidemics, onset is
rapid; many animals are affected within days or 2-3 weeks. BEF is
most prevalent in the wet season in the tropics and in summer to
early autumn in the subtropics or temperate regions (when conditions
favor multiplication of biting arthropods); it disappears abruptly in
winter. Morbidity may be as high as 80 percent; overall mortality is
usually 1-2 percent, although it is higher in well-conditioned cattle
(10-20 percent).
Signs, which occur suddenly and vary in severity, include biphasic or
polyphasic fever, shivering, inappetence, lacrimation, serous nasal
discharge, drooling, dyspnea, atony of forestomachs, depression,
stiffness and lameness, and a sudden decrease in milk yield. Affected
cattle may become recumbent and paralyzed for 8 hours to one week and
longer. Lesions include polyserositis affecting joint, pleural, and
peritoneal surfaces; some lung edema; and atelectasis. After
recovery, milk production often fails to return to normal levels
until the next lactation. Abortion, with total loss of the season's
lactation, occurs in about 5 percent of cows pregnant for 8-9 months.
Bulls, other heavy cattle, and heavily producing dairy cows are the
most severely affected, but spontaneous recovery still usually occurs
within a few days. More insidious losses may result from decreased
muscle mass and lowered fertility in bulls.
Diagnosis is based almost entirely on clinical signs in an epidemic.
Confirmation is by serology, rarely by virus isolation. All clinical
cases have a neutrophilia with band forms, although this is not
pathognomonic. Isolated viruses are identified by neutralization
tests using specific ephemeral fever virus antisera and by ELISA
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) using specific monoclonal
antibodies. A 4-fold rise in antibodies confirms infection. The
neutralization test and the blocking ELISA are recommended and give
similar results.
In Australia, which has experienced seasonal outbreaks of BEF since
1936, the disease is not subject to regulatory control, although
virus activity is monitored as part of the National Arbovirus
Monitoring Program.
The virus is endemic in northern Australia and spreads south when
climatic conditions are suitable for spread and survival of the
vectors. Epidemics tend to occur only every few years, as the level
of immunity in the population from previous epidemics declines,
providing a susceptible population. Australian, South African, and
Japanese vaccines are commercially available. Live-attenuated
vaccines seem to be effective but should be used only in endemic
areas. Egypt produces an inactivated vaccine (see
<http://apps.cfsph.iastate.edu/Vaccines/disease_list.php?diseaseID=10>).
BEF has been reported to be increasingly active in several
Middle-Eastern countries since the early 1990's; in Israel, the
mortality rate in 1990 was 3 percent and in 1999 almost 4 percent in
affected dairy herds. The average mortality or emergency-slaughter
rates in such herds was 0.4 percent for calves (up to one year old)
and 4.4 percent for cows in production. Milk production losses were
estimated as 380 kg per milking cow in affected herds.

BEF deserves enhanced attention, having -- like other arthropod-borne
viral diseases -- the potential of spreading into virgin areas, which
seem increasingly receptive. - Mod.AS]
