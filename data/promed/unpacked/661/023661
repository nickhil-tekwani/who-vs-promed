How one death, sick passengers led to fears of pandemic
-------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian was rolling through Northern Ontario early Friday [9 May
2008] morning when a passenger began to have trouble breathing. A
crew member gave her oxygen, but by the time a retired doctor from
Britain sitting in the same car went to her side, she was already
unconscious. Within minutes, the 60-year-old woman -- who boarded
the Via Rail train 2 days earlier in Jasper, Alberta, and was in good
spirits the night before -- was dead, leaving passengers and crew
members in shock.

It was the beginning of a dramatic day in which 6 more passengers
fell ill, seemingly all at once, and the train, with its 264
passengers and 30 crew, was placed under quarantine. Health officials
from across Canada were in a high state of anxiety amid fears of an
outbreak of an infectious disease, and, along with emergency
services, broke into their planned responses. David Butler-Jones,
Canada's chief public health officer, headed to an emergency
operations centre in Ottawa to communicate with counterparts at
provincial and local health authorities from British Columbia to
Ontario -- every province through which the train travelled on its
journey from Vancouver to its final destination, Toronto.

By late Friday afternoon [9 May 2008], it became apparent that there
was no infectious disease. Neither did there appear to be any
connection between the sudden death of one woman, the airlifting of
another to a nearby hospital and the 5 tourists from Australia with
flu-like symptoms who were placed in isolation on the train to
contain the potential spread of disease.

David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health,
described the fate of the 7 passengers as a series of unfortunate and
unrelated health events. "There is no evidence to support an outbreak
of infectious disease on the train," a visibly relieved Dr. Williams
declared at a news conference in Toronto.

The drama began around 8:30 (ET) Friday morning, when the
unidentified woman took ill as the train was approaching Foleyet, a
sleepy hamlet 100 kilometres [62 miles] from Timmins. Shortly after,
crew members notified the Sudbury District Health Unit of an unusual
event on the Canadian -- one woman dead and 6 others ill. People in
Foleyet realized something unusual was happening when they saw that
the train was stopped at the station around 9 a.m., said a local
resident. OPP cruisers, some with sirens turned on, arrived and
cordoned off the local rail yard, she said. Residents saw 4 or 5
ambulances show up. A medical helicopter landed nearby and airlifted
a female passenger away. Medical personnel donned masks and white
protective suits before heading to the train.

A travelling companion of the woman who died was airlifted to a
hospital in Timmins after she began suffering from shortness of
breath. She does not show any sign of a communicable disease and is
now in stable condition, Dr. Williams said.

The visitors from Australia have a variety of respiratory illnesses
and did not feel well when they boarded the train in Jasper, Dr.
Williams said. One of them had seen a doctor before boarding the
train, he added. A helicopter in Foleyet was used to transport swabs
from the 5 Australians to a laboratory in Timmins.

The rest of the passengers could not leave the train while it was
under quarantine. At least one passenger donned a surgical mask, but
most remained calm and stared out the windows at the landscape, the
tall jack pines and birch trees that encircle the cluster of modest
aluminum-sided homes of the isolated community.

By the evening, things began returning to normal when the train
finally left the station. It was scheduled to arrive in Toronto early
Saturday morning [10 May 2008]. Public officials expressed cautious
satisfaction at the apparent readiness of plans that have been honed
in anticipation of a possible global influenza pandemic, and in light
of the experience with SARS, the respiratory disease whose 2003
outbreak killed 44 people in Canada. "There was a high degree of
awareness and suspicion, which I think post-SARS we might call the
new normal," said Perry Kendall, provincial health officer for
British Columbia, "and there was evidence of a really good
communication network.

[An impressive response to what might have been a serious incident.
The authorities are to be congratulated for their rapid response to a
potentially serious incident, and the passengers commended for their
forbearance.
