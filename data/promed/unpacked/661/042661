Health officials try to determine scope of _E. coli_ outbreak
-----------------------------
GREELEY, Colo. - Health officials are conducting tests in at least 8
states, including Iowa, to determine whether more people have been exposed
to a batch of _E. coli_-tainted beef processed at the ConAgra plant here.
The contaminated beef was distributed in 21 states. As of 17 Jul 2002, the
meat had been positively linked to 19 cases of _E. coli_, 17 in Colorado, 1
in South Dakota and a new case in Wyoming. Testing was under way in those
states and 5 others as public health officials tried to establish the scope
of the outbreak.
"They are still going through a lot of samples," said K.D. Hoskins of the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where work was
under way to compare various cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 that have been
reported in recent weeks and trace their origins.
The July 17 acknowledgment of the breadth of the distribution of the
ConAgra meat came more than 2 weeks after the company recalled 354 200
pounds of ground beef and nearly a month after a positive _E. coli_ test at
a Denver packing house raised the first sign of trouble.
In addition to the pending tests in Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota,
scientists were looking at cases in Alabama, Virginia, Michigan, Iowa and
Arizona. Determining exactly how many cases were being investigated was
unknown Wednesday because health officers in several states would not
disclose specific numbers.
The ConAgra ground beef was processed 31 May 2002 and sold to wholesalers
and other customers.

[This posting is, in fact, an expansion of a 12 Jul 2002 posting
(20020712.4733) in which the ConAgra ground beef recall was localized to
Colorado. It is now much more widespread (Wyoming and South Dakota) and
may well involve other states in the Rocky Mountain and Midwestern areas of
the US. - Mod.LL].
