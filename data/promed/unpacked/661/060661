A North Carolina dog died from coronavirus [COVID-19] complications last week [week of 3 Aug 2020], state health officials said Tuesday [11 Aug 2020].

The dog's owner took it to a veterinary hospital, reporting breathing problems, and told staff it had earlier tested positive for the coronavirus and recovered. A test for the dog came back positive at the vet's office, according to a local CBS affiliate.

Health officials noted there is no evidence animal-to-human transmission of the virus is a major risk.

"There is no indication at this time dogs can transmit the virus to other animals, so there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare," State Veterinarian Doug Meckes said.

"Based on the information available, the risk of animals spreading the virus to people is considered to be low," said Carl Williams, State Public Health Veterinarian.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended any pet owners who suspect the virus contact a veterinarian.

The 1st dog to test positive for the virus in the US died on Staten Island, New York, in late July [2020]. The dog, a German shepherd, was also believed to have had lymphoma.

Two cats also tested positive for the virus last week, according to researchers at Texas A&M. Researchers said study results indicated transmission is possible in higher-risk environments.

"By actively screening pets who may not be symptomatic and who are living with people who have tested positive for COVID-19, Dr Hamer's project provides important new information about the transmission pathways of the virus," interim Dean John August said in a statement.

[There is currently no evidence pets can transmit this disease to humans but there seems to be growing anecdotal evidence of people passing it (and perhaps other diseases) to their pets. If you are ill, in any way, a cold, the flu, a sinus infection, a gastric infection, be aware your pets can also catch the illness from you. Be careful to wash your hands before touching your animals, especially a cat as their grooming habits are slightly different. Do not kiss your pet or breathe into their face or allow them to lick your face or unwashed hands.

Be cautious to keep their food/water bowls very clean. Wash and dry them daily, just as you would your own dishes. This also helps your pet stay healthy.

There is little information about the dog in this report. We do not know if there were underlying factors in the death of this animal. - Mod.TG
