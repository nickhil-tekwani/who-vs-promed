Epidemic of hemolytic septicemia (pasteurellosis) in the Irkutsk region
-----------------------------------------------
Several thousand rabbits have died during the past month in the Irkutsk
region. The infection has affected the whole region. Veterinarians have
been concerned about public health in the Irkutsk region and advised
consumers against purchasing meat from unregulated markets.
Svetlana Golenko maintains a rabbit farm, which houses more than 500
animals. Her farm is one of the few in the Irkutsk region which remained
unaffected by the outbreak. Svetlana confirmed that there had been massive
mortality among rabbits in the region. The animals had been struck by
hemolytic septicemia [pasteurellosis - Mod.NP]. Animals succumb to the
disease within a period of a few hours.
Farms in Novosibirsk have been affected as well; according to Svetlana
Golenko, the affected farms had not been vaccinated due to delayed supply
of the vaccine.
Veterinarians in the region have expressed a different view. In their
opinion, the price of a protective dose (10 rubles [USD 0.40] per ampoule,
sufficient for the vaccination of 10 rabbits) is more than many farmers can
afford. As a result, thousands of animals have been lost.

[The Irkutsk region is located in the south of Eastern Siberia, in
Pribaikalye. The region comprises 7679 sq. km (4.6 percent of all Russian
territory; an area surface which could contain Italy, Denmark, Belgium,
Great Britain, Portugal and Holland combined), with 33 districts and 22
cities. - Mod.NP]
[Pasteurellosis is rather common in domestic rabbits. It is highly
contagious and is transmitted primarily by direct contact, although aerosol
transmission may also occur. The etiologic agent is _Pasteurella
multocida_. Clinical symptoms include rhinitis, pneumonia, abscesses,
reproductive tract infections, torticollis, and septicemia. This is not a
zoonotic disease.
A fatal hemorrhagic disease in rabbits can also be caused by a virus,
namely the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, a calicivirus. Similarly, this
is not a zoonosis. It would help to know whether RHD virus has been
excluded by laboratory investigations in Irkutsk. - Mod.AS]
