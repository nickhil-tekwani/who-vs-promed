A lion in a Hungarian zoo died after it ate beef infected with the deadly anthrax disease identified in a nearby farm in the eastern region of the country, national news agency MTI reported on Thursday [10 Apr 2014]. Citing the local veterinary authority, MTI said the infected meat came from the village of Esztar [in Hajdu-Bihar county]. It went to the zoo in the city of Debrecen.

Two lions, 2 leopards, and a tiger ate from the infected meat, Istvan Tischler, director of the local veterinary authority told MTI. One of the lions died, while the rest of the animals are being monitored after receiving preventive medicine. He said the farm, where the infected cow had been identified, had been placed under quarantine and the pigs and dogs got preventive medicine.

Tischler told MTI that around 70 animals in the zoo, which could be susceptible to the infection, would have to be vaccinated. The zoo has been closed to visitors temporarily. The disease would not spread from human to human, from one animal to another, or from infected animals to humans, he said.

[Lions are susceptible and not infrequently theirs is an oropharyngeal infection. Anthrax is truly sporadic in Hungary with just a few scattered outbreaks; in cattle in 2010 (one outbreak, 2 affected) and 2012 (2 outbreaks, 9 affected); 1 sheep outbreak in 2009 with 9 affected; and no humans since 2000, when 2 were affected. This infrequency can result in mistaken diagnoses and regrettable behaviour.

Zoo outbreaks routinely follow from unknowingly buying an infected carcass to feed to the carnivores. As the disease is not contagious it would not be necessary to vaccinate any other animals except for those exposed to this carcass meat and bones. And don't skin any dead animals please, however attractive that lion hide might be. This would expose your workers to cutaneous anthrax and the hide, when dry, will shed spores all over. On the index farm it would be wise to vaccinate the livestock, not just the farm pigs and dogs. Reading between the lines, if the pigs and dogs were exposed there would have been multiple bovine deaths, which the pigs and dogs had been helping themselves to.
