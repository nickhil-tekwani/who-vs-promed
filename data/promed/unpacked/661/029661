_Legionella_ from guests of Welsh hotel indistinguishable from humidifier
isolates Molecular typing has shown that isolates of _Legionella
pneumophila_ serogroup 1 from two patients who died from legionnaires'
disease were indistinguishable from isolates from a food display humidifier
in the dining room of a hotel visited by the patients.
Five cases of legionnaires' disease (two fatal) visited the same hotel in
South Wales within the incubation period of their disease - one in July
1999, two in December 1999, and two in January 2000(1). Three had lunch at
the hotel, one used the swimming pool, and one had a meal and stayed
overnight. All water systems in the hotel, and local cooling towers were
investigated, but suspicion focused on a food display unit with a
humidifier, in the main dining room.
The refrigerated display unit for cold buffet food used a humidifier to
produce a mist over the food, to keep it looking fresh. Initial testing
failed to isolate _Legionella_ from the unit, whose three antibacterial
filters were missing and whose ultraviolet lamp did not work when examined.
Residual water obtained from the humidifier's sonification unit and
associated tubing after the unit was dismantled yielded _Legionella
pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Isolates from residual water in the sonification
unit and from two patients subtyped by the Respiratory and Systemic
Infection Laboratory at the PHLS Central Public Health Laboratory are
indistinguishable by mAb subgrouping and amplified fragment length
polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Epidemiological investigation has revealed no
further cases.
Machines that produce an aerosol or mist for refrigerated food cabinets,
air conditioning systems, or industrial use have been used widely in the
United Kingdom for about 12 years. Maintenance guidelines usually include
antibacterial treatment, frequent testing of the ultraviolet lamp, and
sampling for _Legionella_ and coliforms every six months. This outbreak,
and an earlier outbreak in the United States (2), show that humidifiers may
act as a vehicle for _Legionella_ transmission. Such equipment must be
properly installed and maintained.
Please contact CDSC Wales if you are aware of further cases who have
travelled to South Wales or who have been exposed to humidifiers in similar
settings (contacts: Susan Hahne, tel: 029 2052 1997, email:
