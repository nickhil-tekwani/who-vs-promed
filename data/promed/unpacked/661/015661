West Nile virus was first isolated in Camargue, in the Rhone delta, south
of France, in Sep 1964 from _Culex modestus_ mosquitoes and 2 entomologists
on field work. It was then recovered from the same mosquito species in Jul
1965 and [from a horse in Sep 1965 (Hannoun C et al, CR Acad Sc Paris,
1964, 259, 4170-4172).
Previous evidence of West Nile circulation was suspected during the summer
1962, in the same area when meningoencephalitis were [was recorded in
horses. Among a group of 500 horses, 50 animals were sick (morbidity 10%)
with a fatality rate of 25-30%. Most of the cases were reported from
mid-Aug to mid-Sep 1962. Antibodies to West Nile were confirmed in
1963-1964 by Neutralization Test in 12 out of 47 horses. A retrospective
study on sick patients from the area during this summer 1962 showed
antibodies to Group B arboviruses in several individuals. Among these, a
young girl in Arles with febrile illness and meningitis showed a
seroconversion for Group B arboviruses (Joubert L et al, Ann Inst Pasteur,
1970, 118: 239-247).
Serological surveys in horses and humans during the period 1975-1980 did
not show evidence of recent circulation of the virus in this region (Rollin
PE et al, Med Mal Infect, 1982, 77-80)
Summer 2000
2 serum specimens from horses for WN diagnosis arrived in the laboratory on
4 Sep 2000. Suspicion of West Nile infection (detection of WN IgG) was
obtained on 5 Sep 2000. On 8 Sep 2000, confirmation was obtained by
detection of specific IgM in sera and West Nile virus detection by RT-PCR
from one brain specimen sent for rabies diagnosis. More samples are
expected and on process.
The "Entente Inter Departementale pour la Demoustication" performed a first
programme of eradication of mosquitoes on 9 Sep 2000 in Lansargues
(Herault) where these 2 confirmed cases were located.
About 20 horses presented [with encephalitis in the Herault and Gard
departments from the beginning of Aug 2000 according to retrospective
investigation. Most of them died (euthanized).
