Ford plant worker dies from Legionnaires' disease
-------------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease among workers at a
Ford Motor Co. rose to 4 after it was confirmed that a worker who died last
week had the disease, officials said Thursday.
The Cleveland Casting Plant, which employs 2500, was closed Wednesday night
at least through the weekend after the third case was confirmed. The plant
hasn't been confirmed as the source of the disease, which is caused by
water-borne bacteria.
A 61 year-old, 27-year Ford employee, died 9 Mar 2001 with pneumonia
symptoms. Cuyahoga County Health Commissioner Timothy Horgan said test
results on [the deceased were positive for the bacteria that cause
Legionnaires' disease.
Two of the sick workers were still hospitalized Thursday and the third was
being treated at home, said Willie Hubbard, president of United Auto
Workers Local 1250. Health officials also were double-checking 10 cases of
pneumonia among workers. Health investigators Thursday took water samples
from shower stalls, drinking fountains, air-conditioning units and other
areas at the plant to determine if the bacteria exist there.
It could take 5 to 10 days to match any bacteria found in the water with
the strain that may have been contracted by the sick workers. There are
numerous varieties of the disease. Legionnaires' disease is a form of
pneumonia that is spread through inhalation of mist from contaminated
water. It does not spread from person to person. It was identified at a
1976 American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Symptoms include high
fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Roman Krygier, Ford vice president of powertrain operations, expressed the
company's sympathy to [the family [of the deceased. "Our company is
taking extraordinary measures to deal with this issue," Krygier said in a
prepared statement Thursday night. "We are cooperating with all public
health authorities. Nothing is more important to us than the safety and
welfare of our employees." Ford spokesman Ed Miller said there was no
evidence of any health risk to employees working at 3 adjacent Ford plants.
Water samples will be taken at the other plants after the casting plant is
checked.
Ford said the shutdown was not expected to impact assembly plants for at
least the next several days. The casting plant makes engine blocks and
heads and crankshafts. Hubbard said the union and the company have tried to
get out as much information as possible about the disease. He said workers
are concerned but not panicking. "If everything is in order, I'd go back,"
Sylvester Johnson, 50, of Cleveland, said across the street from the plant.
Six people died of Legionnaires' disease last year in Ohio. The state has
averaged 131 cases annually since 1994.
