Outbreak in British Columbia, Canada is not SARS - 25 Aug 2003
An outbreak of respiratory illness in an aged care facility in Canada has
now been extensively investigated for SARS, and WHO concludes the disease
is not SARS.
On 14 Aug 2003, Canadian public health officials reported to WHO that an
unidentified respiratory disease in a Surrey, British Columbia health care
facility had infected 143 residents and staff. Some initial testing
suggested the SARS coronavirus may have played a role.
Now, WHO and Canadian health authorities have gathered enough evidence to
conclude that the outbreak in British Columbia is not SARS. Analysis from
laboratories in Canada and the United States did not confirm the initial
concern that SARS had mutated into a milder disease.
2 lines of evidence have converged to dismiss the SARS concern.
Clinically, the disease itself was strikingly different from the SARS
outbreak in the spring of 2003. The features of the current outbreak
included a low case fatality, runny nose, lack of fever in most patients,
and no SARS-like changes in the lung seen on X-ray.
Now, sequencing of a portion of the virus causing the outbreak has led to
the finding that it was not the SARS coronavirus but another human
coronavirus known as OC43. This virus, which is one of the causes of the
common cold, has been associated with respiratory outbreaks in aged care
facilities in other countries.
In terms of SARS, Canada continues to be a safe destination for travellers,
and travellers from Canada pose no exceptional risk to other countries.
This outbreak has no international public health implications.

[It is important to note that we are on the upward slope of the learning
curve with respect to human coronavirus (Co-V) disease. Prior to SARS, the
coronaviruses were considered nuisance viruses (in humans) without much
clinical import -- other than for those researching a cure or vaccine for
the common cold. The veterinarians took the coronaviruses more seriously,
as they were implicated in serious illness in the veterinary world. A year
ago, an outbreak such as the one in Vancouver would have caused specimens
to be sent for influenza virus identification. Positive results would have
led to an enhancement of the influenza vaccination program; negative
results would have probably been the end of further testing, other than for
those cases of pneumonia where appropriate cultures would have be done to
identify the etiology of the pneumonia. More sophisticated virologic
testing would only have been done if an institution "in the neighborhood"
was doing research on respiratory viruses.
In the post-SARS era of heightened alert, we are performing more extensive,
sophisticated virologic testing on outbreaks of respiratory illness,
especially in the institutional setting. It is highly likely that more
viruses in the coronavirus family will be identified that will cross-react
with some of the tests currently in place for the SARS Co-V. It should be
remembered that the tests for the SARS Co-V have been around now for less
than 12 months and have been predominantly used on specimens from
individuals meeting the clinical epidemiologic definition of SARS -- with
additional uncontrolled studies on contacts and blood donors. This test was
not extensively tested on individuals with respiratory illnesses not
meeting the case definition for SARS, and that was not a large enough group
to tell us much about cross-reactivity, false positives, etc. - Mod.MPP]
