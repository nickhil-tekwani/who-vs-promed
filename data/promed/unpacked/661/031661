a. Introduction
---------------
The 3rd winter has passed since the emergence of the HPAI H5N1
epidemic. From the end of 2005 to the 1st quarter of 2006, the
disease spread to European and African regions. It was said that the
severe winter in Russia and Caucasus area pushed migratory birds
south and westward. More than 30 countries/area reported cases in
poultry during the 1st half of 2006, of which 23 reported this H5N1
infection for the 1st time. More than 209 million poultry have died
or been culled since January 2004 worldwide. While the number of case
reports has decreased in the European Union (EU), the reports from
Eastern Europe and Caucasus Area are increasing. As the disease
moves, biosecurity at all levels is the key to protect birds from infection.
b. Country situation
--------------------
Africa
1. Burkina Faso [as of 24 Jun 2006]:
---------------
The 1st outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in helmeted guinea fowl (_Numida
meleagris_) farmed at Le Pharaon Camp, Gampela Village, Saaba
Department, Kadiogo Province which started around 1 Mar 2006 was
reported to OIE on 3 Apr following the confirmation by the OIE/FAO
Reference Laboratory in Italy. On 19 May, outbreaks in 3 further
places were confirmed: sector 2 of Ouagadougou, the sector 20 of
Bobo-Dioulassao (south-western trade centre), and Tenado, Boulkeimde
Province in western Burkina Faso. Most of the affected birds belong
to backyard poultry farmers. On 20 May, a "quarantine zone" was
declared in Dioulasso Sore, prohibiting the entry and the exit of any
poultry, poultry products into/from the zone. Municipal police have
deployed 5 teams to control poultry transport. The control measures
taken include: stamping out and disinfection of infected premises;
movement control; checking wildlife reservoirs; and vaccination is
being considered. In Dioulasso Sore, owners of traditional breeds
will be compensated at a rate of 1000 CFA Franc per chicken (USD
1.95) and 25 CFA Franc [USD 0.04] for each destroyed egg.
2. Cameroon [as of 29 May 2006]:
-----------
An HPAI H5N1 outbreak was confirmed on 11 Mar 2006 by the Institut
Pasteur from samples taken from suspected cases found on 19 Feb 2006
in 3 households in Doualare suburb, Maroua Town, Diamare District,
Northernmost Province, about 200m from an abattoir. Clinical signs
observed were: nervous signs, stiff neck, greenish diarrhoea and
lameness. Some chickens also held in the households were not
clinically affected but culled as a part of control measures. The
control measures taken include: stamping out at the infected premises
and within a 3-km radius; disinfection of infected premises and
material; epidemiological survey; ban on the movement of birds and
poultry products and closure of all live bird markets and avian
products markets in Maroua city; active surveillance of all poultry
farms in Maroua city and nearby areas. H5N1 infection was also
confirmed on 29 March in a wild duck found dead at the lake of
Malapa, according to media.
3. Cote d'Ivoire [as of 19 Jun 2006]:
----------------
On 25 Apr 2006, suspicions of an HPAI H5N1 outbreak in poultry and a
case in wild birds were reported in Abidjan District. The official
notification was made on 3 May 2006 after confirmation by the OIE/FAO
reference laboratory in Padova, Italy. As of 7 Jun 2006, the disease
has been confirmed in several communes of Abidjan district in the
smallholder sector. The control measures taken include: market
closure and stamping out at 2 bird markets in Abidjan with
compensation; disinfection in bird markets and slaughter points;
movement control inside the country; surveillance; start of public
awareness and information campaign for consumers, poultry merchants
and farmers; reinforcement of biosecurity measures around modern
poultry farms. A 24-hour hotline has been established to report
suspected cases, and 10 mobile investigation teams consisting of a
veterinarian, 2 technicians and laboratory staff will investigate any
suspected cases. Vaccination of the breeding stock and layer chickens
and of all poultry in Abidjan district is under preparation. FAO has
provided PPE [personal protective equipment], diagnostic reagents,
vaccines, vaccination tools and equipment for outbreak control as
well as technical support for the country to manage the first phase
of disease control.
4. Djibouti [as of 9 Jun 2006]:
-----------
An HPAI outbreak was first suspected in Boulaos Commune, Djibouti
City on 6 Apr 2006. Of 8 samples taken from the second suspected
cases in the same area, 3 (2 chickens, 1 turkey) tested positive for
H5N1 by the US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3), Cairo. Out of
a flock of 22 poultry, 4 poultry died and the rest were culled.
Djibouti has a total of 3000 poultry in the country. The control
measures taken include: quarantine; disinfection; stamping out within
a 3-km radius of the infected households; movement control; zoning.
FAO has provided PPEs, field surveillance training and has assisted
in bio-secure culling and situation analysis. A 2-year-old girl from
Arta District tested positive for H5N1.
5. Egypt [as of 30 May 2006]:
--------
HPAI was first reported to OIE on 18 Feb 2006 in 7 of the 27
governorates. The disease has now spread to 20 governorates: Aswan,
Alexandria, Luxor, Behera, Giza, Dakahlia, Sharkia, Gharbia, Fayoum,
Cairo, Qualiubia, Menofia, Menia, Dumyat, Sohag, Quena, Kafr
Elsheikh, Beni Suef, Assiut, Ismailia. The latest case was reported
on a farm in Beni Mazar District, Al Minia Governorate, on 10 Jun
2006. All fowl at the site were culled, all persons involved were
tested and area around the site was sanitized. More than 30 million
birds have been culled. The control measures taken include:
quarantine till confirmation; stamping out and disinfection; and
movement control. Initially chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys were
vaccinated with H5N1 inactivated vaccine. An H5N2 inactivated vaccine
has been permitted and is now being used. To date, between 50 and 60
million combined doses of H5N1 and H5N2 inactivated vaccines have
been imported into Egypt. While large commercial farms should cover
the cost for the vaccines, village poultry are vaccinated free of
charge. Pre-slaughter flock and post-processing testing schemes to
ensure consumers receive healthy poultry have also been implemented.
Due to the shortage of chicks, movement control was relaxed in May to
issue a movement permit for healthy chicks.
A 75-year-old woman from the Al Minia Governorate who died on 18 May
tested positive for H5N1. Of the 14 human cases in Egypt, 6 have been
fatal (42.8 percent).
6. Niger [as of 2 Jun 2006]:
--------
An HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Magaria and Dan Barde, Magaria District,
Zinder Province was first reported to OIE on 28 Feb 2006 following
the confirmation by the OIE/FAO Reference Laboratory in Italy on
samples taken from ducks. The culling operation of approximately 15
000 poultry in Magaria within a 5-km radius of infected areas started
at the end of March, together with a 15-km radius surveillance of all birds.
Recently, media reported the deaths of 530 poultry in Boko Maigao
Village, Maradi Province in April from which H5N1 were confirmed.
7. Nigeria (as of 30 May 2006):
The 1st outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was confirmed on 8 Feb 2006 in
Jaji-Kaduna State of Nigeria. Since then the H5N1 strain of HPAI
virus has been confirmed in 32 local government areas (LGAs) of 13
states of Nigeria including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) by
the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) in Vom, with the
support of the OIE/FAO Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza in
Padova, Italy. The NVRI in Vom is the central reference point for
HPAI diagnosis in poultry in Nigeria.
The capacity of this laboratory for HPAI diagnostics was improved
through FAO/WHOCDC/Nigerian government support. No human case of H5N1
infection has been confirmed to date. Control measures taken include:
stamping out, disinfection and movement controls.
Vaccination of poultry as an additional control tool has not been
adopted by Nigeria, despite
advice from FAO and other international organizations. So far, 760
farms/premises have been affected and a total of 704 107 poultry have
either been culled or died from the disease. FAO is assisting Nigeria
to put in place a comprehensive compensation strategy.
8. Sudan (as of 30 May 2006):
The 1st cases in poultry flocks were reported in Gezira State on 25
Mar 2006 and in Khartoum State on 4 Apr 2006. As of 30 May, 117 680
poultry in Gezira State and 1 849 494 poultry in Khartoum State have
died/been culled.
The control measures taken include: quarantine; stamping out and
disinfection of infected premises; bio-security measures; and
movement control between affected and non-affected states;
vaccination will be carried out. A suspect case in River Nile State
was found to be a false alarm after thorough investigations. Sudan
introduced an import ban of all parent stocks, day-old chicks and
hatching eggs in October 2005. Due to the shortage of chicks, the
import ban on hatching eggs was lifted on 28 Nov 2005. The ban was
reinstated on 18 Feb 2006, the day Egypt declared an outbreak of HPAI.
