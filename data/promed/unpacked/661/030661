African swine fever in Tanzania
-------------------------------
Information received on 16 Apr 2004 (refers up to 13 Apr) from Dr Barnos WS
Kimaryo, director of veterinary services, Ministry of Water and Livestock
Development, Dar es Salaam:
End of previous report period: 9 Feb 2004 (see Disease Information 2004;
17[8]: 48, 20 Feb).
New outbreaks (1 at each one):
Location No. of outbreaks
Kasulu District, Kibuye village (3 deg 48 min S - 30 deg 25 min E)
Kasulu District, Muyovozi refugee camp (4 deg 22 min S - 30 deg 17 min E)
Kigoma District, Bangwe village (4 deg 54 min S - 29 deg 36 min E)
Total number of animals in the new outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
sui / 110 / 47 / 34 / ... / 29
Diagnosis: serological tests at Tanzania Animal Disease Research Institute
on 8 Apr 2004 and virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests
at Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, South Africa, on 8 Apr 2004
confirmed the presence of infection in the outbreak area.
Source of agent/origin of infection: suspected to be traded animals
introduced from a neighbouring country into refugee camps.
Control measures during reporting period:
- pig producers with affected pens have depopulated their pens and
disinfected their premises.
- the area has been quarantined and more intensive surveillance has been
instituted to verify the extent and severity of the epizootic.
- veterinary staff and government administrators throughout the country
have been put on the alert to look out for signs of this disease.
- neighbouring countries (Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and
Rwanda), African Union - Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources, Southern
African Development Community, and Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations have been notified.

[We might not usually report on African swine fever in Tanzania or other
parts of East Africa, because it is common in countries in the region such
as Mozambique and Zambia. This report is instructive, however, because it
highlights some of the complex reasons -- or as epidemiologists would say,
the "causal web" -- which eventually result in outbreaks. All too often we
forget that human political events result in animal disease because the
causal web is complex at best.
In this report, the single phrase "refugee camps" is suggestive. The
inferences are mine, so I would like to be corrected by knowledgeable
readers, should I have made unwarranted assumptions -- but with those
caveats, here is how the causal web looks to me. In 1994, the terrible
genocide in Rwanda set off a series of associated events which drove
refugees from neighboring Burundi into the usually hospitable country of
Tanzania. Over the last 10 years, people have also fled the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, so that some 10 years after these horrific,
genocidal events, there are still about 500 000 people living in refugee
camps. There are probably another 400 000 people living in Western Tanzania
in an unofficial status very similar to that of refugees. At first, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was able to meet the basic
needs of the refugees, but in 2000 programs were introduced to help people
grow their own food. Economic strains must have been considerable.
One can only imagine the various economic strategies required for the
successful support of this increasing semi-permanent population. It does
not take much imagination to see how imported pigs from neighboring
countries might eventually find their way into the country and cause
outbreaks of African swine fever in the refugee camps. So while we all know
that war, political turmoil and the resulting disruption are often blamed
for outbreaks of cholera and other diseases in refugee camps, the potential
for the introduction of new animal diseases into countries via the
economics associated with semi-permanent refugee camps is less
well-recognized by veterinarians responsible for disease control. Under
these circumstances, it is not difficult to imagine the links in the causal
web which tie politics, economics and African swine fever in Tanzania
together, leading to the introduction into Tanzania of a new disease.
We only wish the animal health authorities in Tanzania the best of luck in
fighting back the disease in a short time. - Mod.PC]
