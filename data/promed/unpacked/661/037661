WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD CONTENTS: NEW SYSTEM
**************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Fri, 26 Sep 1997
From: Jack Woodall <woodall@wadsworth.org>

Readers may have noticed that in some of these weekly issues there is
nothing specifically concerning emerging infectious diseases or current
outbreaks. So in an effort to reduce the volume on ProMED-mail, we are no
longer going to post these Contents.
However, we will be checking them for items relevant to ProMED-mail, and
will post the full text (or excerpts, if the text is very long) of such items.
We hope this will be a better way of getting the information out.
Jack
