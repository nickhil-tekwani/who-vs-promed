[1] Massachusetts (Plymouth County): skunk, canine exposure

Last October [2014], a Brockton [Plymouth County] resident faced a difficult decision when her dog was bitten by a rabid skunk 10 days after her pet's rabies vaccine had lapsed. State law is strict when it comes to rabies exposure. She either had to put the dog down or quarantine it for 3 months in a kennel, followed by 3 months of "strict confinement" at home.

Ultimately, the Scott Road resident decided to euthanize her 10-year-old Schnauzer mix.

At the time, a story about the ordeal in The Enterprise prompted experts in veterinarian science and immunology to criticize the state's rules, arguing that vaccine expirations create an "arbitrary" deadline that can force pet owners to make an unnecessary choice between expensive quarantine procedures and killing their animals.

This month [January 2015], a scientific study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association [AVMA] provides data that supports those concerns. And David Kirkpatrick, a spokesman for the association, said that the Brockton story helped frame the study's public roll-out this week.

In its press release outlining the study, the AVMA, one of the oldest and largest veterinary medical organizations in the world, describes the Brockton rabies story and goes on to say that it was "situations such as this that prompted a group of researchers to embark on a study to see whether they could make a difference and help avoid similar cases in the future."

"The general public gets to see cases like this once a year," said Dr Mike Moore, project manager for the rabies lab at the Kansas State University's College of Veterinary Medicine and the report's lead author. "We get calls like this -- if not weekly -- every other week. I was a practicing veterinarian for 23 years, and it's really, really sad for me not to be able to help these people."

According to the study -- which tested 74 dogs and 33 cats -- pets whose rabies vaccination were considered out-of-date at the time of exposure to a rabid animal responded well after receiving an immediate rabies booster and did not develop any signs of the illness.

This demonstrated to researchers that the following guidelines should be considered: immediate booster vaccination followed by observation for 45 days of dogs and cats with an out-of-date vaccination status that are exposed to rabies, as is the current practice for dogs and cats with current vaccination status.

This article focuses on a tragic event, but the results are becoming a topic of hot debate across the US. The limited study published by the American Veterinary Medical Association has some valid points. Despite the discussion the article has generated, it will likely take some one else's research to validate these enlightening findings. The validation of this work is critical and long overdue.

[2] New York (Lewis County): cow, canine and human exposure

http://www.wwnytv.com/news/local/Cow-Tests-Positive-For-Rabies-In-Lewis-County-288289981.html


Lewis County Public Health says a cow from the town of Denmark has tested positive for rabies.

According to the agency, 4 people had direct contact with the animal and all have received rabies post-exposure treatment. 2 dogs also have received a rabies booster.

One additional cow that had direct contact with the rabid cow is being placed on a 6 month quarantine so it can be observed for signs of developing rabies.

The New York State Department of Health notified Public Health about the positive test results on [31 Dec 2014]. Rabies, a viral disease affecting the central nervous system, is transmitted from infected mammals to man and is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.

People can get rabies if they are exposed to the saliva or nervous tissue of a rabid animal through a bite or scratch. Exposure can also occur if infected saliva or nervous tissue gets into a fresh wound or in mucous membranes. Fortunately, only a few human cases are reported each year in the United States.

There have been no human cases of rabies in Lewis County.

All species of livestock are susceptible to rabies with cattle and horses being the most frequently reported.

In 2014, New York state reported positive rabies cases in 5 cattle, 1 horse, and 1 sheep. Lewis County has had one other cow test positive for rabies within the last 5 years.

Lewis County Public Health encourages all livestock owners to contact their veterinarians and discuss the benefits of having their cattle and other livestock vaccinated against rabies.

Rabies vaccination of livestock is not required under New York state law.

[The article above focuses on rabies in cows. Every year people involved in the production of our milk and meat are exposed to rabies, as are the veterinarians and care takers of these animals. Skunks, raccoons, and other rabid animals pass rabies to farm animals just as easily as they do to people and pets. I have long advocated for vaccinating your production animals, especially those such as show animals and large animal pets. A vaccination is cheap insurance for protecting yourself and your family from a disease that is almost always fatal.

A dead raccoon found in North Raleigh was confirmed to have rabies, county officials said. Residents who live in the area of Ray Road and Charterhouse Drive are asked to be on alert after the animal was confirmed to have rabies [Fri 23 Jan 2015].

"We don't want to alarm residents in North Raleigh, but they should be aware of these cases and of the potential for exposure to themselves, family members and their pets," said Sue Lynn Ledford, Community Health director for Wake County. "Do not approach an animal that you don't know."

No animals or people were exposed to the rabid animal, officials said.

Wake County Animal Control officials urge the following:
- Residents should not approach animals that they do not know.
- Residents should ensure their pets have a current rabies vaccination.
- If a pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is recommended.
- Outdoor pets should be kept inside until they receive booster vaccines.
- Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs.
- Do not leave trash or food outside, unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid.
- If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight.
- If a pet comes in contact with an animal that might be rabid, contact a veterinarian immediately.

Anyone who sees an animal acting in an unusual manner is urged to call Wake County Animal Control at 919-212-7387 (PETS)

To report a bite or contact with an animal suspected of having rabies, or for additional information, call Lewis County Public Health at 376-5453.
