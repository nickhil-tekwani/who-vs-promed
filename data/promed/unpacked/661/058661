Several states have provided the TAHC with information on enhanced entry requirements they are imposing on Texas livestock (including horses) due to the recently announced VS cases in Texas. For information about these movement restrictions, contact the state or country of destination and/or visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/2014StateRestrictionsOnTX_VS.pdf.

[For a simple county distribution map of all the cases go to the TAHC website. To better understand where the specific affected counties are, got to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/texas_90.jpg.

The new outbreak in Val Verde county is not far from the index outbreak of 28 May 2014 in Kinney county. I think we can therefore hypothesise that VS virus is circulating in the white tail deer population in that area. That part of Texas has plenty of deer, but much less cattle and horses. - Mod.MHJ
