A drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis is a cause of annoyance in
the province of Southern Karelia. Although only 2 cases of the most
difficult form of the disease were encountered last year [2010], they
were extraordinarily tenacious, explained a doctor of infectious
diseases, Pekka Suomalainen, from the South Karelia Central Hospital.
In both cases, the patients' tuberculosis originated from Russia. One
of the patients remained infectious for several months before the
illness was diagnosed and the treatment commenced.

The drug-resistant form of the illness requires expensive special
treatment that lasts for several months. The drugs [that were used]
are only partially effective and have lots of side-effects. The
treatment lasts for 2 years. The "ordinary" tuberculosis, which is
more common in Finland, requires only 6 months to effect a cure.
Fortunately, the difficult form of tuberculosis is not easily
contracted.

"The risk of spread increases the more time uninfected people spend
in the same space with a person [having clinically active] disease. In
other words, the infected person's family members are at the greatest
risk," Suomalainen explained. Early diagnosis of the illness has now
been emphasized by doctors in Finland.

In Southern Karelia, special attention is now being paid to the
situation regarding the monitoring of infectious diseases in Russia,
due to the vast differences in the prevalence of infectious illnesses
across the eastern border of the EU.

The hospital district is also in the process of starting health
checks of immigrants. Health screening of asylum seekers, refugees,
and returning migrants has been organised in accordance with
instructions of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, but the
problems reside with those who arrive by other means. The challenge is
to also reach these individuals. The health checks will be performed
on a voluntary basis.

[Finland shares a long border with Russia that has shifted between
the 2 countries many times over the centuries
(<http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160531&contentlan=2&culture=en-US>).
Karelia, a region that straddles this border, is inhabited by speakers
of various Karelian dialects (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelia>).
North and South Karelia are administrative regions along the western
side of the border in southeastern Finland (for a map, see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Finland>). The Leningrad
Oblast and the Republic of Karelia are members of the Russian
Federation along the eastern side of this border. Saint Petersburg is
the administrative center of the Leningrad Oblast
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg#Government>).

The Russian Federation is one of 27 WHO-designated high
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) burden countries
(<http://www.who.int/tb_beijingmeeting/en/>). Among all incident TB
cases globally, 3.6 percent are estimated to have MDR-TB; but in 3
oblasts in the northwest part of the Russian Federation, the
proportion of MDR-TB among new TB cases was reported to be 23.8-28.3
percent
(<http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2010_3_executive_summary.pdf>).

With the collapse of the Soviet system in 1991 and the subsequent
increased travel between Finland and the St. Petersburg district of
Russia, MDR-TB was projected to become a problem in Finland
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9522429>). However, no increase
in the incidence of TB among Finnish-born people living near the
Russian border had been noted as of 2006
(<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=607>),
and the proportion of MDR-TB among all new TB cases in Finland in 2007
was 1.0 percent
(<http://apps.who.int/globalatlas/predefinedReports/TB/PDF_Files/fin.pdf>).
But, because of continued concern over the high incidence of TB and
MDR-TB in neighboring countries, Finland has been involved in
improvement in the diagnosis and management of TB in the St.
Petersburg region
(<http://www.filha.fi/in_english/activities/joint_tuberculosis_control_proje/>)
and in the Republic of Karelia
(<http://www.filha.fi/in_english/activities/fighting_tuberculosis_in_karelia/>).
