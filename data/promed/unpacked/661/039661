Panic spreads in Indian state on fatal mystery disease
------------------------------------------------------
Panic is spreading in India's northern Himachal Pradesh state after the
deaths of 10 people from a mystery disease. Doctors in the state's capital
Shimla say the condition of several other patients is also critical. Most
of the patients who were admitted to hospital complained of high fever and
severe headaches. While doctors have yet to diagnose the disease, relatives
of those affected are fearing the return of a killer plague. They are
accusing hospital authorities of negligence, saying patients are being
forced to share beds. This, they allege, has raised fears of further spread
of the disease.

Mystery fever toll rises to 10
------------------------------
With 2 more patients dying of mystery fever, the official death toll at
Indira Gandhi Medical College IGMC) has now shot up to 10. Thirty patients
are presently admitted at IGMC.
Doctors, however, say that the toll might be higher since sequential
records were not being maintained till patients started arriving in hordes.
At least 100 people have taken symptomatic treatment for mystery fever in 3
weeks. Alarmed at the rising death toll and the unabated inflow of fever
patients with varied clinical manifestations from across Himachal, clueless
doctors are now looking up to the team of National Institute of
Communicable Diseases (NICD), Delhi, team which is arriving on Thursday.
Although the visit of NICD experts last year failed to provide any leads
about the mystery disease which had claimed 13 lives, doctors hope that
NICD will conduct detailed serological examinations this time to unravel
the mystery. Meanwhile, not willing to leave anything to chance, hospital
authorities have also decided to send blood samples of infected patients to
the Central Research Institute (CRI) at Kasauli, for virological
investigations.
Speaking to TNN, senior medical superintendent Dr Hardyal Chauhan said NICD
experts would be arriving on Thursday. "We have already prepared the status
report regarding mystery fever cases for their perusal.We are also in touch
with CRI and as advised, we would be sending 2 blood samples of each
patient to them. With 7 fresh admissions in 2 days, 30 patients are
presently admitted here," he said.
Further, fearing that the ill-famed trench fever which wreaked havoc during
the World Wars, testing facilities for which are not available at IGMC,
senior doctors have also consulted from nationally-reputed private
laboratories. The cost of carrying out investigations of rickettsial
diseases including trench fever and jail fever has been quoted at over Rs
9000 each. Since testing facilities are not readily available in India,
some laboratories have said that samples would have to be sent to the USA.
When quizzed about IGMC's "over dependence" on NICD, senior doctors said
that since rickettsial fever is neither a viral nor a bacterial disease,
blood culture examination shows negative results. "As the organism is not
present in the blood stream but attaches itself with the wall of blood
vessels, isolation of causative agent is not possible through culture. Not
only do we need special media or animals on which it can be grown but also
the confirmatory tests, which are not routinely recommended, are quite
costly. We therefore have to depend on NICD. Special media if procured
would expire in 6 months and audit might raise objections," said a senior
microbiologist.

[The above newswires mention an as yet undiagnosed outbreak associated with
high fever and headache (frequently a result of high fevers or a sign of
cerebral involvement) with about 100 or more cases (only 30 are currently
in hospital) with 10 reported deaths associated with this outbreak (a case
fatality rate of either 25 per cent [10 out of 40 cases in hospital] or
about 10 per cent [10 out of about 100]). In one of the newswires typhus is
speculated as a possible etiology. (Epidemic typhus is caused by
_Rickettsia prowazekii_, can cause high fevers, headaches and rash, and can
be associated with a 10 to 20 per cent mortality if untreated).
The clinical descriptions of the cases as well as the epidemiology
(including the age distribution of cases) given in the newswires does not
permit an in-depth discussion on the differential diagnosis of potential
etiology of this outbreak. ProMED-mail would appreciate additional
information from authoritative sources on this outbreak.
In the "see also" section below, a sampling of recent postings of
undiagnosed/unexplained deaths in India is presented. In a number of cases,
initial reports were of unexplained febrile illnesses, in others
undiagnosed encephalitis, and in one case plague was suspected and
confirmed within 5 days of initial reports. A number of these
unexplained/undiagnosed outbreaks remain without definitive diagnosis (for
example, the outbreaks in Andhra Pradesh/Maharashtra of encephalitis are
presumed to be due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) as most of the cases were
children. But, according to the WHO/India outbreak update information
<http://www.whoindia.org/Happenings/Outbreak/150703JE_AP.htm>, "NICD has
tested 55 serum samples of cases and 5 of contacts by capture ELISA for IgM
antibodies to JE and found 3 samples (2 cases and 1 contact) positive
inferring recent JE infection. Also 62 serum samples were also tested for
total JE antibodies (IgM and IgG) by HAI and 8 sera had moderate titres and
3 low titres." Of note, there had been an earlier newswire report that
Chandipura virus had been identified, but further official information on
this finding is not available.
While ProMED-mail is requesting further information on this current
reported outbreak in Himachal Pradesh, ProMED-mail would also appreciate
further information on other as yet unresolved outbreaks reported to have
occurred elsewhere in India. - Mod.MPP]
