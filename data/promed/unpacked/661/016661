[3] Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak -
Update 8 24 Mar 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_24B/en/>

Advice to travelers, situation update
Travel advice
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first recognized as a new
disease in Asia in mid-February 2003. Since then, more than 450 cases, with
17 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries on 3 continents.
On 15 Mar 2003, WHO issued an emergency travel advisory, based on
information available at that time, and a preliminary case definition of
SARS. The travel advisory was intended to alert national authorities and
clinicians to potential cases of SARS and to urge travelers, including
airline crew, with symptoms suggestive of SARS to seek medical attention.
WHO continues to recommend, on the basis of currently available data, no
travel restrictions to any destination. Guidance to governments, airlines,
physicians and travelers issued on 15 Mar 2003 remains valid.

Advice for health authorities and clinicians
A more detailed clinical picture of SARS has been posted at the WHO Web
site: <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/clinical/en/>
WHO has further recommended that suspect cases be placed in isolation and
managed using strict barrier nursing practices:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/management/en/>
Drawing on partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, WHO
and its partner institutes and collaborating centres have placed field
teams in Hanoi, Viet Nam, Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan, China to assist health
authorities. Last week, WHO flew 300 kilos of protective equipment and
medical supplies to Hanoi.
Health authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the
symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly
reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the
risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.
As of data available today, the vast majority of cases continue to occur in
health care workers managing patients in hospital environments, and in the
families and other close contacts of patients. [see [1] above].
Update on cases and countries affected
Reports from health authorities in 13 countries, compiled today, indicate a
cumulative total of 456 cases of SARS and 17 deaths. This compares with
reports a week ago (17 Mar 2003) of 150 cases in 7 countries. [see [1] above]
For most of the affected countries, cases reported today are for probable
cases. Previous reports included both probable and suspected cases. As case
definitions of SARS differ in some countries, the United States of America
is today reporting 37 suspect cases under investigation.
Hong Kong SAR China remains the most severely affected area, reporting 260
cases and 10 deaths. Other severely affected areas included Singapore, with
65 cases and no deaths, and Vietnam, with 58 cases and 4 deaths. Canada has
reported 11 cases and 3 deaths.
Chest X-rays showing distinctive features of SARS are presently the main
tool for distinguishing suspected from probable cases. A hand-made
diagnostic test, developed by Hong Kong scientists, began producing
reliable results on Saturday and will be made available to key laboratories
in a matter of days. A more sophisticated test is expected to be available
for widespread use in diagnosing SARS cases within weeks.
Work towards the definitive identification of the causative agent, now
strongly expected to be a virus of the Paramyxovirus or Coronavirus
families, is continuing at breakneck speed. Researchers in a network of 11
leading laboratories, set up on Monday 17 Mar 2003, exchange data on a
restricted web site and compare virological and clinical information during
daily teleconferences.
A second network of clinicians was set up on 20 Mar 2003 to expedite work
on diagnosis and treatment.
WHO team of experts in China
A WHO international team of experts in epidemiology, microbiology,
virology, and respiratory diseases arrived in Beijing, China on Sunday 23
Mar 2003. The multinational team was assembled in response to a request
from the Chinese Ministry of Health to investigate possible links between
the current SARS outbreak, which began in Asia in mid-February 2003, and an
outbreak of atypical pneumonia which began in Guangdong Province in China
in mid-November 2002.
The WHO team, which includes experts from 5 countries, will review
available epidemiological and laboratory data on cases in the southern
China outbreak. It will also propose what additional investigations should
be carried out, and which additional reagents, antibodies, tests, equipment
and expertise might be required to continue the laboratory and virological
work. This additional expertise and equipment is expected to bolster
efforts to trace the source of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province.
Concern over international spread
The first concern WHO has regarding travel is the possibility that the
disease will spread rapidly and become established in many countries around
the world. The extent to which this is happening is being monitored by
heightened surveillance for SARS symptoms around the world and rapid
reporting of suspected cases.
The worldwide awareness of the disease has been demonstrated by the number
of countries reporting to WHO. Recommended isolation procedures appear to
be working. Since these measures were introduced, no onward transmission of
the disease, beyond those initially identified, has been reported.
In these circumstances, where the rapid identification and isolation of
cases appears to be containing international spread, WHO does not consider
that any additional restrictions on travel or trade are required.
Concerns over travel to affected areas
As countries around the world have increased surveillance activities they
have discovered a small number of cases in persons who have traveled to the
affected areas. The small number of such cases, at present, is an
indication that SARS poses little risk to travelers visiting the affected
areas.
Based on available information, WHO does not consider that the small health
risk attributable to SARS significantly increases the health risk
associated with travel to any destination. WHO therefore maintains its
advice that no SARS-related restrictions on travel to any destination are
necessary.
WHO is aware that a number of countries have advised their nationals to
consider postponing unnecessary or elective travel to the areas where local
transmission of the disease has been demonstrated. Such advice does not
amount to a restriction of travel, and is the responsibility of the
concerned national authorities.
Concern about air travel
The public is also concerned about the safety of air travel. Cases that
have been identified in countries outside the initially affected areas have
arrived by air transport.
It is important to note that there is no evidence to date to indicate that
the disease is transmitted during air travel, or that travelling in an
aeroplane with an infected person has resulted in illness to other
passengers or crew. In case of concern that passengers have been exposed to
an infected person during a flight, a protocol exists for the follow up of
passengers and crew. When an airline wishes to disinfect an aeroplane after
carrying a suspected SARS case there is good reason to believe that the
procedures described in the WHO Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation
will be fully effective.

[Of interest is the mention that the etiologic agent could be a member of
either the paramyxovirus family or the coronavirus family, 2 very distinct
viral families. We await further clarification and testing of the
hypotheses as to the etiology of SARS.
As mentioned in this update, transmission to date still seems to be
restricted to close contact of cases and not to general spread within the
community. It is noteworthy that with the implementation of appropriate
infection control procedures, transmission in the health care setting has
been apparently interrupted. - Mod.MPP]
