Indonesia: Suspected fatal case in Riau province
-------------------------------------------------------------
An Indonesian woman suspected of being infected with bird flu died on
Friday [5 Oct 2007] on the island of Sumatra, a hospital official
there said. Blood and tissue samples from the 44-year-old victim have
been sent for testing in Jakarta, said Azizman Daad, a doctor at the
Arifin Achmad Hospital in Riau province said.
Two tests must come back positive for the H5N1 virus before a victim
is confirmed as part of the official bird flu death toll in
Indonesia, which is the highest in the world at 86. If confirmed, the
latest victim would be the nation's 87th fatality.
"The woman who died early this morning was showing symptoms of bird
flu infection, such as high fever, coughing and breathing
difficulties," he told AFP (Agence France Presse). Daad said it was
unclear whether the woman, who lived in a residential complex run by
US oil company Caltex, had been in contact with poultry.
H5N1 is endemic in birds across nearly all of Indonesia. Indonesia,
the world's 4th most populous nation, has reported 107 bird flu
infections, including the fatalities, since it recorded its 1st case
in July 2005.

[If confirmed, this case will become the 108th human case of H5N1
avian influenza in Indonesia and the 87th fatality. No cases have
been confirmed elsewhere in the world since 25 Jul 2007 when an
Egyptian woman tested positive. Since that date 5 confirmed cases
have been recorded in Indonesia according to the WHO Timeline at
