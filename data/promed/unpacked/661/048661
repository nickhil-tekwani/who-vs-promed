A feared virus that occurs among farmed salmon in Europe may have been detected in Canada's British Columbia (B.C.) according to a recently published study, although the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has not yet declared the presence of the virus, a European variant of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV), on the West Coast. In 1996, a case of the virus was detected in Atlantic Canada. No signs of it have yet been detected in regular testing in Washington State, which borders B.C.

Death of infected fish can occur over weeks or months. The disease is the most feared virus in the salmon farming industry. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Virology Journal, from the international publishing house Springer Nature.

ISAV's presence in B.C. was found by a study that tested more than 1000 farmed and wild fish. This was an extension of a preliminary study that announced in 2011 that ISAV had been found in the province. However, researchers say in the report that in the more recent stages of the study, a code was cracked to detect ISAV as a mutation in the fish. The study also found evidence of ISA virus in sea lice, which could spread it to wild salmon.

"I have been following this work for many years. ISA virus is a serious matter," Dr. Daniel Pauly, at the University of British Columbia (UBC), said in a release. "A member of the influenza family in open ocean feedlots is a risk Canada should not be taking on the west coast."
The fear in B.C. and for the streams along the U.S. border is that ISAV could spread from farms to wild salmon. In a previous situation of ISAV infection in Chile in 2007, where the disease was not contained, USD 2 billion in damages resulted.

"The potential that viruses such as ISAV are contributing to widespread decline in sockeye salmon populations cannot be taken lightly," co-author Dr. Rick Routledge said in the release. "The findings in this paper should lead to development of more sensitive screening for this specific virus. This opportunity needs to be pursued with vigor."

More has been learned since the early results of the study in 2011, said report co-author Alexandra Morton in the release. "This was a difficult strain of ISAV to detect, because of a small mutation. It is easy to see how it was missed, but we have cracked its code. It is critical that we learn from what happened to Chile. In my view, this work gives B.C. and our U.S. neighbors the opportunity to avoid tragic consequences."

[ISA is a disease of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by an Orthomyxovirus, and it affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease is systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry. The disease is of obligatory notification to the OIE.

In 2011, a group of scientists from Simon Fraser University reported for the 1st time ISAV in the Pacific (ProMED post 20111019.3120). Later, a laboratory in Norway retested those samples finding negative results (ProMED post 20111110.3335). In an article published recently in the Virology Journal http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12985-015-0459-1, the authors show that this disagreement was caused by a mutation of the virus, which would be a new ISAV variant of European genotype. This further suggests that these strains can be present without being detected by virus isolation using fish cell lines. - Mod.PMB
