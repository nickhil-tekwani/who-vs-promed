Communicated by:
ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi

[Aweil is a city in South Sudan and the capital of the state of North Bahr-al-Ghazal.

After some 8 years of no anthrax reports when this disease was apparently sporadic, we are seeing a series of multiple outbreaks in Aweil South county; Mayom county (June); Warrap state (March to October); and Gogrial West county (March). These have followed a period of severe flooding. Apart from these counties, vaccination is in hand in Twic, Gogrial East, Tonj North, Tonj East, and Tonj South. The vaccination programme is being aided by FAO and Vétérinaires Sans Frontières (VSF), an international non-governmental organization. Thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
