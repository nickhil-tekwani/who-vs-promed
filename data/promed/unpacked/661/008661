Regarding the news in ProMED, may I correct the information. [Since 1947,
we've known that Irian Jaya [has a high prevalence of tuberculosis,
especially in the Sentani lakes area.
The latest figures for tuberculosis in Irian Jaya: the case detection rate
is 155/100,000.
Efforts to control tuberculosis have been [recently implemented with the
support of
the Netherlands Foundation for Leprosy (NSL) which is combining leprosy
control with tuberculosis control.

[The information reported in the ProMED-mail posting cited above was
derived from an official ANTARA news agency report, which quoted provincial
health official Slamet Hardjosuwarno as saying that there had been 155
cases of tuberculosis in 25 villages near Lake Sentani. The next sentence
went on to place the total population of the area at between 3,000 and
5,000 residents. We thank Budi Subianto for the clarification, and presume
that the news agency misquoted the provincial health officer. - Mod.ES
