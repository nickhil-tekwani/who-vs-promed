Resist the urge to blanket an otter. The critter could have rabies and attack. That's what happened to an Orlando woman who tried to warm an otter on her driveway during a chilly afternoon last week.

The attack triggered a rabies alert for Delaney Park and surrounding neighborhoods. The alert zone is centered on Ferncreek Avenue. These are its boundaries:

State Road-408/East Anderson Street
Interstate 4/Division Avenue
Holden Avenue
State Road 15/Conway Road

"All residents and visitors in Orange County should be aware rabies is present in the wild animal population, and domestic animals are at risk if not vaccinated," the Florida Department of Health in Orange County said in a statement Tuesday [29 Dec 2020]. Residents in the zone shouldn't allow pets to run free. "Outside cats are by far the most common domestic animal found to have rabies in the state of Florida, largely because they are often not kept up-to-date on rabies vaccinations," the state health department says online.

Infected animals spread rabies mainly through bites because the virus is shed in saliva. However, transmissions are also possible through scratches. Saliva and nervous tissue of infected animals can infect people or other mammals through an open wound, mouth, nose, or eyes.

The attack happened before 3 pm on Christmas Day outside the woman's house on East Kaley Street. The temperature that day in Orlando [reached] 53 deg F [12 deg C], according to the National Weather Service in Melbourne. Overnight lows hovered in the mid-30s [deg F / 1-2 deg C]. A Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officer said the victim spotted the otter on her driveway as she was leaving home and placed a blanket on it because the weather was cold, according to a report. "It turned and bit her leg," the report said. "It soon died at the location."

The wildlife officer retrieved the otter for testing. The results confirmed it was infected with rabies, prompting the rabies alert 29 Dec [2020]. The alert is for 60 days.

The Orlando woman immediately received medical treatment. Rabies-bite victims are initially treated with a dose of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine, both administered on the day of exposure. Additional vaccines are given on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th day after exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Only mammals are at risk of contracting rabies. Human cases are rare, with only 1-3 instances annually in the United States, according to CDC. However, about 55 000 people annually in the US receive rabies-prevention treatments after bites or scratches from animals with suspected or confirmed rabies infections. Raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes are the animals most commonly associated as carriers of rabies in the US.

Rabid otters have been reported in Florida in the past. A Maitland Police officer fatally shot an infected river otter after the animal scratched and bit people near Lake Lily in January 2019. River otters are found everywhere in the Sunshine State except for the Florida Keys, according to the state's wildlife commission. They typically weigh from 15-30 pounds [10-15 kg] and thrive in areas near waterways. The powerful swimmers dine on crustaceans, amphibians, reptiles, fish, birds, insects, and small mammals.

Seek veterinary assistance immediately for pets and livestock bitten by wild animals and contact Orange County Animal Services. Health officials say people should immediately seek medical attention if they are bitten by wild or domestic animals. Report injuries to the Florida Department of Health in Orange County.

[2] Canada: Northwest Territories - arctic fox, possible human and dog exposure

After 2 foxes tested positive for rabies in Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories (NWT), public health officials are advising people who have been in contact with a fox -- or with their dog after it was attacked by a fox -- to contact the Rosie Ovayuak Health Centre and report the incident immediately.

A government news release Thursday [31 Dec 2020] said there have been incidents of dogs in the community being attacked by foxes. [Foxes attacking dogs may expose the dogs to rabies. - Mod.TG] Officials are urging dog owners to contact wildlife officers with the NWT Department of Environment and Natural Resources (ENR) if their dogs are attacked.

The release stated the departments of ENR and Health and Social Services are working to make sure a vaccinator will be in Tuktoyaktuk in January [2021]. It reminded people that getting dogs vaccinated against rabies is important in reducing the risk of rabies in the community. Rabies can be fatal in humans. [And other mammals. - Mod.TG]

The government is also advising hunters, dog mushers, and other people who regularly handle wildlife to make sure their [own] rabies vaccination status is up to date.

[What a range of temperatures and animals! Florida and otters in the south, to the Northwest Territories with Arctic foxes and possibly dogs exposed to rabies!

For those who live in the northern regions where temperatures can be much lower than 50 deg F [10 deg C] before they are considered cold, this is not the case in the southern regions of North America. Likewise, those in the southern regions are more accustomed to higher temperatures before it is considered hot. Therefore, those in Florida may feel the 50 deg F [10 deg C] temperature was chilly. Consequently, the animals can get cold at those temperatures, as they are also accustomed to warmer temperatures. However, I am not sure I would have considered an otter to be cold at 50 deg F, as they are often in the water at this temperature. So while I appreciate the person's caring for an animal, I suppose the advice to not cover an otter is advice I never expected.

However, foxes attacking dogs could mean the fox was exposed to rabies. Foxes are generally not so bold as to attack dogs. Consequently, the dogs could be a rabies risk to their owners if the dogs are not current on their rabies-prevention vaccination. We may be hearing more about this region if dogs are found with rabies, or if their owners are bitten.

A call for dog mushers to be cautious of wildlife, to make sure of their personal and their dogs' vaccinations against rabies, clearly says the virus is active in the area. - Mod.TG]
