Three people have contracted botulism after eating separate batches of fermented seal flipper in Koyuk. Alaska's Division of Public Health says the 1st case presented signs of the illness on Fri 7 May 2015 with 2 more becoming sick by Monday afternoon, 10 May 2015. All 3 have been transported to Anchorage for emergency medical treatment, and officials say an investigation to "identify and monitor" others who may be at risk is currently underway.

Botulism is a life-threatening disease caused by bacteria that can incubate in some traditional Alaska Native foods, including fermented seal flipper and fermented fish heads, which some consider a delicacy.

Last August 2014, a botulism outbreak in Lower Kalskag killed one person and sickened 2 others. Just before Christmas, an outbreak attributed to a batch of seal oil from Twin Hills hospitalized several people in Quinhagak, Twin Hills, and Dillingham. The Alaska Dispatch News reported that death in Lower Kalskag was the 1st to be caused by botulism in Alaska for over a decade.

Officials are urging health care providers to immediately report suspected cases so that they can be treated quickly and others can be prevented from eating contaminated food. Symptoms of the illness include a dry mouth, blurry vision, dizziness, stomach pain, nausea or difficulty breathing.

[Most of the botulism in Alaska and in Canada as well occurs among the native people of the areas and is related to marine-related foods that are prepared in various traditional ways of fermenting.

A good review on the subject in Alaska is available on line prepared by the State of Alaska Department of Health and Human Services (http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/id/botulism/Botulism.pdf). In a 2011 update, the review report includes 54 outbreaks involving either seal components or seal oil, 27 from salmon eggs, 14 from salmon heads, 15 involving whale meat or blubber, 9 from whitefish and 6 from beaver tail or paw. A similar report from Canada, also primarily among native Canadian people can be found at Hauschild AHW, Gauveau L: Food-borne botulism in Canada, 1971-84. Can Med Assoc J 1985;133: 1141-1146.

Overwhelmingly, the serotype of botulinum toxin involved was serotype E. As explained in the Alaskan citation:

"Foods involved in Alaska botulism outbreaks are usually aged or putrefied ("fermented"). Traditionally prepared northern foods are not in fact "fermented," as fermentation requires a carbohydrate substrate and results in organic acid production that subsequently reduces the pH. Sea mammal food products do not contain enough carbohydrates to enable fermentation; therefore, the pH remains neutral. Instead, the aging of traditional foods is really putrefaction or advanced decomposition of proteins and fat which does not inhibit growth of _Clostridium botulinum_ (type E strains are inhibited at a pH of under 5) or production of botulinum neurotoxin."

"Additionally, changes in techniques using more modern vessels have also increased risk somewhat: Now, aging may be carried out in a barrel, a plastic or glass jar, or a plastic bag. These containers may increase the risk of botulinum toxin formation because most can be easily sealed, thereby increasing the likelihood of anaerobic conditions. Some foods are aged in a seal skin or fish skin bag or "poke," which is either buried or hung up. If salmon eggs are aged in this manner, they can be left until they dry out somewhat and form a "cheese" that is firm on the outside and soft in the center.

Toxin production is temperature dependent, and is less likely to occur at the lower temperatures that were usually attained during traditional aging. Type E is more resistant to freezing than types A or B, and optimal/minimal growth occurs within temperature ranges typical of summer in coastal Alaska and ambient indoor air. Aging now may be done indoors, or in a container above ground and in the sun, which produces warmer temperatures that make aging more rapid and production of botulinum toxin more likely."

[2] North Carolina - home canned carrots
Date: Tue 12 May 2015
Source: North Carolina Health News [edited]
http://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2015/05/12/botulism-case-highlights-need-to-follow-canning-directions/


An Ashe County [North Carolina] woman learned the hard way her food-preservation techniques were wrong. It only took one bite. Five days later, an Ashe County woman lay in the hospital on a ventilator unable to breathe.

The woman, whose name has not been released, told health officials she didn't even swallow the carrot. She opened the home-canned jar of carrots, tasted one, decided it looked and tasted off, and spit it out. But that was enough to give her botulism, sending her to the hospital for an 11-week stay.

She was lucky there was an off flavor, said Ben Chapman, a food-safety expert from NC State University. "The toxin itself doesn't have the sensory attributes that we associate with spoilage," Chapman said this week at a presentation about the case during a meeting of the Governor's Task Force on Food Safety and Defense that was held at the NC Biotechnology Center in Research Triangle Park.

Chapman said the procedure the woman had used to treat the carrots may have left some other live bacteria behind that created the off taste. But her canning technique was not correct, which also left behind viable botulism spores in her carrots. She was fortunate to have ingested a small enough amount that her hospital stay was relatively short compared to what happens in many botulism cases, Chapman said.

And he offered the story as a cautionary tale as we head into the main growing season, when many people pull out pots and jars to preserve the fruits of the season.

It took several days for a possible diagnosis of botulism poisoning to show up in the woman's medical record, said Nicole Lee, an epidemiologist from the state Department of Health and Human Services. The woman's daughters and a friend told doctors that she canned her own food. Before she was intubated, the woman said she suspected the carrots. But doctors also needed to rule out a stroke or other neurological problems. It took more than a week for doctors to tell state health officials that they suspected botulism.

"That immediately got our attention," said Lee. "We had gotten wind that this person was canning her own food. We weren't sure if these items were being sold in commerce or across state lines." Lee also called the CDC to let them know there was a suspected case of botulism. That same day, the CDC released botulism antitoxin for the woman that was flown to Ashe County from Atlanta.

"I was on my way to Morganton, and I got a call to divert," recounted Susan Parrish, a food regulatory supervisor for the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Parrish, who monitors food outbreaks around the state, was given the carrots by one of the woman's friends. "They were in a quart jar," said Parrish, who put on a biohazard suit to handle it. "Obviously, she had only tasted a bite, because the jar was full."

A sample of the carrots was shipped to the FDA. The doctors at the hospital had sent a sample of the woman's blood to the CDC for testing, and the results came back negative.

The woman eventually tested positive for botulism in her stool, confirming the diagnosis.

In recent years, home canning has become more and more popular. According to the Jarden Corporation, which makes Ball canning jars, sales have exploded. "No longer a niche homesteading practice, home canning is a mainstream culinary trend as food lovers nationwide seek to preserve the best local produce," reads a 2014 press release from the company.

And that worries Ben Chapman, who said that all those new home canners are a generation or 2 away from people who canned out of necessity, rather than for fun, fashion or gift-giving. "This was a tragic mistake that can happen to anyone not using proper canning procedures," he said, explaining that the woman had not pressure canned the carrots, which would have created temperatures high enough to kill botulism spores.

"By boiling the water bath, there is this 200 F [93.3 C] kill of vegetative cells," he said. "So she killed all the stuff that would have spoiled it, but didn't get hot enough to take out the spores.

"It doesn't often look spoiled," he said of improperly canned vegetables.

He noted that pickling vegetables with acid or salt and preserving fruits with sugar is enough to retard spore growth without a pressure bath, assuming there's enough acid, salt, or sugar. "There are very passionate people who are maybe not doing canning with science-based recommendations," said Chapman, who has studied how people preserve food.

He said that when he's asked canners where they learned to can, they tell him the knowledge has been passed down rather than learned in a home economics class or a workshop that's strong on the science.

"We've seen in other cases where [a] family link perpetuates error," said Chapman, who said there are plenty of books, classes and online instructions from agricultural extension services. He also said it's important to follow recipes that have been tested, because factors such as temperature, the amount of air left in the jar or the proper level of acid are vital details. "Of the botulism cases we see that are foodborne, the majority we see are home canning," he said.

[The following is extracted from the CDC website on botulism (http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/consumers.html):

"Know the risks of botulism from home-canned foods
-----------------------------
Home-canned vegetables are the most common cause of botulism outbreaks in the USA. From 1996 to 2008, there were 116 outbreaks of foodborne botulism reported to CDC. Of the 48 outbreaks that were caused by home-prepared foods, 18 outbreaks, or 38 percent, were from home-canned vegetables. These outbreaks often occur because home canners did not follow canning instructions, did not use pressure cookers, ignored signs of food spoilage, and were unaware of the risk of botulism from improperly preserving vegetables.

Use proper canning techniques
-----------------------------
- The best way to prevent foodborne botulism is by carefully following instructions for safe home canning.
- Use a pressure canner or cooker and follow all specified home canning processing times for safe home canning of all foods.
- Pay special attention to the processing times for low-acid vegetables like green beans, carrots, and corn.
- Discard all swollen, gassy, or spoiled canned foods.
- Boil home-processed, low-acid canned foods for 10 minutes before serving.
- For higher altitudes, add 1 minute for each 1000 feet [305 m] of elevation.
- People who can foods in their own home should follow strict hygienic procedures and follow USDA recommended canning guidelines to reduce the risk of contaminating foods.
- All home-canned foods should be canned following to the USDA canning guidelines (http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/usda/INTRO%20section%20Home%20Can.pdf), particularly low acid and tomato foods.
- Low-acid and tomato foods not canned according to the recommendations in this publication or according to other USDA-endorsed recommendations are at risk of being contaminated with botulism.
- Consider boiling home-canned foods for 10 minutes before eating them because the botulism toxin is destroyed by high temperatures.
- However, foods known to be underprocessed according to the current standards and recommended methods should not be eaten and should be disposed of safely."

As noted in the text of the posting and in the CDC information, proper disposal of the material is important (see CDC URL above) to avoid contamination with toxin, and, also, the toxin can be acquired by the aerosol route.

Aerosolization of toxin can occur if a sealed container in which _Clostridium botulinum_ is replicating explodes from internal pressure related to gas formation. The risk of acquisition of clinical botulism after an aerosol exposure is not entirely clear, but...

As an example of what might occur, in the early 1960s (1,2), as part of the German biowarfare program, the laboratory workers exposed rabbits and guinea pigs to aerosolized botulinum toxin type A. The animals were enclosed in hermetically sealed containers during the exposures and the workers wore "completely protective clothing." Following the exposures, the animals were transferred to other enclosures, and later examinations were made by the workers with only protective gloves.

By the 3rd day after the exposures, the workers developed pooling of secretions in the mouth, an influenza-like feeling, and some dysphagia to solids. The next day, increased weakness, difficulties with gait and speech, and oculomotor pareses were noted. All 3 were treated with botulinum antitoxin. Subsequently, they had slow recoveries, and their serum was shown to contain type A toxin in a mouse assay. Aerosolization botulism has also been studied in primates (3).

Overall, it was estimated that a point-source aerosol release of botulinum toxin could incapacitate or kill 10 percent of persons within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) downwind (4).
