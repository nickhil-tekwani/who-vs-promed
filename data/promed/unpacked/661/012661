REGINA (CP) -- A second case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a
wild deer has been confirmed in Saskatchewan, the province
announced.
The disease was found in the brain tissue of a 4-year-old mule buck in
the Manito Sandhills region south of Lloydminster.
It was one of 213 samples taken last month in the area. The other
samples tested negative. The second animal was found within 3
kilometres from the first positive case, a 2-year-old deer mule shot
during last fall's hunting season.
Both positive cases come from within 100 kilometres of a game farm
which has been called the source of the disease among game-farmed
elk in the province. The disease has heavily damaged the game-farmed
elk industry in Saskatchewan. It is unknown if there was any contact
between animals, or how the disease is actually transmitted.
The only way to test for the fatal brain disease is to take samples from
the brains, which means the deer have to be shot and killed. There is
no live animal test for the disease.
However, it's only the second case out of 1418 animals sampled over
the last 3 years, so the occurrence of the disease in the wild is quite
small, says Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management.
The government will keep sampling animals in the area to determine
the extent and prevalence of the disease. Chronic wasting disease has
also been confirmed in 25 elk herds across the province.
A similar program in Alberta running along the Saskatchewan
boundary has found no positive tests in 241 animals.
It is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), the same
category of diseases as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. CWD
attacks the brains and nervous systems of animals in the deer family.
Scientists do not know how it is transmitted, but don't believe it can be
transmitted to other animals.
