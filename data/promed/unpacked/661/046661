Glanders; Brazil
----------------
Information received on 21 Apr 2010 from Dr Jamil Gomes de Souza,
Director, Departamento de Salud Animal, Ministerio da Agricultura,
Pecuaria e Abastecimento, Brasilia DF, Brazil

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date 22 Dec 2009
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 12 Apr 2010
Report date 20 Apr 2010
Date submitted to OIE 21 Apr 2010
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence September 2008
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Burkholderia mallei
Nature of diagnosis: Suspicion, Clinical, Laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Sobradinho, Distrito Federal
Date of start of the outbreak 22 Dec 2009
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Species Equidae
Susceptible 1
Cases 1
Deaths 0
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0
Affected Population The animal belongs to a coachbuilder, who has no
other horses, and is used for transport (animal traction).
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: In Brazil, the disease is limited to
certain areas, to some north-eastern States of the country, where it
is endemic and, consequently, notified to the OIE in the 6-monthly
reports as present in a zone of the country. The disease has not been
recorded in other regions of the country since 2008, when it was
detected in the State of Sao Paulo.

On 22 Dec 2009, the Official Veterinary Service was informed that a
horse in a university veterinary hospital in Brasilia showed
respiratory signs and did not react to the treatment with
antibiotics. The Official Veterinary Service sent then [sic -- it
should be then sent - Mod.PC] samples to the National Agricultural
Laboratory at Recife, Pernambuco (LANAGRO/PE). The serological
results were positive for glanders to the complement fixation test.
Later, 2 mallein tests were made at 45-day and 60-day intervals and
results were, respectively, inconclusive and negative.

In order to continue the investigations, nasal swabs were sent to the
same laboratory and the agent was isolated on 12 April 2010. Since
the 1st serological result was obtained, the Official Veterinary
Service began investigations and examined all animals having had any
contact with the affected animal; all were negative and, up to date,
no animal shows clinical signs of the disease. The Official
Veterinary Service conducts the health surveillance and
investigations needed to identify the source or origin of the disease.

Control measures - Measures applied. Quarantine; Movement control
inside the country; Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); No vaccination; No treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied - Modified stamping out

Laboratory name and type: National Agricultural Laboratory
(LANAGRO/PE) (National laboratory)
Species Equidae
Test pathogenic agent isolation on culture
Test date 12 Apr 2010
Result Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Glanders, a formerly very common disease of horses, has disappeared
in many countries over the last century. Some countries and some
areas in particular countries remain infected and the disease is
considered endemic. In Brazil, the disease is usually found in the
Northeast and how it occurred in the center of the country is unknown.

Of course, we are hopeful, especially since the site is a veterinary
teaching hospital, that the resources devoted to outbreak
investigation may help determine the source of this apparently
isolated, non-clinical case.

The Iowa State Center for Food Safety and Public Health has a
comprehensive 7 page Fact Sheet on Glanders, the 1st part of which is
presented below. For more information, see
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/glanders.pdf>:

Glanders is a serious zoonotic bacterial disease that primarily
affects horses, mules and donkeys. Some animals die acutely within a
few weeks. Others become chronically infected, and can spread the
disease for years before succumbing. Although human disease is
uncommon, it is life threatening and painful. Without antibiotic
treatment, the case fatality rate can be as high as 95 percent.
Occasionally, glanders also occurs in other mammalian species,
particularly members of the cat family.

Glanders was a worldwide problem in equids for several centuries, but
this disease was eradicated from most countries by the mid-1900s.
Outbreaks are now uncommon and reported from limited geographic
areas. In non-endemic regions, cases may be seen in people who work
with the causative organism, _Burkholderia mallei_, in secure
laboratories. An infection was reported in a U.S. researcher in 2000.
Glanders is also considered to be a serious bioterrorist threat. _B.
mallei_ has been weaponized and was used as a biological weapon
against military horses, or animals and humans, during the 1st and
2nd world wars.

If this organism is aerosolized during a biological attack or in a
laboratory accident, the morbidity rate could be high. Glanders
results from infection by _Burkholderia mallei_, a Gram negative rod
in the family Burkholderiaceae. This organism was formerly known as
_Pseudomonas mallei_. It is closely related to and appears to have
evolved from the agent of melioidosis, _Burkholderia pseudomallei_.

Glanders is thought to be endemic in parts of the Middle East, Asia,
Africa and South America. Between 1998 and 2007, cases were reported
from Brazil, Turkey, the former U.S.S.R., Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran,
Iraq, United Arab Emirates and Mongolia. This disease may also exist
in Pakistan. The geographic distribution of _B. mallei_ can be
difficult to determine precisely, as cross-reactions with _B.
pseudomallei_ interfere with serological surveys.

In countries that have eradicated glanders, cases may occur in
researchers who work with this agent. In 2000, this disease was
reported in a U.S. researcher.

Glanders is mainly transmitted by contact with skin exudates and
respiratory secretions from infected equids. Latently infected as
well as clinically ill animals can spread the disease. Horses, mules
and donkeys often become infected when they ingest _B. mallei_ in
contaminated food or water. This organism can also be spread in
aerosols, and by entry through skin abrasions and mucous membranes.
Carnivores usually become infected when they eat contaminated meat.
_B. mallei_ is readily spread on fomites including harnesses,
grooming tools, and food and water troughs.

Although this organism is inactivated by heat and sunlight, its
survival is prolonged in wet or humid environments. _B. mallei_
remains viable in room temperature water for up to a month. Some
sources suggest that it might be able to survive for more than a year
in the environment, under some circumstances. Others state that it
may survive for up to a few months in favorable environments, but it
is likely to be inactivated within 2 weeks in unfavorable conditions.

Humans are infected by contact with sick animals, contaminated
fomites, tissues or bacterial cultures. Transmission is often through
small wounds and abrasions in the skin. Ingestion or inhalation can
also occur. Transmission through unbroken skin has been reported, but
not proven. Most laboratory-acquired infections have occurred during
routine handling of cultures or samples, rather than after injuries
or accidents. Rare cases of person-to-person transmission have been
reported in family members who nursed sick individuals. 2 cases were
thought to have been sexually transmitted.

Aerosols may be the major route of infection in a bioterrorist
attack. - Mods.PC/FE]
