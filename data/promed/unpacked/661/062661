[1] Control & prevention

The Boerenbond [Farmers Union in Flanders, Belgium] argues for a decisive and joint approach to the overpopulation of wild boars. This is necessary to reduce nuisance and prevent possible spread of African swine fever into pig farms, says the organization.

"With the regularity of a clock, reports appear in the press of shunted gardens, traffic accidents caused by wild boars, and troubled civilians who notice wild boars on their streets. But farmers have been complaining for a long time, especially in the province of Limburg, about the damage that wild boars inflict on agricultural crops. There is now the threat that wild boars could spread African swine fever," the Boerenbond wrote in a press release on Mon 5 Nov 2018 [in Dutch, at https://tinyurl.com/y7cunsh6].

With a view to planned consultation this and next week between the governors of Limburg and Antwerp and the various other stakeholders, the organization will list some points of interest.

For example, they argue for the appointment of a wild boar coordinator who must ensure that the parties involved meet more quickly and make clear agreements so that the Boerenbond has a clear overview of the number of wild boar and their location. This is necessary in order to be able to find out to what extent the actions on the ground meet the effort to reduce the wild boar populations in Flanders, it says.

The agricultural organization also demands more opportunities for hunting. They suggest using night vision goggles and infrared cameras and allowing the use of silencers under certain circumstances.

There must also be a clear hunting policy in nature areas. In the nature reserves where nothing happens, Boerenbond believes that nature managers must fence these areas so that the population can no longer cause damage in agricultural areas and to private individuals.

Finally, it calls for sensitizing measures to prevent African swine fever. For example, placing on information boards in parking sites along highways and in nature reserves a call to the public to avoid leaving food scraps. The hunting sector must be permanently sensitized to act with each hunting party, in Flanders as well as in other regions, in accordance with the required biosecurity regulations. Cleaning and disinfecting boots, clothes, and materials are extremely important.

[2] DEFRA assessment
Date: Tue 30 Oct 2018

African swine fever in wild boar in Belgium [for the omitted references, maps and assessment of risk for the UK, refer to the source URL]:

The Belgian authorities have reported [as of Mon 5 Nov 2018] 156 cases of ASF in wild boar in the Luxembourg region of Belgium, close to the border with France, within a forested area of nearly 80 sq/km. There have been no cases in domestic pigs, commercial or otherwise. The commercial pig sector is located over 200 km away, in the Flanders region. Belgium remains free of ASF in domestic pigs.

The source and route of virus incursion have not been confirmed, and investigations are continuing. The European Commission has confirmed that interim protective measures under 2002/60/EC Article 15 are in place, delineated by the border with Luxembourg and France. An infected zone has been established (of 630 sq/km), within which there are strict biosecurity measures.

Belgium has preventively culled all domestic pigs within the infected area (about 5000 pigs) including 6 small commercial holdings (farms with more than 50 pigs) and implemented a series of strict control measures to limit the spread of the disease.

a. Surveillance of Wild Boar outside the Infected Area:

1. Raising awareness of hunters and visitors to the forests

2. Passive surveillance: all wild boar carcasses must immediately be reported; sampling and analysis of dead wild boars, and disposal of the carcasses

3. Active surveillance: increased hunting, sampling, and analysis of a proportion of hunted wild boars

b. Surveillance of wild boar within the infected area.

Phase 1 (15 Sep - 14 Oct 2018)
-----------------------
1. Ban on hunting, supplemental feeding of wild boar and other game.

2. Active searching for wild boar carcasses by trained personnel with secure removal of carcasses.

3. Controls on access to the forest; ban on all commercial and leisure activities, with exemptions only for activities related to ASF control.

4. Setting up collection centres for carcass collection, sampling and disposal

5. Collection and testing of all wild boar found dead.

Phase 2 (15 Oct - 14 Nov 2018)
---------------------
Establishment of 3 zones inside the Infected Area (map at https://www.chasse.be/files/Image/news/2018-ppa-carte-au-12102018.png):

1. Kernel zone (Zone Noyau, red; 12 562 ha)
a. Same measures as already in place for the infected area

2. Buffer zone (Zone Noyau et Tampon, purple; 29 183 ha)
a. All of the above and:
b. Building a network of fences

3. Reinforcement Zone (Zone d'Observation rendorc√©e, gray; 21 101 ha)
a. Forest activities (logging and tourism) permitted in daylight hours;
b. Ban on feeding wild boar;
c. Increased passive surveillance;
d. Active surveillance plus eradication of wild boars: culling and testing wild boar and disposal of carcasses;

If ASF were to be detected in domestic pigs and captive wild boar/feral pigs, the following measures would be introduced:

- No visitors are allowed access to establishments where pigs are held except for management of the holding;
- Access to establishments with pigs is forbidden for 72 hours following contact with wild boar;
- Increased surveillance: All sick pigs to be tested for ASF, regardless of clinical signs;
- Reinforced ban on swill feeding and no outdoor access for pigs unless property is double fenced;
- All assemblies and gatherings of pigs prohibited, including the loading of pigs of different origin on the same vehicle.
- Four week standstill for all newly introduced pigs.

France has also implemented controls in a reinforcement zone, comprising 53 communes in Ardennes, Meuse and Meurthe-et-Moselle departements, within 10 km of the Belgium infected zone, where hunting (without dogs) will be used to reduce the wild boar population, and increased surveillance for dead wild boar is in place and in a wider observation zone, where there are also measures for hunting, passive surveillance, and awareness raising. This comes after a period of observation and hunting bans, as recommended by the Europe Commission veterinary expert team. The observation zone consists of 60 more communes in the same departements.

In Luxemburg, there is a surveillance zone along the border with Belgium in which there is increased surveillance for dead wild boar; hunting is allowed, and commercial outdoor pigs are being housed.

[Belgium submitted its follow-up report 7 to the OIE notifying 9 new outbreaks (15 dead animals) in wild boar on Mon 5 Nov 2018; see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=28541.

The summarised and assessed data of the event since its start on 9 Sep 2018, as of 5 Nov 2018, are the following:

Total outbreaks = 82 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar / - / 158 / 152 / 6 / 0
