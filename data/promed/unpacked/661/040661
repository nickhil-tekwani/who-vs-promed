As many as 13 patients with OXA-48-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ ST392 have been reported by Sweden and Norway between January and April 2018 -- all returning travellers with prior hospital admission in Gran Canaria. Whole genome sequencing showed tight clustering between the bacterial isolates from the cases. [Whole genome sequencing analysis indicates a common place of acquisition for the cases. - Mod.ML]

According to ECDC's risk assessment published today [Wed 11 Jul 2018], the risk to individual travellers of acquiring OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST392 of the Gran Canaria cluster without healthcare contact is very low. However, if carriers of the bacteria are admitted to a hospital in their country of origin, there is a high risk for further transmission and outbreaks if carriage is not detected and if adequate infection prevention and control measures are not in place.

Given the large number of tourists visiting Gran Canaria, one hospital may become the source of spread to other European countries when patients are transferred from one country to another, making this cluster a cross-border threat, states the report. In 2016, more than 15 million of EU/EEA citizens -- mainly from Spain, the UK and Germany -- travelled to the Canary Islands, according to the International Air Transport Association.

OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ is a resistant bacterium typically acquired in healthcare settings. Hospitalisation abroad and cross-border transfer of patients are well known modes of introduction of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), including OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST392, into countries with lower prevalence.

The report suggests that hospitals in EU/EEA countries should consider taking, at hospital admission, a detailed history of all travel and hospitalisations of the patient. All patients who are directly transferred or were hospitalised in a foreign country 12 months prior to hospital admission may be considered for screening, regardless of the CPE prevalence at the place of hospitalisation.

Carbapenemase-producing (OXA-48) _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ ST392 in travellers previously hospitalised in Gran Canaria, Spain
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Main conclusions and options for response
-----------------------------------------
Conclusions
Between January and April 2018, Sweden and Norway reported a cluster of 13 returning travellers who carried or were infected with carbapenemase (OXA-48)-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ ST392. All cases were associated with hospital admissions in Gran Canaria. Isolates from cases showed tight clustering when analysed by whole genome sequencing.

This cluster of 13 patients colonised or infected with OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_- ST392 is an example of cross-border spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). Cross-border transfers of patients or hospital admissions of patients with previous hospitalisation in another country are a daily occurrence in EU/EEA hospitals.

The risk for individual travellers to acquire OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST392 of the Gran Canaria cluster without healthcare contact is very low. However, if carriers of OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST392 of the Gran Canaria cluster are admitted to a hospital in their country of origin, there is a high risk of transmission and subsequent outbreaks if OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST392 carriage remains undetected and there are no adequate infection control and prevention measures.

This example highlights the benefits of active surveillance (screening) for CPE carriage, including OXA-48- producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST392, immediately at hospital admission in patients who are directly transferred from a hospital abroad. It also shows the value of cross-country sharing of epidemiological and whole genome sequencing data as well as the added value of collaborative analyses to determine the origin of this OXA-48- producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST392 cluster.

Options for response
Hospitals in EU/EEA countries should consider taking, at hospital admission, a detailed history of travels and hospitalisations for every patient. They should also perform pre-emptive isolation and screening for carriage of CPE, including OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_, at least in patients who were directly transferred or hospitalised in countries with known high prevalence in the 12 months before admission (see ECDC survey of national experts), or in patients who were hospitalised in their own country in the 12 months before admission, but in a region or hospital with known high prevalence of CPE, including OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_.

However, as prevalence of CPE, including OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_, is difficult to monitor in some regions and national prevalence might not always reflect the regional or local situation, screening every patient who was hospitalised in a foreign country in the 12 months before admission might be a more suitable option. Microbiological methods suitable for the screening and detection of CPE, including those producing an OXA-48-like carbapenemase, are outlined in the section on laboratory detection below [available at source URL]. Detailed actions for the prevention of transmission of CPE in hospitals and other healthcare settings have been described in a prior ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment and in an ECDC guidance document.

Proper transfer letters and good interfacility communication surrounding transfers are key elements of ensuring effective measures to limit the spread of CPE, including OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_, in the receiving hospital. Moreover, gathering reliable epidemiological data, notifying cases to public health authorities, and exchanging information are important activities to enable informed and coordinated actions by public health authorities across the EU/EEA. Public health authorities should issue notifications on the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) where relevant, as per Article 9 of Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health. The use of the Epidemic Intelligence System (EPIS) is encouraged to ensure transparent and timely sharing of information among participating public health authorities in order to detect public health threats at an early stage.

[The Canary Islands is an archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean and an autonomous community of Spain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands). Gran Canaria is the 3rd largest island of the archipelago and its population of 847 830 (in 2015) constitutes approximately 40 per cent of the population of the archipelago. Gran Canaria is located about 150 km (93 mi) off the north western coast of Africa and about 1350 km (840 mi) from Europe. The capital city is Las Palmas. There are several outpatient centers and hospitals on Gran Canaria (http://www.justgrancanaria.com/en/general_info/medical/hospitals.htm), but we are not told in the ECDC reports above where the 13 tourists from Norway and Sweden who became colonized or infected with the outbreak strain of OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST392 had been hospitalized.

Oxa-type beta-lactamase is a member of a group of enzymes called carbapenemases that destroy carbapenem antibiotics, as well as most other beta-lactam antibiotics. Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that include ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems commonly is the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases. Other resistance mechanisms, which include reduced affinity of penicillin-binding protein (PBPs) for carbapenems, increased efflux of the beta-lactam antibiotics, or decreased permeability of the outer membrane due to loss of outer membrane porin channels, may be combined with production of the carbapenemase. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases such as KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.); NDMs (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases such as NDM-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, etc.); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases).

Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids, as is OXA-48 in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_. Plasmids can facilitate spread of resistance genes among organisms of the same species or even different bacterial species. The plasmids frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics, such as colistin and tigecycline.

OXA-type beta-lactamases hydrolyse the isoxazolylpenicillin oxacillin much faster than penicillin G. There are over 100 different variants of OXA-type beta-lactamases, some of which exhibit carbapenem-hydrolysing activities. Although many of the OXA-type carbapenemases show only weak carbapenemase activity, carbapenem resistance may result from a combined action of an OXA-type carbapenemase and a 2ndary resistance mechanism such as overexpressed efflux pumps or outer membrane porin deficiencies, as has been found in OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ (http://aac.asm.org/content/48/1/15.full.pdf+html).

Enterobacteriaceae producing OXA-48-group carbapenemase do not have characteristic susceptibility patterns, which makes their recognition difficult (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3884727/). OXA-48 has been found to be weakly inhibited by clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam (http://aac.asm.org/content/48/1/15.full) or by vaborbactam (marketed with meropenem)(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5655098/). However, avibactam (marketed in combination with ceftazidime) inhibits some OXA-48, as well as KPCs, ESBLs, and AmpC beta-lactamases (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/63/2/234/1745233, http://aac.asm.org/content/59/12/7842.full).

Acquisition of pathogens that are uncommon in the home country is a known risk of travel. Examples include multi-antibiotic resistant gonococci (ProMED-mail. Gonococcal disease: UK, Australia, antibiotic resist. ceftriaxone/azithro. ECDC 20180515.5798557), intestinal carriage of antibiotic resistant Enterobacteriaceae (ProMED-mail. Antibiotic resistant Enterobacteriaceae: travelers, ESBLs, carbapenemases 20150124.3116245), diphtheria (ProMED-mail. Diphtheria - Norway ex Mozambique: cutaneous, traveler 20140621.2556752), schistosomiasis (ProMED-mail. Schistosomiasis - Uganda: (KA) travelers, altitude 20131123.2070772), typhoid fever (ProMED-mail. Typhoid fever update (06): Australia ex India, travelers 20130815.1881197), and measles (ProMED-mail. Measles update (06) 20170201.4808554). Similarly travel for the specific purpose of obtaining health care abroad (medical tourism) (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/the-pre-travel-consultation/medical-tourism) has been associated with nontuberculous mycobacteria infections among patients who had cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic (ProMED-mail. Non-TB mycobacteria - USA: ex Dominican Rep, M. abscessus/chelonae, post-surgery 20170625.5130300) and Q fever among patients who received sheep cell injections in Germany (ProMED-mail. Q fever - Germany: (RP) sheep cell therapy, 2014 20170416.4974554), as well as NDM beta-lactamase-producing organisms in patients who had received medical care in India (ProMED-mail. NDM-1 carrying Enterobacteriaceae (04): Taiwan ex India 20101005.3604). As emphasized by the ECDC above, a travel history should be an essential component of a thorough medical examination. - Mod.ML
