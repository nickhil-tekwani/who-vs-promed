BSE MOUSE TESTS (02)
====================
[see
BSE mouse tests 970409151017]
From: jralphb@easynet.co.uk (J Ralph Blanchfield)
In responding to Peter Cyrog's post re Dormont/Lesmezas, it was only
afterwards that I realised that I had not explicitly addressed his final
line query "Does this mean diagnosis of BSE by mouse assay may miss animals
with BSE?"
Animals are not diagnosed ante mortem for BSE by mouse test, and a post
mortem one would have to wait two years for as result, which can be obtained
quickly by brain histopathology. Mouse assay has of course been used to
examine every conceivable tissue and secretion from confirmed BSE infected
cows, with negative results in all but brain, spinal cord and retina. I do
not think that the researchers would have overlooked "symptoms of a BSE-like
neurological disorder."
However, negative results by the mouse assay are now in question for a
different reason, which so far as I know has not yet been published in a
scientific paper, but which was reported in the last (22 November 1996)
updated IFST Position Statement on BSE. It is easiest (because of the
absence of any species barrier) to transmit BSE infectivity to calves. In
the BBC2 Horizon TV programme on 18 November 1996, John Wilesmith reported
that experimental intracerebral inoculation, into calves, of brain tissue
from BSE-infected cows has shown that this method can detect levels of
infectivity of the order of one-thousandth of that detectable by mouse
assay. This would imply that the failure to find infectivity in various
tissues and secretions of confirmed BSE-infected cows by mouse assays
_might_ mean that there were very small amounts of infectivity present which
might have been detected by intracerebral inoculation into calves. However,
these experiments were part of a programme of long term feeding trials and
inoculation trials over about seven years.
What the TV programme did not include, but John Wilesmith told me on the
following day, was that the research programme included parallel
intracerebral inoculation, into calves, of lymph tissue and spleen,
respectively, from BSE-infected cows, resulting in none of the calves
succumbing to BSE, i.e. no infectivity being detected in either lymph tissue
or spleen by this more sensitive method. John also told me that SEAC were in
full possession of the results of these experiments when they made their
"extremely small" risk assessment in March 1996. If any of the tissues or
secretions (other than brain, spinal cord and retina) contained infectivity
at levels lower than could be detected in the mouse assay, lymph tissue and
spleen must be prime candidates; so I think that the fact that infectivity
has not been found in them by the more sensitive calf assay is encouraging.
Nevertheless, SEAC was right to call for testing of other tissues,
particularly muscle meat and milk, by the calf assay.
While this does not mean that consumption of muscle meat, milk and tallow
from British cows is unsafe, until those calf assay tests are completed it
will not be possible to state categorically whether they are free from
previously undetectable small amounts of infectivity.
