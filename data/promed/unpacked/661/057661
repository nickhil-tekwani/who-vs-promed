The Tokelau National Games for this year [2014] have been cancelled as a result of a chikungunya outbreak in the islands.

The sports coordinator for the event, Susan Perez, says the health of local people and the containment of the epidemic were the 2 driving factors to the board's decision.

She says a state of emergency was declared on the island where the games were to be hosted, so it made sense to cancel the event. The National Games were to be hosted by Fakaofo.

[Fakaofo, with a population of 370, formerly known as Bowditch Island, is one of 3 atolls in the Tokelau group in the South Pacific Ocean and consists of islets on a coral reef that surrounds a central lagoon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakaofo). Tokelau has a population of 1,411 people. - Mod.ML]

[Chikungunya outbreaks have been circulating among the Pacific Islands over the past 5 months. This is the 1st report of chikungunya virus infections on the Tokelau Islands. This Tokelau situation is a good illustration of how an outbreak can disrupt well planned events. No case numbers are given, but they apparently were significant enough to result in cancellation of the national games.

The Tokelau Islands are an overseas territory of New Zealand. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing their location can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2878897,6767. - Mod.TY]
