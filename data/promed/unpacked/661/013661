Public health officials in Pueblo, Colorado announced on Thursday [15 Aug 2013] that a rabbit had tested positive for tularemia in Pueblo West. The rabbit was collected in the 1000 Block of West Saginaw Drive after it had contact with a child.

"Tularemia is similar to plague. It is typically found in animals, especially rabbits," said Scott Cowan, program manager of the Disease Prevention and Emergency Preparedness Division at the Pueblo City-County Health Department. "Tularemia can be passed to humans or animals through the bite of infected insects, most commonly ticks and deer flies, and by handling infected, sick, or dead animals," said Cowan. The disease can also be passed to people or animals if they eat meat or drink water infected by the bacteria.

"It is very important not to pet or come in contact with wild animals," stated Cowan. He explained, "A child petted this rabbit before the rabbit died, potentially exposing the child to the bacteria. The child currently has no symptoms of tularemia and is on a fever watch."

Tularemia is a potentially serious illness that occurs naturally in the United States. It is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_ found in animals (especially rodents, rabbits, and prairie dogs).

People can get tularemia multiple ways:
- being bitten by an infected tick, deerfly or other insect
- handling infected animal carcasses
- eating or drinking contaminated food or water
- breathing in the bacteria, _F. tularensis_

Tularemia is not spread from person to person. People who have tularemia do not need to be isolated. People who have been exposed to the tularemia bacteria should be treated as soon as possible. The disease can be fatal if it is not treated with the right antibiotics.

Symptoms of tularemia usually occur 3-5 days after exposure and may include:
- sudden fever
- chills
- headaches
- diarrhea
- muscle aches
- joint pain
- dry cough
- progressive weakness

People can also develop pneumonia and may have the following symptoms: chest pain, bloody sputum, trouble breathing and they even sometimes stop breathing.

Other symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the tularemia bacteria. These symptoms can include ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat.

The Pueblo City-County Health Department recommends the following to protect against the disease:
- Avoid all contact with wild rabbits, squirrels and rodents; do not feed or handle them.
- Avoid ticks. The best protection for pets, especially cats, is to keep them indoors. If outdoors with your pets, protect them with a flea collar; keeping them out of heavily wooded areas can provide additional protection, as these areas are ideal for ticks to live.
- Stay out of areas wild rodents inhabit. If you enter areas with wild rodents, wear insect repellent containing DEET or treat clothing with repellent containing permethrin.
- Prevent your pets from hunting or eating wild rodents, especially rabbits.
- Never touch sick or dead animals with your bare hands. If an animal must be moved, use a long-handled shovel to place it in a garbage bag, and place the bag in an outdoor garbage can.
- Avoid drinking unpurified water from streams or lakes and prevent your pets from doing the same.
- See a physician if you become ill with a high fever and/or a swollen lymph node. Tularemia is a treatable illness when diagnosed early.
- See a veterinarian if you pet becomes ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes.

"It is important for pet owners keep their animals from roaming outside, as they can be exposed to tularemia when hunting rabbits and/or prairie dogs," stated Cowan. "Do not let your pets roam; do not let them eat dead animals; protect your pets with a flea and tick collar, and keep an eye on their health and take then to the veterinarian if clinical signs develop."

Note any change in the behavior of your pets especially cats, as well as notice activity of rodents, rabbits, and prairie dogs or livestock, and consult a veterinarian if your pet develops unusual signs.

This is the 1st identified case of tularemia in animals in Pueblo County this year [2013]. No human cases of tularemia have been reported this year.

[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non sporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.

In domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.

Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially [Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod. - CopyEd.MSP], which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

The commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.

The incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.

People may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.

Tularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.

Streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death. Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.
