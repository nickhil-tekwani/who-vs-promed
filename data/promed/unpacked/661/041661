The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF) says it has received its 1st reported case of a SARS-CoV-2-positive dog in Louisiana. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus causing COVID-19 in humans.

"Initially, it was believed pets could not get the disease, but the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is now learning animals can be infected," said Commissioner Mike Strain, DVM.

According to the United State Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS), there is currently no evidence pets play a significant role in spreading the virus. Based on the limited information available, the risk of animals spreading the virus to people is considered to be low. They say there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare.

"It appears people with COVID-19 can spread the virus to animals during close contact. It is important for people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to avoid contact with pets and other animals to protect them from possible infection. At this time, routine testing of animals is not recommended," Strain added.

According to the CDC, in many cases, the pets do not get sick, but some have suffered mild signs of respiratory tract or gastrointestinal disease. A small number of pet cats and dogs have been reported to be infected with the virus in several countries, including the United States.

The CDC recommends that patients with COVID-19 who have pets follow the recommendations found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/animals/interim-guidance-managing-people-in-home-care-and-isolation-who-have-pets.html.

Strain also urged Louisiana domestic pet owners to not abandon or surrender their pets to animal control agencies if they are able to take care of them.

"If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, allow a family member or close friend to care for your pets. If no one is available, maintain a safe distance from your pet and frequently wash your hands before and after contact with your pet, their food, and their supplies," said Strain. "Remember, in the event of any emergency, it is wise to have a pet plan as you would have a game plan for your family," added Strain.

According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) rules, the LDAF cannot release any information possibly identifying the pet owner, including where the dog is located.

[Currently there is no evidence that pets can transmit COVID-19 to people, but people can certainly pass it to pets. Therefore, just as you try to protect yourself from the virus, also take precautions to protect your pets from the virus.

If you suspect you have been exposed, or if you have the virus, no kissing or hugging near your face, and no speaking directly into your pet's face to help prevent transfer of the virus to your pet. Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently after touching the pet or the food dishes. Take care of the pet, show it love, but also take care of yourself.

An excellent article is found in COVID-19 update (231): USA (NY) animal, dog conf. 20200602.7420541.

Excerpt from OIE, Q&A on the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [abridged, edited] (https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/):
"Currently there is no evidence that (in-contact companion animals) play a significant epidemiological role in this human disease. However, because animals and people can sometimes share diseases (known as zoonotic diseases), it is still recommended that people who are sick with COVID-19 limit contact with companion and other animals until more information is known about the virus."

Hopefully, additional similar observations will allow the epidemiological role of companion animals (dogs and cats) in human COVID-19 to be considered negligible; at present, it cannot be viewed as such. Additional gathered experience, including PCR and serologic test results of in-contact company animals, is warranted. - Mods.TG/AS
