Cholera is common during the rainy season and is intensified by water waste disposal issues and limited access to clean drinking water. The disease causes vomiting and diarrhea that can result in dehydration. If not treated, it can be fatal. In 2009, more than 260 people died of cholera in Nigeria, no wonder, then that palpable fear has gripped residents of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, over the recent outbreak of cholera in some parts of the town, which has been reported to have claimed no fewer than 10 lives.

The epidemic, which can spread quickly, was initially reported at the Sacred Heart Hospital, Lantoro, in Abeokuta South Local Government Area of the state. The patient was said to have tested positive to _Vibrio cholerae_ using a rapid test. Another case was reported 2 days after at the same hospital, and this development has become a source of concern to residents of the town.

This development was recorded in some communities in Abeokuta South and Abeokuta North Local Government Areas, precisely Ijaiye and Adigbe communities. There was a sudden upsurge of the outbreak on Fri 5 Jul 2013.

Since the outbreak of the epidemic, which the state government maintains is gastroenteritis and not cholera as widely believed, many residents, both children and adults, have either been hospitalised or treated in both public and private hospitals in the capital city.

The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Olaokun Soyinka, in a statement issued by his ministry last Wednesday, 31 Jul 2013, stated that some communities in Abeokuta North and Abeokuta South Local Government areas were identified as being the source of the epidemic. The areas were noted to have poor sanitation, particularly faecal waste management. According to him, "there was a sudden upsurge in cases of gastroenteritis in some communities in Abeokuta. Some severe cases presented to Ijaye Hospital and staffs were informed of a patient who died in the community. State and local government officials reacted immediately to trace the source of the outbreak and to provide life-saving treatment for admitted patients."

Soyinka added that since the case was first reported on 27 Jun 2013 at a private hospital, about 104 cases were said to have been listed, while 2 patients were tested positive of being infected by cholera bacterium.

The commissioner noted that 76 cases were line listed in Abeokuta South, 25 in Abeokuta North, 2 cases in Odeda, and a case in Obafemi Owode Local Government areas of the state; and that only 3 deaths were recorded in these cases.

The commissioner explained that out of the 104 cases, only 2 tested positive, allaying the fears of residents that government had put measures in place to contain the epidemic.

http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/22/burundi-longest-cholera-epidemic-kills-at-least-17/


A cholera epidemic in Burundi, the longest in the small central African country's history, has killed at least 17 people in 10 months, a top health official told AFP Monday, 22 Jul 2013. "Burundi has been affected since last October 2013 by a cholera epidemic," said Liboire Ngirigi, director general of public health.

"It has claimed at killed at least 17 lives and 936 cases have been reported by hospitals. This is the longest outbreak in our country." The scale of the outbreak seems to be growing as 14 of the victims perished since June 2013, he said.

Ngirigi said a lack of adequate information meant some residents were not seeking treatment fast enough for the disease, which spreads mainly because of a lack of safe drinking water and access to toilets.

The epidemic 1st appeared in the northern districts of the capital Bujumbura, but also along Lake Tanganyika and northwestern provinces before spreading across the entire country. Southern regions of the country are now also affected by the outbreak, said the official.

http://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2013/08/02/ghana-records-over-9500-cholera-cases-in-2012-health-minister/


Ghana recorded a total of 9566 cases of cholera with 100 deaths during 2012. The cases occurred in 53 districts in 9 regions but no districts in the Upper West Region recorded any of the cases in 2012. Dr Alfred Sugri Tia, Deputy Minister of Health, said although no cholera case has been confirmed in 2013, the possibility of outbreak is high as the risk factors exist. In 2012, the country confirmed cholera outbreak in the early part of the year and battled the disease.

Dr Ebenezer Appiah Denkyira, Director General of Ghana Health Service, said within the Nima Community and its surroundings, a total of 598 cholera cases was recorded in 2010 while 202 was recorded in 2012. He said people should observe good hygienic practices and warm every food they eat and wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating.

He said the cases of diarrhea currently diagnosed in the city of Pointe-Noire, Congo's main economic city, are not related to cholera. The efforts to end the epidemic were spearheaded by the county's Health Department, with the support of several national and international partners.

[6] Cholera - India (Maharashtra State)

http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/civic/BMC-acknowledges-cholera-cases-for-1st-time-in-5-years/articleshow/21496208.cms


For the 1st time in the last 5 years, BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, formerly known as the Bombay Municipal Corporation - Mod.LL] has acknowledged cholera in the city of Mumbai, with 52 cases reported in 2013. Of these, 42 were reported in July [2013] and 12 in June. Transmitted through contaminated water and food, the increasing number of cholera cases has now sent alarm bells ringing at the civic body.

"Cholera is a concern right now. Our lookout is to detect cases at the earliest so that there are no fatalities," said additional municipal commissioner Manisha Mhaiskar.

All these cases were detected through culture tests. A hanging drop test can also be conducted to detect the disease but BMC officials rely on only the culture tests. Senior physician Dr Pratit Samdani, however, said that if a patient had classic symptoms such as acute gastroenteritis, severe diarrhea and vomiting, and if the hanging drop test was positive, he or she should be counted as a cholera patient.
