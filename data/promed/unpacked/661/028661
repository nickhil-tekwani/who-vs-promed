[The above new outbreak in a hitherto uninfected Chinese province, Anhui in eastern China, has been covered in ProMED-mail's posting 20180830.5997998, which includes background information and commentary.

A Chinese media source "The Paper" published on Sat 1 Sep 2018 the following data: In 2017, following the spread of African swine fever (ASF) in Russia, the recorded culling percentage of pigs, throughout the year, accounted for 8.3% of the national pig population. According to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China, as of July 2018, the total number of live pigs in the country was 320 million. If the culling rate follows the same proportions experienced in Russia, China may need to cull 26.56 million heads. At present, the government subsidy for forced culling due to ASF is CHY 800 (USD 117) per head. If the breeding cost per pig is CHY 1600 (USD 234), the pig breeding industry will lose nearly CHY 2.125 billion (USD 310 million) (see, in Chinese, at https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_2401985). - Mod.AS
