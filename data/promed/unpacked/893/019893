An additional 4 horses in Manatee County have tested positive for a
rare horse disease thought to be eradicated in the United States
since 1988, state agriculture officials have confirmed.

All 4 horses were on the same farm and stable mates of the 7-year-old
gelding who was 1st diagnosed with equine piroplasmosis, a tick-borne
disease. The gelding had to be euthanized 3 weeks after falling ill,
the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services reports.

Although blood tests on the 4 additional horses were positive, all of
the animals are healthy and none has exhibited symptoms of the
disease, said Terence McElroy, Department of Agriculture spokesman.
The Manatee County farm, which officials have declined to identify,
is under quarantine as the State Veterinarian's Office continues its
investigation to determine the source of the disease and whether it
has spread beyond the immediate area.

"We believe the gelding was a chronic carrier that got ill," McElroy
said. "The other horses may have been infected through the use of a
common needle to give injections. Many horses are carriers and don't
display symptoms of the disease."

The investigation so far has not found any of the exotic ticks that
carry the disease, McElroy said. "That's a good sign," McElroy said.
"There is no indication that there is any spread beyond this single premises."

Equine piroplasmosis is widespread in Mexico and throughout Central
and South America. Agriculture officials say it's possible the sick
gelding was an imported horse that carried the disease into the
country. The only way the disease can be spread is through a tick
bite or the use of a common needle or sharing of blood, McElroy said.

Still, the presence of the disease concerns Anne Prince, co-owner of
Prince Farm in Palmetto, FL, which trains and shows more than 80
quarter horses.

"My concern is if the disease is found in more than one horse and the
entire county is quarantined," Prince said. "We have many
horse-related businesses in Manatee County. That could hurt us."

Hopefully they will soon locate the source of the disease and the
ticks that are responsible. - Mod.TG]
