Honeybees mysteriously perish in Shaoguan area
----------------------------------------------
Shaoguan area [in Guangdong province] continues to be perplexed by
the mysterious deaths of bees. Over 200 beekeepers have been
affected. The 81 beekeepers in Shixing County Beekeepers Association,
alone, lost bees of about 2000 boxes last year [2007].

Han Richou, director of the Guangdong Entomological Institute, says
field surveys show that the dead [bees] are all Italian bees -- a
type of bee imported to China from the West. The majority of worker
bees die near the beehive box. If a frame is pulled out, many limp
bees will fall off. Currently only worker bees die. Queen bees
haven't been found to die. Although the hive is not completely wiped
out, the number of bees will be reduced and the hive made weak. There
has been no determination of the cause yet.

This sounds a little bit like the colony collapse disorder occurring
in the US. It is not completely like colony collapse disorder, but
perhaps it has been identified at an earlier stage - Mod.TG

Shaoguan is located in northern Guangdong province, which can be seen
