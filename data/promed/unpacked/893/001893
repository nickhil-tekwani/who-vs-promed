Bluetongue virus serotype 9 has been identified in Israel for the 1st time, in samples collected from cattle on the Golan Heights and from sheep in Moshav Arbel, lower Galilee.

Bluetongue cases have been observed this year [2019] throughout the country, clinically affecting sheep in particular (few cases in cattle).

Most samples reaching the laboratory during the season were serotyped as BTV-4 or, to a lesser extent, BTV-3. The latter, recorded 3 years ago in southern Israel for the 1st time, has been recently circulating in other parts of the country, particularly in the north, causing serious clinical disease. In addition, there have been sporadic diagnoses of BTV-8.

[BTV-3 was discovered in Israel for the 1st time in September 2016, more than 60 years after its original and only detection in the Mediterranean Basin (Cyprus). During the same season (2016), a strain of the same serotype appeared for the 1st time in Tunisia and later, for the 1st time, in Sicily, probably transmitted by wind-borne _Culicoides_ midges from North Africa. Information on its genotyping and about the clinical signs observed in Sicily was requested in 20171204.548264.

Bluetongue disease has been recurring in Israel since its initial laboratory-confirmed identification in 1951, with clinical disease seen in the majority of years since 1964. Until recently, the disease affected mainly sheep of susceptible breeds (European mutton and dairy sheep breeds and, to a lesser extent, their crosses with local Awassi fat-tail sheep). The disease is seasonal (August-December, peaking October-November). Five BTV serotypes were identified in Israel between 1951 and 1973, namely (year of 1st identification noted in parentheses) BTV-4 (1951), BTV-16 (1968), BTV-6 (1972), BTV-2 (1973), and BTV-10 (1973). Throughout these years, BTV-4 has been, and still is, the most prevalent strain.

After 32 years of a seemingly stable sero-profile, a new strain appeared in 2006, namely BTV-15, affecting sheep. This was followed by the reporting of 5 other new BTV strains, most of which caused clinical disease in cattle as well: BTV-24 (2008), BTV-8 (2008, eventually identified in early 2009), BTV-5 (2009), BTV-3 (2016), and now BTV-9 (2019).

A multi-annual report of Israel's Veterinary Services and Animal Health (Ministry of Agriculture) for the years 2016-2018, published recently, addresses Bluetongue on pages 142-146. The following data (translated from the Hebrew origin) are extracted from it:

Year / Species / No. locations / No. isolates / BTV serotypes
2016 / cattle / 15 / 25 / 4, 8, 15
2016 / sheep / 15 / 35 / 2, 3, 5, 8
-------
2017 / cattle / 10 / 14 / 2, 4, 6, 15
2017 / sheep / 14 / 26 / 3, 4, 6
-------
2018 / cattle / 13 / not available / 2, 3, 4, 6, 15
2018 / sheep / 8 / not available / 3, 4, 6

The report (in Hebrew) is available at https://www.moag.gov.il/vet/dochot-shnatiim/Documents/doch_shnati_2016-2018.pdf.pdf.

Another new airborne orbivirus affecting cattle, namely epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD), appeared for the 1st time in Israel in 2006 (serotype 7), and then again in 2015 (serotype 6) and 2016 (serotype 1). The said new introductions, as well as recent (up to 2018) BTV events in Israel, in the region and globally, are among the topics addressed in a recent review paper (Ref. 1).
