Trinity University announced on Tue 22 Sep 2015 that the illness that left dozens of students sick to their stomachs was the highly contagious norovirus.

San Antonio Metro Health said the illness was contained in a few days and believes the norovirus was a 48-hour bug.

For the last week, the university's health services staff saw 58 students with symptoms of norovirus. Another 22 students have reportedly called or emailed to say they also had symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. That adds up to 80 cases total.

Metro Health physicians collected stool samples to determine the possibility of the illness being norovirus. They said they tried to curb transmission through hand washing, fruit and vegetable washing, surface washing, and encouraged people with symptoms to stay home.

The university believes the outbreak started from a student that got sick somewhere else and spread it on campus.

Metro Health said the only treatment for norovirus is making sure the patient is hydrated. Patients are also advised to stay home for 2 days until their symptoms go away.

Norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis -- i.e. inflammation of the stomach and intestines leading to cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea -- in the United States. Each year, it causes 19-21 million illnesses and contributes to 56 000-71 000 hospitalizations and 570-800 deaths. Deaths are usually in less developed countries and in the very young, elderly, and immunosuppressed.

The virus is transmitted by fecally contaminated food or water, by person-to-person contact, and via aerosolization of the virus and subsequent contamination of surfaces. Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, projectile vomiting, malodorous watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, and low-grade fever may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous, and most who contract it make a full recovery within a couple of days. Norovirus is rapidly inactivated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants and polyquaternary amines, but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents.

After infection, immunity to norovirus is usually incomplete and temporary. Outbreaks of norovirus infection often occur in closed or semi-closed communities, such as long-term care facilities, overnight camps, hospitals, schools, prisons, dormitories, and cruise ships, where the infection spreads very rapidly either by person-to-person transmission or through contaminated food. Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by one infected person.

The genus name Norovirus is derived from Norwalk virus, the only species of the genus. The species causes approximately 90 percent of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world and may be responsible for 50 percent of all foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the United States.
