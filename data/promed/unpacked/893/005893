As many as 12 residents of Gunungkidul Regency, Yogyakarta Special Region, have been confirmed to have contracted anthrax. This confirmation was obtained after the Gunungkidul Health Office examined a sample of 26 residents at the Bogor Veterinary Research Center (BBLivet). Residents whose samples were sent had blisters on their skin, similar to symptoms of anthrax.

"(12 are positive), the others are negative," said Dewi Irawaty, head of the Gunungkidul Health Service, when contacted on Wednesday [9 Feb 2022]. Residents who tested positive for anthrax live in Kapanewon Gedangsari [Gedangsari district] and Kapanewon Ponjong. The Gunungkidul Health Office is said to be still monitoring the location of the emergence of anthrax cases. "Surveillance is still being carried out," said Dewi.

Dewi said anthrax is a zoonotic disease, which is only transmitted from animals to humans, not between humans. However, she said the basis for preventing anthrax depends on the behavior of residents, who have to be selective in choosing fresh meat and make sure it is from healthy animals.

Meanwhile, for the handling of livestock, the Gunungkidul Livestock and Animal Health Service has made a series of efforts to minimize the spread. Head of the Animal Health Division at the Gunungkidul Livestock and Animal Health Service (DPKH), Retno Widyastuti, suggested that livestock such as cattle and goats that were dead should be buried immediately. He explained that the highest risk of anthrax transmission occurred when the cattle were sick and then slaughtered. [And butchered. - Mod.MHJ]

[Again, many thanks to Mahmoud for forwarding this report.

This rounds out the initial investigation. Anthrax has been laboratory confirmed now in both livestock and humans. The only relevant comment one can make is that if anyone with the typical itchy painless skin lesion is laboratory "negative", give the antibiotics all the same as human diagnoses are difficult with a sensitivity around 70%, not 100%. How these animals came to be infected has yet to be clarified, if possible.

Any herd subjected to an outbreak of anthrax should be vaccinated annually for up to 5 years to stop recurrences and neighboring herds should also be similarly vaccinated. Judging when an area is free of risk depends on the knowledge of the local livestock owners. At some point, one will stop vaccinating but it is vitally important for all to be aware of any unsuspected death, which must be called in and investigated. These usually are anthrax cases in unvaccinated animals, and thus the need to continue vaccinating for say 3 years. Effective control is usually some 8 years and then followed by active surveillance to confirm eradication. Whatever the textbooks say, this is an eradicable disease.

Not mentioned in these reports was the disposal of anthrax carcasses, although obviously some were home butchered and the meat sold or given away. Carcasses, if possible, should be burnt and any bloody soil treated with disinfectant, the stronger the better.
