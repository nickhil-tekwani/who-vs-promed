The number of dead seals on the Kazakh coast of the Caspian, which fell
victims of an unknown epidemic, topped 3000, the republican agency for
emergencies reported on Tuesday. Their remains were collected and
destroyed. Specialists are worried over the rising death toll among the sea
animals, threatening the very existence of the entire population. The
reason for the epidemic has not been discovered up to this time, despite
efforts by biologists from Kazakhstan, Russia and Britain.

[We have received the following offer of help from The Netherlands. I have
passed it to my contacts in Kazakhstan but as yet have had no reply. Maybe
members will have other more direct ways of passing this information on. -

We received the information about the mass die-off of caspian seals in the
Caspian Sea. Please can you sent us information about institutions or
persons to which or whom we can offer our help [in Kazakhstan. Our
Institution (The SRRC: Seal Rehabilitation and Research Centre) and the
Erasmus University of Rotterdam, department of Virology, are specialised in
(virological) research on mass mortalities in seals and dolphins. Moreover
we are experienced in rehabilitation of all kinds of seals. In 1988 we
discovered the cause of the mass mortality of seals in the North Sea and in
1997 we were in action in Mauritania when there was a mass die-off among
the highly endangered monk seals. If you can give us any information,
please contact either Prof Osterhaus (email: osterhaus@viro.fgg.eur.nl) or
the SRRC (email: pieterburen_seals@wxs.nl)
