Pygmy and Dwarf sperm whales (_Kogia breviceps_ and _K. simus_) are the
most commonly stranded cetacean in Florida, after the bottle-nosed dolphin,
thus 3 strandings in two months would not be terribly unusual. In my
experience with _Kogia_ (both in Florida and California) all stranded
_Kogia_ are clinically ill, often emaciated, typically are dehydrated and
universally have gastric ulcers and ascarid infections.

They were certainly stressed and may have not been eating but it doesn't
indicate they can't digest food. As to irregular heart beat,
cardiomyopathy, similar to that induced by a thiamine deficiency, is a
recognized disorder of Kogia stranding on the east coast of Florida
(Bossart et al. 1985 JAVMA 187:1137-1140). I agree with the moderator that
there is not indication yet to suspect a viral disorder.
