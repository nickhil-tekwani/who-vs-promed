Pennsylvania officials have reported an alarming increase in sexually transmitted infections [STIs] in a county outside of Pittsburgh as local health experts say young people are more promiscuous than ever.

Beaver county saw a 300 percent increase in HIV and 34 percent increase in gonorrhea among 15- to 24-year-olds in 2017 compared to 2016, and the trend has continued into 2018, according to the alert released early this month.

Rates of STIs in the US have increased significantly in the last 3 years on record, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 50 percent of cases are diagnosed in people aged 15 to 24.

Data suggests rates of sexual activity among teens and young adults have been consistent across the past few decades and use of contraception is increasing, so experts say budget cuts for STD prevention programs may be to blame.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health issued an alert at the beginning of the month [March 2018] that there has been an increase in HIV and gonorrhea cases in Beaver county, located about 30 miles [18.6 mi] northwest of Pittsburgh.

Health officials say there's been a similar trend in Allegheny county, the 2nd-largest county in the state where Pittsburgh is located.

'Our incidence rates for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV have and continue to exceed the state's incidence rates,' Dr Karen Hacker, Allegheny county health department director, told [KDKA-TV].

Earlier this month [March 2018], health officials in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, revealed that at least 125 people had been diagnosed with HIV, syphilis, or both. The 'cluster' is being treated as a citywide health issue particularly among people between the aged of 15 and 24 [see ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (02): (WI) cluster, mostly young men, HIV, congenital 20180310.5678019].

Dr Frank DiCenzo, an OB-GYN in Pittsburgh, claims that the increase is a result of teens being more promiscuous in recent years. 'I've seen high school students who tell me they've had multiple sexual partners,' DiCenco told KDKA. 'Ladies as young as 14. And they have what they call sex partners. Someone that is a friend that they have sex with.' Additionally, Dr DiCenzo said he thinks they are less likely to be using protection. However, available data does not support either of those conclusions.

The most recent national data indicates that rates of sexual activity among adolescents and young adults have not changed in the last 2 decades, but there has been an increase in contraceptive use. In 2015, 30 percent of teens indicated that they were sexually active, meaning they had had sex at least once in the preceding 3 months, and 41 percent had had sex at least once in their lifetime. The number of teens who reported having had 4 or more sexual partners was 11.5 percent between 2011 and 2015, down from 19 percent in 2002. Data from 2011-2015 shows that 81 percent of female teens used some type of contraception when they first had intercourse, up from 74 percent in 2002. Similarly, 77 percent of male teens used a condom during first intercourse, up from 71 percent in 2002.

From 2008 to 2014, the number of HIV cases in the US declined 18 percent. However, national rates for gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia have increased in each of the last 3 years on record -- 2014, 2015, and 2016.

Experts say a decrease in funding for STD programs may be behind the increase in rates. According to the CDC, more than half of state and local programs experienced budget cuts. 'One big challenge is cuts to STD control programs that means public health is constantly being asked to do a bigger job with diminishing resources,' Fred Wyand, director of communications at the American Sexual Health Association told Daily Mail Online. 'This a discussion with much nuance and not a single, simple answer but public health advocates consistently report to an eroding STD [sexually transmitted diseases] prevention infrastructure as a key element in driving STD rates.'

In February [2018], Pennsylvania's Allegheny county opened a clinic that exclusively treats STDs and HIV in response to the increasing rates. Health officials in the area warn that anyone who is sexually active get tested because often symptoms take weeks or months to appear or never present at all.

[ProMED-mail recently posted a report on the Milwaukee outbreak of syphilis and HIV (Syphilis - USA (02): (WI) cluster, mostly young men, HIV, congenital 20180310.5678019). I commented in the moderator comments that the Milwaukee outbreak may represent what the CDC has recently defined as a "rapidly growing cluster" (RGC) of people infected by genetically similar HIV strains (http://www.croiconference.org/sites/default/files/uploads/40.pdf). The CDC and co-workers reported 60 RGC in 20 states in all regions of the country. RGC had 5-42 persons during a 12-month period and HIV transmission rates ranging from 21-132 transmission events (median of 44) per 100 person-years compared with the national average of 4 transmission events per 100 person-years. The 903 persons in RGC were disproportionately young men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly young Hispanic/Latino MSM.

The Beaver county, Pennsylvania outbreak may be another example of a RGC, in this case involving HIV and gonorrhea among 15- to 24-year-olds. However, the news report above did not characterize the infected individuals as to race/ethnicity, sexual behavior, or use of cell phone apps, such as Grindr, "party drugs", PrEP, etc. Knowing this type of information may help pinpoint prevention efforts. Also missing is data on the genetic relatedness of the HIV strains causing the Beaver county outbreak. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Beaver county, with a population of 170 539 residents in 2010, is in the US state of Pennsylvania and is immediately northwest of Allegheny county, whose county seat is the city of Pittsburgh, the second largest city in Pennsylvania, with a metropolitan population of about 2.3 million residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania).
