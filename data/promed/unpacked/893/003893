A kidney transplant patient in WA [Western Australia] has died after
developing Australia's 1st case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza
resistant to oseltamivir (Tamiflu). However, the virus still appears
to be sensitive to zanamivir (Relenza) says Dr David Speers,
Infectious Diseases Physician at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in
Perth, in a case report in the MJA [the Medical Journal of Australia]
today, 11 Jan 2010;
<http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/192_03_010210/spe11148_fm.html>].

Dr Speers and colleagues say their patient initially became infected
with wild-type [i.e. oseltamivir-sensitive] (H1N1) 2009 influenza
virus after undergoing a renal transplant and while taking
immunosuppressant drugs. After a 10-day course of oral oseltamivir,
the patient developed rapid-onset severe primary viral pneumonia due
to oseltamivir-resistant virus, and respiratory failure progressed
despite high-dose oral oseltamvir and nebulised zanamivir. The patient
improved and became negative for influenza after being treated with
intravenous zanamivir but subsequently died from intraperitoneal sepsis.

The report's authors say the resistant virus contained the H275Y NA
[neuraminidase] mutation, which is the major [so far only known]
mechanism for oseltamivir resistance in influenza virus infection.
Until now, most of the 31 cases of resistance reported worldwide have
occurred in people taking oseltamivir as post-exposure prophylaxis,
they note.

They say the patient developed the resistant [virus] a few days after
stopping his initial course of oseltamivir, "possibly due to declining
blood and tissue levels of the antiviral drug." They conclude by
saying that intravenous zanamivir may prove to be a useful antiviral
therapy for severely unwell influenza patients, including those with
oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection.

[This 1st oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in
Australia was isolated during the course of treatment of an
immunosuppressed renal transplant patient with high doses of the
antiviral drug. The patient developed severe respiratory disease
thought to be the consequence of selection of drug resistant virus as
a result of treatment with high doses of oseltamivir.

Subsequently, the resistant virus infection was cleared by intravenous
administration of the alternate influenza virus neuraminidase
inhibitor zanamivir, and the patient recovered, although,
unfortunately, he did not ultimately survive the organ
transplantation. Nonetheless, it is concluded that intraveous
administration of zanamivir may be a useful mode of antiviral therapy
in cases of oseltamivir resistance.
