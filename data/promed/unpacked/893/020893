On 13 February, an outbreak of an unidentified disease was reported to have
occurred in Darwaz, Badakhshan, Afghanistan. On 26 February, a specialized
WHO team arrived on site at one of the affected villages, Jamarche Bala,
with the logistic support of the United Nations system. Other villages were
visited by _Medecins sans frontieres_ and Focus (Aga Khan Foundation).
The outbreak began around mid-January after 2 young men returned from the
village of Waram, both suffering from an acute respiratory infection. Over
the next 2 days, approximately 40 persons living in the same household
became ill. The disease then spread through the whole village, affecting
70%-80% of households. The village has a population of 5 400. The deaths
occurred among both males and females and involved primarily infants and
the elderly. The most recent case was reported on 26 February. Cases were
treated by the team with chloramphenicol, which resulted in a significant
improvement, suggesting that severely ill patients were suffering from
secondary bacterial infections. There were no deaths among those treated.

The disease is flu-like and is characterized by abrupt onset of fever,
headaches and myalgia, followed by chest pain and cough. Living and
sanitary conditions are crowded, and the water supply is unprotected.
Nutrition is of poor quality. There are no health services in this very
remote area, which has not been accessed by routine immunization teams.
Preliminary conclusions of the WHO team in the field is that the outbreak
now declining was an influenza-like illness which has affected a large
proportion of the population. The rate of secondary complications (mainly
pneumonia) was high. Mortality is 1%-2% of the total population primarily
due to lack of antibiotic availability and overall poor living and
nutritional conditions.
WHO and its local partners are now helping local authorities to organize
follow-up treatment and arranging for additional medical supplies to the
area. Clinical specimens collected by the field team will be analysed shortly.
