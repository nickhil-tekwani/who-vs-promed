A citrus disease that has killed and destroyed more than 100 million trees worldwide has been detected in T&T [Trinidad and Tobago]. [It] is called huanglongbing (yellow dragon disease), HLB or citrus greening, [and] has been identified in more than 40 countries. In the Caribbean, Jamaica and Belize have been severely affected.

Farmers want to know if this is the reason why the Ministry of Agriculture [MoA] has stopped the sales of citrus plants at its 3 nurseries. The T&T Cooperative Citrus Growers Association's Felix Clarke said, "I made a report to the MoA [about] a sighting of HLB, [but] nothing has happened. They're sitting on a problem that has the potential to destroy the remaining citrus crops in the country." A laboratory was set up in St Augustine with screen houses to produce viral-free and high-quality planting material, but was still not operational.

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (Asian greening; huanglongbing, HLB), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening), or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel, and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. _Ca._ L. asiaticus and americanus are spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_). The main vector for _Ca._ L. africanus is the African citrus psyllid _Trioza erytreae_. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Alternative management approaches, such as detection of infected trees by sniffer dogs and cultural control by interplanting with non-host crops, are being trialled. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of greening outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).
