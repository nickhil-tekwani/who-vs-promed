Pumpkin crops hit hard by mildew
--------------------------------
The 2010 warm, humid summer is causing trouble for area pumpkin
growers who are finding some of their plants infected with powdery
mildew. "Some of the leaves are speckled and some completely turned
white," a farmer said. He estimated that about 25 percent of his
pumpkin plants have been infected. "I think this has definitely been
the worst year ever," he said.

Cornell Cooperative Extension's Stephen F VanderMark said, "I suspect
it could be worse than past years. It's also coming earlier in the
season. You may end up with fewer pumpkins of smaller size and may
notice all the effects of crippled plant growth." Pumpkins also may
end up with poor rind color and shriveled, discolored handles.
Powdery mildew also predisposes plants to other diseases.

Mr VanderMark said the right mix of humid weather and adequate
rainfall, along with some windy days, helped the spores develop and
spread among the plants. "It's a perfect set of conditions for this
mildew to really spread quickly and do damage," he said. The problem
can be mitigated by spraying the plants with fungicide. Keeping the
weeds under control and spreading the vines out can also help.

[The 2 most commonly recorded fungi causing cucurbit powdery mildew
are _Golovinomyces orontii_ (previously _Erysiphe cichoracearum_) and
_Podosphaera fuliginea_ (previously _Sphaerotheca fuliginea _). The
fungi appear to be present in varying combinations and amounts
depending on the area. Different strains exist and can affect a range
of cucurbit hosts. White fungal growth develops on both leaf
surfaces, petioles, and stems producing masses of spores leading to a
'powdery' appearance. Fruit may be deformed or discoloured and of
inferior quality. Heavy infection leads to reduced photosynthetic
ability and decreased plant vigour, which can cause serious yield losses.

The fungi are thought to overwinter primarily on plant debris and
glasshouse crops. Spores are spread by wind, water, and mechanical
means. Disease management includes fungicides and cultural practices
to remove inoculum and improve air circulation in crops (as mentioned
above). Varieties with different levels of resistance are available
for pumpkin and some of the other cucurbit crops.
