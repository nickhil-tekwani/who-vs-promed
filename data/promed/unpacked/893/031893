The prefecture of Meuse warned in a statement that 3 cases of Aujeszky's disease (AD) were confirmed in late 2013 in hunting dogs who had been in contact with wild boars in the communes of Loisey and Sommedieue.

This disease is caused by a herpesvirus that invades the domestic pig and wild boar but less frequently may be transmitted to other species such as carnivores, ruminants, and equines. This disease is not transmissible to humans.

Carnivores can be infected by ingesting offal and uncooked meat of pigs or wild boar, by a bite, or direct contact, such as during a hunt.

The predominant clinical signs in dogs are those of encephalomyelitis, paralysis of the larynx, and significant pruritus, which may lead the animal to harm itself. Incubation lasts from 2 to 6 days and death is rapid, within 48 hours after onset of symptoms. There is no treatment.

Protective measures that can be considered for dogs are the limiting of contact with wild boars and refraining from feeding them with offal or uncooked (pig) meat.

The prefecture of Meuse states that any owner whose dog(s) have symptoms of this disease should contact their veterinarian or the Departmental Directorate of Social Cohesion and Protection of the Population (DDCSPP), Meuse (Tel. 03 29 77 42 00).

[Aujeszky's disease (AD), also known as pseudorabies, is included in OIE's list of reportable diseases (multi-species group).

AD is caused by an alphaherpesvirus that infects the central nervous system and other organs, such as the respiratory tract, of various mammals (such as dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, rabbits, foxes, minks) except humans and the tailless apes. It is associated primarily with pigs, the natural hosts, which remain latently infected following clinical recovery (except piglets under 2 weeks old, which die from encephalitis). In consequence, the pig is the only species able to survive a productive infection and therefore, serves as the reservoir host. In pigs, the severity of clinical signs depends on the age of the pig, the route of infection, the virulence of the infecting strain, and the immunological status of the animal. Young piglets are highly susceptible with mortality rates reaching 100 per cent during the 1st 2 weeks of age. When pigs are older than 2 months (grower-finisher pigs), the respiratory forms become predominant with hyperthermia, anorexia, and mild to severe respiratory signs. In other species, AD is less common. In cattle and sheep, it is almost always fatal within a few days, clinically resembling scrapie: the 1st symptom is intense pruritus concentrated in a patch of skin, usually manifested as severe licking, rubbing, or gnawing. Affected animals become progressively weaker, and eventually recumbent. Convulsions, bellowing, teeth grinding, cardiac irregularities, and rapid, shallow breathing are common. The clinical signs are similar in dogs and cats, and a combination of neurologic signs, pharyngeal paralysis, and profuse salivation may resemble rabies. Affected animals typically die within 1 to 2 days.

A diagnosis of Aujeszky's disease is established by detecting the agent (virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), as well as by detecting a serological response in the live animal.

Aujeszky's disease is endemic in many parts of the world, but several countries, such as the USA, Canada, New Zealand, and many member states of the European Union, have successfully completed eradication programmes.

The above and additional information on AD is available in OIE's relevant manual chapter, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.02_AUJESZKYS_DIS.pdf and in http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/aujeszkys_disease.pdf.
