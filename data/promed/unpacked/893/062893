Sexual Transmission of Hepatitis C Virus
----------------------------------------
In the United States, an estimated 3.2 million persons are living
with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (1). HCV transmission occurs
primarily through percutaneous exposure to blood, and persons who
inject drugs are at greatest risk for infection. The role of sexual
transmission of HCV has not been well defined. However, reports over
the past decade, mainly from Europe, have implicated sexual
transmission of HCV among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
men who have sex with men (MSM). In late 2005, 2 HIV-infected MSM,
each with acute HCV infection that was suspected to have been acquired
sexually, were evaluated at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York
City, prompting Mount Sinai to request referrals of similar patients
(2). During 2005--2010, a total of 74 HIV-infected MSM with recently
acquired HCV infection and no reported history of injection-drug use
were evaluated. To examine the role of sexual transmission, a matched
case-control study and viral analysis were conducted. Results from the
case-control study showed that high-risk sexual behavior was the most
likely mode of transmission among these men. Phylogenetic analyses
revealed 5 clusters of closely related HCV variants, suggesting
networks of transmission among these men. The findings underscore the
importance of screening HIV-infected MSM for HCV, particularly those
engaged in high-risk sexual behavior.

MMWR Editorial Note:
--------------------
This report suggests high-risk sexual behavior as a cause of HCV
transmission among HIV-infected MSM in New York City. Unprotected
receptive anal intercourse with ejaculation and sex while high on
methamphetamine were the most important predictors of HCV infection.
Results from phylogenetic analyses suggest networks of HCV
transmission among these men. The findings of high-risk sex,
concurrent noninjection-drug use, and phylogenetic clustering are
similar to those observed among cohorts of HIV-infected MSM with HCV
infection in Northern Europe and Australia (4). A notable finding from
this study and those in other countries is the association of
noninjection, recreational drug use (e.g., methamphetamine use) with
the acquisition of HCV infection.

Sexual transmission of HCV is considered to be an inefficient and
rare mode of transmission (6). However, concurrent HIV infection
results in increased HCV RNA levels (viral load) (7), which are
thought to increase infectiousness of HCV acquired through sexual
contact. Of further concern among persons who are coinfected is that
HIV accelerates HCV disease progression, even in its early stages (2).
End-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, both usually
resulting from chronic HCV infection, are now leading causes of death
not attributable to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among
HIV-infected persons in the United States (8).

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations.
1st, recall of events such as ejaculation by sex partner up to 12
months before HCV diagnosis can be imperfect. For example, the
findings should not be interpreted to definitively exclude acquisition
of HCV by some men through unprotected receptive anal intercourse
without ejaculation, even though this variable did not exert a
significant independent effect on HCV infection in the multivariable
analysis. 2nd, refusal to acknowledge injection-drug use is not
uncommon, and other types of stigmatizing risk behavior also might be
underreported. Such social desirability bias was addressed by using a
self-administered questionnaire and assuring each patient that his
responses would not be shared with his primary-care provider. Finally,
study investigators relied on patient referrals from HIV-care
providers outside Mount Sinai, and referral bias might have occurred;
however, the number of referring providers was fairly sizable (n =
35).

Sexual transmission of HCV among HIV-infected MSM is more widespread
than this one study demonstrates. A recent U.S. report described
HCV-antibody seroconversions among HIV-infected MSM without a history
of injection-drug use (9). A recent European report that examined a
group of studies, primarily from Europe, found substantial increases,
particularly during 2002--2007, in the incidence of HCV infection
among HIV-infected MSM, demonstrating just how serious the epidemic
has become among these men (10). Hepatitis C should be added to the
list of infections spread among HIV-infected MSM who have sex with
HCV- infected partners HIV-infected patients should be counseled and
reminded that unprotected sex between HIV-infected partners can
transmit other infections, including HCV. In addition to HCV screening
for MSM newly diagnosed with HIV, routine HCV screening using both ALT
and antibody testing should be considered for HIV-infected MSM,
particularly those with high-risk sexual behaviors or concomitant
ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., syphilis and herpes
simplex virus). Finally, newly diagnosed HCV infections among
HIV-infected MSM should be reported to state and local health
authorities.

[This report indicates that certain forms of high risk sexual
behavior by by HIV-infected men is a a cause of HCV transmission among
HIV-infected MSM in New York City, confirming European data. It
remains true, however, that sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus
infection occurs rarely and is an inefficient mode of transmission. -
