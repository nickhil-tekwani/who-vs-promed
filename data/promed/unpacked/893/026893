Abstract
--------
Background: The 1st recognized cases of _Borrelia miyamotoi_ disease (BMD) in North America were reported in the northeastern United States in 2013.

Objective: To further describe the clinical spectrum and laboratory findings for BMD.

Design: Case series.

Setting: Patients presenting to primary care offices, emergency departments, or urgent care clinics in 2013 and 2014.

Participants: Acutely febrile patients from the northeastern United States in whom the treating health care providers suspected and ordered testing for tick-transmitted infections.

Measurements: Whole-blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed for the presence of specific DNA sequences of common tickborne infections (including BMD). Serologic testing for _B. miyamotoi_ was performed using a recombinant glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (rGlpQ) protein. Clinical records were analyzed to identify the major features of acute disease.

Results: Among 11 515 patients tested, 97 BMD cases were identified by PCR. Most of the 51 case patients on whom clinical histories were reviewed presented with high fever, chills, marked headache, and myalgia or arthralgia; 24 per cent were hospitalized. Elevated liver enzyme levels, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were common. At presentation, 16 per cent of patients with BMD were seropositive for IgG and/or IgM antibody to _B. miyamotoi_ rGlpQ. Most (78 per cent) had seropositive convalescent specimens. Symptoms resolved after treatment with doxycycline, and no chronic sequelae or symptoms were observed.

Limitation: Findings were based on specimens submitted for testing to a reference laboratory, and medical records of only 51 of the 97 case patients with BMD were reviewed.

Conclusion: Patients with BMD presented with nonspecific symptoms, including fever, headache, chills, myalgia, and arthralgia. Laboratory confirmation of BMD was possible by PCR on blood from acutely symptomatic patients who were seronegative at presentation. _Borrelia miyamotoi_ disease may be an emerging tickborne infection in the northeastern United States.

[Mod.ML commented on the 19 Feb 2014 post (ProMED-mail archive no. 20140220.2289846), "For a detailed discussion of _Borrelia miyamotoi_, the clinical presentations of illness produced by this organism and its epidemiology, please see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail posts Tick-borne borreliosis - USA: (South. New Engl., NY) _B. miyamotoi_ 20130118.1504740 and Tick-borne borreliosis - USA (02): (MA,NJ) B. miyamotoi 20130703.1805219; and moderator LL's comments in posts Tick-borne relapsing fever - Russia: (SV) Borrelia miyamotoi 20110920.2858 and Tick-borne relapsing fever - USA (02): discussion 20110824.2580.

It is apparent that human infection with _B. miyamotoi_ can present as a non-specific acute febrile illness with fever as high as 39.5 deg C (103.1 deg F), headache, and myalgias or as a relapsing fever-like illness. It also has the potential to be misdiagnosed as Lyme disease, although _B. miyamotoi_ usually does not cause the bull's eye-shaped rash that characterizes Lyme disease; or can be misdiagnosed as human granulocytic anaplasmosis, 2 other tick-borne diseases. The infection has also presented in an elderly, immunocompromised woman with confusion and an unsteady gait.

_B. miyamotoi_ can be detected by PCR in the blood of infected patients, or the diagnosis can be made with a specific serologic test, for example, that uses _Borrelia miyamotoi_ GlpQ protein (an antigen that is nonreactive to _Borrelia burgdorferi_ antibody), but these tests may not be widely available. The 2-step serology for Lyme disease is usually negative in _B. miyamotoi_ infections. Because of its non-specific clinical presentation and lack of readily available diagnostic laboratory tests, the true extent of _B. miyamotoi_ infection may be underappreciated."

_B. miyamotoi_ in the Northeastern USA is transmitted by _Ixodes scapulars_, the same tick that transmits the Lyme disease spirochete. Publication of the above case series will doubtless raise awareness of _B. miyamotoi_ infections and lead to the reporting of additional cases. - Mod.TY
