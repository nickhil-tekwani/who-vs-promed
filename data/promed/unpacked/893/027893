HEPATITIS, NON-A TO G VIRUS ISOLATED

A paper published in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications
(241:92-97, December, 1997) reported a novel agent associated with
post-transfusion hepatitis. This agent was identified as a novel DNA virus
with poor homology to known sequences.
Researchers in Japan isolated a viral clone of 500 nucleotides from the
serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. A
specific primer was created and used to test for viral DNA. Five patients
with non-A to G post-transfusion hepatitis were tested for viral DNA using
PCR. Three tested positive for the virus [DNA], including the original
case.
In two cases the patient ALT [alanine amino transferase, a liver enzyme]
levels were closely associated with viral [?] titers. Viremia [or at least
circulating viral DNA] appeared to be transient in two cases (positive for
4 to 6 weeks); the last case had persistent viremia [circulating DNA] at 21
weeks.
The researchers have designated this virus TTV. In light of the fact that
HGV has not been shown to be a major cause of non-A thru E hepatitis, this
virus may be a candidate [for that disease?]. The primers are available,
so a serologic study [using expressed antigen] of blood donors would be
fairly straight forward.
