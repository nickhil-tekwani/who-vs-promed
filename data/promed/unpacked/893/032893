Ireland Reports Suspected Mad Cow Disease in County Louth
---------------------------------------------------------
Ireland, Europe's 2nd-largest beef exporter, found a suspected case of mad cow disease in a dairy cow in County Louth.

Tests are being taken to confirm whether the 5-year-old animal had mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, according to a statement from the country's Agriculture Department. Results should be available in a week [around 18 Jun 2015]. If confirmed, it would be the 1st case in Ireland since 2013. The cow didn't enter the food supply and was discovered through a surveillance program testing animals that die on farms, according to the statement. Researchers will also examine other animals related to the infected cow.

"From an international trade point of view, it's not particularly positive," John Lancaster, a dairy analyst at INTL FCStone in Dublin, said by phone. "We export 90 percent of our beef here, so the export markets are of critical importance."

Ireland has stepped up control measures for mad cow disease since the 1990s, with the number of cases falling from more than 300 in 2002 to zero last year [2014], according to the Agriculture Department. The Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health last month [May 2015] lowered Ireland's risk status for the disease to "negligible" from "controlled," saying that the improved ranking would facilitate trade. The U.S. lifted a 15-year ban on Irish beef earlier this year [2015]. China, the world's 3rd-biggest beef consumer, also relaxed import restrictions, the Irish Food Board said in February [2015].

More than 185 000 BSE cases in cattle were confirmed in the European Union during the epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s. Cases were also found in U.S. herds in 2003, prompting countries including Japan and South Korea to halt imports. The most-recent U.S. case was in 2012. Other cases have been reported this year in Canada and Norway, according to the animal health organization, known by its French acronym OIE.

BSE is a transmissible brain disease that is fatal for cattle. Eating meat from BSE-infected animals has been tied to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an incurable human illness that destroys brain tissue.

Ireland ranked behind the Netherlands as the EU's top beef exporter last year [2014], including fresh and frozen supplies shipped within the bloc and externally, according to Eurostat, the bloc's statistics office.

[According to another source (TheJournal.ie): The "suspected BSE case is '80 percent likely' to test positive for the disease." If it's confirmed, it will be the 1st case of BSE found in Ireland since 2013. The Department of Agriculture said earlier that a suspected bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) case had been identified in County Louth, Ireland. The suspected case of the disease was identified in a 5-year-old cow on a dairy farm. The cow was of the Rotbunt breed, which is rare in Ireland, and there hasn't been a comparable case in such a cow since 2005. Though the results of the test will be confirmed in a week, the investigation should last a number of weeks.

The screening sample was taken on Tuesday (9 Jun 2015) and sent to the Backweston laboratory for testing. The initial result came through, but further testing is needed.
