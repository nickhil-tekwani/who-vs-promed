China warns against unsafe, maverick research into bird flu
--------------------------------------------------
Citing a recent government notice, the Beijing News reported that China has
warned maverick scientists against conducting "unsafe" research into bird
flu, ordering them to seek explicit approval from the authorities first,
and that the ministry of agriculture must give the green light before
anyone can transport microbe samples abroad, stating, "No unit or person is
allowed to dissect poultry or wild animals that have died from disease, or
to collect or transport samples without the approval of animal health
authorities at the provincial level or above. No unit or person is allowed
to collect samples and microbes and ship them overseas without the
agriculture ministry's permission."
The story notes that the warning came a month after the government
acknowledged more than 1000 migratory birds had been found dead from the
H5N1 strain of avian flu in northwest China's Qinghai province.

[China has recently demonstrated the first -- though modest -- signs of
willingness to improve transparency in relation to animal health.
Hopefully, this newswire does not herald a return to the old unfortunate
tendency towards covertness. - Mod.AS]
