Ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A in Nis, Serbia: a preliminary report
-----------------------------------------------
Hepatitis A is still a great problem in developing countries, especially
those in which vaccination is not obligatory. It is well known that
hepatitis A is associated with risk factors such as poor sanitation and
inadequate hygiene. However, some investigations (such as in Spain and
Greece) showed that the seroprevalence of antibodies against hepatitis A
virus (HAV) in recent decades has decreased, especially in the younger
adults, most likely due to improvements in living standards and hygienic
conditions [1-4]. This raises the question of the possible emergence of
this disease at an older age, highlighting the necessity of applying
appropriate preventative strategies.
Although similar studies have not been performed in Serbia, we assume that
the improvement of hygienic conditions (which are not optimal but better
than 20 years ago) has led to reduced numbers of individuals protected by
antibodies against hepatitis A virus also in the Serbian population.
Hepatitis A situation in Nis, Serbia
------------------------------------
In Nis, as in the whole of Serbia, hepatitis A is the most common type of
viral hepatitis. It occurs every year sporadically and in the form of small
home-centred clusters. A total number of 694 serologically confirmed
hepatitis A cases had been registered in Nis from 1987 to 2006 (average
annual incidence rate of about 14/100 000). In the non-epidemic years (from
1987 to 2006, except 1987, 1994, and 2003), the average incidence of
hepatitis A in Nis was about 10/100 000 population.
The last large epidemic of this disease occurred in Nis in 1987, with 123
serologically confirmed cases and an incidence of 50/100 000. Two smaller
outbreaks were reported in 1994 and 2003, with 70 (incidence 28/100 000)
and 60 cases (incidence 24/100 000), respectively. In addition, a large
number of non-serologically confirmed cases (1170) for whom diagnosis was
based on clinical signs, biochemical parameters (AST, ALT and bilirubin
levels) and epidemiological data were registered in this period (1987-2006).
In Nis, serological diagnosis for hepatitis B has been performed since 1986
and for hepatitis C since 1992. No serologically confirmed cases of
hepatitis B and C were included among the non-differentiated hepatitis
cases. Serodiagnosis of the other hepatitis infections (G, E) has not yet
been introduced in Nis. Assuming that most (but not all) of
non-differentiated hepatitis cases were hepatitis A, the total number of
cases in the observed period would be about 1800 (average annual incidence
rate of 37/100 000). The disease predominantly occurred among those aged 7
to 19 years of both sexes (illustrated by a figure in the original text).
In the past 20 years, in southeast Serbia where Nis is located, no
foodborne or waterborne epidemics of hepatitis A have been reported.
Vaccination against hepatitis A is not mandatory in Serbia.
Ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A in Nis
--------------------------------------
Since 2006, large outbreaks of hepatitis A have occurred in the towns
surrounding Nis (Prokuplje in 2006; Pirot, Bela Palanka, Leskovac,
Aleksinac, and Prokuplje in 2007). The inhabitants of these towns have
frequent contacts with citizens of Nis. (The number of reported cases of
hepatitis A in Nis in 2006 and 2007 is illustrated by a figure in the
original text, indicating that 2006 was a non-epidemic year with a total of
45 cases from January to December 2006 [incidence 18/100 000]).
From January 2007 to October 2007 hepatitis A occurred sporadically in
Nis. However, in the end of October, the hospital for infectious diseases
in Nis reported a higher number of cases than usual. Subsequent
epidemiological investigation revealed that from 8 Oct to 30 Nov 2007, the
total number of reported hepatitis A cases in Nis was 716 (illustrated by a
figure in the original text). About 150 of them (21 per cent) were
hospitalized. The highest number of cases (44) was registered on 1 Nov
2007. The diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical symptoms, biochemical
parameters (AST, ALT and bilirubin levels) or serological findings
(anti-HAV IgM).
All cases were living in Nis or in the neighbouring rural municipalities
and had many contacts with the town's inhabitants. The geographical
distribution of cases was even.
There were significant differences between the rates of disease in men and
women. Among the cases, there were 527 males (74 per cent) and 189 females
(26 per cent). Persons aged 20 to 35 years, male and female, made up the
majority of cases (378 or 53 per cent). The highest incidence rate was
among men aged 20 to 24 years (1 258/100 000) (illustrated by a figure in
the original text).
The occupation of the cases varied as did their socioeconomic status and
educational level.
Conclusion
----------
Initially, the shape of the outbreak epi curve indicated that the way of
infection (viral transmission) could be a result of a point source, that
is, drinking water or food. However, the results of drinking water analyses
performed in 2007 demonstrated no problems. The control of drinking water
was done in the Public Health Institute in Nis, and residual chlorine in
the investigated samples of drinking water was always on the recommended level.
Epidemiological investigations, including food questionnaires, demonstrated
that cases had bought and consumed food in various places all over the
city, and no specific product was implicated in the investigation. The
distribution of cases by age and sex showed that young males were most
often infected. However, no special risk factors could be associated with
this group.
Therefore, considering the hepatitis A epidemiological situation in south
east Serbia, especially in Nis and the neighbouring towns, we can presume
that the viral transmission in this outbreak occurred via direct contact
with cases (with or without clinical symptoms). The spread of disease was
facilitated by a long, hot and dry summer and poor hygienic and
environmental conditions. Also, the relatively low incidence of hepatitis A
in Nis over the past 20 years, low vaccination coverage and overall better
hygiene practices are thought to have increased the number of persons
susceptible to hepatitis A and contributed to this large and ongoing epidemic.
