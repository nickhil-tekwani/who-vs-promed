The US FDA says it has uncovered potential safety problems at 30 specialty pharmacies that were inspected in the wake of a recent outbreak of meningitis caused by contaminated drugs. The agency said its inspectors targeted 31 compounding pharmacies that produce sterile drugs, which must be prepared under highly sanitary conditions. The FDA said Thu 11 Apr 2013, it issued inspection reports to all but one of the pharmacies citing unsanitary conditions and quality control problems, including: rust and mold in supposedly sterile rooms, inadequate ventilation, and employees wearing non-sterile lab coats.

The agency generally issues such reports before taking formal action against companies. Inspectors visited pharmacies in 18 states, including Florida, Arizona, Colorado, Tennessee, and New Jersey. The wave of inspections comes in response to a deadly fungal meningitis outbreak linked to contaminated steroids from the New England Compounding Center, a Massachusetts pharmacy. The company's injections, mainly used to treat back pain, have been linked to 53 deaths and 733 illnesses since last summer [2012].

Compounding pharmacies are supposed to mix customized prescriptions based on individual doctors' instructions. However, some pharmacies like the New England Compounding Center have grown into larger businesses, supplying bulk quantities of injectable drugs to hospitals across the country.

The FDA has stepped up its oversight of the pharmacies since the outbreak was identified in September [2012], but agency officials say they have been slowed by the complex overlap of various state and federal laws that govern the industry. Pharmacies are licensed and overseen by state pharmacy boards, though the FDA sometimes intervenes when major safety issues arise.

In a blog post to the FDA's website [Thu 11 Apr 2013], FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg noted that 4 pharmacies initially refused to admit the agency's inspectors. In 2 cases the agency had to return with search warrants and US marshals to complete the inspections.

"These challenges and others highlight the need for clearer authorities for FDA to efficiently protect public health," Hamburg stated.

Hamburg has asked Congress to pass new laws giving the FDA explicit oversight over large compounding pharmacies. Under the proposal, large compounders would have to register with the FDA and undergo regular inspections, similar to pharmaceutical manufacturers.

But the FDA proposal has faced pushback from some members of Congress, particularly House Republicans, who have been investigating whether the FDA could have prevented the meningitis outbreak using its existing powers. The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee for Oversight and Investigations will hold its 2nd hearing on the issue next [Tue 16 Apr 2013]. Hamburg is scheduled to testify, according to committee staffers.

[2] FDA: Inspection Statement

Summary: 2013 FDA Pharmacy Inspection Assignment
------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
The agency recently took a critical look at our surveillance and enforcement approach to pharmacies that produce sterile drug products. The agency's objective was to determine whether certain pharmacies that were known to have produced high-risk sterile drug products in the past posed a significant threat to public health from poor sterile drug production practices.

Using a risk-based model, FDA identified 29 firms for priority inspections that focused on their sterile drug production practices. During these 29 inspections, in 2 instances, FDA identified secondary firms associated with the initial priority inspections, which it then inspected, for a total of 31 firms. Criteria for FDA's risk-based model included serious adverse event reports, historical inspection data, and reports of product quality problems. Facilities that met at least 2 criteria or had a reported death were identified for the priority inspections. The inspections took place over a 7 week period from February to April 2013. The Agency inspected these firms according to federal standards regarding aseptic practices.

The majority of the inspections (28/31; 90 percent) were completed in coordination with applicable state boards of pharmacy or other state officials. Each inspection evaluated the firm's sterile drug processes to identify firms that may pose a higher risk of producing unsafe or poor quality sterile drugs.

To conduct the inspections, FDA mobilized highly-skilled, certified drug investigators who have specialized experience and specific training to evaluate pharmaceutical production and determine a firm's compliance with sterile production standards. These investigators performed the targeted inspections in 18 states.

During each inspection, the investigators visually examined the firm's practices and procedures by observing the production environment, equipment used to make the drugs, the design of the facility, and personnel practices and behavior. In addition, FDA interviewed the firm's technicians and collected information on the firm's operations, standard operating procedures, and products to learn more about the effectiveness of the firm's sterilization methods and drug stability program. Finally, the investigators looked into the firm's potency, sterility, and endotoxin failures, as well as the firm's air flow studies (if present). If warranted, investigators collected samples when they observed an abnormality, such as drug product residues, particulates, or discoloration within the production environment or the actual sterile drug product.

Status
------
As of 11 Apr 2013, the agency had completed 29 of the 31 priority inspections, and FDA had issued a list of inspectional observations, called an FDA Form 483, to 28 of 29 firms. The one firm not receiving a FDA Form 483 was not producing sterile drugs. FDA has subsequently posted the FDA Form 483s on its website. Select FDA observations during the inspections include: incomplete and/or inadequate drug product batch failure investigations, inappropriate and/or inadequate clothing for sterile processing, lack of appropriate air filtration systems, insufficient microbiological testing, and other practices that create risk of contamination.

At one firm, Lowlite Investments, d/b/a Olympia Compounding Pharmacy in Orlando, Florida, FDA's inspection was delayed because investigators had to obtain an administrative warrant to gain access to, and make copies of, that firm's records. Once the warrant was obtained, US Marshals accompanied FDA investigators to the firm to collect records and conclude the inspection. In January 2013, FDA also had to obtain an administrative warrant to get access to records and complete a for-cause inspection of Wedgewood Pharmacy in Swedesboro, New Jersey.

In addition, 4 out of the 31 firms initially refused to permit FDA investigators access to records or to allow observation of their sterile processing activities. After some initial delay, and in some instances, discussion with the firms' legal counsel, these firms eventually provided the investigators the necessary access to inspect their facilities.

Next steps
----------
The agency is currently evaluating the information obtained during the inspections and where applicable, will apply its existing legal authority to protect the public health. For the firms that are operating outside the bounds of traditional pharmacy compounding and who had significant sterile production issues, FDA plans to take aggressive action, including through enforcement actions, as appropriate. Under the current regulatory framework, FDA may not be able to take enforcement action against firms that meet certain criteria and are operating within the bounds of traditional pharmacy compounding unless certain provisions of the law are violated, such as producing or distributing a contaminated drug product. However, FDA is coordinating closely with the state boards of pharmacy and referring the appropriate cases to them.

[3] Regulatory issues
Date: Thu 17 Apr 2013

In the wake of last year's [2012] horrific meningitis outbreak stemming from unsanitary practices at a Massachusetts-area compounding pharmacy -- facilities where certain drug batches are mixed and prepared -- the FDA launched a comprehensive investigation into compounders in 18 states. These facilities are largely out of the purview of federal oversight, which is why FDA director Margaret Hamburg has begged Congress to give her agency more power and clearer guidance to regulate them. But even though the FDA revealed last Thu 11 Apr 2013, that its investigation had found unsafe practices at nearly every facility it audited, House Republicans aren't sold on Hamburg's request, and question whether stronger FDA oversight of compounders is warranted.

During a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation, Republican lawmakers expressed skepticism that giving more power to the FDA would accomplish much. GOP committee members pointed out the FDA's past failure to avert crises such as the meningitis outbreak that killed over 50 Americans. "10 years of warning signs, alarm bells, and flashing red lights were deliberately ignored. Ultimately, the FDA knew [the compounding facility] was breaking the law but chose to do nothing," said subcommittee chairman Rep. Tom Murphy (Republican-Pennsylvania).

As Hamburg pointed out in her testimony, that's a very skewed version of the facts. Even if the FDA had known about the offending pharmacy, a combination of conflicting statutes and stratified jurisdictional authority would have made it impossible to do much about it. The failure to prevent public health emergencies such as last year's [2012] meningitis outbreak is actually an argument for increasing the FDA's authority, as the current dynamic is confusing, conflicted, and leaves the agency vulnerable to uncooperative drug makers.

Hamburg said the authority the agency currently possesses is too limited and not enough to properly ensure the safety of some compounding pharmacy products. In particular, she said her biggest concern amongst such pharmacies is with those making what she called "high-risk, sterile" products that are often made in high volumes despite not having an individual prescription and sent out of state. Hamburg estimated about 3000 compounding pharmacies engage in making sterile products. She added that there have been several occasions where the FDA has been rebuffed by compounding pharmacies to conduct inspections, saying that the agency does not have such authority, and have sued to prevent access.

In response to questioning from one committee member, Hamburg said she agreed that the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists [IACP], a trade association, has stepped in the way of inspections, adding that "the IACP has for many years questioned our authority."

House Democrats introduced legislation to crack down on these unregulated pharmacies soon after the meningitis outbreak. That bill -- dubbed the SAFE Act -- incorporates FDA requests for a federal database of compounding facilities and subjects the drug makers to a minimum level of production standards. Hamburg has warned that, barring additional oversight authority, the FDA is largely powerless to prevent the next outbreak of this kind.

[The _Exserohilum rostratum_ outbreak is winding down with few long incubation period outliers. It is not winding down, however, for many of the individuals affected by the mold, especially those with central nervous system infections. Indeed, a newly reported death occurred in Tennessee only 3 days ago from a previously reported case (http://www.tennessean.com/article/20130417/NEWS07/304170189?nclick_check=1). 733 cases with 53 deaths (now 54) were reported in the last CDC update (http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/outbreaks/meningitis.html).

It is clear to this moderator (and many other individuals) that more regulation must be put in placed to better regulate this growing industry. The FDA currently has limited ability to do so. To say that the FDA failed in its efforts is not really correct and is parallel to the argument that a totally inadequate 1994 assault weapon ban (that was allowed to lapse) demonstrates that assault weapon legislation cannot work. - Mod.LL
