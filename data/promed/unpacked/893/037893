[Hofuf was the scene of a prolonged nosocomial outbreak earlier this year (April-July 2015), involving more than 40 patients.

The designation as a 'primary' case only tells us these cases had no known exposure to an identified MERS case. Nearly 40 percent of all known Saudi cases fall into this 'primary' category.

[2] WHO chief says US, Saudi discussing MERS vaccine

The United States and Saudi Arabia are discussing the possibility of readying a vaccine for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) before the next outbreak of the disease, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on [Tue 20 Oct 2015].

Margaret Chan [Director-General of WHO] said there were many gaps in the science of MERS and so far, the world had taken only "baby steps" in tackling the virus.

She said cases in Saudi Arabia and South Korea showed that infection control in hospitals was not good enough, one of many examples where countries were failing to meet their obligations to protect public health.

[Currently there is no vaccine or effective antiviral for MERS. The question is whether pharmaceutical companies will invest the resources to develop and produce the vaccine. "In the US, generally speaking, it will take a decade or more and just shy of a billion dollars to get a vaccine licensed through the FDA," says Gregory Poland, who heads the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic. The reason is human testing, which is costly and must prove not only that a vaccine works but also that it produces no harmful side effects. (http://www.technologyreview.com/news/527306/we-need-a-mers-vaccine-but-high-costs-regulations-make-one-unlikely/). However, it appears several companies are already working on a vaccine. See:

19 Oct 2015. Montco firm wants to start human testing of MERS vaccine [edited]
http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2015/10/19/inovio-geneone-life-mers-vaccine-human-testing.html
Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc and GeneOne Life Science Inc filed an investigational new drug application with the Food and Drug Administration seeking approval to begin human testing of Inovio's MERS vaccine.

The companies hope to begin a phase-I clinical trial testing the vaccine in healthy volunteers before the end of this year [2015]. ...

In a preclinical animal study earlier this year [2015], Inovio's MERS vaccine, according to the company, induced 100 percent protection in animals exposed to a live virus.

"We are moving rapidly from achieving complete protection from MERS in monkey studies to our goals of obtaining safety data from a phase-I trial and regulatory approval," said Dr J Joseph Kim, President and CEO. ... -- more.
