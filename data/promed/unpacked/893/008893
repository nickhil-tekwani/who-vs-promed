[1] Confirmation of peanut butter isolate

Lab tests on a tainted tub of peanut butter produced a genetic match to the
strain of salmonella that has struck nationwide, Minnesota health officials
reported on Monday [12 Jan 2009]. Meanwhile, the victim toll has risen to
410 people in 43 states, according to USA health officials, who also said
Monday [12 Jan 2009] that the illness may have caused 3 deaths.

The Minnesota report, issued on its Department of Health website, was a
follow-up to initial tests done last week [week of 5 Jan 2009] on the
bacteria found in a 5 pound [2.27 kg] package of King Nut creamy peanut
butter that had been collected from a long term care facility. Officials
from the Minnesota Departments of Health and Agriculture had issued a
product warning Friday [9 Jan 2009] after preliminary testing indicated the
presence of salmonella in the peanut butter.

Late on Saturday [10 Jan 2009], King Nut Cos., of Solon, Ohio, announced it
had issued a recall of King Nut peanut butter and Parnell's Pride peanut
butter with the lot code "8". Both brands are manufactured by Lynchburg,
Virginia-based Peanut Corp. of America [PCA]. King Nut distributes peanut
butter through food service accounts and does not sell it directly to
consumers, the company's statement said.

"We are very sorry this happened," Martin Kanan, president and chief
executive officer of King Nut Cos., said in the statement, adding, "We are
taking immediate and voluntary action because the health and safety of
those who use our products is always our highest priority." On Sunday [11
Jan 2009], Kanan told the Associated Press that the recall involved 1000
cases of peanut butter.

Peanut Corp. of America issued its own statement on its website, confirming
the salmonella finding. The statement added, however, that the finding
"leaves open the possibility of cross-contamination from another source.
PCA is working with the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration), CDC (US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and other agencies to
determine whether the current illness outbreak could be at all related to
products made in the PCA facility."

[2] Latest CDC report

As of Monday, 12 Jan 2009, 410 persons infected with the outbreak strains
of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium have been reported from 43 states. The number
of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Arizona
(8), Arkansas (3), California (55), Colorado (9), Connecticut (6), Georgia
(5), Hawaii (1), Idaho (10), Illinois (5), Indiana (4), Iowa (1), Kansas
(2), Kentucky (3), Maine (4), Maryland (7), Massachusetts (40), Michigan
(20), Minnesota (30), Missouri (8), Mississippi (1), Nebraska (1), New
Hampshire (10), New Jersey (13), New York (12), Nevada (6), North Carolina
(1), North Dakota (10), Ohio (53), Oklahoma (2), Oregon (5), Pennsylvania
(12), Rhode Island (4), South Dakota (2), Tennessee (9), Texas (5), Utah
(3), Vermont (4), Virginia (17), Washington (11), West Virginia (2),
Wisconsin (3), and Wyoming (2).

Among the 388 persons with dates available, illnesses began between 3 Sep
2008 and 31 Dec 2008, with most illnesses beginning after 1 Oct 2008.
Patients range in age from less than 1 to 98 years; 48 per cent are female.
Among persons with available information, 18 per cent were hospitalized and
the infection may have contributed to 3 deaths.

Outbreak investigation
----------------------
Preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public
health officials in multiple states comparing foods eaten by ill and well
persons has suggested peanut butter as a likely source. To date, no
association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in
grocery stores.

An epidemiologic investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health
suggested King Nut creamy peanut butter as a likely source of salmonellosis
among many ill persons in Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of
Agriculture Laboratory isolated the outbreak strains of _S._ Typhimurium
from an open 5-pound container of King Nut brand creamy peanut butter. The
product is distributed in Minnesota to establishments such as long term
care facilities, hospitals, schools, universities, restaurants, delis,
cafeterias, and bakeries. It is not sold directly to consumers and is not
known to be distributed for retail sale in grocery stores.

Clusters of infections in several states have been reported in schools and
other institutions, such as long term care facilities and hospitals, and
King Nut is the only brand of peanut butter used in those facilities for
which we have information.

[One more state and 11 additional outbreak strain cases have been added,
now with the possibility of 3 deaths linked to the outbreak. Remember, the
very young and very old as well as those with defects in cellular immunity
are more likely to have more morbidity and mortality from salmonellosis. It
is very likely that additional isolates are found to be the specific
genetic strain. These isolates may be from late 2008 cases prior to the
recall or from newer cases.

[3] King Nut statement: distribution to only 7 states

On Sat 10 Jan 2009, we issued a recall of our peanut butter distributed to
food service companies under the King Nut label. We issued the recall after
learning that salmonella had been discovered in an open container of peanut
butter with our label. We also made it clear that we do not manufacture
King Nut peanut butter nor do we supply any ingredients for the peanut
butter. We are simply the distributors.

Since that time, we have been working closely with the Food and Drug
Administration and the Centers for Disease Control to help them trace the
cause of this contamination. This takes time, but we are cooperating fully
with their investigation.

Today [12 Jan 2009], the Minnesota Department of Health suggested that King
Nut peanut butter is linked to illnesses nationwide. We only distribute in
7 states and therefore King Nut peanut butter could not possibly be the
source of a nationwide outbreak of salmonella. (King Nut peanut butter is
distributed to food service companies in Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan, North
Dakota, Arizona, Idaho, and New Hampshire.)

Questions about the manufacture of the peanut butter and nationwide
distribution should be directed to Peanut Corporation of America.

We thought it was very important for the public to understand this. We are
doing everything we can to get our King Nut peanut butter out of
distribution because our 1st priority is the health and safety of those who
use our products. But we can only recall the product that was distributed
under our label, and clearly that does not extend nationwide.

[With the statement that this product was only distributed by King Nut to 7
states and cases occurring in a total (so far) of 43 states, it is possible
that secondary distribution occurred or that one or more products made by
the original producer are also "hot". Of the 410 cases, however, 141 are
reported from those 7 states, which represent 55 per cent of all the states
with 10 or more cases. - Mod.LL]
