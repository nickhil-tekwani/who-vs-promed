The restrictive measures over the foot and mouth disease [FMD] spreading in
Bulgaria, adopted in the districts of Varna, Shumen, Yambol, Sliven,
Haskovo and Kardzhali, have been lifted, the National Medical Veterinary
Service announced.

At a sitting in Brussels, the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and
Animal Health with the European Commission (EC) decided that only the
coastal district of Burgas [shall] stay in quarantine.

No new FMD samples tested positive so far. More than 2800 tests have been
made since Friday [7 Jan 2011] until today [12 Jan 2011].

If the European Union does not approve 100 per cent financial compensation
for the Bulgarian farmers who suffer losses due to the FMD outbreak in the
country, the remaining sum will be provided by the national budget, said
minister of agriculture and food Miroslav Naydenov. According to European
Union regulations, the farmers suffering FMD losses could be granted up to
60 per cent financial compensation.

The Bulgarian minister added [that] only samples taken in the southern
village of Kosti tested positive for FMD. According to him, the costs for
handling the outbreak could run to about half a million [in case this
refers to the Bulgarian Lev, USD equivalent is 331 565].

A reference laboratory in England determined the FMD virus strain found in
Bulgaria. It is typical of Iran and the Asian part of Turkey [see item 2].

Bulgarian farmers will get up to 60 per cent financial compensation from
the European Commission for FMD cases in the country, European Commission
spokesman for healthcare Frederic Vincent told FOCUS Radio. He specified
that FMD is the disease farmers get the highest compensation for according
to the European Union regulations: 60 per cent. He added that no final
decision had been made about the size of the compensation for Bulgaria, but
the European funds will be 60 per cent at the highest.
