Reacting to dozens of salmonella cases nationwide, the Food and Drug
Administration on Saturday warned consumers not to drink unpasteurized
orange juice distributed by an Arizona company.
The juice products, both frozen and liquid, were distributed under several
brand names by Sun Orchard Inc. of Tempe.
Besides the Sun Orchard label, the juice was sold under the labels Earls &
Joey Tomato's, Trader Joe's, Markon, Sysco, Aloha and Voila! The juice in
question was dated for use by July 7 or earlier.
So far, 52 cases of salmonella poisoning in Washington state have been
linked to the unpasteurized orange juice. Other states and Canadian
provinces also have reported cases.
Health officials say those who suspect they may have salmonella poisoning
should see a doctor immediately. The bacteria can cause severe intestinal
distress and possibly even death.
Sun Orchard has stopped production of unpasteurized juice and is now
pasteurizing all of its juice products, the FDA said.

[It is noteworthy that Trader Joe's is a food market chain that has
expanded operations to the East Coast of the USA. It would seem that there
may be a potential for additional reports from that region. - MPP/ Mod.ES
