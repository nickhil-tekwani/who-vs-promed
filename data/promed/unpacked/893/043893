The WA [Western Australia] Department of Agriculture is reminding rangelands pastoralists to vaccinate their stock, after 2 recent outbreaks of botulism on stations in the Pilbara region.

Found worldwide, botulism is a soil organism which develops in dead carcasses when conditions are favourable. The organism produces a highly toxic chemical capable of causing paralysis and sudden death when eaten.

Department vet Kevin Hepworth visited both stations and said the number of dead was between 20 and 50 animals in each case.

He said the signs pastoralists observed were not typical of botulism. "People described their cattle as having an arched back, hunched belly and tail raised, as if they were in abdominal pain.

"Botulism doesn't actually cause abdominal pain, it causes paralysis, but because those cattle were trying to support their weakness by having their hind limbs further underneath them, they appeared to have this hunched posture."

On one station, cattle had been vaccinated against the disease but it's believed that the vaccine was not stored correctly. "It's likely there was a problem with the vaccine's transport, maybe a lack of refrigeration.

The Pilbara is a hot place, leaving vaccine sitting out in the sun, in the yards all day can make it ineffective.

Cattle contract botulism by chewing on animal bones or carcasses, usually when they are phosphorus or protein deficient. But Mr Hepworth says that doesn't mean you can avoid botulism by simply feeding stock a phosphorus supplement. "If stations are providing enough phosphorus, it's likely cattle won't chew bones as much as they would normally do. "But it also is a bit of a learned behaviour, so sometimes they'll still do it and it's very difficult to provide the amount of phosphorus that cattle in the rangelands require year-round."

These latest cases of botulism don't put the Pilbara's beef exports at risk, but Mr Hepworth says it's important to clarify that botulism is the cause of death in stock because the signs can be similar to mad cow disease. Mad cow disease has never been found in Australia, but if it were, Mr Hepworth says, exports would be at risk.

"Some of the signs of botulism and mad cow disease are similar: lethargy, sitting down a lot, altered behaviour. Both can lead cattle to have a drunken, staggery gait.

"So by investigating these diseases and finding botulism we have ruled out mad cow disease which is very significant for our export market."

Stations seeking further information about botulism or wishing to organise a vet visit can contact Kevin Hepworth on 08 9956 8512.

For subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the "Diagnostic tests" (for animals) chapter in the "Botulism" review published by The Center for Food Security & Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated June 2010 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf.):

"Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as the toxin is not always found in clinical samples or the feed. Diagnosis is often a matter of excluding other diseases. A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the feed, serum/blood, stomach, crop or intestinal contents, vomitus, feces, or tissues. The toxin can usually be found in the blood or serum only in the early stages of the disease. Botulinum toxin is typically detected with a mouse bioassay. ELISAs may also be used, but they detect both active and inactivated (such as heat treated) toxins, and false positives are possible with this test. Botulinum toxins can be typed using neutralization tests in mice.

_Clostridium botulinum_ organisms may also be isolated from the feed. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism may be cultured from the gastrointestinal contents, feces, wounds, or other tissues. Because healthy animals can have _C. botulinum_ spores in the gastrointestinal tract, finding them in this location should be interpreted with caution [_C. botulinum_ isolation techniques are described in detail in the original document].

Biochemical tests and the detection of volatile metabolic products using gas-liquid chromatography are helpful in identification. The metabolic patterns and other characteristics vary with the strain/group. Definitive identification is by demonstration of the toxin. Molecular techniques can be used for the genetic characterization of _C. botulinum_ and may be helpful in determining the source of an outbreak.

Serology is not used routinely in diagnosis, but antibodies to botulinum toxin have been reported in some animals that recovered, including horses, cattle, and a dog. In the dog, paired serum samples revealed a 4-fold increase in titer. Antibodies to type C and/or D botulinum toxin have also been reported in a few golden jackals (_Canis aureus syriacus_) in Israel."

PCR is mentioned only in the review's chapter addressing botulism in humans, which says: "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays that detect the neurotoxin genes can be helpful in identifying _C. botulinum_; however, some genes (silent toxin genes) do not produce active toxin, and the results from this assay are confirmed using the mouse bioassay."
