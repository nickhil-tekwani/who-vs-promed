For the year 2006 in Bavaria, 59 cases of avian influenza in wild
birds have been confirmed by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI).
During the week of 7 Apr 2006 (12 noon) until 13 Apr 2006 (12 noon),
the following new cases were confirmed:

No. / Municipality / Administrative or City District / Regional
District / Species / Date H5N1 confirmed

59 / Schwenningen / Dillingen on the Danube / Schwabia / Mute Swan /
13 Apr 2006

58 / Schwenningen / Dillingen on the Danube / Schwabia / Mute Swan /13 Apr 2006

57 / Lauingen / Dillingen on the Danube / Schwabia / Merganser / 12 Apr 2006

56 / Lindau / Lindau / Schwabia / Duck / 12 Apr 2006

55 / Gunzenhausen / Weissenburg-Gunzenhausen / Middle Franconia /
Swan / 7 Apr 2006

So far in 2006, 5872 wild birds have been handed over to the Bavarian
Agency for Health and Food Safety; 5120 of them have already [by 13
Apr 2006] been tested for influenza A, and the 77 samples that were
influenza A positive have been sent to the Friedrich Loeffler
Institute (FLI) for further testing. The FLI has confirmed 59 samples
as H5N1 positive, 14 as H5N1 negative, and 4 have yet to be determined.

In addition to avians, 264 carnivores (martens, foxes, cats) have
been sent to the LGL; 251 have been tested for influenza A virus. One
influenza A positive sample has been forwarded to the FLI, where it
was [found] H5N1 negative.

Avian influenza (Bird flu): UK surveys of wild bird populations to
screen for the presence of Avian Influenza

There are 3 components to UK wild bird survey:
-Sampling of live caught wild birds
-Sampling of freshly shot birds
-Examination of carcasses from unusually high mortality events
affecting wild birds

Summary of results (Avian influenza (Bird flu): UK surveys of wild
bird populations to screen for the presence of Avian Influenza)

1. Survey of live caught birds to identify the presence of avian
influenza viruses:

Number of samples received: 3343
Number of individual samples tested: 3343
Samples positive for high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAI)
subtypes H5 or H7: 0
Samples positive for low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAI)
subtypes H5 or H7: 0
Samples positive for low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAI)
subtypes other than H5 or H7: 2
Samples negative for avian influenza virus: 3341

Note: The 2 samples which are recorded as positive for Low
Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (LPAI), gave a positive result to a
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) laboratory test for LPAI viral
genetic material of subtypes H2 and H1 respectively; however, no
virus could be isolated from either of these samples which were
collected from a Shelduck caught in South West England and a Mallard
caught in northwest England.

2. Survey of freshly shot birds to identify the presence of avian
influenza viruses:

Number of samples received: 423
Number of individual samples tested: 423
Samples positive for high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAI)
subtypes H5 or H7: 0
Samples positive for low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAI)
subtypes H5 or H7: 1
Samples positive for low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAI)
subtypes other than H5 or H7: 2
Samples negative for avian influenza virus: 420

Note: An isolate of Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (LPAI) virus
(subtype H6N2) was reported on 7 Dec 2005. The sample was taken from
a wild Mallard duck shot in West Lothian, Scotland.

A 2nd isolate of Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (LPAI) virus
(subtype H1N1 was reported on 30 Jan 2006. The sample was taken from
a wild Widgeon duck which was shot in South Wales.

The 3rd sample which is recorded as positive for Low Pathogenicity
Avian Influenza (LPAI), gave a positive result to a Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) laboratory test for LPAI viral genetic material of
subtype H5; however, no virus could be isolated from the sample which
was collected from a Teal duck which was shot in the East of England.

3. Examination of carcasses from unusually high mortality events
(die-offs) in wild birds:

Number of enquiries received: 4351
Number of incidents with carcases submitted: 2059
Number of incidents tested for avian influenza: 1561
Number of individual samples tested: 3501
Incidents positive for high pathogenicity avian influenza virus
(HPAI) subtypes H5 or H7: 1
Incidents positive for low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAI)
subtypes H5 or H7: 0
Incidents positive for low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAI)
subtypes other than H5 or H7: 0
Incidents negative for avian influenza virus: 1470
Incidents under test with some sample results to follow: 91

Note: Investigations in England and Wales are carried out by the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), in Scotland by the Scottish
Agricultural Colleges Laboratories (SAC) and in Northern Ireland by
DARD's Veterinary Sciences Division laboratory.

Wild bird carcasses may not be received in all incidents in which
enquiries are received; this is because not all incidents fulfil the
requirements for the survey. For instance, further enquiries may
indicate that only 1 or 2 birds have died or that the mortality level
is not unusual.

[The above data, which seem to relate mainly to 2005's surveillance
results, might help in assessing the discussed comparison between UK
surveillance data and those available on the Danish and German
national websites (item 2 in 20060412.1088).

We are looking with interest to the UK update, due next week.

In the meantime, an additional case in a wild bird (swan) -- the
12th, so far -- has been reported from the southern Czech town Ceske
Budejovice. See

[3] Cote d'Ivoire, poultry, suspected.

An illness not yet determined has decimated the poultry in a village.
The results from tests being performed on the samples taken from the
chickens are awaited.

More than 200 chickens died during the night of 31 Mar 2006 and 1 Apr
2006 in Soko. This village of 4000 inhabitants is situated in the
district of Bondoukou, 6 km from Ghana. 3 dogs had eaten [some
chickens] during the first days, and they [the dogs] died the day
after. Mr. Sylvestre Beugre, the medical assistant of the village
health center, stated: "the illness that killed the chickens at Soko
evolved rapidly. All the chickens were dead after the first few
days. [However,] on the evening of 31 Mar 2006, the domesticated
animals did not [show any signs of illness]. During the course of the
night, this illness evolved."

On Sat, 1 Apr 2006, 20 chickens were found dead in 3 poultry houses
in the Setounga section. The medical assistant notified his chain of
command. The subprefect, Jean-Paul Kablan, arrived the same day with
a veterinarian and an officer from the department of Waters and
Forests. The chickens had been incinerated. Sunday, the 2 Apr 2006,
10 other chicken carcasses had been discovered in the morning.
Recently, the subprefect returned to Soko.

By the afternoon, this unusual occurrence agitated the village. The 3
dogs that had eaten the birds had died. Taking the lead, Beugre, the
medical assistant, obtained survey results from 950 students from 3
primary schools from the village. The children discovered 60 more
dead chickens, severely decomposed, in the underbrush around the
village. Beugre instructed the population not to touch or eat fowl.

On 6 Apr 2006, a team composed of Dr. Felicite Beudje, head of the
analysis laboratory in Bingerville, brought back some samples for
analysis from Soko. As recently as 13 Apr 2006, the results of the
analysis had not yet been announced.

The regional director of health, Dr. Denis Sonh Kah, returned
yesterday evening from Soko. He also awaits the test results in order
to [handle] the situation. Raising chickens is a family enterprise.
Such developments with domesticated animals are rare in Soko. The
populace is worried, anxious to know the cause of the poultry deaths.

[We join Soko's inhabitants in anticipation of lab results, hoping
that samples will be submitted to a reference laboratory as well.
Until then, this outbreak remains suspected.

Bondoukou is situated on Cote d'Ivoire's border with Ghana, about 550
km northeast of Abidjan; map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?action=showmap&country=185_0_4&language=1>.
For Soko, Latitude 8.0000, Longitude -2.7500, see
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IV/0/Soko.html>.
A map of West Africa is available at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/westafrica.pdf>.

If confirmed, Cote d'Ivoire will become the 5th infected country in
Africa, following Egypt, Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Burkina Faso.

The information about infected dogs should be viewed with caution. So
far, there is no referenced evidence of clinical H5N1 infections in
dogs, though several anecdotal pieces of information have been
published (see, for example, item 3 in 20060331.0970).

Similar information has been received from Joseph Dudley. - Mod.AS]
