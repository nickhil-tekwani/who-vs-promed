[The following statement was embedded in an article about a
chickenpox outbreak in Ghana. - Mod.TY]

Prince Osei Frimpong, the officer in charge of Disease Control at the
Ridge Hospital, said from records he obtained from the Korle-Bu
Public Health Reference Laboratory that there is a need for health
authorities to watch out for yellow fever cases this year [2008].

Mr Frimpong said though chicken pox has not recorded any casualties,
yellow fever has claimed one victim at the hospital.

[The Ridge Hospital is in Accra, the capital. It would be important
to know when and exactly where in Ghana the single case of yellow
fever (YF) occurred. There have been recent cases of YF in neighboring
Cote d'Ivoire -- see ProMED refs. below. ProMED requests information
about the YF case in Ghana and whether control measures (vaccination,
vector mosquito control) are being implemented as a result.
