Researchers at Charles Sturt University (CSU) in southern New South Wales said they have developed the 1st vaccine for psittacine circoviral disease (PCD) and are ready to submit their work to the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) for approval.

Professor Shane Raidal is a veterinary pathologist at CSU and has been working to develop the vaccine for more than a decade.

"[Australia is] the land of the parrots and critically endangered species, such as the orange-bellied parrot, and others around the country are devastated by this infection," Professor Raidal said.

Professor Raidal said the vaccine could now give these species a fighting chance of survival.

Found at Melaleuca in far south-west Tasmania, there are thought to be less than 15 orange-bellied parrots left in the wild.

Ornithologist Mark Holdsworth became involved with the species in 1979 when there were up to 500 remaining.

Since then Mr Holdsworth has led the recovery program for the parrot and now sits on the advisory group for the management of the species.

He said viruses like PCD threatened the survival of species like the orange-bellied parrots.

"If a vaccine is available to make these birds immune, then that's one less thing they have to deal with," Mr Holdsworth said.

There are currently 400 orange-bellied parrots bred in captivity and all birds need to be regularly tested to identify and prevent the spread of disease.

Mr Holdsworth said a vaccine would help reduce the costs associated with testing by tens of thousands of dollars.

"It's very costly to test for this disease and we're very cautious about releasing more of this disease into the wild," he said.

PCD is a naturally-occurring virus that affects parrots, cockatoos, lorikeets, and birds in the psittacine family. It is often fatal to birds that contract it. "It's very common in the wild, very recognisable, and it's a pretty devastating infection when the bird gets it," Professor Raidal said.

The virus' ability to survive in high temperatures and nest hollows allows it to be easily spread. "These birds breed in nest hollows and that then allows the nest batch of nestling birds to be infected," Professor Raidal said.

Mr Holdsworth said PCD has been well known for many years but there is no current treatment.

It has taken more than 10 years for this vaccine for PCD to be developed.

"We now know a lot about the genetics and the structure of the virus to be very confident that this single vaccination will work," Professor Raidal said.

CSU professor of biochemistry Dr Jade Forwood said the success of the vaccine came down to a key protein.

"This particular protein of the virus encapsulates the genome -- it's the outer shell of the virus," Dr Forwood said. "That's what is presented to the immune system."

Dr Forwood is now responsible for developing the sufficient quantities and purities needed for the vaccine.

"By producing this protein in a non-infectious form, it gives the bird an opportunity to raise an immune response, increase their antibodies and ultimately fight off the virus," he said.

Dr Forwood said one gram of the protein was enough to generate 10 000 vaccines.

But Professor Raidal, who hopes to see the vaccine approved by 2021, said there is another significant step that needs to be completed.

"The arduous task will now be getting something registered by the Australian Government for veterinarians to have on their shelves," he said.

A spokesperson for APVMA said an application for a new vaccine was submitted when the product registrant considers they have enough data to satisfy the criteria for safety and efficacy.

"The APVMA generally accepts data generated by tests that have been conducted according to international standards," the spokesperson said. "Evidence that the product is manufactured to a standard comparable with the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Veterinary Products is also required."

[Psittacine beak and feather disease is a viral disease affecting all Old World and New World parrots. The virus belongs to the family Circoviridae. The virus attacks the feather follicles and the beak and claws-growing cells of the bird, causing progressive feather malformation and necrosis. In later stages of the disease, the feathers develop constrictions in feather shafts, cease development early, until eventually all feather growth stops. The disease was first diagnosed in Australia early in the 20th century.
