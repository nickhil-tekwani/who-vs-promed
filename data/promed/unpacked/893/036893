The prion hypothesis implies that CJD, nvCJD, scrape etc. are all causing
conformational change that amplifies through modification of the
individuals genetically determined pre prion protein. Familial variants
have been described but with regard to the spongiform process my
understanding is that there is only one pre prion protein to modify! Thus
nvCJD is a syndromic variant but not a new disease. Syndromic variation
could be caused by the mode of introduction or the dose but the mechanism
should lead to the same end point. This is more than a taxonomic point --
if we model the epidemic in terms of recent cases, attack rates etc., or
will we be able to use theory to estimate the eventual scope of the
outbreak. Current case rates may decline due loss of a particular
subpopulation, variation in the individuals diet, genetics, or other
factors that affect uptake and dose. Models that track the frequency of
current cases (i.e. nvCJD - potentially representing only high exposure)
may see the 'peak' decline and may underestimate the epidemic. The classic
form of the disease MAY result from a 'classic' low dose exposure, which
could imply that the epidemic would eventually be large. Does this make
sense to anyone out there?

I concur, we have been advocating strongly for a "surveillance of factors
of emergence" area of study...however the movement towards this is slow
both due to interdisciplinary barriers (and language is not the least of
these) and funding. Nonetheless, we are proceeding in this area through our
working group here.

Responding to Bill Graney's comments, a rear guard effort is a reactive
response, a defensive response. I believe he is right, however, when he
says that we cannot predict which forms of human activity might result in
an emergence of infectious disease. But that is hardly reason not to
evaluate new human activities and develop predictions regarding their
outcomes. Some activities are easier than others to recognize as cauldrons
of microbial opportunism. Others are so insidious as to be
missed entirely. Farsightedness, a discriminating eye, and the ability to
"think like a microbe" are what is needed in this age of emerging diseases.

I was one of the first to read Robert LaBudde's study, because parts of his
material are based on media information that he got from me. However, I
would never even dream of putting together and trying to publish something
like an epidemiological study based on newspaper reports. And, I would
definitely not draw serious epidemiological conclusions from such data.
However, here are my comments to earlier posts by Robert (10/4) and Oz
(10/18).
* The paper was rejected by Lancet and has not been published elsewhere.
* The case data in the report are not confirmed by the British CJDSU/DoH or
any other authority in the field.

* My opinion, and the position of SEAC, CJDSU and most BSE/nvCJD
researchers, is that it's too early in this epidemic - and today's data are
not enough - to predict a future curve.
