PCR VERSUS TRADITIONAL LABORATORY TECHNIQUES

[ProMED had said, "....Keep in mind that arboviruses were
identified and named based on their antigenic relationships... [and]
In order to definitively identify an arbovirus, two-way (field isolate
and antibody against it tested against reference viruses and
antibody against them) neutralization tests are called for..." -
Mod.CHC]
This sounds tedious relative to PCR amplification and sequencing of
flaviviral gene fragments and identification by homology. I disagree that
this gives less definitive identification if done properly. Omitting this
efficient and direct approach for pathogen identification with the comment
that one has only a gene fragment sequence, is like saying one can only
make a diagnosis of HIV infection by culturing the virus and using
ultrastructural characteristics. Such standards were appropriate in early
virus research but I would argue that they should have been supplanted or
supplemented by now with newer immunology and molecular biology methods.

[Let me try to get this straight, then cut the string. Gerald has
developed many PCR-based assays for detecting the major US
flaviviruses in mosquitoes, and knows what he is talking about.
Are serologic means tedious? Yes, and they also take some
expertise. I didn't say that PCR gives less definitive identification
than serologic means. PCR gives more definitive identification of
nucleic acids than do serologic tests because serologic tests do
not measure nucleic acids, they measure the products specified by
those nucleic acids.
PCR is a technique, not a shrine. The development and application
of PCR has provided more information in certain areas than we
could have ever dreamed was possible a decade ago. For studies
of epidemiology, production of vaccines, studies of viral evolution,
production of noninfectious diagnostic antigens, evaluation of
mutagens, and so many other areas of research and application,
nothing approaches PCR. That is not the question.
PCR can be used for rapid and specific detection and identification
of virus RNA, but it can be so specific that you will detect only
exactly what you are looking for. The bottom line is that PCR was
used in the NY labs, at CDC, and at UC/Irvine and they still have
not definitively identified the virus causing the human and crow
deaths and illnesses in the New York area. Where is the "rapid" in
all this?
As I write this, primers and monoclonal antibodies are being sent to
CDC to assist them in determining then exact identification of this
West Nile-like (or Kunjin-like) virus.
There are those who believe that a technique that has been used
for decades must be replaced by "more modern technques". Try
getting an NIH grant funded without using all the latest buzz words.
Never mind that the work to be done can be done with
"conventional" techniques, one must look like one is at the cutting
edge, and that means one must not use complement-fixation (or
the like) tests. This is nonsense, as far a I am concerned.
Duane Gubler, Director of the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious
Diseases, CDC/Ft. Collins, certainly was correct when he said that
a new approach is needed. Such a paradigm must include all tools
available, not just the ones that have been developed most
recently. The best technique is the best technique.
As Ogden Nash said, "Progress might have been all right once, but
it has gone on too long."- Mod.CHC]
