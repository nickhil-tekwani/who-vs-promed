Measles in the Netherlands from 1 May to 16 Oct 2013
----------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles is on going in the Netherlands, mostly situated in municipalities with a low level of vaccination coverage (under 90 per cent). It is expected that this virus will spread in these areas among unvaccinated children in the coming period. Children below 14 months of age with an increased risk of contracting measles will be offered an extra vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR vaccine). In general, the Dutch population is well protected against measles because of vaccination or immunity from having had the disease.

Measles outbreak
----------------
Since the end of May [2013], cases of measles are being reported in a number of areas. The epidemic is spreading, especially in communities where vaccination coverage is low (less than 90 per cent). Many of the people living in these areas belong to the Dutch Orthodox Reformed Church. For religious reasons they do not have their children vaccinated. It is likely that the disease will spread further because a relatively large number of children in these areas are not protected against measles.

Earlier this year [2013], there were several local outbreaks in The Hague, Alblasserwaard and the Land of Heusden and Altena region. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) is in very close contact with the community health services (GGDs) in question. Doctors in the areas concerned have been informed.

Effect of vaccination
---------------------
In the Netherlands, there has been a large decrease in the number of patients with measles and the number of deaths since measles vaccination was introduced into the Dutch National Vaccination Program in 1976. The vaccination is at least 95 per cent effective. Measles epidemics occur periodically among the population groups who are not vaccinated. The last outbreak in the Netherlands was between 1999 and 2000 when there were 150 children with measles admitted to a hospital and 3 children died from the effects of the disease.

Adygea: 11 cases of measles registered
--------------------------------------
According to the health authorities of the republic, all 11 measles infections have occurred in the Roma population.

A total of 4 of the 11 cases were unemployed adults, aged between 26 and 39 years. The other 7 were children under 14 years of age. The Health Department, in conjunction with the Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, has initiated epidemic control measures. All contacts of the patients have been placed under surveillance.

Transmission of measles is mainly by airborne droplets. Measles is characterized by cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis. Temperature may rise to 38 degrees C [100.5 degrees F] and above at the height of the disease, accompanied by a characteristic rash.

The incubation period lasts on average about 2 weeks, in the range of 7-28 days. Vaccination against measles is the only sure way to prevent measles infection.

Measles cases at 3 schools, college and nursery
-----------------------------------------------
The number of measles cases has risen to 14, with Public Health Wales warning there is "potential for the outbreak to spread quickly". There are cases at a secondary school in Pontardawe, and others at a primary school, a college and a nursery.

Says Dr JÃ¶rg Hoffmann, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales: "We now have cases not only in Cwmtawe School but also in 2 primary schools, a further education college and a nursery -- and in all of these places there are unvaccinated children and young people who could easily catch and spread measles. Parents who have decided not to vaccinate their children are not only risking their children's health, but are putting other children at risk, children either too young to be vaccinated or with medical conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated.

"We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year [2013] and we are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease. The only way to achieve that is through vaccination and I urge parents whose children have not received 2 doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine."

Public Health Wales says it wants to remind parents that children need 2 doses of MMR for the maximum 99 per cent protection against measles. Public Health Wales is urging anyone who thinks they or their children has the symptoms should contact their GP or NHS Direct Wales.

Health officials in Lethbridge are preparing for what could be a major outbreak of measles, and have erected a number of tents outside the Chinook Regional Hospital to serve as a measles assessment clinic. "We know there's a large population out there, hundreds of people actually have already been exposed based on information we've received and who are not immune," says Dr Vivian Suttorp, the South Zone medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services.

On Friday [18 Oct 2013], AHS officials confirmed a single case of measles in the south zone. The boy is a Grade 9 student at Coaldale Christian School. "He went home sick," Joop Harthoorn, the school's principal says. "At the time we were not aware it was measles." Alberta Health also notified the school late last week, and a notice was sent home to parents on Monday [21 Oct 2013]. According to Dr Martin Lavoie, Alberta's deputy chief medical officer of health, the student contracted the illness on a recent trip to the Netherlands. "We know he went to school, to church and a hockey game before we identified the illness so it is likely we will see more cases of the disease."

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that begins with mild cold and flu-like symptoms. After 4 to 7 days, patients may experience a high fever before developing a rash. The rash usually begins behind the ears before spreading to the face, down the body and to the arms and legs. "People are contagious up to 4 days after the start of the rash, but interestingly enough people will be contagious and spreading illness before they have any symptoms," Suttorp explains. Health officials have quarantined individuals they believe have been exposed, asking anyone who may have come in contact with the boy to stay home for 21 days.

Measles immunization clinics are also set to begin in Lethbridge on Wednesday [23 Oct 2013]. Infants usually receive the 1st of 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine at 12 months but during this outbreak infants 6-to-12 months can also receive a dose.

The MMR vaccination rate across Alberta is 84 per cent, far below the 98 per cent needed to achieve herd immunity. In areas around Lethbridge, the rate is less than 70 per cent. Health officials say vaccination rates have been dropping in recent years and Alberta Health is currently working on plan to try and reverse this trend. "Some parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children based on misinformation," says Lavoie. "We are very concerned about this."

Vaccine clinics are being offered in Lethbridge, Alberta, after it was confirmed 2 students have been treated for measles.

Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health for the south zone, says the biggest concern is the low rate of immunization because it is well beyond the requirements for herd immunity -- meaning a larger risk of an outbreak. Suttorp says classmates who haven't had the MMR (measles mumps rubella) vaccine and were exposed to the 2 students will be quarantined at home for 21 days.

The provincial measles, mumps and rubella vaccine immunization rate in Alberta is 84 per cent, but drops to 61 per cent in Lethbridge County and 79 per cent in Lethbridge. Suttorp says more than 85 per cent is needed for the best community immunity. "You have sub-optimal vaccination rates, so you have a large proportion of susceptible individuals in that population and that's how these sort of diseases -- and measles is very, very contagious -- spread," said Dr Glen Armstrong, a microbiologist at the University of Calgary. "Measles is still a concerning disease," she said. "There is a reason why we have vaccines for measles, and would like to eradicate measles worldwide -- no different than polio."

The push now is on to contain the virus. Alberta Health Services is holding public immunization clinics in Lethbridge for babies aged 6 months to a year. There is no cure for measles, but it can be prevented with vaccination. Medical health officers in Lethbridge say they are bracing for a larger measles outbreak.

A large measles outbreak that occurred in Quebec a couple of years ago [2011] is raising more questions about whether babies are getting their 1st dose of measles vaccine at too young an age. A new analysis of the 2011 outbreak, which involved a surprising number of children who should have been protected against the virus, suggests that giving the 1st dose of measles vaccine at 12 months may be undermining the efficacy of the vaccination program.

And it raises the possibility that a growing pool of vaccinated children may still be vulnerable to infection -- which, if true, could put in jeopardy efforts to eliminate and eventually eradicate measles, one of the authors of the study said in an interview. "This study shows that there is vulnerability in children who receive 2 doses and we should not overlook that. The reason for that is still unknown. But it is important to dig into this question further," said Dr Gaston de Serres, an infectious diseases specialist with Quebec's provincial public health agency. The new study was published on Monday in the journal Pediatrics.

De Serres and colleagues have been mining data from the 2011 high school outbreak to try to figure out why 102 of the 725 children infected caught the disease at all. They had received the recommended 2 doses of measles vaccine when they were young children. An earlier study by the same researchers showed that in the outbreak, teens who got their 1st dose at 12 months -- the time that is recommended across Canada -- were 6 times more likely to be infected than those who got their 1st shot at 15 months of age. When they published that study, one of the suggestions was that a phenomenon known as "maternal antibody" may have been responsible.

It takes time for the human immune system to develop. But babies survive infancy because they receive antibodies to diseases their mothers have either experienced through infection or been introduced to through vaccination. Maternal antibodies wane over time. But while they are present, if a baby is given a vaccine made from a live but weakened virus, the maternal antibodies may quell the vaccine virus before it has a chance to induce a strong immune response. Measles vaccine is a live-virus [vaccine]. So immunization programs are planned to try to hit the sweet spot, giving vaccines in time to protect toddlers against threats but not so soon that the vaccines won't be fully effective.

It's thought that women who had measles would have higher levels of maternal antibodies than women whose immunity was due to vaccination. Most people born before measles vaccination programs began in Canada in the early 1970s would have been infected with the highly contagious virus. If maternal antibody was behind the inadequate protection, some argue this is a problem that will simply melt away. That's because in parts of the world where measles vaccine coverage is high, women who were infected with measles are moving out of their child-bearing years. So 12 months for the 1st shot might be just fine for the children of women whose antibodies were generated by vaccination, the thinking goes.

But this new work suggests that theory may be optimistic. Though the numbers in this study are small, there were fully vaccinated children of vaccinated mothers among the measles cases. And other studies have shown that when you compare the antibody responses of children who get their 1st dose of measles vaccine at 6 months, 9 months or 12 months, the quantity and durability of the antibodies differs markedly. De Serres said this suggests that the immune system needs to have reached a certain point of maturation before measles vaccine will really take well. And even if 2nd -- or 3rd, or 4th -- doses are given, children whose 1st dose was given too early do not get as much protection from the vaccine as children who got their initial dose at 15 months.

Dr Diane Griffin is a measles expert at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. She said the work on the Quebec outbreak raises serious questions about whether measles vaccine campaigns that start at 12 months are adequately protecting children. She said she would probably recommend giving the 1st shot later -- especially given that in current day North America, the risk of being exposed to measles in infancy is low. "I would say that 15 months is probably a better time to vaccinate," Griffin said. She shares the concern that there may be a growing pool of children who could be infected if the virus is imported from parts of the world where measles still circulates widely. She noted that children who have been vaccinated but go on to be infected generally have a milder disease, so on an individual level the risk wouldn't be great. But having many more children who can catch and spread the virus than public health officials think are out there would make it much more difficult to contain and eventually wipe out measles.

Both De Serres and Griffin said data from the Quebec outbreak cannot answer the question of whether this phenomenon was triggered by giving the 1st vaccine too soon. But both said it's important to try to find an answer to the question.

[A large outbreak of measles in Quebec in 2011 was exceptional in that a surprisingly large number of vaccinated children who would have been expected to have been protected, developed measles. Subsequent investigation has centred on the timing of vaccination and the role of maternal antibody in determining this phenomenon. The preceding discussion comes to no final conclusion but suggests that the timing of vaccination in relation to development of protective immunity should be re-examined. - Mod.CP]

A 12th measles case has been confirmed in Ipswich [Queensland]. West Moreton Hospital and Health Service public health physician Dr Kari Jarvinen said an unknowingly infectious man caught the 4:40pm train from East Ipswich station to Booval station last Thursday [17 Oct 2013], then walked through Booval Fair. "To date 11 of the 12 confirmed measles cases in Ipswich had occurred in adults who were born after 1966," Dr Jarvinen said.

"Many adults in their late 20s and early 30s mistakenly believe that they have been vaccinated for measles as a child when in fact they haven't. "This may be because measles vaccine wasn't universally available to all children in Australia until the late 1980s and early 1990s. "Adults born in 1966 or later and who do not have documentation of having received measles vaccine, or having had the infection are particularly at risk of contracting the disease, in the current outbreak setting. "If you are unsure of your measles immunity or vaccination status, please talk to your GP."

Health officials in Papua New Guinea have confirmed a measles outbreak in the Sandaun province, the 1st such outbreak since 2005.

Samples taken from 3 boys were diagnosed positive by the Central Public Health Laboratory last week. The Health Department says the 3, who are less than 2 years old, are from 2 villages in the Vanimo Green District close to the Indonesian border. The Health Secretary, Pascoe Kase, says there is no information on whether they had been vaccinated or if they have travelled.

Mr Kase says health facilities across the country have been put on alert and instructed to investigate patients of any age reporting a fever and rash, and collect blood samples and throat swabs to check for measles.
