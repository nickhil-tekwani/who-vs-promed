Cholera has killed 770 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the last 3 months, the Health Ministry said on [Mon 6 Nov 2017]. In a statement, the ministry added that 21 of the country's 26 provinces have seen cases of cholera. "Since the beginning of the cholera epidemic in July 2017 until [30 Oct 2017], teams fighting cholera and other diarrheal diseases have recorded 40 100 suspected cases and 771 deaths," said the statement.

National cholera elimination program teams, supported by the UN's World Health Organization, continue to face many challenges on the ground. The WHO on [9 Sep 2017] sounded the alarm over a cholera outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo killing people in what it termed, 'worrying proportions'. Due to poor hygiene in most communities in the country, the disease is a major public health problem, with many cases seen every year.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (Mombasa County)
Date: Mon 6 Nov 2017

Health officials in Mombasa County have isolated 2 people with cholera-like symptoms to curb its spread. The 2 are suffering from acute diarrhoea and were admitted at Likoni District Hospital on [Sun 5 Nov 2017]. They are being treated in an isolation ward.

County chief health officer Khadija Shikely said medics are analyzing whether the 2 are suffering from cholera. "Two weeks ago we had a cholera case but we managed to contain it. We have been treating numerous diarrhea cases in Mombasa," she said.

The highly contagious disease is spread by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. When it rains heavily in Mombasa, hospitals usually receive a number of patients suffering from cholera or cholera-like symptoms.

Dr Shikely said a team of public health officers have been creating awareness on proper sanitation. "Anyone with acute or prolonged diarrhea and vomiting should immediately seek treatment in hospital," she added. A source at the hospital said samples from the 2 patients have been taken for tests to find out if they are suffering from cholera. "They came here vomiting and suffering from non-stop diarrhea. It is a highly likely a cholera case but let's wait for their [test results from their] samples, which have been taken for further analysis at the government chemist," said the source.

Heavy rains are currently pounding the Coast and many areas in Kenya, causing flooding.

The Borno state ministry of health says it had recorded 5281 suspected cases of cholera as of [31 Oct 2017]. According to a daily situation report by the ministry, there have been a total of 61 deaths so far with the highest recorded in Jere local government. In September [2017], the death toll stood at 44.

"The total number of suspected cases of cholera reported stands at 5281, with 61 deaths (CFR = 1.2 percent). As many as 2651 cases in the Muna corridor (Jere LGA), 736 cases in Dikwa, 1753 cases in Monguno, and cases in MMC and Mafa stands at 58 and 20 respectively. No case recorded from Guzamala (Gworam) today [2 Nov 2017], and the cumulative still stand at 69 cases."

The report said there have been no reported cases in Dikwa local government for more than 2 weeks. At present, the affected local governments are Jere, Mafa, Dikwa, Monguno, Guzamala and Maiduguri local government.

"Active case search continues in hot spots and high-risk areas; a total of 3 new cases found during community case search in Jere LGA. In Gwaram, Guzamala LGA, the active case search and health promotion by the LGA RRT and WHO Hard-To-Reach team is still ongoing. Priority locations have been identified and communicated to WASH and risk communication teams for priority intervention in Jere LGA: Dusunma (2 cases), Munguno (3 cases).

"Two rounds of OCV campaign in identified 5 priority hard to reach LGAs (Bama, Kala-Balge, Gwoza, Mobbar and Ngala) which are areas at-risk of cholera outbreak are planned. MOH to conduct OCV in Bama and MSF to support OCV in the other 4 LGAs. A 2nd round of oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign also being finalized for the 6 LGAs where the last OCV campaign was previously conducted. Preparation for all planned OCV campaigns is in the final stages: microplanning has been finalized, tentative date for the OCV campaigns is [11-15 Nov 2017]."

[4] Cholera - Sudan (Kassala State)
Date: Sun 29 Oct 2017

https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/two-die-cholera-sudan-s-kassala


Two women died and 2 other people were infected with cholera at Aroma locality of Kassala state last week [week ending 29 Oct 2017]. Ahmed Hasan Dirar told Radio Dabanga that one of the cholera patients was transferred to Kassala Hospital in critical condition, while the other patient is still in a temporary isolation center. He said that the deaths occurred on [Tue 24 Oct 2017].

He said last [Thu 26 Oct 2017] the State Health Ministry sent a committee to Aroma to find out [about] the cases. He also stressed that Aroma Hospital is lacking doctors and is run by medical assistants in a very poor environment.

Sudan's first cases of cholera were recorded in Blue Nile state in August 2016. Since then, the disease spread in eastern Sudan, and later to the Northern State and central Sudan's El Gezira. In April 2017, sources in White Nile state reported a rapid spread of cholera. The disease then spread to North Kordofan, and fully hit Khartoum in May 2017.

The epidemic - referred to as "acute watery diarrhea" by the Sudanese government and several international agencies operating in Sudan - quickly spread in the camps for displaced people in Darfur when the 1st cases emerged in the region in June 2017.

A Taiwanese man was diagnosed with cholera in late October 2017, marking the 2nd confirmed case of the disease in Taiwan in 2017, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said [Tue 7 Nov 2017].

The man, in his 40s, is believed to have contracted the disease during a recent visit to the Philippines, CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said in weekly report on diseases in Taiwan. Lo said the man fell ill with diarrhea and vomiting while he was visiting the Philippines with 8 friends around the end of October 2017 and was diagnosed with cholera upon his return to Taiwan. A total of 2 of the 8 people have also developed diarrhea and vomiting and are scheduled to be tested for cholera, Lo said.

It was the 2nd confirmed case of cholera in Taiwan this year [2017], with the first 1 originating within the country, Lo said. He advised people to refrain from eating uncooked food or drinking water from local sources when visiting countries where cholera is prevalent.

[6] Cholera - Haiti

Haiti: Cholera figures (as of 30 Sep 2017)
------------------------------------------
The efforts of humanitarian partners to achieve the objective of zero cases of cholera continue with encouraging results. Thus, between January and September 2017, the country recorded a total of 10 814 suspected cases of cholera and 107 deaths against 30 211 cases and 289 deaths for the same period of 2016, a decrease of 64.2 percent.

The highest peak in the number of cholera cases occurred in the department of Artibonite with 64.9 percent of the suspected cases in the month of September 2017 followed by Centre ant Ouest departments. To contain this situation, UNICEF's partners (ACF, ACTED, Solidarites International, and French Red Cross) mobilized teams from other departments to constitute 19 teams mixed with the Rapid Response Teams (EMIRA) of the MSPP1 in the Artibonite alone. PAHO / WHO also deployed teams to outbreak areas to strengthen response either through institutional care or community activities.

However, the lack of required funding for all the components of the National Elimination Plan is a handicap and a major risk for future control of the epidemic.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
