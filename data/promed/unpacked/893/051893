[Sydney's] eastern suburbs [New South Wales state] has a reputation for bronzed bodies, activated almonds and fitness fanatics, but a health report released [in early June 2014] has diagnosed the region with some serious health black spots.

One of the most startling is a 290 per cent increase in the number of gonorrhoea notifications recorded in the 4 years between 2008 and 2012. The results were revealed as part of a comprehensive health needs assessment report released by Eastern Sydney Medicare Local (ESML). The local government area that recorded the highest increase of "The Clap" was the wealthy enclave of Woollahra.

ESML chair Tim Smyth said despite the triple figure increase residents should not be alarmed. "Look, there's not a huge epidemic out there," Dr Smyth said. "I think that the (higher) figure is probably because of a combination of better screening, better awareness and also some social changes. One of those is younger people becoming more sexually active at a younger age."

A 14 per cent year-on-year increase in chlamydia notifications was also noted. Half of these cases were recorded within the City of Sydney.

Dr Smyth said the report, released earlier this month [June 2014], was a timely reminder that sexually transmitted disease was still present in the community, particularly among those aged between 30 and 35.

Gonorrhoea is a serious infection of the genital tract in both men and women, caused by a bacterium [_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_]. It is transmitted sexually, by oral, anal or genital sex. Symptoms include [urethral] discharge or a burning sensation [on urination]. The infection is treated with a simple course of antibiotics. Left untreated, the infection can cause scarring of the fallopian tubes, ectopic (tubal) pregnancy or eventual infertility in women.

[In Australia in 2011, the national notification rate for gonococcal disease for people aged 15 years and over was 65 per 100 000 population, up from 40 per 100 000 in 2001 (http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features10Jun+2012). Gonorrhea notifications continued to rise in 2012 to 13 649 cases in 2012; more men than women are diagnosed with gonorrhea, most cases are said to be among men who have sex with men, and the rate of diagnosis is 21 times greater in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples than in the non-indigenous population (extracted from "Sexually transmissible and blood-borne infections in Australia: the 2013 Surveillance Reports", available at http://www.kirby.unsw.edu.au/news/sexually-transmissible-and-blood-borne-infections-australia-2013-surveillance-reports).

The following on gonococcal disease in the US has been extracted from the US CDC's "2012 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Surveillance/Gonorrhea", which is available at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/gonorrhea.htm:

Gonorrhea rates in the US decreased to 98.1 cases per 100 000 population in 2009, the lowest rate since recording of gonorrhea rates began. The rate then increased slightly each year to 107.5 cases per 100 000 population in 2012, with a total of 334 826 cases reported in the US in 2012. The increase in gonorrhea rates during 2011-2012 was observed among both men and women. Although the gonorrhea rate among women increased 0.6 percent, to 108.7 cases per 100 000 population during 2011-2012, the rate among men increased 8.3 percent, to 105.8 per 100 000 population. Because most jurisdictions do not routinely report sex of sex partners or site of infection for gonorrhea cases, trends in gonorrhea rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) cannot be assessed. However, from the STD Surveillance Network, which provides more complete estimates of case characteristics often missing on routine case reports -- such as gender of sex partners (essential for better targeting of gonorrhea control efforts), the CDC estimates that in 2012, 26.6 percent of gonorrhea cases were among MSM, 29.4 percent among men who have sex with women (MSW), and 44.1 percent among women.

The magnitude of the increase among men compared to women suggests either increased transmission or increased case ascertainment (e.g., through changes in screening practices such as increased testing and increased extra-genital screening among MSM and changes in reporting practices).

_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ has progressively developed resistance to each of the antibiotics used for treatment of gonorrhea. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone plus either azithromycin or doxycycline is now the only CDC recommended treatment regimen for gonorrhea. The percentage of isolates that exhibit elevated ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) increased from 0.1 percent in 2008 to 0.4 percent in 2011, and decreased slightly to 0.3 percent in 2012. The proportion of isolates with elevated azithromycin MICs decreased from 0.5 percent in 2010 to 0.3 percent in 2012.

The city of Sydney, on Australia's southeast coast, with a population of 4.76 million people, is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney). Woollahra, with a population of 52 158 people in 2011, is a local municipality in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, where the median weekly income was double the national average (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality_of_Woollahra#Demographics).
