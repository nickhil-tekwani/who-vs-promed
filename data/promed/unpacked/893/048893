An _Eschericha coli_ [O157] outbreak at a St. Catharines, ON,
restaurant that made several people seriously ill was likely caused
by improperly handled food, say public health officials.
Public health officials allege the _E. coli_ contamination began when
the restaurant continued to operate during an 18 hour period on 19
May 2007 when its water supply was cut off by the city for repairs to
a broken water main.
With no clean water flowing to the restaurant, it would have been
impossible for those preparing food to properly clean bacteria from
their hands, utensils and surfaces touched by raw meats and other
food items, said Dr. Doug Sider, Niagara's associate medical officer
of health.
"We think that was probably instrumental in broad contamination ...
in the restaurant," he said. Public health officials blame the _E.
coli_ outbreak on improper hygiene, not on the water itself. "We're
not at all concerned that contamination got to the place through the
water," Sider said.
The health department closed the restaurant on 5 Jun 2007 after
receiving numerous reports of people sick with symptoms of infection
with _E. coli_ O157, the same strain that killed 7 people in
Walkerton's tainted-water scandal 7 years ago.
A total of 9 people who ate at the restaurant between 17 May and 5
Jun 2007 have been confirmed to be ill with the bacterial infection,
including 5 who were sick enough to be hospitalized. All of the
victims, most of them young children and youths, have been released
from hospital and are recovering, Sider said.
About 25 others who ate at the restaurant are listed as probable
cases of _E. coli_ infection.
The health department sent 16 food samples and 16 swab samples from
food preparation surfaces and utensils to a central public health lab
in Toronto for testing. Traces of _E. coli_ O157 were found in
samples of chicken shawarma and a carving knife from the restaurant,
Sider said.
Because chicken doesn't actually harbor the _E. coli_ bacteria,
public health officials believe the meat was contaminated from
another source inside the restaurant. "Our investigation indicates
there were probably more food sources than the chicken shawarma that
were contaminated with _E. coli_," Sider said.

[The absence of running water makes kitchen hygiene quite
problematic. Shawarma is a Middle Eastern-style sandwich usually
composed of shaved lamb, goat, chicken, turkey, beef, or a mixture of
meats. It is a popular dish across the Middle East, and is consumed
by many across the rest of the world as well. The name comes from a
Turkish word meaning turning.
