Biosecurity New Zealand has suspended fresh melon imports from Queensland after routine testing detected cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) on a consignment of watermelons from Australia.

Biosecurity NZ's Peter Thomson said CGMMV, if introduced to NZ, could have a serious impact on local production of cucurbit crops. "There is no suggestion the disease is in NZ." [He] said the suspension currently affected several melon consignments that have been placed on hold at the border. Biosecurity officials were working with importers to determine whether or not their product would be able to enter NZ.

"We are also working closely with Australian authorities who have agreed to not issue export certificates for any new consignments until they have investigated the situation and taken corrective measures," said Thomson. The length of the suspension would depend on how quickly Australian authorities could investigate the situation and put measures in place to assure NZ that their product was free from the disease.

The virus was also detected twice at the border last year [2018] on 2 consignments of fresh watermelon from Australia [ProMED-mail post 20180903.6005465].

[_Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is a major pathogen of cucurbit crops with reported yield losses of around 15 percent. The virus has a narrow host range. Many strains, including the type strain occurring in Europe, are limited to Cucurbitaceae, but some isolates have been reported which can also affect a number of species in other families, including Amarantaceae and Solanaceae. Symptoms vary in different host species and may be masked in field crops. In cucurbits, they may include severe leaf mosaic, deformation of vines and leaves, as well as internal fruit symptoms such as discolouration and rotting of flesh.

CGMMV is both seed and pollen transmitted. It is extremely stable and can also be spread by mechanical means (human activities, insect damage, plant-to-plant contact), with contaminated agricultural tools, infected plant material, contaminated soil and in water. Spread by specific insect vectors appears doubtful. Disease management may include removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitary practices and use of certified clean seed or other planting material. Transgenic rootstock lines of some cucurbit crops (such as watermelon) with resistance to CGMMV have been or are being developed.

Among the seed-borne viruses, tobamoviruses are currently considered a risk for crop production worldwide due to increasing global seed trade. For some species, seed coat surface sterilisation is effective in preventing transmission to new seedlings, suggesting that these viruses are carried on the outside of seeds. However, for some species including _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_, surface sterilisation of seeds does not seem to prevent transmission, suggesting these viruses may be carried within the endosperm since seed-transmitted tobamoviruses are thought to be absent from embryos.

In Australia, CGMMV has been detected repeatedly in Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland in cucurbit crops and seedlings, as well as in a number of weed hosts (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below). After the 2018 interceptions by NZ (ProMED-mail post 20180903.6005465), the Australian Department of Agriculture agreed to certify all Australian cucurbits exported to NZ as produced on a CGMMV-free farm. While the NZ Ministry for Primary Industries agreed to accept these clearances, yet another interception, as reported above, shows the importance of good quarantine diagnostics, rather than relying on certificates issued by foreign sources of produce.
