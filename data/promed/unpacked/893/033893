The outbreak of bubonic plague in the Chicama district of La
Libertad, Peru has been increasing rapidly, specifically in the
Libertad settlement, where 3 new cases of infection have been confirmed.

This was revealed by the chief epidemiologist of the Belen Hospital,
Pedro Diaz Camacho, who came to that area to assess the critical
condition of those affected, aged 8, 9, and 14.

"The presence of rats has increased in the settlement, and we ask the
intervention of local and regional authorities," emphasizes the epidemiologist.

Diaz Camacho also said that the 9-year-old patient is in serious
condition and the prognosis is guarded.

[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in the Western Hemisphere
are reported from the southwestern part of the USA. Cases from South
America do occur and have been previously reported in ProMED-mail
from Brazil and Ecuador. ProMED would appreciate more clinical
information about the cases as well as the total number of identified
cases. - Mod.LL]
