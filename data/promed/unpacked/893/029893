Taiwan has reported 28 cases of acute hepatitis A in 2022 as of Tuesday [15 Feb 2022], 18 of which were Thai workers, as the health authorities raise concerns over the consumption of raw food. The Thai patients live in Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan, New Taipei, Changhua and Nantou. The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said its investigation points to contaminated meat eaten raw as the culprit.

CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang told CNA that the migrant worker cases are not linked and that chains of infection are still being probed. Contaminated food at unspecified stores some of the cases visited may have played a role. Local authorities will wage a campaign to raise awareness among migrant communities about the liver infection. People classed as high risk will be inoculated with the hepatitis A vaccine to prevent a potential outbreak of the contagious disease, as many of migrant workers live in dorms, Chuang said.

The hepatitis A virus is found in the blood and stool of the infected and spreads through person-to-person contact or contaminated food or drink. The disease has a latent period of 15 to 50 days and causes symptoms that include fever, fatigue, diarrhea, and jaundice.

[It is unusual to see outbreaks of hepatitis A in the developing world, as serosurveys suggest close to 100% seropositivity by age 10 from asymptomatic infection earlier in childhood. The diagnosis of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is made by finding anti-HAV IgM in suspected cases.

Food items that have been described or assumed to have caused hepatitis A outbreaks include mussels, oysters, vegetables and salad fertilized with feces, fruits including raw or frozen frozen berries, green onions and shellfish. Contamination of food by infected food handlers in restaurants has also been described, with examples being several outbreaks associated with restaurants in 2021-2022 in the eastern USA. Several outbreaks have been associated with bakeries, including an outbreak observed in 1968 in Michigan, USA, with the vehicle of infection pastries covered with glaze or icing, and an outbreak in New York, USA, where the outbreak was associated with sugar-glazed baked goods.

Meat, per se, is not a well-described vehicle for hepatitis A since the virus is not zoonotic but could be contaminated by infected people along the food chain. Several genotypes of hepatitis E, however, are zoonotic and can be transmitted to human via undercooked meat, particularly pork sausage. In immunocompromised people, these genotypes can cause chronic infection.

ProMED would appreciate more information about this outbreak, especially regarding the diagnosis itself and the potential vehicle. - Mod.LL
