CDC, in collaboration with the New York City and New York State departments
of health, has isolated and identified a West Nile-like virus from birds
that died in New York City and were submitted for testing by the Bronx Zoo.
West Nile virus is an arbovirus closely related to St. Louis encephalitis
virus, but generally causes a milder disease in humans. Both viruses are
transmitted through the bite of a mosquito that becomes infected with the
virus by feeding on an infected bird. Like St. Louis encephalitis, West
Nile virus is not transmitted from person to person or from birds to
persons. West Nile virus never before has been recognized in the United
States or any other area of the Western Hemisphere.
Since late August, New York City has been experiencing an outbreak of
arboviral (mosquito-borne) encephalitis. Previously, diagnostic tests on
serum from human cases in this outbreak were reported as consistent with
St. Louis encephalitis virus infection. At present, the relationship
between this isolation of West Nile-like virus from birds in New York City
and the outbreak of encephalitis among persons in New York City remains
uncertain and further laboratory testing is underway. The CDC is testing
these and additional human specimens for the possibility of West Nile-like
virus infection.
CDC and city and state health departments emphasize that current mosquito
control efforts by individuals and communities are appropriate because the
same mosquito species transmit both viruses. Individuals should continue
to do the following to reduce their contact with mosquitoes:
When outdoors, wear clothing that covers the skin such as long sleeve
shirts and pants; spray clothing and exposed skin with insect repellant.
Curb outside activity at dawn, dusk and during the evening.
Communities should continue to do the following:
Raise public awareness about the outbreak, control measures, and personal
protection.
Continue current efforts of mosquito control. CDC further recommends that
communities in the area should consider mosquito spraying if they have not
yet done so.

The New York Times also has an article on this topic:
"African Virus May Be Culprit in Mosquito-Borne Illnesses in New York Region"

In part, it says that West Nile virus [WNV was discovered this week in
dozens of birds that died in and around the Bronx Zoo this summer. Blood
samples from people with symptoms, trapped mosquitoes, as well as roughly
450 birds will be examined by the CDC. to see whether the WNV virus found
in the birds was what has caused the New Yorkers to become ill.
The discovery of WNV came about in large part by determined investigations
by Tracy McNamara, head of the department of pathology at the Bronx Zoo,
Federal officials said. In late July Dr. McNamara became concerned when
she heard that a large number of crows had been dying around the zoo. By
August, 40 crows had died. Then, birds at the zoo began to die.
Over Labor Day weekend, the zoo lost a Guanay Cormorant, three Chilean
flamingos, a pheasant and a bald eagle. Because these deaths followed those
of the crows, experts strongly doubt that the disease originated in the
zoo.
Autopsies of the birds revealed streaking in the heart and brain
hemorrhages. Eastern equine encephalitis was suspected, but McNamara was
skeptical, because the emus in her care, which are very susceptible to
eastern equine encephalitis virus, were thriving.
When two more flamingos died on Sept. 9, she sent samples to laboratories
of the United States Department of Agriculture, in Ames, Iowa, which ruled
out all the common bird viruses. "It was becoming more and more suggestive
that this was not a regular bird disease," McNamara said. The CDC was also
sent samples, as were doctors at an Army lab in Fort Detrick in Maryland.
Yesterday, the CDC discovered the WNV link. "Everyone was shocked," she
said. "It's possible it came in with a human or a smuggled bird, and I am
not at all certain it will ever be established how it got here."
The Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, which has been in charge of the
spraying, would not comment on the CDC news.

[This is one of the most remarkable occurrences I have seen in 35 years
working with arthropod-borne viruses. This strain of WNV might have
entered the U.S. in an infected bird or an infected human, either of whom
might have been viremic for the length of time it takes a jet plane to
travel from essentially throughout Africa, where it is enzootic, or from
Europe, where this virus has appeared recently with greater frequency and
apparent pathogenicity (vide supra, archived messages re: Romania, and
Italy). A recent issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases
<http://www.cdc.gov> contains a report on human WNV infections in the Czech
Republic; older literature reports mention the virus in Europe from
Portugal, Croatia, Cyprus, and the former Soviet Union.
If WNV has entered the U.S. in exotic, imported birds, it should be
relatively easy to check the Bronx Zoo's recent import records and dates of
death of any of those birds. It will also be necessary to check records of
arrivals of exotic birds at NY City and area bird dealers. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service =
APHIS) should also have import records.
Irrespective of the method by which WNV has entered the U.S., this is a
stunning discovery. Keep in mind that to this moment it has not been shown
that any of the human infections, with what has been reported as St. Louis
encephalitis (SLE) virus, have actually been WNV infections. Therefore,
this may be the oddest of coincidences but, as C.J. Peters has said, "When
you hear hoof beats, think horses, not zebras". That may hold for the U.S.
but not for Africa. Still, such a coincidence would be remarkable. There
had been no reports of the presence of SLE virus anywhere in the eastern
U.S., except in the NY City area; ProMED had mused on the source of the
index SLEV-infected bird. As we reported on 22 September [St. Louis
enceph. - USA(New York, Westchester County) 990922002538, not only was
"SLE virus" detected in mosquitoes collected on a Greenwich, Connecticut,
golf course but the virus also was isolated from the brain of a dead crow
removed from a home in Westport, Connecticut, the same species dying near
the Bronx Zoo.
WNV has been isolated from humans, birds, camels, bats, rodents, horses,
ticks, and many species of mosquitoes. However, these isolations have all
been from places outside the U.S., so it is not clear how the CDC and local
health departments can say that "current mosquito control efforts by
individuals and communities are appropriate because the same mosquito
species transmit both viruses".
If the crows and other birds began dying in July, why did the first human
cases of whatever this is not begin to appear until late August, in Queens
County?
St. Louis encephalitis virus and West Nile virus are both members of the
West Nile antigenic complex of the virus family Flaviviridae. They are
very closely related viruses and might be confused. However, arbovirus
identification can be tricky business. One usually "screens" an isolate
against a battery of antibodies to viruses suspected to occur in an area
(there are more than 500 recognized arboviruses). After detecting reaction
with antibody to one or more viruses, confirmatory neutralization tests are
done. Nucleotide sequencing follows, so that the molecular epidemiology of
the virus and the possible source and route of movement can be ascertained.
Obviously, this has not yet been done with the SLE virus isolates. Until
adequate and appropriate neutralization tests are conducted the
identification can only be called provisional.
Vincent Deubel, Pasteur Institute, Paris, has considerable experience with
the molecular epidemiology of WNV and will likely be called in to consult
on further studies.
Seems to me that Dr. Tracy McNamara deserves considerable praise for her
keen observances. - Mod.CHC
