Impending Worldwide Shortage of Equine Rabies Immune Globulin
-------------------------------------------------------------
There is an impending worldwide shortage of Equine Rabies Immune Globulin
(ERIG). This product is of little direct interest in North America and
Europe. It is, however, essential for "State of the Art" post-exposure
rabies treatment in those developing regions of the world where rabies may
be endemic.
Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) is not only in short supply worldwide
but is completely out of the affordable price range in most parts of the
world. Modern ERIG was highly purified and had a serum sickness rate of
around 1 percent and an anaphylaxis rate lower than that of penicillin
(Annals
Int Med 1996; 125: 233-236). The price for ERIG imported from Europe used
to be about 80-90 percent less than HRIG, making it almost affordable in poor
countries.
We have just been informed that the last of the 3 large international firms
making purified and pepsin-digested ERIG has ceased production and none
will be available after a few more months. The reasons give for this are:
actions by animal rights activists who demonstrated against horse farms
used for plasma donations; increased costs; and complex new regulatory
rules. This means that the ability of most poor countries to manage
post-exposure rabies cases will be further impaired or even eliminated.
What does this mean to the infectious disease community worldwide?
Consequences may be: 1) Countries in rabies-endemic regions have to work
harder to control the disease in dogs; 2) these countries should also look
into local production of ERIG and/or expansion of existing small isolated
facilities; and, 3) pre-exposure rabies vaccination of high risk groups
will become even more important.
