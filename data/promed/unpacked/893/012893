Malaysia on dengue alert, Johor activates action plan following outbreak in
Singapore
------------------------------------------------
After 4 months of battling to control dengue, Malaysia is back on high
alert, as the number of cases soared last week [3rd week September 2005].
With the disease claiming 68 lives as of 10 Sep 2005, the health
authorities are concerned that there may be more casualties. Their worries
are growing, as 9540 people in Singapore were reported to be down with the
disease as of 12 Sep 2005, surpassing the previous record of 9459 last year
[2004].
An action plan has been activated in Johor to cope with a possible increase
in dengue cases following the outbreak in the neighboring republic.
All over Asia, governments are scrambling to halt the spread of the
disease, with the agenda topped by efforts to educate the public on the
disease and control of mosquito-breeding areas, as there is no known cure
for dengue.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has billed dengue as "the
most important mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans -- ahead of
malaria and encephalitis -- with an estimated 2.5 billion people at risk
worldwide."
Health Ministry Communicable Disease Control division director Dr Ramlee
Rahmat, when contacted in Australia, said: "Although the situation in
Malaysia is under control, it can lead to an epidemic if people do not keep
their surroundings clean and destroy all _Aedes_ mosquito-breeding
grounds." He said continued monitoring, surveillance, education and
co-operation between the public and relevant authorities ensured that the
situation was under control in the country, which recorded an average of
600 cases a week.
"A slip-up will lead to an outbreak," he said, adding that the number of
dengue cases had almost doubled, from 507 cases recorded between 28 Aug and
3 Sep 2005, to 703 from 4-10 Sep 2005.
Selangor topped the list with 214 cases, compared with 141 the previous
week, Federal Territory 99 (76 last week), Penang 93 (54), Johor 80 (50),
Kedah 33 (23), Negri Sembilan 33 (36), Perak 31 (32), Pahang 29 (23),
Sarawak 27 (10), Kelantan 19 (13), Malacca 17 (7), Sabah 15 (22),
Terengganu 6 (12), Putrajaya 4 (3), Perlis 3 (4) and Labuan 0 (one).
Dr Ramlee said their main concerns were Selangor, the Federal Territory,
Penang and Johor, where the number of cases was soaring despite regular
enforcement operations.
The problematic areas in Selangor are areas under the care of the Shah Alam
City Council, Subang Jaya Municipal Council, Petaling Jaya Municipal
Council, and Ampang Jaya Municipal Council.
The areas of concern in Johor are Taman Perling, Apartment Melawi Taman Yu,
Taman Megah Ria, Felda Cahaya Baru, and Taman Jaya Mas.
Barat Daya, Seberang Prai Utara, Seberang Prai Tengah, Seberang Prai
Selatan, Timur Laut and areas under the care of the Penang Municipal
Council are being monitored by the authorities as well.
Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are caused by one of 4 closely
related, but antigenically distinct virus serotypes: the Den-1, Den-2,
Den-3 and Den-4, of the genus Flavivirus.
Dr Ramlee said the Den-1 was the prevalent virus. "I have directed all
state health directors to monitor the situation and ensure a weekly report
is submitted," he said. He said that between 1 Jan and 10 Sep 2005, the
authorities were notified of 26 099 suspected cases, with 7604 later
confirmed as dengue.
Dr Ramlee said that 35.7 per cent, or 9313, of the suspected cases were
reported in Selangor, followed by Federal Territory with 4072 and Perak
with 2164.

Woman dies, man critical in Penang dengue outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
A woman died Saturday [17 Sep 2005] of dengue hemorrhagic fever, and a man
suffering from the disease is in critical condition in the Penang Hospital,
following an outbreak of dengue in several urban areas of the state last
week [3rd week September 2005]. The 46 year old woman, a handicraft
entrepreneur of Bukit Gelugor, died at 2 pm Saturday, State Health, Welfare
and Caring Society Committee chairman P Subbaiyah said. The man, a 21 year
old from Kampung Binjal, Bayan Lepas, was admitted to the hospital on
Wednesday [14 Sep 2005] and is reported to be in stable condition.
Subbaiyah, who had visited both of them earlier today [18 Sep 2005], called
for public cooperation to prevent the spread of the disease, saying that
the people should rid their house compounds of breeding grounds of the
_Aedes_ mosquito. He said workers from the local authorities would conduct
checks and also spray insecticide in suspected mosquito-breeding areas.
Areas where dengue cases have occurred include Sungai Nibong, Bayan Baru,
Pantai Jerejak, and Teluk Kumbar. Subbaiyah advised those who have fever to
seek immediate treatment at hospitals. He also said that people should
spray their homes with mosquito repellant, especially at dawn and sunset.

5 more dengue cases, Janakpuri scene grim
-----------------------------------------
Dengue fever continued to maintain its grip on the capital with 5 more
cases, making 109 as of Thursday [15 Sep 2005]. Worse still, the MCD's
health department is stumped at the large number of cases being reported
from Janakpuri despite repeated visits by teams to the area to check
mosquito breeding. To discuss ways to contain the overall rise in cases in
Delhi, an expert group led by health minister Yoganand Shastri will meet on
Friday [16 Sep 2005].
MCD's medical health officer Dr KN Tewari rated the overall dengue scene in
the capital as a cause for concern. Even he is grappling hard to look for a
reason for this rising trend in Janakpuri, located in west zone. He said:
"There are certain kinds of dengue-causing mosquitoes that do not transmit
the virus. So, even though there is as much breeding in some other areas,
Janakpuri could be reporting more cases, as the mosquitoes prevalent there
could be more infectious."
Of the 114 dengue cases reported so far, 79 are from within Delhi, and 35
have come from other states. Of those reported from Delhi, west zone has
reported 26, this being the highest among the 12 zones.
"Of these, 16 are from Janakpuri," Dr Tiwari said. This is the situation
despite the fact that MCD teams have been focusing on Janakpuri in
particular for some time now, Dr Tiwari added.
"Over the last 15 days, around 6 visits to check mosquito breeding have
been carried out in the area," he said. An awareness campaign has also been
carried out extensively in that area, but still the cases continue to be
reported. Dr Tiwari also noted that the public needs to be cautious.

Indian state fights dengue with fish
------------------------------------
Indian health authorities are using colorful aquarium fish with a taste for
mosquito larvae to fight a dengue epidemic that has left dozens dead,
health officials said on Friday [16 Sep 2005]. Dengue, which is transmitted
by mosquitoes, has killed about 50 people and affected hundreds in the past
few weeks in the eastern state of West Bengal, where authorities are
struggling to control the disease.
Health officials have released thousands of gambusia and guppies, small,
brightly colored freshwater fish popular in home aquaria, into ponds,
lakes, wells and stagnant water where mosquitoes breed. "Guppies eat
mosquito larvae and help in checking the breeding rate of mosquitoes. These
fish are being used successfully to fight dengue," said Prabhakar
Chatterjee, West Bengal's medical services chief.
Dengue is marked by high fever, headache, rash and nausea, and if not
treated in time, can lead to death.
Health volunteers, medical students and voluntary organizations are
distributing the fish. "Gambusia is a cheap and easily available fish that
can eat daily its own weight in mosquito larvae or pupae," said Amiya Hati,
an expert in mosquito-borne diseases.
Authorities are encouraging the use of gambusia fish, because mosquitoes
have become resistant to many pesticides, such as DDT.
