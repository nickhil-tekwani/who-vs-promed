Beekeepers are being urged to monitor their hives after an outbreak of the killer disease American foulbrood [AFB] was discovered at an apiary near Alyth [Scotland].

The outbreak at the apiary was confirmed following diagnosis by Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture.

The disease kills bee larva by consuming their tissue.

The infected hives are being destroyed as there is no permitted treatment for the disease in the UK.

It means around 210 000 honeybees will have to be destroyed.

There are no risks to public health from AFB and no implications for the quality and safety of honey.

Bee farmers and beekeepers are being urged to be vigilant for signs of the disease, to maintain good husbandry practices and to report any suspicions of infection.

Classic signs of the disease are sunken cappings on cells, which when uncapped reveal dead larvae in various stages of decomposition.

The larvae have a caramel like, light to dark brown consistency and when drawn out, the decomposing material strings out rather than snapping off -- something known as the roppiness test.

In order to assist Scottish Government Bee Inspectors to control this and other diseases, beekeepers are urged to register on BeeBase, the national bee database.

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium. AFB is a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 50 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae, leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
