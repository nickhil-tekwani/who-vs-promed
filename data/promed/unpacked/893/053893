The Northern Territory Government has reported an outbreak of a potentially
deadly disease in the Borroloola community, about 850 km [531 miles] south
east of Darwin.

Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (AGSN) has been wiped from most
developed nations except for Australia, where remote indigenous communities
have the highest rates of the disease in the world. The Menzies School of
Health Research's Catherine Marshall co-authored the report and says the
illness has been identified as a precursor to kidney disease.

"We think that there are a lot of cases of subclinical diseases where
children may not have a lot of symptoms, and I guess it's important for
clinicians to be aware of the condition," she said. "[Clinicians should]
monitor children who have skin sores and also that may have blood in their
urine and other symptoms of this condition." She says the outbreak could
have significant long term effects, as the illness has been identified as a
precursor to chronic kidney disease. "One of the important things is that
this is related to skin infections, which I think [are] probably in part
related to the living conditions in indigenous communities," she said.
"It's one reason why we need to sort of work on improving the issues of
overcrowding and living conditions in communities in the Northern Territory."

[Group A streptococci (_Streptococcus pyogenes_ or GAS) are responsible for
most cases of streptococcal illness. Other types (for example, groups B, C,
and G) may also cause infection. Pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis, impetigo,
cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, bacteremia, toxic shock syndrome, and
hematogenously disseminated foci are some of the forms of acute infection
caused by GAS. GAS are also responsible for non-suppurative complications
such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis, which can follow GAS
infection caused by particular strains of GAS after a latent period. Acute
rheumatic fever only follows pharyngitis, whereas acute post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis (APSGN) can follow either GAS pharyngitis or skin infection.

M protein is the major somatic virulence factor of GAS, which are divided
into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein
molecule. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of
the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm>.

There are more than 120 different M protein serotypes and/or emm sequence
types of GAS. APSGN follows GAS infection with a limited number of M
serotypes, the so-called nephritogenic strains of GAS. Type 12 is the most
frequent M serotype following pharyngitis, and type 49 is the most frequent
serotype following skin infection.

GAS skin infections occur most frequently in children in humid subtropical
and tropical regions and during the summer in temperate regions. Insect
bites, skin abrasions, or other minor trauma can induce skin infection
following exposure to a nephritogenic GAS strain. GAS infections can be
highly contagious; crowded, unhygienic living conditions can facilitate
person-to-person spread of GAS infection. APSGN may occur in sporadic cases
or in an epidemic. The attack rate of APSGN after GAS pharyngitis or skin
infection with a nephritogenic strain is 10-15 per cent. APSGN is thought
to be due to deposition of circulating complexes consisting of
immunoglobulin, streptococcal antigen, and complement components within the
glomerulus of the kidneys. These immune complexes can be demonstrated by
immunofluorescent staining of renal biopsies. Symptoms of APSGN include
headache and dull back pain. Clinical findings may include dark-colored
urine, swelling of different parts of the body (edema), and high blood
pressure. Serum complement is low in most patients with APSGN. Unrecognized
subclinical cases outnumber cases with apparent nephritis. Antibiotic
treatment of an antecedent GAS infection does not prevent APSGN and
treatment of APSGN is supportive.

GAS skin infections are reported to be very common in Aboriginal children
in the Northern Territory; 50 to 70 per cent of cases are reported to be
secondary to scabies, with a concurrently high rate of the post-infection
complication of rheumatic fever and APSGN (see:
<http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/6/1448>;
<http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=1719641>;
<http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13677258>; and
<http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/4/07-043034.pdf>).

In 1993, an epidemic of APSGN was described in 10 per cent of 583
Aboriginal children and was associated with GAS skin infections
<http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119965088/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0>.


The mass use of penicillin in this outbreak may have reduced further
transmission of the nephritogenic strain of GAS. A prior ProMED-mail post
(archive no. 20050210.0448) described another outbreak of APSGN in the
Torres Straits in Northern Australia in 2005.

The news release concerning the current outbreak offers no epidemiologic
data on numbers of individuals affected, their ages, medical or social
predispositions, time course of the outbreak or microbiologic data
documenting the number or types of GAS strains involved.

There is a likely ongoing need for adequate housing, eradication of
scabies, care of other predisposing skin lesions, and improved hygiene in
this population to prevent GAS skin infections.

Borroloola NT, Australia is an isolated township with a population of 800
