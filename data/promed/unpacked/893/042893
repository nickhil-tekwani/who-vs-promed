The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) reported on 15 Aug 2017 that 2 Virginia horses have tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

On 11 Aug 2017, a horse from Culpeper [Culpeper county] which was exhibiting neurologic signs was transported to the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center in Leesburg [Loudoun county]. The horse was immediately isolated from the hospital population and has not come into contact with any other patients.

On 12 Aug 2017, the VDACS Animal Health Lab in Warrentonp [Fauquier county] confirmed a diagnosis of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). The horse remains isolated while undergoing supportive care.

On 14 Aug 2017, a 2nd horse from the same farm developed a fever and neurologic signs and was euthanized. The VDACS' Animal Health Lab confirmed an EHV-1 diagnosis, and the farm has been quarantined.

The Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center employed strict biosecurity measures and disinfection upon arrival and will continue to do so during the entirety of the horse's hospitalization. The center is operating normally.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[If these 2 horses never the left the farm, then quarantining the farm makes sense. If the horses had traveled anywhere other than the veterinary school it would seem appropriate to notify the show steward or the event organizer. This article implies the horses had not left the farm. However, the owners should be advised to take the temperature of every horse at least twice daily. A slight rise in temperature may be the earliest and perhaps only sign of illness. - Mod.TG
