Risk
----
Manufacturing controls necessary to ensure the safety of the products listed above could not be demonstrated satisfactorily by the product manufacturer. The issue relates to controlling factors to prevent the growth and toxin production of _C. botulinum_. Botulinum toxin may cause a serious form of food poisoning called botulism and can be fatal.

A recall from customers is being carried out as a precautionary measure.

Our advice to consumers
-----------------------
If you have bought the above product do not eat it. Instead, return it to their store for a full refund.

Action taken by the company
---------------------------
Chatsworth House is recalling the above products. A point-of-sale notice will be displayed in their retail store. These notices explain to customers why the products are being recalled and tells them what to do if they have bought any of the product.

[Rillettes are a form of pâté (paste made from finely minced or mashed ingredients). How much and the location of the distribution of the recalled products are not stated.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
