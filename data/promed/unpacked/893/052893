[2] Zika virus mutation
Date: Tue 12 Apr 2022
Source: Science Daily [edited]
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220412141017.htm


Researchers at La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) have found that Zika virus can mutate to become more infective -- and potentially break through pre-existing immunity.

"The world should monitor the emergence of this Zika virus variant," says LJI Professor Sujan Shresta, PhD, who co-led the Cell Reports study with Professor Pei-Yong Shi, PhD, of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB).

Zika virus is carried by mosquitoes, and the symptoms of Zika infection are usually mild in adults. However, the virus can infect a developing fetus, resulting in birth defects such as microcephaly.

Zika virus and dengue virus overlap in many countries worldwide. Like Zika, dengue virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and thus shares many biological properties. In fact, the viruses are similar enough that the immune response sparked by prior dengue exposure can offer protection against Zika. "In areas where Zika is prevalent, a vast majority of people have already been exposed to dengue virus and have both T cells and antibodies that cross-react," says Shresta.

Unfortunately, both viruses are also quick to mutate. "Dengue and Zika are RNA viruses, which means they can change their genome," explains Shresta. "When there are so many mosquitoes and so many human hosts, these viruses are constantly moving back and forth and evolving."

To study Zika's fast-paced evolution, the LJI team recreated infection cycles that repeatedly switched back and forth between mosquito cells and mice. This work gave the LJI scientists a window into how Zika virus naturally evolves as it encounters more hosts.

The researchers found it is relatively easy for Zika virus to acquire a single amino acid change that allows the virus to make more copies of itself -- and help infections take hold more easily. This mutation (called NS2B I39V/I39T mutation) boosts the virus's ability to replicate in both mice and mosquitoes. This Zika variant also showed increased replication in human cells.

"This single mutation is sufficient to enhance Zika virus virulence," says study 1st author Jose Angel Regla-Nava, PhD, former postdoctoral researcher at LJI and current Associate Professor at the University of Guadalajara, Mexico. "A high replication rate in either a mosquito or human host could increase viral transmission or pathogenicity -- and cause a new outbreak."

Adds Shresta, "The Zika variant that we identified had evolved to the point where the cross-protective immunity afforded by prior dengue infection was no longer effective in mice. Unfortunately for us, if this variant becomes prevalent, we may have the same issues in real life."

So how can we prepare for this kind of variant? Shresta's laboratory is already looking at ways to tailor Zika vaccines and treatments that counteract this dangerous mutation. She will also continue to work closely with Regla-Nava to better understand exactly how this mutation helps Zika replicate more efficiently.

"We want to understand at what point in the viral life cycle this mutation makes a difference," says Shresta.

[As the above report notes, mutations in this RNA virus are to be expected. These researchers have found a mutant that may enhance replication in both mice and mosquitoes and virulence in mice. It will be interesting to see if loss of cross-protective immunity with dengue virus will increase the risk of non-neutralizing dengue virus antibody-dependent enhancement with more severe dengue infections resulting. The frequency of occurrence of the NS2B I39V/I39T mutation is not known, nor whether pathogenicity is increased for humans as it is for mice. These findings indicate that surveillance for Zika virus infections and routine sequencing of the virus genomes circulating in nature will be necessary to determine how serious a risk this virus variant is for human health. - Mod.TY]

[3] Mutation enhanced transmission

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
------
Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are arthropod-borne pathogenic flaviviruses that co-circulate in many countries. To understand some of the pressures that influence ZIKV evolution, we mimic the natural transmission cycle by repeating serial passaging of ZIKV through cultured mosquito cells and either DENV-naive or DENV-immune mice. Compared with wild-type ZIKV, the strains passaged under both conditions exhibit increased pathogenesis in DENV-immune mice. Application of reverse genetics identifies an isoleucine-to-valine mutation (I39V) in the NS2B proteins of both passaged strains that confers enhanced fitness and escape from pre-existing DENV immunity. Introduction of I39V or I39T, a naturally occurring homologous mutation detected in recent ZIKV isolates, increases the replication of wild-type ZIKV in human neuronal precursor cells and laboratory-raised mosquitoes. Our data indicate that ZIKV strains with enhanced transmissibility and pathogenicity can emerge in DENV-naive or -immune settings, and that NS2B-I39 mutants may represent ZIKV variants of interest.

[4] Male genital tract inflammation
Date: Fri 19 Aug 2022

Citation: Ampel NM. Persistent Zika virus RNA in semen is associated with inflammation of the male genital tract. N Engl J Med J Watch. 2022.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Men with long-term shedding of Zika virus RNA had more leukocytes and inflammatory cytokines in their semen than short-term shedders.

An unusual aspect of the Zika virus is that, in addition to being mosquito-borne, it can be transmitted sexually -- a modality estimated to account for 23% of all infections in endemic regions. In a previous prospective study of 184 men with symptomatic illness, Zika virus RNA was found in the semen of 33% and continued to be detectable 90 days later in 21% [N Engl J Med J Watch June 2018 (https://www.jwatch.org/na46441/2018/04/11/zika-virus-shedding-semen) and N Engl J Med 2018; 378: 1377 (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1711038)].

To examine why some individuals shed Zika virus RNA for prolonged periods and others do not, samples from the previous study were further characterized. The 26 long-term shedders (>78 days) were compared with 23 short-term shedders (<22 days). Long-term shedders had significantly higher semen leukocyte concentrations 30 and 60 days after infection. In long-term shedders, the concentration of Zika virus RNA was similar in seminal fluid and the cellular fraction and was found equally in epithelial cells, leukocytes, and sperm cells. Among long-term (but not short-term) shedders, Zika virus RNA and inflammatory cytokines were significantly correlated in semen.

Comment
-------
These results demonstrate that long-term shedding of Zika virus RNA in semen is associated with inflammation of the male genital tract. While human Zika virus epidemics begin when infection spills over from the animal reservoir into a nonimmune population, they may be sustained by sexual transmission. Better understanding of male viral shedding could be important in controlling future epidemics.
