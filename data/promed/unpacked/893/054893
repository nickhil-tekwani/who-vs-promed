Health warning issued after cats contract plague
--------------------------------------------------
After 2 feral cats [domestic breed but running wild outdoors tested
positive for the plague [_Yersinia pestis_ on Mount Charleston
[Nevada, Clark County Health District officials are warning visitors
and residents of the area to avoid contact with wild animals and to
wear insect repellent when going outdoors. Owners should protect pets
by using flea collars and keeping pets away from rodents or sick or
dead animals.
Plague is a bacterial illness transmitted through the bite of an
infected flea, contact with an infected animal, or inhalation of
respiratory droplets from an infected animal [or human. Symptoms
include swollen glands, fever, chills, headache, and exhaustion [as
well as pneumonia and signs of overwhelming bacterial sepsis.
No human plague cases have been documented in Clark County [Nevada,
health district officials said, though 5 cases have been reported in
rural areas of Nevada since 1978, with the most recent case in 1992.
Of the 5 people infected, 2 died.
Cases of animal plague are not unusual; 4 foxes and one coyote tested
positive for the disease in the Mount Charleston area last year. For
more information about the plague, contact the health district at
[702 383-1251.

[Although flea control is discussed in this piece from the media, it
may well be of more importance to prevent cats from hunting, as is
pointed out in a comment by Dr. Eidson in the 1999 ProMED-mail posting
"Plague, cats & dogs to humans", above. In a paper by Dr. Eidson on
this topic (Eidson, M., L. A. Tierney, O. J. Rollag, T. Becker, T.
Brown, and H. F. Hull. 1988. Feline plague in New Mexico: risk factors
and transmission to humans. Am J Public Health 78(10):1333-5), there
was a history of hunting rodents in 75% of the 60 feline cases.
Of interest, prior to 1980 there had only been 8 confirmed cases of
feline plague reported in the United States. In Dr. Eidson's paper, 60
cases of feline plague were reported, which represented the _Y.
pestis_ infections in cats in New Mexico alone from 1977 to 1985. It
is not clear if the increase in number cases of plague in cats is due
to an increase in the incidence of infection, improved surveillance of
cats, or increased awareness by veterinarians of feline plague.
It is also worth noting that prior to 1977 there had been no human
cases of plague reported in which cats were identified as the source
of infection. However, from 1977 to 1994 cats were identified as the
source of infection for 15 human plague cases in the United States.
Importantly, the proportion of human plague cases with primary
pneumonic plague was much higher among cat-associated cases (4 of the
15 cases) than among cases for which cats were not sources of
infection (only one of 236 cases; Human Plague -- United States,
1993-1994. MMWR:43(13);242-246).
Cat-to-human transmission of plague has been documented both in the
south-western United States (& California near the Nevada border) and
in South Africa. In addition to the means of transmission mentioned in
the second paragraph of the media report above, transmission via cat
bite has also occurred (Thornton, D. J., R. C. Tustin, B. J. Pienaar,
W. N. Pienaar, and H. D. Bubb. 1975. Cat bite transmission of
_Yersinia pestis_ infection to man. J S Afr Vet Assoc 46(2):165-9). -
