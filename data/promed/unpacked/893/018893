Schmallenberg virus [SBV] is spreading across Britain with 4 new counties affected
----------------------------------------------------------------
The number of farms affected by the virus, that causes lambs to be born deformed, jumped by a 3rd over the weekend from 92 to 121. Devon, Dorset, Cambridgeshire, and Somerset, that all have a large amount of livestock, are the latest counties to be infected with the disease.

It is thought the disease, that 1st emerged this summer in the German town of Schmallenberg, [has been] spread by midges that came across the channel. Midges are inactive at this time of year but the disease is only just emerging as animals give birth.

The Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) found 113 cases in sheep and 8 in cattle. Goats are also affected [though no cases registered yet in UK] but no cases have been found in wild species of cloven hoofed animals such as deer.

The largest number of cases have been reported in eastern counties -- Suffolk, Norfolk, East Sussex, and Kent -- but the disease has been found as far west as Cornwall.

The increase in cases had been expected by the industry as lambing and calving gather pace.

Little can be done to protect livestock beyond housing them inside [during the vector season], which reduces exposure to midges. Nets and insecticides have proven to be of little use.

Reports so far suggest that on affected farms between 10 per cent and 50 per cent of lambs are lost to the infection.

A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was vital that farmers continue to report any suspicions as soon as possible, to help gather information about progress and effects of the disease.

SBV is not thought to be a threat to human health but could decimate the Britain's lamb and beef industry. It is hoped a vaccine will be developed in the next 2 years but in the meantime the farms affected will have to bear the losses of dead lambs.

[The Telegraph's reader "Don" has submitted the following corrective comment to the newspaper:

'"The Schmallenberg virus is spreading across Britain" -- wrong. It is not spreading. It did spread last year. There are no midges active now. The birth defects that are seen now are the results of infection when the embryos were in the womb. Obviously the disease spread widely last summer and no symptoms at all were seen at that time. The defects seen now are the only signs of last summer's epidemic.'

We fully agree. See also Dr Roeder's contribution (item 2, below). - Mod.AS]

[2] Comment on SBV epidemiology

Subject: Epidemiology of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) infection
------------------------------------------------------------
I am concerned that some reports in the media give an imprecise explanation of SBV epidemiology and tend to suggest that SBV is transmitting between lambs in affected flocks and spreading between flocks by this means; I would suggest that more needs to be done to ensure that the public is better informed on the epidemiology of this disease. I would also like to make some comments about Europe's vulnerability to virus invasions.

As is common knowledge, the epidemiology of SBV infection seems to be similar to that of Akabane virus and other orthobunyaviruses of the Simbu Group which affect ruminants. Useful insights can be gained from a global view of Akabane disease over the last 40 years or so since its 1st description. Akabane virus infection is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas. In these, susceptible ruminant species become infected at an early age when fed on by ubiquitous midge and mosquito vectors and develop a long-lasting protective immunity by the time of breeding; thus, congenital abnormalities are seldom seen in endemic areas even though cases can occur when naive, susceptible animals are introduced into such areas. Under favourable environmental conditions, the vectors (and hence the virus) may spread beyond their usual range, and outbreaks of congenital disease then occur in areas where the disease process has rarely, or never been experienced before.

Essentially it is at the interface between free and endemic areas that severe outbreaks are to be expected. Acute infection following postnatal exposure, accompanied by unremarkable clinical signs, is usually not recognised to have occurred until malformed lambs and calves are born. By this time the virus is no longer present in either dam or offspring; antibodies disclose the presence of earlier infection. Akabane viruses vary in their virulence but only rarely has pathology been associated with post-natal infection (ref 1).

Outbreaks at the interface tend to occur infrequently but are recognised to have occurred in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Israel, and Turkey (ref 1) and southern Africa to the north and south of the endemic zone. Repeated outbreaks in Turkey and Israel over the last 40 years indicate clearly that, at least from 1970 until 2010 or 2011, the eastern Mediterranean was situated at the interface between endemic and free areas.

Now that a Simbu Group virus, like bluetongue viruses in 2006 to 2010, has made the leap northwards in Europe, and without understanding the determinants that favoured the change, it is impossible to predict what will happen next. Will the virus "burn out" and the earlier status be re-established (whatever that was); are we to see a permanent shift in the interface between endemic and free zones; or, alternatively, will the epidemic wave move on as vector range extends or previously free populations of vectors become infected for the 1st time? It has been reported that SBV is most closely related to Shamonda virus, one of a number of Simbu Group viruses detected in Nigeria in the 1960s. Having not been seen since, emergence of the virus in Japan in 2002 (ref 3) illustrated that we know little of the epidemiology of such potential pathogens. One thing is clear -- our vision of the threat posed by the presence of these viruses at the edge of Europe was too complacent by far.

Several other viruses are in a similar situation to that of SBV and pose an immediate threat to the livestock of northern Europe. Not least of these are the orbiviruses causing epizootic haemorrhagic disease [EHD] of ruminants, African horse sickness [AHS], and equine encephalosis [EE]. Enhanced surveillance and applied research are surely essential at this time to prepare for the introduction of new vectorborne diseases which now seems inevitable.

[The following passage, derived from chapter 2.9.1 of OIE's terrestrial manual which addresses Akabane and other bunyaviruses, falls in line with Dr Roeder's appreciated commentary and adds supportive background:

"In endemic areas, antibody in the female animal prevents fetal infection, but Akabane virus is capable of establishing a long-term infection of the placenta in susceptible cattle and sheep. This takes place between 30 and 70 days gestation in the ewe and between 30 and 150 days gestation in the cow. Akabane virus has a predilection for brain, spinal cord and muscle cells where non-inflammatory necrosis interferes with morphogenesis.

"Akabane virus infection has been studied experimentally in sheep and goats with the production of arthrogryposis/hydroencephaly, kyphosis, scoliosis, micro- and porencephaly, stillbirths and abortions.

"Experimental Akabane virus studies have been carried out in pregnant cattle and it was shown that the type of abnormality is dependent on the gestational age of the fetus with hydroencephaly seen at 76-104 days and arthrogryposis at 103-174 days gestation. This time differential in appearance of abnormalities is clearly seen in bovine fetuses, whereas in sheep with a shorter gestation period, brain and skeletal lesions appear concurrently in the same fetus. The sequence of events during an epizootic of Akabane virus-induced fetal loss are the birth of uncoordinated calves, followed by those with arthrogryposis and dysplastic muscle changes, and lastly those with hydrocephalus and other severe CNS lesions. These events may be preceded by stillbirths and abortions." (For additional data and references, see http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.09.01_BUNYAVIRAL_DISEASES.pdf)

According to the said data, and provided SBV behaves similarly to its closely-related Akabane virus, increasing numbers of CNS-affected cattle may be anticipated during the coming 1 - 3 months. But see also item 3, below ... - Mod.AS]

Important opinion from an experienced cattle farmer in Germany
--------------------------------------------------------------
Extract:
"..Believe me, nothing can beat hands on examination and good experience.

Just one example: Here they enter confirmed cases of SBV into the database without any information about breed, age or farming details so what information should the epidemiologists work with?

In my opinion SBV is not new, has popped up the 1st time in 2007/2008 and then has been dormant until last year. The fact that dams of affected calves, at least in our region, are rather young (about 3 years, 1st-2nd calvers) while older cows produce healthy offspring should make everybody think. You won't find this information in the computers yet it could be of importance once data for the whole country could be compared."

Nearly one and a half [thousand] farms are now affected throughout the European Union, with Germany the worst at present.

[It would be interesting to note from informed sources in the Netherlands and Belgium (where at least 82 cattle farms with SBV-affected congenital malformed calves have already been recorded), if they observe an age distribution pattern which is similar to the one described above from (a region) in Germany, and if sheep -- older than 4 years -- have been affected. - Mod.AS]

Information on Schmallenberg virus
----------------------------------
... From investigations in affected animals [carried out by FLI], in some animals virological tests indicated that certain tissues have a relatively high viral load. Virus was detected in placentas and birth fluids. Therefore people assisting animals during parturition are considered as coming more frequently into contact with the new virus.

The new virus is similar to other viruses from the group of Orthobunyaviridae. Closely related viruses of the Simbu serogroup, known to infect cattle, don't have a zoonotic potential and don't pose a danger for humans. Therefore even if there is contact with animals infected with the SB, this is not regarded a risk for humans.

So far the RKI has no information that humans have tested positive for the new virus. Nevertheless, when dealing with animals possibly infected, the general guidelines on hygiene and maternity regulations should be adhered to.

Though, so far, there is no evidence of risk to humans, the RKI is conducting, as a precaution, screening of persons exposed to the virus to determine whether infection can occur in certain individuals.

On 29 Feb 2012, during a meeting of sheep breeders in Northrhine-Westphalia whose animals had been affected by SBV, the RKI conducted a survey and took blood samples. The RKI has developed a blood test to detect the virus as well as antibodies in human blood. The sheep farmers in attendance supported the scientific research and a very high number, 61 sheep farmers, agreed to take part in the study.

Interviews with farmers gave no indication that the virus might have caused disease in humans. The blood samples are currently tested at the RKI lab and only after analysing the samples reliable information will be made available.

[The results of the described RKI serological study in humans are anticipated with great interest.

According to the most recent countries' updates, the total number of SBV-infected animal holdings which have been lab confirmed in Europe so far, is 1737: 190 cattle farms, 1495 sheep farms and 52 goat farms. Their details, per country, are the following:

3 sheep holdings have, reportedly, been affected in Luxembourg (one of them a mixed sheep/goat farm); one single infected holding has been reported from northern Italy.

EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) is to hold its next meeting on 08 & 09 March 2012. The 1st subject on the agenda is "Update and exchange of views on the Schmallenberg virus situation". (The other issues in section A of the meeting are "Information from The Netherlands on the outcome of the studies on Q fever" and "Bluetongue situation in the Member States"). Outcome of the meeting and presentations are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
