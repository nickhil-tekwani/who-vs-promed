A female patient was admitted to the Wesley Hospital due to Legionnaires' disease. This is the 2nd case of Legionnaires' disease in Brisbane following the death of a 60-year-old woman last Sunday. Although a cancer patient, the elderly woman tested positive for Legionnaire's disease.

The Wesley Hospital water supply tested positive for _Legionella_ bacteria. In a statement released today [6 Jun 2013], Wesley Hospital said that the latest patient is confined in a different section of the hospital. The older woman stayed in a different hospital ward until her death. New hospital admissions were temporarily cancelled last night [5 Jun 2013] according to Executive Director Richard Royle of Uniting Care Health. The emergency department of Wesley Hospital will be the holding place of all emergency cases related to the disease.

Royle said the decision was made for the safety of all patients. It is a necessary precaution until the source of contamination is clearly determined. The director also said the health department would not risk the lives of patients in the hospital without knowing more about the recent Legionnaires' disease case.

Hospital personnel distributed wash kits to patients, since showering was not allowed at this time. The water supply of the hospital is being disinfected by engineers. Royle says every precautionary step will be taken until the hospital hears from Queensland Health experts. An investigation will be conducted today [6 Jun 2013] by agency environmental health experts.

The situation calls for a different kind of treatment, since it has never happened before. Uniting Health Care fully supports Wesley Hospital and is willing to provide the necessary resources. The hospital is the biggest not-for-profit hospital in Queensland. The hospital currently has 480 patients. Hundreds of patients were waiting for more updates since they have been alerted by hospital staff after a patient died from Legionnaires' disease.

According to health experts, the likelihood of developing the disease is rare and comparable to being struck by lightning. Nevertheless, they were worried about the risks of contamination and began contacting patients who may have had contact with the bacteria at the hospital.

Water samples collected 7 days before from the hospital's water supply tested positive for _Legionella_ bacteria. The samples were taken after the death of the elderly cancer patient. The contamination of the hospital's water system came as a surprise.

Legionnaires' disease has symptoms similar to [those of] flu, which include fever, headache, chills, fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea and shortness of breath. The disease is triggered by a few strains of _Legionella_ bacteria and may be spread via air conditioning units, showers, and other hot water sources.

Patients are advised to inform the hospital if any of the symptoms are felt. The hospital awaits further announcements as more information is known about the disease.

[The news release above is somewhat confusing: It says that the 2nd patient was admitted to the Wesley Hospital due to Legionnaires' disease, which implies that her infection was acquired in the community, but then goes on to imply that the 2 patients' infections were hospital-acquired in that water samples collected from the hospital's water supply had tested positive for _Legionella_; that the 2 patients with Legionnaires' disease were housed in different sections of the hospital; that the hospital has been closed to new hospital admissions temporarily until the source of contamination is found; that hospital personnel distributed wash kits to patients since showering (which may expose patients to _Legionella_-contaminated aerosols) is not allowed; and that the hospital's water supply is being disinfected. The article also says that all emergency cases related to the disease will be cohorted in the emergency department of Wesley Hospital, implying that Legionnaires' disease is transmitted person-to-person, which it is not.

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused usually by inhalation of aerosols containing _Legionella_ species. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis; more than 70 percent of cases of Legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at: http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf). Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ has been associated with the use of potting soil and gardening, whereas Legionnaires' disease due to _L. pneumophila_ is associated with exposure to aerosols of _Legionella_-contaminated water.

Legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or who have a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as, corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons. However, it is important to emphasize that relatively healthy individuals can also be at risk of contracting this disease.

A diagnosis of even a single case of Legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. It is, therefore, a public health imperative to find that source to prevent further cases.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir for an outbreak can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because, frequently, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

For a description of an extensive investigation of a nosocomial outbreak, please see the CDC report on the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Veterans Hospital posted by ProMED-mail recently (Legionellosis - USA: (PA) nosocomial, CDC investigation 20130226.1560035).

Brisbane, with a population of 2.2 million, is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland and the 3rd most populous city in Australia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane). Wesley Hospital is located in the Brisbane suburb of Auchenflower and has over 530 beds (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Hospital_(Brisbane)).
