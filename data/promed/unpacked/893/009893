[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 2 994 761, with reports of cases by 214 countries and territories worldwide. Given the rate of daily newly confirmed cases, the global total will surpass 3 million cases tomorrow (27 Apr 2020), taking 11 days to register a million cases (the 2 millionth case was reported on 15 Apr 2020). The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 97.2% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 33.0% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 206 990 deaths have been reported, 202 357 (97.8%) outside mainland China.

Ecuador, having doubled its case count overnight from 232 to 24 Apr 2020, has not reported any new cases for the past 2 days, most likely due to weekend reporting artifact.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Spain is number 2, and Italy is number 3, followed by France, Germany, UK, Turkey, Iran, China, and Russia as number 10. At the rate of increase in cases in Russia it will most likely have more cases than China in the next 24-48 hours. - Mod.MPP]

[3a] Cruise ships

https://www.fijitimes.com/nearly-150-total-coronavirus-cases-confirmed-on-cruise-ship-in-japan/


Nearly 150 cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed among crew members of an Italian cruise ship docked in Japan after health authorities finished testing everyone on board, an official said on Saturday [25 Apr 2020]. The Nagasaki prefecture official said 57 more crew had tested positive, bringing the total infections on board the Costa Atlantica to 148, roughly 1/4 of the vessel's 623 crew members. Authorities began testing after one crew member tested positive for the virus earlier this week.

No passengers are on board the vessel, which has been docked in Nagasaki in southwestern Japan since February [2020] for repairs and maintenance after the pandemic prevented scheduled repairs in China. The official told a news conference that the prefecture was discussing with the national government how to handle the large number of positive infections on the ship. He added that there was no change in plans to send those testing negative to their home nations as soon as possible.

The infection cluster on board the vessel comes as hospitals are running out of beds in some parts of Japan, where the national tally of virus cases has risen above 13 000. Some 350 people have died. Nagasaki, excluding the ship figures, has seen a relatively low number of 17 infections and one death.

Of those infected on board the Costa Atlantica, only one crew member has been admitted to hospital, while others remain on board, having shown slight or no symptoms. Nagasaki authorities had quarantined the vessel on arrival and ordered its crew not to venture beyond the quay except for hospital visits. But prefecture officials said earlier this week that some of the crew had departed without their knowledge, and sought detailed information on their movements.

The cruise ship infections follow a similar incident earlier this year [2020], when more than 700 passengers and crew tested positive for the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked in Yokohama.

[3b] Naval warship

As the American destroyer USS Kidd heads home to Everett [Washington State] with nearly 3 dozen cases of COVID-19, relatives and friends of the 350 crew members prayed for their health while Navy officials vowed to keep the outbreak, the 2nd to strike a Navy vessel, from spreading.

On Saturday [25 Apr 2020], the Navy reported that 33 sailors aboard the guided-missile destroyer had tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, up from the 18 cases announced just 24 hours earlier, according to the Navy's COVID-19 news site.

Navy officials had reported Friday [24 Apr 2020] that a Kidd sailor with symptoms had been evacuated a day earlier on Thursday [23 Apr 2020] to a San Antonio [Texas] medical facility, where he tested positive for the virus. The Navy then sent a specialized medical team to the Kidd to conduct contact tracing and additional testing. A 2nd sailor was medically evacuated off the ship later.

The Kidd is the 2nd Navy vessel at sea to report an outbreak, after the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, which has reported more than 800 cases of infection among its nearly 5000 crew members.

Navy officials did not respond to requests for updates about the Kidd on Sunday [26 Apr 2020]. But in a Saturday [25 Apr 2020] statement on the ship's Facebook page, Cmdr. Matt Noland, the ship's executive officer, said the Kidd was "navigating safely to port under our own power and under the watchful eyes of our own deck officers, CIC [combat information center] teams, and engineers. Our priority is to get this team to port safely, get ourselves a clean bill of health, and get right back into the mix at sea." The destroyer was on a mission related to US counterdrug activities off the Pacific coast of South America.

The ship's Facebook page also featured hundreds of comments of support and concern by the family and friends of the crew. "I am a very proud navy mother and my daughter is a proud USS KIDD sailor who has been stricken with the virus!!!" wrote a woman. "May you all keep her in your prayers as we have all Kidd sailors in ours!!!!" Navy officials said Friday [24 Apr 2020] that the 1st patient was "already improving" and that the Kidd would rendezvous with a Navy vessel with a fleet surgical team, intensive-care capacity, and ventilators in case additional support is required at sea.

The outbreak adds to the challenges for the Navy, which has the largest number of positive cases of all service branches, with some 1500 as of Friday [24 Apr 2020], according to media reports. On Thursday [23 Apr 2020], The Hill reported that at least 26 other vessels have reported coronavirus infections, but all those ships are docked in port. The outbreak aboard the Kidd comes just weeks after questions were raised over the Navy's handling of the outbreak aboard the Roosevelt, whose captain was relieved of command after complaining of a lack of support from the Navy as the outbreak spread.

Asked whether the Pentagon fears that the Kidd may become another Roosevelt crisis, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said the Navy acted quickly once learning of the 1st symptomatic sailor aboard the Kidd, according to The Associated Press. "The Navy has lessons learned from prior experience with a COVID crisis, and they have been quickly applying those to this case," Hoffman said. "Fingers crossed, the Navy is doing everything they can right now, and we're going to hope for the best outcome, but they are going to take all of the prudent steps that they possibly can."

On [17 Mar 2020], Noland, the Kidd's executive officer, wrote in a Facebook post that the ship had "no suspected cases on board," and was "taking all the precautions to keep crew health and safety at the forefront, in case we do have any shipmates that begin manifesting symptoms of the virus." As elsewhere, those precautions would become more intensive. Photos posted on the Facebook page as recently as [3 Apr 2020] appeared to show sailors not wearing masks or practicing social distancing. By [6 Apr 2020], however, posted photographs from the ship showed the crew wearing masks and practicing social distancing.

The Navy did not give a timetable for the Kidd's return to the Everett Homeport. But Navy officials said the crew would continue to clean and disinfect the ship, "in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Navy-specific guidelines. Onboard test results will inform operational decisions."

On Saturday [25 Apr 2020], Noland published a Facebook post that characterized the outbreak in terms of battle. "I am an optimist, but make no mistake. KIDD is in a fight right now, against COVID and against anyone out there who might want to capitalize on what they perceive as a weakness," Noland stated. "I am seeing hundreds of young American sailors come together to fight for each other, and to do what they swore to do when they took an oath to protect our republic." That fighting spirit was in evidence among the crew's family and friends. "This ship survived Hurricane Katrina," Chad Lozier wrote on the Facebook page. "It's going to survive this too."

[4] Australia tracking app

https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-australia/australia-launches-controversial-covid-19-tracking-app-as-some-states-start-easing-rules-idUSL5N2CE022


The Australian government launched a controversial coronavirus tracing app on Sunday [26 Apr 2020] and promised to legislate privacy protections around it as authorities try to get the country and the economy back onto more normal footing. Australia and neighbouring New Zealand have both managed to get their coronavirus outbreaks under control before it strained public health systems, but officials in both countries continue to worry about the risk of another flareup. "We are winning, but we have not yet won," Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt said at a televised briefing announcing the app's launch.

The app, which is based on Singapore's TraceTogether software, uses Bluetooth signals to log when people have been close to one another. It has been criticised by civil liberties groups as an invasion of privacy. The Australian government, which wants at least 40% of the population to sign up to make the effort effective, said the voluntary app, which would not track location, is safe.

The app's stored contact data will enable health officials to trace people potentially exposed to infections. "It will help us as we seek to return to normal and the Australian way of life," Hunt said. "No one has access to that, not even yourself ... only a state public health official can be given access to that data." A legislative directive ensuring that will be proposed to the parliament in May [2020], the health ministry said on the app's website on Sunday [26 Apr 2020].

A few countries, including South Korea and Israel, are using high-tech methods of contact tracing which involves tracking peoples' locations via phone networks, though such centralized, surveillance-based approaches are viewed as invasive and unacceptable in many countries. Trust in governments in Australia and New Zealand has risen since the start of the pandemic, opinion polls show, with leaders of both countries -- ideologically opposite -- hailed for their management in suppressing the coronavirus.

The rate of increase in new cases has been below 1% for 2 weeks now in both countries -- much lower than in many other countries. On Sunday [26 Apr 2020], Australia's states of Queensland and Western Australia said they would slightly ease social distancing rules this week to allow for larger outdoor public gatherings, among others, but officials in Victoria, 2nd most populous state, said they were not ready to relax the state's hardline restrictions.

Australia reported 16 new coronavirus cases on Sunday [26 Apr 2020], which took its total to 6703, according to health ministry data. There have been 83 deaths. In New Zealand, there were 4 new confirmed cases, bringing the total to 1121. 18 people have died, health ministry data showed.

On Monday [27 Apr 2020], New Zealand will start to ease some of the world's strictest lockdown measures and is also set to roll out a tracing app soon, but Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has warned this is not the only panacea. "We have been very clear on from the beginning that no tracking app provides a silver bullet," Ardern said earlier this month [April 2020].

[A tracking app was helpful in South Korea, but the final push to interrupt transmission was the implementation of more strict social distancing, something Australia and New Zealand have been doing from early on. It will be interesting to see if it helps mitigate the relaxation of the lockdown rules. - Mod.MPP

Highlights
----------
- Public health systems are coming under severe strain as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Countries must also continue to focus on other health emergencies and make progress against diseases such as malaria or poliomyelitis (polio). A new analysis of malaria supports the call to minimize disruptions to malaria prevention and treatment services during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information is available in the statement from the WHO Regional Office for Africa (https://www.afro.who.int/news/who-urges-countries-not-let-covid-19-eclipse-other-health-issues), the statement from the WHO Regional Office for the Americas (https://www.paho.org/en/news/24-4-2020-paho-underlines-importance-sustained-malaria-efforts-and-protection-health-workers) and in details on the analysis (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-04-2020-who-urges-countries-to-move-quickly-to-save-lives-from-malaria-in-sub-saharan-africa).

- The WHO Regional Office for the Americas urges countries to strengthen vaccination against seasonal influenza and measles to prevent respiratory illness and vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information is available at https://www.paho.org/en/news/24-4-2020-paho-urges-countries-maintain-vaccination-during-covid-19-pandemic.

- The core protocol for therapeutics against COVID-19 has been published by the WHO R&D Blueprint Working Group. More information is available at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/who-working-group-core-protocol-for-therapeutics-against-covid19.

- The WHO Regional Director for Europe has emphasized the need to build sustainable people-centred long-term care in the wake of COVID-19.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is stable at 212. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
The Americas region reported 47 338 new cases (55.8 % of the global newly reported cases) and 2960 deaths (49.3% of the global newly reported deaths). Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 81.4% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 7.4% and Canada at 3.4%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 39.7% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 18.3%, Mexico at 14%, and Peru at 8.3%. Note that Ecuador did not report any cases, probably related to weekend reporting.

The European region reported 27 185 new cases (32.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 2756 deaths (45.9% of the global newly reported deaths). Russia reported 22% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 18.1%, Turkey 10.5%, and Italy 8.7%. Note that Spain did not report any newly confirmed cases, probably a function of weekend reporting.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5615 new cases (6.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 137 deaths (2.3% of the global newly reported deaths). Saudi Arabia reported 1197 new cases representing 21.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran at 20.2%, Pakistan at 14%, Qatar 14.8%, and the United Arab Emirates at 9.5%. This is the 2nd consecutive day that Saudi Arabia surpassed Iran.

The African region reported 819 new cases (0.97% of the global newly reported cases) and 27 deaths (0.45% of the global newly reported deaths). There were 22 countries reporting no cases in this 24-hour period. That being said, South Africa reported 17.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria at 15.8%, Cameroon at 14.0%, Nigeria at 10.6%, and Senegal at 8.4%. Note that Ghana did not report any cases, probably related to weekend reporting.

The Western Pacific region reported 1170 new cases (1.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 37 deaths (0.62% of the global newly reported deaths). Singapore reported 52.8% of the newly reported cases, followed by Japan at 30.2%, and the Philippines at 8.7%. Given the high proportion of cases reported by Singapore, removing Singapore from the denominator, Japan represents 64% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by the Philippines at 18.5% and Malaysia at 9.2%.

The South East Asia region reported 2773 new cases (3.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 89 deaths (1.5% of the global newly reported deaths). India reported 71.8% of newly reported cases, followed by Indonesia at 14.3% and Bangladesh at 11.1%. Removing India from the denominator, Indonesia represents 50.6% of the newly reported cases, Bangladesh represents 39.5%, Sri Lanka 5.1%, and the Maldives 2.7%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region through (26 Apr 2020) at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend; the European region appears to have its cyclical weekend drop. The America's region does not appear to have decreased even though there were 29 countries reporting no new cases in the past 24 hours. One sees a gradual increase in the number of cases from the Africa Region.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
