The Sri Lankan government has confirmed that the viral fever
spreading rapidly amongst people in Jaffna is the mosquito-borne
chikungunya fever. It is suspected that more than 5000 people have
been infected with the virus, now at epidemic levels.
Sri Lankan Health authorities have called on the public to clean up
areas where mosquitoes breed in an effort to prevent the spread of
the disease.
The symptoms of the disease -- high fever, joint and muscular pain,
severe headaches, body aches and rash -- are similar to those caused
by dengue fever, another mosquito-borne illness.
The disease has now spread rapidly in Kalmunai, Mannar, Batticaloa,
Puttalam and parts of Colombo.
The closure of the main highway to the northern peninsula because of
heavy fighting in August 2006 has resulted in a shortage of food and
medical supplies in the north, and Dr. Nihal Abeysinghe, director of
the state Epidemiology Department, said pockets of the fever had now
also been detected in Sri Lanka's northwest, south and east.
The outbreak has coincided with an outbreak of dengue fever cases, as
monsoon rains create breeding conditions for the mosquitoes that
carry the diseases, and health workers are struggling to cope.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that
while the disease is painful, no deaths from chikungunya have been
documented in the scientific literature. [True, but there is a recent
evaluation by French epidemiologists that points strongly to
fatalities due to chikungunya virus infections [see archive number
20061014.2953]. Several deaths in the current Indian Ocean outbreak
have been attributed to chikungunya virus infections. - Mod.TY]
