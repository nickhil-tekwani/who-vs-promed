The federal government of Nigeria through its health ministry has announced that the issuance of a new yellow fever [YF] card has commenced, and the replacement would take full effect on 1 Oct 2013.

The Minister of Health, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, who made this known at an event in Abuja, disclosed that the new yellow card, also known as international certificate of vaccination and prophylaxis, will have advanced features.

It should be recalled that there was a diplomatic face-off between Nigeria and South Africa over 18 months ago which led to the deportation of over 125 Nigerians.

The health minister advised that international travellers need not risk their trips with fake yellow fever vaccination cards, as genuine cards used to certify vaccinations against yellow fever, cholera, and smallpox can easily be obtained at the public health department of the federal ministry of health and the nation's airports, seaports, and land borders.

[It is good to learn that the Ministry of Health is dealing with the sale of fake YF vaccination cards, which has been a problem this year (2013). Vaccination and the issuance of legitimate cards is important not only for international travelers but also for preventing cases within Nigeria.

The occurrence of YF cases in Nigeria this year [2013] is confusing. The number of suspected YF cumulative cases for 2013 as of 8 Feb 2013 was 38 cases. Curiously, Nigeria Weekly Epidemiology Report Vol. 3 no. 25 issued on 28 Jun 2013 (http://www.health.gov.ng/images/OtherWeeklyDoc/WeeklyEpidemiologyReport_Week_25_.pdf) makes no mention of YF cases. However, the report for week 30 (no URL available) indicates:

Suspected new cases: 7
Laboratory confirmed cases: 0
Discarded cases: 64
Pending laboratory results: 110
Deaths: 0

It is not clear why the large numbers of pending cases are not confirmed. It would be unusual indeed if these suspected cases are, in fact, YF virus infection with no resulting fatalities. No reports of YF cases in Nigeria have been reported to WHO this year [2013], as is required by international agreement. Surrounding countries certainly need to know whether YF cases are occurring in Nigeria, with details on time and place of occurrence. ProMED would appreciate receiving clarification of the current YF situation in Nigeria.

Travelers should be aware that an international yellow fever certificate only becomes valid 10 days after vaccination, so getting the vaccination at the airport on the day of travel is too late to permit entry to a country that demands evidence of YF vaccination. Be sure to get vaccinated well in advance.

The figures above are cumulative since January 2013. Since the clinical picture of these cases resembled that of yellow fever, it would be important to discover by testing patient specimens what other viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) is occurring, and what the final diagnosis of the YF negative cases was. It could be Lassa or another VHF.
