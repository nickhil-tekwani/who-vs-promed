An outbreak of bubonic plague killed 3 out of 9 people infected with the
disease in the north western Ugandan districts of Arua and Nebbi, the Daily
Monitor has reported.

Of those infected, 2 of them in Arua and 3 in Nebbi, are in critical
condition in hospital, the Kampala-based newspaper reported, without saying
when the outbreak started.

Bubonic plague is transmitted to humans through contact with rats infested
with fleas. The disease, common in north western Uganda and neighboring
Democratic Republic of Congo, causes fever, headaches, and fatigue, the
newspaper said.

[Fatalities in plague, infections due to _Yersinia pestis_ are often due to
spread of the organism outside of the painful bubo into the bloodstream
causing septicemic plague and/or spread to the lung causing pneumonic
disease. It is this latter form that facilitates person-to-person spread
via the respiratory route.

Arua and Nebbi are endemic for plague and are located in north western
Uganda as can be seen on a map at
