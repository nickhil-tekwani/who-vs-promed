42 locations in 14 counties are under quarantine after horses, mules, and cattle herds tested positive for Vesicular Stomatitis (VS), the Colorado Department of Agriculture announced Thursday.

VS is a viral disease that typically affects livestock. The agriculture department says it's rare for people to contract the disease, but not unheard of. The disease is usually not fatal, but can cause lesions, lameness and severe weight loss. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says VS is recognized around the world as a disease with serious economic and regulatory repercussions.

"The prolonged warm temperatures in this season have been favorable for Vesicular Stomatitis transmission. It is important for livestock owners to continue with fly control until we have a hard freeze, as flies are the main means of transfer of VS," State Veterinarian Dr. Keith Roehr said in a statement released Thursday.

"In the last 2 weeks," Roehr went on, "we had new VS cases diagnosed in Fremont, Garfield, Logan, Moffat and Morgan counties. Other counties that had a significant number of cases have seen their number of current cases subside (Montrose and Delta counties), and yet we have seen a significant increase of new cases in Mesa County."

The state agriculture department says VS is not very contagious between animals; it's usually spread through flies.

"The key to remember is to take steps to reduce the fly populations near livestock," Roehr said.

[Colorado and Wyoming have been hit pretty hard this year with this disease. Since this is an insect-transmitted disease, the states are surely hoping for a killing frost soon to eliminate the insects and decrease the spread of this virus.

Owners should remember:
- Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease.
- Avoid transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools, or health care equipment from other herds.

How vesicular stomatitis spreads is not fully known; insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and movement of animals are all factors. Once the disease is introduced into a herd, it may move from animal to animal by contact or exposure to saliva or fluid from ruptured vesicles. Humans rarely contract vesicular stomatitis, but they can become infected.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. Vesicular stomatitis has been confirmed only in the western hemisphere. It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, but outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically.
