Fresh blow for farming industry with outbreak of brucellosis
--------------------------------------------------
The farming industry faced another major problem yesterday after bovine
brucellosis was confirmed in a Scottish herd for the first time in 30 years.
Brucellosis, a highly contagious bacterial disease which can be transferred
to humans, was discovered in 2 imported cattle from the Republic of Ireland
at a farm in Forfar. If unchecked, the infection can cut a herd's
productivity, causing heifers to abort and trigger undulant fever, a
chronic debilitating disease in humans.
The British mainland was believed to have eradicated the disease, with the
last case in Scotland reported in the 1970s.
The disease at Forfar was identified following the abortion of a cattle
foetus. The animals had been under restriction since 11 Feb 2003, and
surveillance and testing will continue to ensure that the outbreak has been
eradicated.
The farm at the centre of the scare is a mixed beef and sheep enterprise
which does not sell milk. Any risk to humans is through direct contact with
the aborted animal.
Farmers were advised to exercise great care in planning the purchase of
livestock when re-stocking herds and were reminded by the Scottish
Executive that by law, they must report all bovine abortions and premature
calvings to the local Animal Health Office.
A statement said: "Contact with infected discharges provides the route of
infection through beef cattle. The only humans at possible risk are those
in direct contact with livestock who are well aware of the known
occupational hazards. Symptoms can include recurrent or chronic fever.
There is no risk from pasteurised milk, cooked meat, or contact with
pasteurised animal products. The local public health department has been
informed."
In England, the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs,
said last night that 3 other animals at a farm near Middlesbrough were to
be culled because they came from a Northern Irish herd which had been shown
to have brucellosis.
The announcement by Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary officer, will
concern farmers still struggling to recover from the outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease and BSE.

[Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less
frequently by _B. melitensis_, and rarely by _B. suis_. It is manifested by
abortion, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in
milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of Brucella from abortion
material, udder secretions, or tissues removed at post-mortem.
Alternatively, specific cell-mediated or serological responses to Brucella
antigens can be demonstrated. All Brucella species are pathogenic for humans.
The only organism involved in outbreaks of Bovine Brucellosis in Northern
Europe is _B. abortus_; Southern European countries are affected by _B.
melitensis_ as well. The last outbreak of Bovine Brucellosis was recorded
in the UK in 1993. In 1997, 13 cattle were compulsorily slaughtered as
reactors to serological tests, and a further 3 animals as contacts -- but
no infection with _Brucella sp._ was detected in laboratory investigations
in any of these cattle.
The Republic of Ireland has a high incidence of bovine Brucellosis, though
some decrease has been observed in recent years. During the 4 years
1998-2001, the number of outbreaks there was 1081, 875, 659, and 553,
respectively. As reported to the OIE, 24 233 head were compulsorily
slaughtered in infected farms during 2001.

It remains to note the exact origin of the animals imported to Scotland
from Ireland and which -- if any -- certification accompanied them.
According to the provisions of OIE's International Animal Health Code, a
country may be regarded as free of Bovine Brucellosis if its entire cattle
population is under official veterinary control, it has been ascertained
that the rate of brucellosis infection does not exceed 0.2 percent of the
cattle herds, vaccination is not allowed, and prescribed surveillance is
operational. The current reported outbreak does not change UK's status as a
Brucellosis-free country, hopefully to remain so thanks to the adopted
control and eradication steps.
Vaccination of cattle against _B. abortus_ is prohibited in all EU member
countries.
Data on the infectivity of _B. abortus_ in animal products have been
