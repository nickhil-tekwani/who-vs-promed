Update on Rift Valley Fever Outbreak in Saudi Arabia
----------------------------------------------------
RIYADH: Rift Valley fever (RVF) has killed 124 people in Saudi Arabia since
Sep 2000, the official Saudi news agency reported on Mon 15 May 2001. A
Health Ministry report said 760 of the 884 people who have been infected
with the mosquito-borne virus have recovered. Most of the deaths occurred
late last year, the Saudi Press Agency said.
Experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are
working with Saudi officials to bring the virus under control. The virus is
transmitted from livestock to humans by mosquitoes and causes diarrhea,
nausea, and internal bleeding that can result in death. It can be treated
with ribavirin.

[The preceding report on RVF in late March had a total of 822 cases
reported since the onset of the outbreak. This current report has an
increase to 884 cases but no additional deaths. This suggests that the
outbreak is still ongoing, but that there have been improvements in case
management resulting in the reduction in mortality. - Mod.MPP
[The outbreak of RVF in the Arabian Peninsula began in Yemen and spread to
Saudi Arabia. There have been no direct reports from Yemen since 1 Dec 2000
(see; Rift Valley fever - Yemen (06) 20001203.2106). Further information
on the course of the outbreak in Yemen would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
