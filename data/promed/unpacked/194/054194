Botulism case linked to heroin
------------------------------
A 43 year old Yakima woman has been diagnosed with botulism, the 2nd case
of the muscle-paralyzing disease in about a month in Yakima County. Both
cases have been linked to the use of black-tar heroin, prompting health
officials to warn drug users that the sometimes fatal disease could
threaten others.
"With 2 cases in about a month's period of time, it certainly suggests the
possibility of a contaminated supply of black tar," said Marianne Patnode,
Communicable Disease Services coordinator at the Yakima Health District.
Patnode said the health district has also notified local health care
providers of the case. CDC rushed antitoxin over the weekend to treat the
woman, who was hospitalized in Yakima.
A Yakima County man was also diagnosed with botulism on 21 Feb 2006. He
stayed in a hospital outside of the county for about a week and was still
not speaking or walking normally when he left, Patnode said.
Although neither case has been confirmed in a laboratory, Patnode said both
patients showed symptoms consistent with wound botulism and have said they
believe they contracted the disease from black-tar heroin.
Heroin-related cases are classified as wound botulism. Materials that can
contain botulism spores are often used to prepare black-tar heroin for
injection. If the [spores germinate and] toxins are released, botulism can
occur. The disease cannot be passed from person to person.
The only other cluster of botulism cases reported to the health district
was in August 2003. All 4 of the cases were eventually connected to a bad
batch of black-tar heroin.

[Black tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound
botulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a gummy
black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly in Mexico,
adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally injected subcutaneously
in a process referred to as skin popping. The local area may be
unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess-forming.
The tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents ("cutting"
agents) which have been postulated to be the source of the _Clostridium
botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the development of wound
botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin, cleaning the injection
paraphernalia or sharing needles.
Debridement of necrotic areas or drainage of abscesses are required if such
lesions are present. Respiratory support and antitoxin remain the mainstays
of treatment.
Yakima County, Washington, as noted, was the location for a previous
cluster of cases (2).
