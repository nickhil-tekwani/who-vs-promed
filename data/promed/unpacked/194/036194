As of Mon 21 Aug, 5 people have died from rabies in Beijing in 2006, with
close to 70 000 people in the capital reporting being bitten by dogs in the
first half of this year, said local health authorities.
Only one of the 5 people who died in Beijing contracted rabies in the city.
The 4 others came down with the disease in other parts of the country and
were rushed to the capital for treatment.
