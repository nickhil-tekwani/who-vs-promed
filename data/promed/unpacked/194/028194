An outbreak of ovine Johne's disease [OJD] has been reported on the
Fleurieu Peninsula -- the 1st known case of the disease in the
region. [The Fleurieu Peninsula is just south of the City of Adelaide
in South Australia;

PIRSA [Department of Primary Industries and Resources of South
Australia] investigations found that the sheep were originally
purchased interstate from an area where the disease prevalence had
increased significantly in recent years. PIRSA biosecurity chief
veterinary officer Rob Rahaley said OJD was confirmed after sheep
were tested.

"The property manager contacted PIRSA after the sheep were found to
be not putting on condition," Dr Rahaley said. "After discussion, it
was agreed to send the sheep to an abattoir for processing and
inspection. Samples from these sheep were sent to VETLAB where OJD
was confirmed."

Dr Rahaley said tests were being run on sheep on neighbouring
properties and a subsidised vaccine would be offered under the State
OJD control program.

Further checks found no sheep from the affected property had been
sold to any other SA properties.

[Ovine Johne's disease is not new in Australia, but this does seem to
represent an expansion of the disease into an area not previously
reporting this disease.

Ovine Johne's Disease (OJD) is a chronic, incurable bacterial disease
of sheep. Infected sheep gradually lose weight and die. Since it was
first found in Australia in 1980, OJD has proven to be a costly
disease. It spreads slowly, is difficult to detect early on, causes
production losses, and can kill about 10 percent of adult sheep each
year if left unmanaged.

OJD is a wasting disease caused by the sheep strain of the bacterium,
_Mycobacterium paratuberculosis_, which grows mainly in the small
intestine. The intestine wall slowly thickens and the animal has
increasing trouble absorbing nutrition from its food. Infected
animals slowly lose condition and usually die within 3 to 6 months of
showing signs. Scouring (diarrhea) may occur, but is not seen
routinely. Merinos are more susceptible than crossbreds and British
breed sheep. Goats, deer, and other species can be infected to
varying degrees. There is no cure for OJD.

Gudair(R) vaccine is the only vaccine registered in Australia for the
control of ovine Johne's Disease (OJD) in sheep. Gudair(R) vaccine is
also registered for use in goats.

Ongoing trial work has shown that the vaccine reduces the level of
clinical disease and mortalities, and delays and reduces the shedding
of OJD bacteria in faeces. Used over several years, it will help
reduce the potential for further spread from contaminated pastures.

The vaccine is inactivated (killed), meaning that it will not
introduce OJD into a sheep flock.

It is most effective if administered to sheep before being exposed to
the disease. Although sheep of any age can be vaccinated, the risk of
OJD is considered to be very low for sheep classified as 'approved
vaccinates.'

This is a case of protecting your property and your flock by
purchasing only from flocks known to be OJD free.
