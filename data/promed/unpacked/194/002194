[This summary is a poignant reminder that disease can impact our cattle from unsuspected sources. The entire article is worth reading, but a synopsis is provided here. While this is directed toward Texas, it is applicable to any location. The original article is by Dr. Steve Wikse, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University. - Mod.TG]

We have had weather conditions over the past several weeks that increase the chances of several cattle diseases. After about 4 months of essentially no rain in College Station [in central Texas], I recorded 5 inches of rain from 2 storms in late September 2013. Then, my rain gauge showed 5.3 inches of rain over a 24-hour period from 12-13 Oct 2013. That was a real gully washer.

Drought followed by heavy rainfall can lead to outbreaks of many different types of diseases in cattle. Infections by spore-forming bacteria commonly occur. These weather conditions also can result in losses from diseases such as polioencephalomalacia or pulmonary emphysema, which are caused by a sudden change from a low-quality to high-quality diet.

In addition, continual wet conditions can support severe parasite problems, especially lungworms. Outbreaks of leptospirosis occur with excessive rainfall.

Moist pasture conditions also can result in Dallis grass staggers, which occurs when seedheads of Dallis grass are infected with the fungus _Claviceps paspali_.

There are 3 important diseases caused by spore-forming bacteria: anthrax, blackleg, and redwater. These bacteria develop tough spores resistant to heat and drying that live in soil for decades. Ranches contaminated with the spores are under constant low-level threat of disease outbreaks, but the threat peaks following rains. Heavy rainfall results in separation of particles in saturated soil. The very buoyant bacterial spores float up between soil particles to become concentrated on the surface of the soil. The main way cattle become exposed to these diseases is by ingesting spores in water or in soil attached to grass.

Anthrax is prevented by routine immunization once a year with the Stern avirulent spore vaccine. The risk of an anthrax outbreak on most ranches in the Brazos Valley is not high enough to warrant routine vaccination, however.

Cattle grazing pastures where anthrax has been diagnosed in the past should definitely be vaccinated. It's a good idea to begin clostridial vaccinations in calves at 1st working. The 8-way clostridial vaccine protects against redwater and can be used instead of the commonly used 7-way or 4-way clostridial vaccines, which do not protect against redwater. It's a good idea to use the 7-way or 8-way clostridial vaccines because they include protection against additional fatal but lower risk clostridial diseases such as black disease (_Clostridium novyi_). Control of liver flukes must be added to vaccination to prevent redwater.

Vaccination of all ages of cattle against clostridial diseases this fall [2013] and administration of boosters at spring working are highly recommended. Include treatment for liver flukes this fall if they are a problem on your ranch. With these diseases, an ounce of prevention is worth way more than a pound of cure, because there is no cure.
