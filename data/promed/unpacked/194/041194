The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) has, in the outbreak investigation of the _Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV), found 7 companies affected by the quarantine disease. These are added to the 11 companies that had already been discovered. The investigation has been completed, Rob Hageman, NVWA, reports, "But we continue to carefully monitor the situation."

During this outbreak investigation, which started at the end of February [2018] and ended in April [2018], the authority examined about 40 tomato companies in Westland [province of South Holland] and another 40 in the rest of the Netherlands. In two-thirds of the cases, it concerned companies with lighted cultivation.

[_Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV; genus _Crinivirus_) has been reported from Europe and a number of locations in other parts of the world. Besides tomato, it can also affect capsicum and some solanaceous weeds which may serve as pathogen reservoirs, as well as some ornamental and weed species in other families. Symptoms on tomato leaves may include irregular chlorotic mottle, interveinal yellowing, necrotic flecks and possible distortions. No obvious symptoms develop on fruit and flowers, but fruit size and numbers are reduced due to a loss of photosynthetic area. Significant yield losses occur as a result, but symptom severity varies with host cultivars. Symptoms may be confused with nutritional problems and are also similar to those of the related _Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV) of the same genus. Both ToCV and TICV are included on the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

ToCV is transmitted by a number of whitefly vectors, including _Bemisia tabaci_, and outbreaks are usually associated with high vector populations. Whiteflies are a serious pest in themselves and have also been reported to transmit over 100 virus species. Multiple infections with viruses sharing these vectors (for example, coinfection of ToCV and TICV, see ProMED-mail post 20140808.2671012) are not unusual and may result in symbiotic enhancement of symptoms (synergism) of the co-infecting viruses.

Control of whitefly transmitted viruses is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management of these viruses is difficult and includes vector control, removal of reservoirs of both virus and vectors, use of crop varieties with increased pathogen tolerance and clean planting material.
