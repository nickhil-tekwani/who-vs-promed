The lethal strain of H5N1 bird flu found in Nigeria this month probably got
there in poultry and not through the movement of wild birds, according to
migratory-bird experts and several lines of circumstantial evidence.
The first Nigerian cases were found at a commercial farm with 46 000 chickens,
not among backyard flocks that would have greater contact with wild birds.
Nigeria imports more than a million chicks a year from countries that include
Turkey, where H5N1 appeared during the fall of 2005, and China, where it has
circulated for a decade. Furthermore, the infected flocks in 2 of Nigeria's
northern states are not near wetlands where migratory birds spend the winter.
There are no reports of waterfowl die-offs like those in Asia and Eastern
Europe. The few wild species known to occasionally harbor H5N1 arrived months
ago and are about to leave.
If it turns out that trade, not nature, was responsible for introducing H5N1
to Africa, better control of trade in domesticated birds may be able to limit
the virus's spread there and on other continents, public health experts
said. "If you put all the possible factors in perspective, we wouldn't jump to
the conclusion as others do that it was wild birds that brought it," said Ward
Hagemeijer, an ornithologist at Wetlands International, a Dutch conservation
organization.
William B. Karesh, a veterinarian with the Wildlife Conservation Society in
New York, said: "I would never rule out wild birds. But I think we have to
look at the most probable routes, and the most probable route would be
poultry. How did it skip the whole Nile Delta and get to Nigeria? That kind of
bothers me. Common sense would dictate that it should be all over Egypt by
now."
The spread of H5N1 by wild birds "is a horrible assumption that a lot of
people are making," agreed Peter Marra, an ecologist with the Smithsonian
Institution's Migratory Bird Center at the National Zoo. "There is no question
that migratory birds are playing a role, but they are not the main players."
Marra said more attention should be given to the legal -- and illegal --
movement of poultry and pet-trade birds because "that is where you can
actually do something about it."
Some of this reasoning appears to have support in Nigeria, as well. The
Guardian, a daily newspaper published in Lagos, recently quoted the country's
agriculture minister, Adamu Bello, as saying, "We think someone may have
imported or smuggled in contaminated birds."
Epidemiological teams of local and foreign scientists are investigating the
outbreak of H5N1 in Nigerian poultry and sampling wild birds for the virus.
About 60 percent of the country's poultry production is in backyard flocks, 25
percent in large commercial farms, and the rest in mixed operations. About 80
000 birds died at a large farm in the northern state of Kano in early January
2006. At the time, the deaths were attributed to Newcastle disease and cold
cholera, but may have been caused by H5N1 influenza. The first confirmed cases
were in Kaduna state, about 100 miles to the south.
In 2002, Nigeria imported 1.2 million chickens, according to statistics on the
U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Web site <http://www.fao.org/>.
Nearly all the birds were day-old chicks.
China, Nigeria and the FAO signed a $22.7 million agreement in March 2003 to
have 520 Chinese agriculture experts, including poultry technicians, help
Nigerian farmers. Nigeria also imported live birds from China until January
2004, when the trade was banned because of bird flu outbreaks in Asia. Despite
the import ban, numerous reports say chickens continue to come in from China.
At a news conference last week, Bello said that "birds come every day from
China, Turkey . . . so Nigeria is exposed," according to a newspaper report.
In a study published this month in the journal Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, an international team led by 2 Chinese researchers
reported that a survey of more than 50 000 birds in live-poultry markets there
found 1 percent were infected with H5N1 virus. The researchers also sampled
about 13 000 migratory birds and found that 6 were carrying H5N1 and did not
appear to be ill -- evidence that healthy migrants may be able to carry the
microbe long distances. The genetic diversity in the virus samples from
domestic chickens led the researchers to deduce that "H5N1 virus is
perpetuated in poultry largely through the movement of poultry and poultry
products, rather than by . . . migrating birds."
Although no H5N1 has been found in wild birds in West Africa, elsewhere the
virus has been found in 3 duck species that spend winter in Africa. They are
the garganey, the northern pintail and the northern shoveller -- about 3.5
million birds in all -- said Alex Kaat of Wetlands International. None of the
wintering places are close to the chicken outbreaks, however, Kaat said.

The recent outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in Nigeria shows that poultry
movements can cause the virus to jump across countries and even continents.
With poor enforcement of controls already blamed for outbreaks in China,
Southeast Asia and Turkey, the Nigerian outbreak further demonstrates that
lapses in biosecurity are the major reason for avian influenza's continuing
spread around the world.
Whilst the precise nature of the outbreak is unknown, it seems more than
likely that the virus arrived through infected poultry brought into the
country in defiance of Nigeria's import controls. Speaking at a press
conference, Nigeria's Agriculture Minister, Adamu Bello, said, "Birds come
every day from China, Turkey, into Nigeria, and from Europe and also from
Latin America. So Nigeria is exposed. Illegal importation of poultry by people
who have farms, bringing in poultry from places and smuggling them in... could
also have been a cause."
Mr Bello was also reported by Nigeria's Guardian newspaper group as
saying: "We think someone may have imported or smuggled in contaminated birds."
Large-scale commercial poultry farms need a regular supply of day-old chicks,
and this has created a global trade in supplying the industry in countries
such as Nigeria, which are unable to undertake all the stages of commercial
production. Contesting the ban on imports of day-old stock earlier in 2005, a
poultry industry spokesman said, "Nigeria does not possess the temperature,
weather conditions and much-needed technology to produce Grand Parent stock
[day-old chickens] now, which is the [backbone] of the poultry business."
"Globalisation has turned the chicken into the world's number one migratory
bird species," said Leon Bennun, Director of Science of BirdLife
International. "Movements of chickens around the world take place 365 days a
year, unlike the seasonal migrations of wild birds. It is important that
strict biosecurity measures are imposed to stop further spread not only within
Nigeria but also to neighbouring countries."
It is extraordinary, given the strong circumstantial evidence implicating
illegal poultry movements, and the repeated opinion of Agriculture Minister
Bello, that some representatives of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
have announced that wild migratory birds are the source of the outbreak. One
senior FAO representative has even been quoted in the press as saying: "If
it's not wild birds, it will be difficult to understand. There is no real
trade between the Middle East and Asia and Nigeria."
Yet according to the websites of China's embassy in Nigeria and their Ministry
of Commerce, "The trade volume between the 2 countries in 2003 reached US
$1.86 billion," and has continued to grow so that "Nigeria is now China's 2nd
largest export market and 4th largest trade partner in Africa".
Nigeria is a major oil-producing nation, and with around 25 percent of the
population of Africa within its borders to provide a market for imports, it is
increasingly being sought out as a trading partner. The largest-scale
industrial poultry production in Africa is concentrated within Nigeria's
northern states. If the global trade in poultry is spreading avian influenza,
it was predictable that it would hit Nigeria before other African countries.
"Perhaps the time has come for an independent inquiry into the spread of H5N1
over the past few years," says Bennun. "This could help the world to learn
lessons on what could have been done differently to halt the spread of the
disease and help to stop further outbreaks."

["Globalisation has turned the chicken into the world's number one migratory

While the overt and covert movements of commercial poultry clearly carry
risks, we should not forget the animal gladiatorial activities. The latter was
the background to the Newcastle disease epidemics in the Southwestern USA in
2002-2003. There is no reason that these [fighting] birds should not carry
H5N1 virus as they travel. Read on ... - Mod.MHJ]

Dogs and cockerels are being brought to Bahrain from Southeast Asia to take
part in illegal fights, animal rights activists told the GDN. Bahrain Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA) president Dr Khalil Rajab
said most dogfights and cockfights take place in Muharraq, Riffa or Manama.
Dr Rajab said smuggled animals are thought to be coming across the King Fahad
Causeway from Saudi Arabia or slipped past customs officers at Bahrain
International Airport. "Despite the fact that there are government
restrictions on the importing of wild animals, we see them around --
particularly birds, African monkeys and wild dogs."
One of the reasons they are thought to come from Southeast Asia is a perceived
lack of regulations and enforcement at the airports in that part of the world.
However, Dr Rajab added not all animals smuggled into Bahrain are brought here
to fight -- saying they are also brought here to be sold as pets. "The problem
we are also facing is the smuggling of wild animals into Bahrain for trade,"
he said. "The animal shops in Bahrain are not subject to any form of control
or hygiene standards."
The BSPCA is now calling for tougher legislation to help change attitudes
towards animal cruelty.
