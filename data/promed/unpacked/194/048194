The United States' CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Paratyphi B variant L(positive) tartrate(positive) infections. The investigation has not conclusively identified the source of this outbreak, but most ill people interviewed reported eating sushi made with raw tuna in the week before becoming ill. The investigation is ongoing and has not identified a common brand or supplier of raw tuna linked to illnesses.

This outbreak is caused by _S._ Paratyphi B variant L(positive) tartrate(positive) bacteria. The illness caused by this bacteria typically includes diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12-72 hours after being exposed. _S._ Paratyphi B variant L(positive) tartrate(positive) does not cause paratyphoid fever, enteric fever, or typhoid fever.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA "fingerprinting" is performed on salmonella bacteria isolated from ill people by using a technique called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE. PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. This PFGE pattern has never been seen before in the PulseNet database.

As of 21 May 2015, a total of 53 people infected with the outbreak strain have been reported from 9 states. Most of the ill people have been reported from the south western USA, or reported travel to this part of the country in the week before they became ill. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: Arizona (10), California (31), Illinois (1), Mississippi (1), New Mexico (6), South Dakota (1), Virginia (1), Washington (1), and Wisconsin (1).

Illness onset dates range from 5 Mar 2015 to 3 May 2015. Ill people range in age from younger than 1 to 83 with a median age of 31, and 47 per cent are female. Among 46 people with available information, 10 (22 per cent) have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
In interviews, ill people answered questions about foods eaten and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Interviews conducted to date suggest consumption of sushi made with raw tuna as a possible source of the infections. Of 37 ill people for whom information is known, 36 (97 per cent) reported consuming sushi in the week before they became ill. This proportion is significantly higher when compared with results from a survey of healthy people in which 5 per cent reported eating "sushi, sashimi, or ceviche made with raw fish or shellfish" in the 7 days before they were interviewed. Of the 36 people reporting eating sushi, 34 (94 per cent) reported eating a sushi item containing raw tuna, and 21 (81 per cent) of 26 with information reported eating a sushi item containing raw "spicy tuna".

Investigating clusters of illnesses can provide critical clues about the source of an outbreak. In this investigation, state and local officials have identified 5 clusters where ill people ate sushi at the same establishments. A cluster of illnesses is defined as more than one unrelated ill person (that is, they do not know or live with each other) who report eating at the same restaurant location, attending a common event, or shopping at the same location of a grocery store before becoming ill. If several unrelated ill people ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there. Also, records kept at these locations may make it easier to trace suspected food items to identify a common point of contamination. State and local officials, along with the FDA, are investigating these clusters to help identify a common brand or supplier of raw tuna possibly linked to this outbreak.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview them about foods they ate before they became ill. This investigation is evolving. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[The organism has been linked to human salmonellosis acquired from ornamental aquaria (Levings RS, Lightfoot D, Hall RM, et al. Aquariums as reservoirs for multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B. Emerg Infect Dis 2006; 12: 507-10
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no03/05-1085.htm).

Outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish for eating are uncommon and are more likely to be related to contamination of the fish after they are caught.

The yellowfin tuna (_Neothunnus macropterus_; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowfin_tuna) is a type of tuna eaten by humans as food. It has been reported to be up to 239 cm (94 inches) in length and 200kg (440 lb) in weight. The fish is also known as 'ahi' tuna, after the Hawaiian word for fire, due to the smoke from their fishing ropes rubbing violently on the gunwales of their wooden canoes while pulling the fish in.
