Leptospirosis is indeed a re-emerging disease of dogs in the United States.
It is important veterinarians be aware of the increased incidence and
various clinical syndromes caused by the various serovars of Leptospira.
However, the statements that dog to human transmission of leptospirosis is
rare should be qualified somewhat.
Before the widespread use of canine leptospiral vaccines in the United
States, dogs were a common source of exposure of humans to this agent. Dogs
infected with _Leptospira canicola_ remain a significant problem in many
parts of the world and have played a major epidemiological role in
outbreaks of human leptospirosis in Nicaragua and elsewhere.
Leptopspiral vaccines are still in wide use in dogs in the United States.
The vaccines provide reasonable levels of protection against the clinical
signs produced by leptospiral serovars _canicola_ and
_icterohaemorrhagiae_. However, the vaccines do not provide absolute
protection from infection and shedding of the organism.
There are reports in the literature of humans acquiring leptospirosis from
vaccinated dogs. Until recently, there have not been canine vaccines for
protection from serovars other than _canicola_ and _icterohaemorrhagiae_. A
new vaccine has been introduced which also contains serovars _pomona_ and
_grippotyphosa_. Vaccines are not yet available for protection of dogs from
serovar _bratislava_ infection.
The serovars most common in dogs in North America (i.e., _pomona_ and
_grippotyphosa_) are serovars prevalent in wildlife populations including
skunks, opossums, and raccoons. Rodents are not thought to be important
carriers of these serovars.

As regards the posting on leptospirosis in dogs in Massachusetts, I believe
it is very important to emphasize several points. First, as regards the
comment that "the disease can be transmitted from dogs to humans, but it is
a rare occurrence," it should be noted dogs are the most important source
of infection for people in the United States (see Mandel, Douglas and
Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Disease, 1995, p. 2137).
Secondly, regarding the comment that "there are vaccines for leptospirosis,
but their efficacy is debatable," it is important to distinguish protection
from clinical disease versus protection from infection.
The Leptospira bacterins available for animals can decrease the
occurrence/severity of clinical disease, but do not prevent infection and
subclinical shedding of the organism. Thus, people coming into contact with
canine urine (dog owners, veterinarians, laboratory staff, etc.) should
always handle it as if it contains _Leptospira_ organisms.
Finally, as to the moderator's comment "leptospirosis has not been
available in dog vaccines for a year or more," this is simply not true. A
variety of Leptospira-containing bacterins for dogs are readily available
commercially, including vaccines that contain not only the traditional _L.
icterohaemorrhagiae_ and _L.canicola_ strains, but also the _L. pomona_ and
_L.grippotyphosa_ strains have emerged recently as a cause of acute renal
disease in dogs, as well as in people.

[There is apparently some diversity within the vaccine suppliers. For over
a year, I have not been able to obtain vaccine with leptospirosis coverage.
Others have written to say they can. I have spoken to a sales
representative who indicated leptospirosis was removed because of
anaphylactic problems seen in some animals. Perhaps it is only the supplier
I use. Thanks to all wrote regarding the vaccine issue. - Mod.TG
