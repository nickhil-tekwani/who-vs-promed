[Visitors to Beijing City should be aware that rabies virus infection is still prevalent in the canine population of the city despite stringent controls. Anti-rabies prophylaxis should be sought after any encounter with an unvaccinated canine. Rabies virus can be transmitted from an infected animal via saliva as well as by bite.
