Low pathogenic influenza H3N1 in poultry, Belgium
-----------------------------------------------------
Timeline
- 1st case detected in January 2019
-- In the framework of the avian influenza surveillance programme
-- Flock of outdoor laying hens
-- LPAI H3N1, but brain was positive in PCR
-- Depopulation on initiative of the farmer
- 6 Apr 2019: the same farm is infected again
- Quick rise of the number of cases since last week of April [2019]

Current situation
- H3 influenza confirmed in 71 poultry farms by PCR, of which 6 confirmed as H3N1

Clinical symptoms
- Eggshell defects (discoloring)
- Depression
- Severe drop in egg production
- Severe drop in feed intake
- Increasing mortality (25%-30%), up to 60%
- Sometimes slowly spreading
- Sometimes no clinical symptoms at all
- Delayed restart of laying after recovery and low egg production

The virus
- Avian influenza virus H3N1
- IVPI 0.13: low pathogenic [according to OIE's Manual, a high pathogenic influenza A virus is "any influenza A virus that has an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) greater than 1.2".]
- Genetically related to a strain isolated from a wild bird in the Netherlands in 2017
- Adaptation to chickens
- Predilection for ovaries and oviduct

Epidemiological investigation
- Clustering of cases in the provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders
- No common link between the affected farms
- No common other pathogen that causes the disease (IB, E. coli, etc.)
- Farms with breeders, laying hens, broilers and meat turkeys -- 27 breeders, 30 laying hens, 7 turkeys, 6 broiler, 1 ostrich

Measures taken
- Not listed disease
- Previously no specific legislation in place
- Temporary legal measures applicable since 16 May 2019:
-- Reinforced passive surveillance
-- Cleaning and disinfection of all vehicles entering or leaving a poultry farm
-- 1-1 transport of poultry
-- Restricted access to poultry farms and hatcheries (personnel, farm veterinarian, authorities)
-- Disinfection of manure

Measures to be taken
Temporary legal measures applicable in very short term:
- Restricted access to egg storage room in poultry farms
- Pre-movement testing of young laying hens, breeding hens and breeding cocks before transport to other farms
- Post-movement testing of young laying hens, breeding hens and breeding cocks at the farm of destination
- Testing of breeding hens before transport of hatching eggs to a hatchery
- Mandatory treatment of eggs of infected breeding farms: no eggs sent to hatchery
- Healthy poultry of infected farms may only be transported to the slaughterhouse
- After depopulation, infected farms have to be cleaned and disinfected. Empty period of at least 21 days
- All egg trays and other equipment used in infected farms must be cleaned and disinfected twice before re-use in other farms

[According to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, all 14 non-H5 and non-H7 low pathogenic influenza A virus strains are not notifiable. This applies to the H3N1 strain currently circulating in Belgium, which is of low pathogenicity (IVPI 0.13). Consequently, the current disease is not liable to official control measures such as culling against compensations. The losses caused by this virus, in spite of its apparent "low pathogenicity", are considerable: According to the Belgian daily Niewsblad of 14 Jun 2019, "damage is increasing by one million Euro every day" (https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20190614_04461438). This has been causing serious concerns in Belgium and also in neighbor countries, particularly the Netherlands.

In view of the growing concerns, Belgium's Federal Minister for Agriculture, Denis Ducarme, his Flemish counterpart Koen Van den Heuvel, and a representative of the Walloon Minister for Agriculture met on 11 Jun 2019 with the European Commissioner for Agriculture, Phil Hogan, to address the issue. According to a press release by the Belgian Ministry, Commissioner Hogan informed them about the Commission's agreement in principle. "The compensation will in particular make it possible to support the holders in the context of a culling measure that will help to limit the spread of the virus." (https://tinyurl.com/y4fmuj2d). It is hoped that the due measures will facilitate an early control and eradication of the emerging disease and prevent its further spread within Belgium, and beyond.

The epidemiological investigation, in the above presentation, includes the statement "No common link between the affected farms," raising the question: how has the influenza A H3N1 virus strain been spreading throughout Belgium since January 2019? - Mod.AS
