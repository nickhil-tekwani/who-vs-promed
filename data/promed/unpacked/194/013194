Staph. aureus, reduced susceptibility to Vancomycin 970826115401]
Source: media reports
A strain of _Staphylococcus aureus_ almost completely resistant to vancomycin
has appeared for the second time in the United States, this time in a patient
in New Jersey. The strain of _S. aureus_, as did the one reported last month
in Michigan, showed an intermediate level of resistance to vancomycin -- one
step from immunity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced
Thursday.
The patient, who was not further identified, had a recurring bacteremia
and was eventually treated successfully with other antibiotics, as had been
the Michigan patient.
Scientists have watched with concern in recent years as common germs have
become resistant to drugs, a problem attributed to overuse of antibiotics.
Doctors should not automatically turn to vancomycin to treat staph, said Dr.
Michelle Pearson, a CDC epidemiologist. "Sometimes the patient is started on
the strongest medicine, but as we have seen, there were a number of
antibiotics to which this organism was susceptible," she said.
