New potato virus strain has industry on edge
--------------------------------------------
A potato virus, around for years, is mutating. Growers have grown
used to seeing some signs of _Potato Virus Y_, or PVY, in fields. The
disease causes foliar damage and infected plants must be taken out of
certified seed fields, but otherwise the virus hasn't really been a
threat.

That could be changing. Researchers are finding new strains of the
virus damaging tubers with little apparent injury to an infected
plant's leaves. When specialists in the US surveyed PVY strains
between 2004 and 2006, they found 70 percent were the ordinary PVY
that causes leaf damage but not tuber damage.

By 2010, surveys showed tuber necrotic strains are increasing in both
incidence and distribution, said Stewart Gray, Agricultural Research
Service New York. Tuber necrotic strains accounted for 18 percent, up
from 6 percent previously, and ordinary strains had fallen to 53
percent. "This is no longer just a seed certification problem. The
problem now affects all aspects of potato production," he said.

The primary concern is that PVY will become a major quality disease
as it did in Europe in the 1980s. [Some] potato varieties can no
longer be planted there because of PVY, highly susceptible varieties
could be lost. As the strains change to more of the necrotic type,
commercial growers will have to pay more attention to PVY.

Infected plants that do not show much foliar or tuber damage, can
still be affected by PVY. "A good looking crop in the field does not
translate into disease-free tubers," Gray said. He emphasizes removing
infected plants and planting healthy tubers, but the shift in PVY
strains is creating challenges for certified growers as well.

[[_Potato Virus Y_ (PVY; type member of genus _Potyvirus_) is one of
the most damaging potato viruses affecting crop yields and tuber
quality. PVY can also affect tomato, capsicum, and some other related
species. Symptoms vary depending on viral strains and susceptibility
level of host cultivar. They may include mottling, distortion and
necrosis of leaves and stems, premature defoliation, tuber necrosis
and plant death, or no symptoms at all.

PVY is transmitted by aphids in a non-persistent manner, with _Myzus
persicae_ being the most efficient vector. PVY can also be spread by
mechanical means, plant-to-plant contact, or with infected planting
material such as seed tubers. Disease management of PVY and other
potato viruses relies largely on clean planting material and use of
resistant crop varieties, but reduction of available virus reservoirs
and vector numbers may also be useful.

The emergence of new PVY strains has recently been reported from
different areas (see ProMED-mail posts listed below). Numbers of
co-infecting strains will build up with every crop cycle if PVY
infected seed tubers are used, especially if these are moved to
different areas where the virus strains they carry may combine with
local PVY populations.
