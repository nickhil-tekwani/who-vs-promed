The mosquito that spreads the potentially deadly dengue and yellow fever viruses has been discovered in the Canary Islands at the start of its high season.

Regional health officials sounded the alarm after discovering _Aedes_ type mosquitoes behind the spread of the painful diseases on the holiday island of Fuerteventura. The insect - _Aedes aegypti_ - can also spread other viruses common in tropical and sub-tropical areas including Zika fever [virus], Mayaro and Chikungunya which has no cure and like the other viruses associated with the mosquito cause fever and severe joint pain.

A small pocket of the mosquitoes, which in 2005 were blamed for 30 cases of dengue fever on Madeira, was detected on a private estate called Las Granadas near to Fuerteventura Hospital in the island capital Puerto del Rosario. In 2010 they were also linked to an outbreak of dengue in Cape Verde, another destination which has become increasingly popular among British tourists in recent years.

Regional officials say "some specimens" have been found and they are trying to locate possible breeding grounds and set traps in the area to try to eradicate the problem and make sure they don't settle on the island.

Health chiefs have sought to play down the fears of locals and holidaymakers by insisting that the presence of the insects does not mean visitors will go down with any of the viruses linked to them because apart from sporadic imported cases, the diseases are not present in the Canary Islands.

The Canary Islands regional health authority confirmed the discovery of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in a statement, saying: "An initial intervention is taking place in Fuerteventura with a larger number of traps being set and surveys taking place in houses near to the area where the mosquito has been detected to determine the spread and the area in which the work to eradicate them needs to be undertaken. Work to locate and inspect possible breeding grounds is also being carried out. All this will give us the vital information we need to proceed to the quick and effective eradication of the mosquito.

"The mere presence of the mosquito doesn't mean that illnesses like dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya are being spread as they are not present in the Canary Islands except for sporadic cases."

A spokesman also insisted on the importance of public cooperation in stamping out the problem, asking the public to send in pictures of the "suspicious" mosquito if they saw them with information on the exact location or bites they considered could have been caused by them.

Basilio Valladares, director of the Canary Islands' Institute of Tropical Diseases and Public Health, told Spanish daily El Pais the possibility of virus transmission was non-existent at the moment because there was no one the authorities were aware of in Fuerteventura that was ill. But he added: "If they settle the moment might arrive when they could transmit viruses like dengue fever as it happened in Cape Verde and Madeira."

The high temperatures in the Canaries over winter makes the destination one of the most popular getaways at this time of the year and early next year for Brits and other Northern Europeans. Thousands also flock to the islands in February for their famous carnivals.

[The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito has the remarkable ability to be transported to new localities in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. For example, in the past 3 years, this mosquitoe has been found in the western USA (Southern California, Arizona and New Mexico) and in Auckland, New Zealand. The risk of outbreak initiation in the Canary Islands is not from tourists coming from the UK or Northern Europe directly during their winter, rather from individuals viremic with dengue, chikungunya or Zika viruses coming from tropical and subtropical localities where transmission of those viruses is going on. The above report does not indicate if _Aedes aegypti_ is abundant enough in any of the locations where they have been discovered in Fuerteventura to permit ongoing virus transmission. Efforts to determine the presence of this mosquito and reduce its numbers are prudent. Eradication may prove difficult. - Mod.TY
