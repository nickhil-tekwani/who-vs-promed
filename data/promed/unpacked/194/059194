[From early July through October 2010, a total of 261 laboratory
confirmed cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in humans were
reported in central Macedonia as well as in the district of Larissa
(Northern Greece). Of these, 191 patients presented with
neuro-invasive symptoms, and 34 deaths have been reported. As reported
by Greek researchers in March 2011 (see 20110313.0809), a WNV lineage
2 strain was molecularly detected in a European magpie [bird], hunted
in central Macedonia in September 2010; the isolate was identified and
characterized, becoming the 1st molecular detection of WNV lineage 2
in wild birds in Greece.

Since 16 Aug 2010, 28 WNV outbreaks have been reported in equidae in
Greece. The epizootic started in Macedonia (northeast Greece), where
25 outbreaks were recorded during 2010, the last one starting 13 Oct
2010. During September 2011, 2 outbreaks affected horses in Thessalia,
southwest to Macedonia. No further cases were reported until July
2011. The 1st outbreak in horses during 2011 has been officially
notified in follow-up report No 5, included in this posting. It
started, reportedly, on 26 Jul 2011 in Attiki, southeast of
Thessalia.

For the locations of all 28 outbreaks, see interactive map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9642.

Out of a total of 614 susceptible horses in all affected holdings, 32
were, reportedly, clinical cases, of which 2 died and one was
destroyed.

It will be interesting to note whether human cases have already
appeared during the current season. - Mod.AS]
