Care must be exercised when interpreting serological data in outbreaks of
leptospirosis.
Outbreaks are almost always due to one single serovar, as cross-reaction is
common, most times different serovars result from such.
Another explanation would be endemic infection, not related to the current
outbreak.
Inasmuch different species may harbor leptospira, outbreaks, specially
those associated with floods, are due to rodents - usually urban - and not
to other reservoirs.
Experience and the literature would point to _L. icterohemorrhagiae_ as the
cause of the current outbreak in Ecuador, particularly due to its high
case-fatality rate.
