Bird flu-hit county in Liaoning culls 6 million poultry
-----------------------------------------------
6 million poultry have been culled in the bird flu-hit county of
Heishan, in northeast China's Liaoning Province, local government
said on Sunday [6 Nov 2005].

The culling lasted from Saturday [5 Nov 2005] evening to Sunday noon,
with all poultry slaughtered within a radius of 3 km from the
epidemic site, said Wang Yunwen, deputy secretary-general of the
Jinzhou municipal government. Local farmers actively cooperated with
the government, he said. The farmers were being compensated for the
culling. The county allocated 9.6 million yuan (USD 1.16 million) to
the townships on Sunday, he added.

Niu Dun, vice minister of agriculture, arrived at the county with 11
experts. 3 experts gave lectures on bird flu prevention to about 150
grassroots officials on Sunday [6 Nov 2005].

Local publicity department is also producing CDs of the lectures and
publishing booklets on bird flu prevention for distribution among the
people living in the affected areas.

Local farmers found some chickens dying in Badaohao township and
reported them to the local government. China's Ministry of
Agriculture confirmed the case as H5N1 bird flu on Thursday [3 Nov
2005].

Heishan county is located on the migratory birds' route from East
Asia to Australia, and more than 20 magpies and other wild birds have
been spotted.

[Data on the exact identity (species) of the infected Chinese
magpies, and of the "other wild birds," are still missing.

Available information on possible autumn migration of _corvidae_ from
China to southern territories, including Australia, will be welcomed.

The current avian panzootic has acquired one of the largest
dimensions in veterinary history, already stretching from Indonesia
and eastern Asia to the Balkans, threatening to spread further. As
repeatedly indicated, there is an urgent need to intensify the close
involvement of ornithologists in the interdisciplinary research
efforts. - Mod.AS]

Bird flu triggers concern over consumption of eggs
-----------------------------------------------
The discovery of chickens infected by the bird flu virus, but showing
no symptoms of the disease, has triggered concern over consumption of
their eggs.

Scientists cannot agree whether the content of the eggs from such
chickens is free of the virus, but they do say there is some risk,
because the surface of the egg shells may still be tainted with
virus-laden excreta of the birds.

Birds infected with H5N1 shed huge amounts of the virus in their
droppings and respiratory secretions, which help spread the bug over
wide geographical areas.

"It is not entirely clear if the eggs of infected chickens will be
affected. But if the chicken is infected, some amount of virus could
be on the shell of the egg," said Samson Wong, a microbiologist at
the University of Hong Kong.

Some 120 people have been infected with virus since it resurfaced in
Asia in 2003, most of them due to contact with sick chickens. More
than 60 people have died from the virus, which made its 1st jump to
humans in 1997 in Hong Kong.

While some of those infected fell ill after eating sick chickens,
doctors cannot quite determine whether their illnesses were due to
consuming or handling the birds.

Doctors have long said chicken is safe to eat as long it is
thoroughly cooked. But the safety of eggs had not been in the
spotlight, because chickens die within 24 hours of becoming infected,
too short a time window for them to produce eggs.

But the question about whether eggs are safe has assumed urgency
since healthy chickens carrying the virus were discovered in
Indonesia recently. The birds do not fall sick and continue laying
eggs even though they carry and shed the virus.

Health experts are extremely concerned about infected birds and
poultry which don't show any symptoms, because they render the virus
so much harder to detect and control. Some have warned against eating
raw or even runny eggs, which are popular in some parts of Asia, such
as Japan.

Australia's veterinary emergency plan of 2004, a copy of which was
obtained by Reuters, said that while severely affected birds will
stop laying, eggs laid in the early phase of an outbreak could still
contain avian influenza viruses in the albumen and yolk, as well as
on the surface of the egg.

However, Guan Yi, a leading virologist from the University of Hong
Kong who has studied the H5N1 virus extensively since 1997, said the
eggs of chickens which tested positive for the virus were infected on
the surface of their shells, and not inside.

"These chickens can continue to lay eggs, and there could be
contamination outside the shell from the feces," Guan said.

Guan said asymptomatic chickens, or birds that do not fall ill or die
but do carry the virus, were a result of improper use of vaccines.

In recent years, many countries in Asia have tried to get rid of H5N1
by vaccinating poultry flocks. But some vaccines used are of low
quality and, instead of killing the virus, they have masked the
disease.

"Many countries use vaccines and think the virus is completely
exterminated ... but this problem is still in southeast Asia. It's
even in migratory birds, and they are dying. Why? Because the virus
has gone from poultry to migratory birds, which are taking it further
afield," Guan said.

Singapore last year [2004] banned imports of poultry products from
Malaysia after an outbreak of bird flu near its neighbor's northern
border, leading to a shortage of eggs in the city-state.

But health experts said eating eggs is still safe, as long as they
are handled and cooked thoroughly until the yolk is hard.

"For such eggs, if they are kept in cold, dry storage for half to one
month, they may still be used, because that would kill the virus. Or
you wash the egg," Guan said.

[Thus far, the possible transmission of the H5N1 virus through
shell-eggs laid by infected, asymptomatic hens remains to be
satisfactorily studied. WHO's relevant recommendations, recently
updated (though before the new observations on non-clinical cases in
commercial, domestic fowl were known), were spelled out as follows:
"In countries with outbreaks, eggs may contain virus both on the
outside (shell) and inside (white and yolk). Eggs from areas with
outbreaks should not be consumed raw or partially cooked. Raw eggs
should not be used in foods that will not be treated by heat high
enough to kill the virus (70 C)."

The safety of shell eggs and their handling have been widely
discussed during earlier years in relation to _Salmonella
enteritidis_; see
