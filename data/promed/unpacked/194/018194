According to the state Secretary of Health, 7
cities of Sergipe record epidemic dengue and 6
are at risk. The state government says it is
taking steps to prevent an increase in the number
of cases and also to strengthen the care for victims of the disease.

Among the cities that face the epidemic, are:
Laranjeiras, Neopolis, Carira, Tobias Barreto,
Riachuelo, Malhador, and Campo do Brito. The
Secretariat believes that there is a high
incidence of the disease in cities which have
over 301 [dengue] cases per 100 000 inhabitants.

Currently Aracaju, Nossa Senhora do Socorro,
Stone Mole, Brejo Grande, and Sao Cristovao are
at risk for an epidemic, presenting [dengue]
incidence that runs to 101-300 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.

"These are locations that require special
attention and increased attention. The situation
worries us. So there is a need for intensive
effort by all," said secretary for health, Rogerio Carvalho.

The press office of the health secretariat said
that between January and March this year [2008],
653 cases of dengue were confirmed in the state.
In all of last year [2007], the number [of dengue
cases] reached 861. In the 1st 3 months of 2008,
4 deaths due to the disease have been confirmed.
Other cases are under investigation -- among them, that of a 3-year-old girl.

The secretary said that 900 epidemic [control]
agents are trained in diagnosis and treatment of
dengue, in addition to doctors and nurses. Also,
large posters were placed in clinics and other
work environments to alert the population.

Sergipe submitted a contingency plan to the
Ministry of Health, to reinforce the actions to
combat the disease. "Through this initiative, we
requested acquisition of vehicles and equipment,
installation of "eco-points" for disposal of
tires, and deployment of a dengue virology
laboratory, as currently the [samples for]
laboratory testing are directed to Recife and
Salvador," said Carvalho. Moreover, there are
plans to temporarily hire and train 510 professionals.

In the coming days, at least 80 extra beds for
special care must be designated in hospitals in Sergipe.

In Rio de Janeiro, the epidemic of dengue
collapsed the public health network this Tuesday
[1 Apr 2008]. All 607 vacancies in federal,
state, and municipal hospitals reserved by the
central [office] for regulation of [hospital]
beds for the victims of the dengue [virus
transmitting] mosquito were occupied. There were
also no beds available in the 9 private
hospitals, including those outside the
municipality, that have been contracted by the state government.

On Monday [31 Mar 2008], the municipal Department
of Health confirmed 13 more deaths from dengue in
Rio, 5 of them children. With these, the number
of dengue deaths reaches at least 67 in the state
since January [2008], 40 of them children.

This Monday [31 Mar 2008], a report from the
Ministry of Health disclosed that the incidence
of dengue in Brazil fell 27 percent in the 1st 2
months of 2008. Currently [at the national
level], as of [the 13th week of the year (23-29
March [2008]), a total of 120 570 dengue cases
have been reported in the country.

[An additional ProMED-PORT report published in
Portuguese in Estadao on 31 Mar 2008
(http:www.estadao.com.br) indicated that Rio
[city] had 44 dengue deaths, 23 of whom were
children up to 12 years of age. There have been
67 dengue deaths in the state. In the entire
country, there have been 74 dengue-related deaths
-- 48 from DHF and the remainder from
complications caused by the infection. ProMED
Rapporteur A-Lan Banks is thanked for sending in a similar report. - Mod.TY]

[It is not clear what is meant by "incomplete
hemorrhagic disease"; perhaps these are milder
DHF cases or classical dengue fever with some
hemorrhagic manifestations. This report does not
indicate if the dengue epidemic continued into
2008. ProMED-mail would appreciate any additional
information that might be available about 2008.

So far at least 23 New Zealanders have contracted
the viral disease [dengue], which is spread
through infected mosquitoes. Auckland medical
officer of health Dr Simon Baker said 2 of the
people have had to be hospitalised.

"It's an ongoing outbreak in Tonga and people
need to be cautious there," Dr Baker said.

[ProMED-mail reported over 200 dengue cases in
Tonga as of 2 Mar 2008 (see archive no.
20080309.0962). One would infer from the report
above of dengue cases showing up in New Zealand
that the epidemic in Tonga continues. ProMED
would appreciate further information from Tonga
concerning the dengue outbreak there.

According to the Department of Health (DOH),
cases of dengue in Negros Oriental have decreased
by 50 percent this March [2008]. The Epidemiology
Surveillance Unit of the DOH shows that there
were only 34 cases of dengue from 1-26 Mar this
year [2008] compared to 70 cases in February.

The survey also showed that the 70 cases of
dengue in February [2008] are lower by 45 percent
compared to [the 130] cases recorded in January.

According to Dr Socrates Villamor, chief of
epidemiology, the decrease of dengue cases in
February and March [2008] is due to the summer
season. However, he reminded the public not to
get [comfortable with] the result of the survey
because dengue cases this year are still high as compared to last 2007.

There were 234 cases from January to 26 Mar this
year [2008] compared to 134 [during the same]
period last year [2007]. Dengue case [numbers]
are higher by 100 victims compared to last year [2007], he said.

With this development, Dr Villamor advised local
residents to continue the 4 o'clock habit to
clean their surroundings to avoid dengue
infections [by eliminating breeding sites for the
_Aedes_ dengue virus vector mosquito. - Mod.TY].

[The reduction in dengue cases is good news.
However, one hopes that health providers and
local citizens will heed Dr Villamor's advice and
continue eliminating mosquito breeding sites in
and around their houses and other buildings so
that the dengue incidence will not increase when the rains return.
