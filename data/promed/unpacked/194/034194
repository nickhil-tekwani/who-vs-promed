Four primary cases, one of whom died, and 10 secondary cases (some
asymptomatic) have been identified in an outbreak of Vero cytotoxin
producing _Escherichia coli_ (VTEC) O157 infection in August 1999 among
visitors to a popular beach in South Devon, in the west country of England.
The PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP) has confirmed 12 isolates as
VTEC O157 phage type (PT) 21/28 Vero cytotoxin 2, and isolates examined so
far have indistinguishable pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns. A
further two cases had antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide of _E. coli_
O157.
Other close contacts have reported symptoms but their infections have not
been confirmed. A specific vehicle has not been identified. The incident
illustrates the complications of investigating outbreaks in which none of
the cases lives in the district where exposure is believed to have occurred.
The first case, an 8 year old girl, became ill with bloody diarrhoea on 2
August while on holiday at Dawlish Warren in South Devon. She was admitted
to hospital, and transferred to a renal unit in Bristol with haemolytic
uraemic syndrome (HUS), and died on 7 August. The Department of Public
Health Medicine of South and West Devon Health Authority then learnt of
two presumptive cases of VTEC O157 infection in local residents, but no
epidemiological links were identified and LEP showed them to be of
different phage types (PT8 and PT49).
On 10 August the consultant in communicable disease control (CCDC) was
informed of a child in the West Midlands with VTEC O157 infection who had
visited Dawlish Warren on 28 July. An outbreak control meeting was
convened, and an Epinet message sent to CCDCs throughout the country
revealed the third primary household case, an 8 year old girl with HUS who
had visited Dawlish Warren from 24 July to 7 August. Her 11 year old
sister, a secondary case, was admitted to hospital with HUS and confirmed
microbiologically. Another visitor to the area who became ill was
subsequently shown to have VTEC O157 PT2 infection. The fourth primary
household case was identified on 23 August. This was a 1 year old girl who
had visited Dawlish Warren on 28 July; VTEC O157 infection was subsequently
identified in several family members, including her four siblings, one of
whom had evidence of HUS.
The local environmental health department carried out intensive
investigations of food outlets in the area and took over 100 environmental
samples, including sea, drinking and swimming pool water, and sand from the
beach and other public areas around the Warren. The Environment Agency
collected 45 samples from 15 sites in the River Exe estuary and along the
coast from Exmouth to Teignmouth between 25 and 27 August. E. coli O157 of
PT 14 and PT 34 was identified in two samples taken from the top of the
estuary. This river flows through a rural area with significant
agricultural activity. An accidental sewage spill two miles along the coast
occurred on 24 July. This was considered to be an unlikely source of
contamination as sampling on 26 July showed that the water quality was
good. The beach is patrolled and there were no reports of sewage on the
beach at that time. Interviews with the families of cases suggest that they
occupied the same part of the beach within the same week and the
possibility has been raised that a small area of the beach may have been
contaminated, perhaps by an infected child or animal.
