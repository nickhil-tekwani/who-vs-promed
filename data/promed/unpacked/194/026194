From: Dr. Richard H. Evans <snaver@home.com>

Concerning the report on the British rabies quarantine trials submitted by
Martin Hugh-Jones, I would offer the following comments.
At present, there are only 2 viable microchip companies in the US; AVID and
Schering Home Again. A third company called Infopet has been operating in
the US for years but appears not to be doing much if any business now. As I
understand it from discussing the subject with representatives form both
companies, AVID is a proprietary chip while Schering and Infopet are chips
made by Destron in Germany. All 3 companies have universal scanners which
in our experience work well reading each others chips. However, there is a
vast difference in the way their respective databases are kept and how data
retrieval is accomplished.
We have talked to veterinarians in Germany, France and England and it
appears that the Destron chips is most commonly used. We have readily
picked up a few chips from dogs coming in from these countries, but have
had tremendous problems accessing the owner data.
