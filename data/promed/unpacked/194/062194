Jennie-O Turkey Store, a Willmar, Minnesota establishment, is
recalling approximately 54 960 pounds of frozen, raw turkey burger
products that may be contaminated with _Salmonella_, the Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced
today, 1 Apr 2011. As FSIS continues its investigation of illnesses
related to this recall, additional raw turkey products may be
recalled. As a result, FSIS is alerting consumers to take extra care
when preparing all raw turkey products.

To prevent salmonellosis and other foodborne illnesses, wash hands
with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after
handling raw meat and poultry, and cook poultry -- including ground
turkey burgers -- to 165 deg F [74 deg C], as determined with a food
thermometer.

The products subject to recall include:
- 4-pound boxes of Jennie-O Turkey Store "All Natural Turkey Burgers
with seasonings Lean White Meat." Each box contains 12 1/3-pound
individually wrapped burgers.

A use by date of "DEC 23 2011" and an identifying lot code of "32710"
through "32780" are inkjetted [printed] on the side panel of each box,
just above the opening tear strip. Establishment number "P-7760" is
located within the USDA mark of inspection on the front of each box.
The products were packaged on 23 Nov 2010 and were distributed to
retail establishments nationwide.

The Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services notified FSIS
of a patient diagnosed with salmonellosis caused by _Salmonella
[enterica_] serotype Hadar. The investigation expanded to include 12
people in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois,
Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Washington, and Wisconsin who also have
been diagnosed with _S._ Hadar infection, with illnesses occurring
between December 2010 and March 2011. Working in conjunction with the
CDC and state public health partners, FSIS determined that 3 of the
patients in Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin specifically reported eating
this product prior to illness onset and hospitalization; the last of
these illnesses was reported on 14 Mar 2011.

As a result of the epidemiologic investigation, FSIS determined that
there is a link between the Jennie-O ground turkey products and this
illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC, affected state
public health partners, and the company on the investigation. FSIS
will continue to provide information as it becomes available,
including information about any related recall activity. Individuals
concerned about an illness should contact a physician.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify
recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps
are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to
consumers.

[Even with salmonellae contaminating the turkey, as with _E. coli_
O157:H7 in ground beef, adequate cooking of the product before eating
as well as appropriate kitchen hygiene to prevent contamination of
cooked burgers with residuae of the uncooked meat will prevent cases.

There is no mention of "smoking" turkey, that is, isolation of the
outbreak strain from the suspected vehicle. - Mod.LL]
