It seems to me, if [the Legionnaires' disease outbreak occurring in
South Wales, UK] is associated with a road [the Heads of the Valleys
Road (the A465)], we should consider car-cleaning spraying systems,
as was reported recently for Legionnaire's disease in Spain and
previously in Australia; or car window wash, as the UK Health
Protection Agency has advised may be a risk if not containing screen
wash solutions.

[Meredith Lloyd-Evans raises a very interesting point about
windshield spray as a possible source for _Legionella_ in the
outbreak of Legionnaires' disease along the Heads of the Valleys Road
(the A465) in South Wales, UK.

Studies from the UK (1), Netherlands (2), Turkey (3) and possibly
Japan (4) have found that being a professional driver is a risk for
developing Legionnaires' disease. The study from the UK (1)
postulated that contaminated aerosols were generated by the vehicle's
windshield washing systems, whereas the studies from Turkey (3) and
Japan (4) postulated the source for _Legionella_ was contaminated
aerosols generated by the vehicle's air conditioning system.

The UK investigators (1) found that professional drivers are 5 times
more commonly represented among community-acquired sporadic cases of
Legionnaires' disease in England and Wales than expected.
Multivariable analysis identified driving through industrial areas
and especially driving or being a passenger in a vehicle with
windscreen wiper fluid not containing added screen wash was strongly
associated with community-acquired sporadic cases of Legionnaires'
disease. The authors estimated that around 20 percent of community
acquired sporadic cases could be attributed to use of tap water in
place of windshield washer solution in the system's reservoir.
Windshield wiper solution contains alcohol
(<http://www.purdue.edu/envirosoft/housewaste/house/windsh.htm>),
which they postulated is the antibacterial agent that would inhibit
growth of _Legionella_.

In addition, as mentioned in a prior ProMED post Legionellosis -
Spain: (AN) 20100612.1973, the Japanese investigators hypothesized
that contaminated aerosols may also enter a car when a car is driven
through puddles, as they isolated _Legionella_ from rain puddles on
asphalt roads, especially during warm weather (5). In this regard,
several studies have indicated an association between rainfall and
legionellosis (6-10).

Also, as mentioned in a prior ProMED post Legionellosis - Spain: (AN)
20100612.1973, aerosolization of water used in the process of paving
a roadway with asphalt may be linked to cases of legionellosis in
Alcoy, Spain. A machine known as a roller follows the asphalt paver
to compact newly laid asphalt. Water is used to lubricate the roller
drums and prevent hot asphalt from sticking to the drum surface. The
drums may also be filled with water on site to achieve the desired
weight. (See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_roller>).

If car-washing facilities were a source for the current outbreak in
Wales, the cases wouldn't necessarily be linked to a particular
roadway. (See prior ProMED post Legionellosis - Spain (02): (AN)
20100708.2279 for a discussion of linkage of legionellosis to
car-washing facilities.)

The Heads of the Valleys Road (the A465) is a major road in South
Wales; it runs along the southern border of the Brecon Beacons
National Park and joins together the north ends (or "heads") of the
South Wales Valleys from Ebbw Vale, Tredegar, Rhymney, and Merthyr
Tydfil (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A465_road>), the region
currently suspected of being involved in the South Wales valleys
Legionnaires' disease outbreak. A map of this area is available at
<http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2010/09/11/new-cases-of-legionnaires-disease-hit-wales-91466-27248515/>.
Merthyr Tydfil is a town with a population of about 30 000 that
relies on a combination of public sector and manufacturing and
service sector companies to provide employment
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merthyr_Tydfil#Employment>).

South Wales and the town of Merthyr Tydfil can be located on the
