Wild boars culled as FMD hits zoo again
---------------------------------------
With foot and mouth (FMD) disease recurring in the zoo in
Thiruvananthapuram, 19 wild boars have been culled, and the zoo has been
closed to visitors for the 2nd time in a month. This closure is for an
indefinite period of time. The deadly disease afflicting cloven-hoofed
animals has claimed about 25 animals including black bucks, mithun bulls
and Nilgai since the outbreak last month [July 2007].
The zoo authorities were given permission to cull the wild boars yesterday
[5 Aug 2007] after a high-power technical committee of experts reviewed the
situation. The authorities were still finding it difficult to contain the
problem as the virus causing the deadly affliction is carried by winds.
"FMD has been reported in many parts of the state killing livestock. Its
recurrence in the zoo is very much due to the direction of wind that
carries the virus. We cannot plug the air passage of the sprawling park,"
Dr C S Jayakumar, chief vet at the zoo, said. He said 60 per cent of the
vulnerable animals had been saved through the preventive and curative steps
taken since the outbreak of the disease towards the end of June [2007]. A
team of experts from the Bangalore-based Regional Disease Dignostic
Laborotary visited the zoo last month [July 2007] to analyse the problem.
The zoo was closed for about 20 days from 8 Jul 2007.

[FMD vaccines were among the first animal vaccines to be developed,
beginning at the end of the 19th century. Loss of the Thiruvananthapuram
zoo animals (protected species!) and their suffering could and can be
prevented by the application of this good old device.
Those interested in the history of FMD vaccination (a hot issue within the
current UK's FMD outbreak deliberations), are referred to a recent paper by
M Lombard, P-P Pastoret, A-M Moulin: A brief history of vaccines and
vaccination. Rev sci tech Off int Epiz 2007; 26(1): 29-48. - Mod.AS]
