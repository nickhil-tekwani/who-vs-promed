There has been plenty of controversy regarding South American camelids and
their susceptibility to FMD during the current outbreak in the UK.
It is my understanding that so far camelids have been culled on contiguous
farms, with no confirmed cases. After extensive lobbying by breeders
associations, MAFF (DEFRA) has recently adopted a policy of quarantine
(provided high standards of biosecurity are adopted) and monitoring by
periodic blood testing for camelids on farms contiguous to confirmed cases.
I would be extremely interested to know if there has been any suspect or
confirmed case involving camelids in the current outbreak in Bolivia. Are
camelids in Bolivia involved in the vaccination program?

[This is a very good question. The reports to OIE indicate that it is a
disease of the highlands as well as of the llanos in the lowlands, so
exposure of llamas and alpacas in Bolivia is possible. In 1999 it was
reported in La Paz and Cochabamba. In the present series ... "La Paz,
Potosi, and Oruro in the Altiplano region, [where the disease was
previously unknown, have started to report some cases" with "the 31
outbreaks of FMD virus in Cochabamba, central Bolivia." As llamas are pack
animals and therefore in daily contact with human communities and their
domestic stock, their risk would be higher. Vicunas and guanacos are also
in Bolivia, but being wild and scattered, the risk to them and from them is
uncertain, if it exists at all. Anyone with information on present FMD
exposure and infection of these animals in Bolivia or historically in Peru
and Chile is asked to share their knowledge. We should not forget the
guanacos in Patagonia now that FMD is there. - Mod.MHJ
