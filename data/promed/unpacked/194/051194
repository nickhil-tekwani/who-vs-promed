[As mentioned in the above report, the total number of cVDPV associated cases in this outbreak in Syria is now at 40, with the most recent date of onset recorded as 14 Jul 2017, suggesting there may have been interruption of transmission. A caution is that the newly reported case in this current update had a date of onset of 19 Jun 2017, 3 months ago, so there appears to be delayed reporting and confirmation occurring in the area. the breakdown of the cases geographically has 38 cases reported from Deir Al Zour governorate (34 from Mayadeen District, 1 from Deir Al Zour district and 3 from Boukamal district), 1 case from Raqqah governorate (Tell Abyad district) and 1 case from Homs governorate (Tadmour district).
