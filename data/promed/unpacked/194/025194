20 flocks hit with ovine brucellosis
------------------------------------
Ovine brucellosis has been confirmed in 20 commercial Victorian sheep
flocks this year [2010], sparking tracebacks to ensure infected rams
did not come from studs accredited as free of the disease. The
Department of Primary Industries' (DPI) sheep disease project leader
Robert Suter said he would normally only expect 2-3 reports of ovine
brucellosis in Victorian flocks at this time of the year.

The recent increase in confirmed reports followed drops in scanning
or lamb marking rates of 10-20 per cent, triggering an investigation,
he said. He was not aware of any interstate flocks being affected or
identified as a source of infected rams.

Ovine brucellosis caused infertility in affected rams and Dr Suter
said in one case an infected ram was shared among 3 flocks. The
increased number of reports was a concern because it came at a time
when a lot of attention was being focused on flock reproductive
performance and rebuilding the nation's sheep flock, he said.

"It is disappointing for producers when they put a lot of effort into
building a fertile ewe flock which is managed well throughout
pregnancy only to have the other part of the reproductive equation,
the ram, not able to do his job," Dr Suter said. "The only treatment
is to cull these rams."

Dr Suter said DPI was trying to identify the sources of infected rams
to ensure they did not come from flocks accredited under the Ovine
Brucellosis Accreditation Scheme. None of the recently reported cases
indicated there had been any breakdown in the scheme's accreditation
process, he said. "The best protection is to buy only from ovine
brucellosis-free accredited ram sources and check that they can
provide a current accreditation certificate.

"If in doubt, have your ram flock assessed by a veterinarian 2 or so
months before mating, as this allows time to source replacement rams
if necessary," Dr Suter said.

"Even if brucellosis is not present, the examination can identify
rams of sub-optimal fertility well prior to mating."

He said affected rams could be identified by examination of the
scrotum and its contents by a veterinarian, who would confirm suspect
animals with a blood test as other conditions could mimic brucellosis
signs. Dr Suter said once brucellosis had been introduced into the
ram flock, it often took a long series of examinations and blood
tests to achieve a clean flock of rams.

"By this time a large proportion will have been culled," Dr Suter said.

[Finding where the disease began is the 1st step in breaking the
cycle of transmission. Sharing rams is economical, until a disease
passed from the ram affects the entire flock for many years, which
may mean sharing a ram was not so economical after all. Brucellosis
is a major impact on any producer.

_Brucella ovis_ produces a disease unique to sheep, in which
epididymitis and orchitis impair fertility -- the principal economic
effect. Occasionally, placentitis and abortion are seen, and there
may be perinatal mortality. The disease was 1st described in New
Zealand and Australia and has since been reported from many
sheep-raising areas of the world.

Rams as young as 8 weeks have been infected experimentally by various
nonvenereal routes. The disease can be transmitted among rams by
direct contact. Active infection in ewes is unusual but has developed
after mating with naturally infected rams. Contaminated pastures do
not appear to be important in spread of the disease. Infection
frequently persists in rams, and a high percentage shed _B ovis_
intermittently for several years.

Because not all infected rams show palpable abnormalities of scrotal
tissues (and not all cases of epididymitis are due to brucellosis),
the remaining rams must be examined further. Rams shedding organisms,
but having no lesions, must be identified by culture of semen.
Repeated examinations may be necessary to identify intermittent
shedders. Microscopic examination of stained semen smears may also be
helpful; fluorescent antibody examination is a highly specific
diagnostic aid. Serologic tests used for eradication of disease and
certification of animals include ELISA, complement fixation,
hemagglutination inhibition, indirect agglutination, and gel diffusion.

Incidence and spread of the disease may be reduced by regular
examination of rams before the breeding season and culling of those
with obvious genital abnormalities. Because susceptibility in rams
increases markedly with age, it is advantageous to keep a young ram
flock and isolate noninfected rams from older, possibly infected rams.

Immunization of rams has been practiced extensively in New Zealand
using 2 doses of killed _B ovis_ cells in adjuvant. Because infection
in ewes apparently originates almost exclusively from service by
infected rams, lamb losses through infection of ewes may be
controlled economically by restricting vaccination to rams.

Chlortetracycline and streptomycin used concurrently have effected
bacteriologic cures. However, treatment is not economic except in
especially valuable rams, and even if infection is eliminated,
fertility may remain impaired.
