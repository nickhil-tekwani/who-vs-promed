AVIAN INFLUENZA - OIE: INTERNATIONAL CONTROL MEASURES
***********************************************

From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

In ProMED-mail's recent posting 20040529.1469 "OIE: 72nd Annual General
Session," we promised to notify subscribers about OIE's "discussed steps to
improve control of avian influenza and provide greater protection for
importing countries while eliminating unjustified barriers to trade" as
soon as they become available. We are very grateful to OIE for providing
the following text of the proposed new articles in the Terrestrial Animal
Health Code pertaining to avian influenza.
Article 2.1.14.5. (Under study).
1. For the purposes of this Terrestrial Code, notifiable avian influenza
(NAI) is defined as an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus
of the H5 or H7 subtypes or by any AI virus with an intravenous
pathogenicity index (IVPI) greater than 1.2 (or, as an alternative, at
least 75 percent mortality) as described below. NAI viruses can be divided
into highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza (HPNAI) and low
pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza (LPNAI):
a) HPNAI viruses have an IVPI, in 6-week-old chickens, greater than 1.2,
or, as an alternative, cause at least 75 percent mortality in 4 to
8-week-old chickens infected intravenously. H5 and H7 viruses which do not
have an IVPI of greater than 1.2, or cause less than 75 percent mortality
in an intravenous lethality test, should be sequenced to determine whether
multiple basic amino acids are present at the cleavage site of the
hemagglutinin molecule (HA0). If the amino acid motif is similar to that
observed for other HPNAI isolates, the isolate being tested should be
considered as HPNAI.
b) LPNAI are all influenza A viruses of H5 and H7 subtype that are not
HPNAI viruses.
2. Poultry is defined as "all birds reared or kept in captivity for the
production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other
commercial products, for re-stocking supplies of game, or for breeding
these categories of birds."
3. For the purpose of international trade, this chapter deals not only with
the occurrence of clinical signs caused by NAI virus, but also with the
presence of infection with NAI virus in the absence of clinical signs.
4. The following defines the occurrence of NAI virus infection:
a) HPNAI virus has been isolated and identified as such, or specific viral
RNA has been detected, in poultry or a product derived from poultry, or
b) LPNAI virus has been isolated and identified as such, or specific viral
RNA has been detected, in poultry or a product derived from poultry, or
c) antibodies to H5 or H7 subtype of NAI virus that are not a consequence
of vaccination, nor indicative of a non-specific reaction, have been
detected in poultry. In such cases, virus isolation should be attempted to
establish whether the serological positivity is due to LPNAI or HPNAI. If
appropriate samples are not available, or if results are negative, a
thorough epidemiological investigation, including further sampling and
testing, should be carried out to identify the type, or exclude the
presence, of NAI infection.
For the purposes of this Terrestrial Code, "NAI-free establishment" means
an establishment in which there has been no clinical sign of NAI for the
past 21 days, and which is not situated within 3 kilometers of an
establishment infected with HPNAI and within one kilometer of an
establishment infected with LPNAI.
For the purposes of this Terrestrial Code, the incubation period for NAI
shall be 21 days.
Standards for diagnostic tests are described in the Terrestrial Manual.
Any vaccine used should comply with the standards described in the
Terrestrial Manual.
Article 2.1.14.6. (Under study)
The NAI status of a country or a zone/compartment can be determined on the
basis of the following criteria:
1) the outcome of a risk assessment identifying all potential factors for
NAI occurrence and their historic perspective;
2) NAI is notifiable in the whole country, an on-going NAI awareness
program is in place, and all notified suspect occurrences of NAI are
subjected to field, and, where applicable, laboratory investigations;
3) appropriate surveillance is in place to demonstrate the presence of
infection in the absence of clinical signs in poultry, and the risk posed
by birds other than poultry. This may be achieved through an NAI
surveillance program in accordance with this Chapter and Chapter 1.3.6.
Article 2.1.14.7. (Under study)
NAI free country or zone/compartment
A country or zone/compartment may be considered free from NAI when it has
been shown that NAI infection has not been present for the past 12 months.
If infected poultry are slaughtered, this period shall be 3 months after
the slaughter of the last infected poultry and disinfection of all affected
establishments.
The NAI status should be determined by an ongoing surveillance and
monitoring program (carried out in conformity with the provisions of
Chapter 1.3.6.) based on virus isolation, virus detection or serology. The
program may need to be adapted to target parts of the country, or
zone/compartment, at a higher risk due to historical or geographical
factors, population data, or proximity to recent outbreaks.
Freedom of infection in a country or zone can be demonstrated with random
and/or targeted serological surveillance, at a minimum interval of 6
months, designed to provide at least a 95 percent level of confidence of
detecting a prevalence of NAI-infected enterprises of 1 percent. Freedom of
infection in a compartment can be demonstrated with an ongoing surveillance
program designed to provide at least a 95 percent level of confidence of
detecting a prevalence of NAI infection of 10 percent. Each establishment
should be sampled to provide a 95 percent level of confidence of detecting
a prevalence of NAI of 25 percent. For commercial ducks, the surveillance
program should be based on virus isolation or detection in the absence of
validated serological methods.
In the case of a country or zone in which vaccination is being conducted,
the ongoing surveillance and monitoring program (carried out in conformity
with the provisions of Chapter 1.3.6.) based on virus isolation, virus
detection, or serology should be carried out on all vaccinated flocks at a
minimum interval of 6 months. In each vaccinated flock, the number of birds
to be tested should provide at least a 95 percent level of confidence of
detecting a prevalence of NAI infection of 25 percent. In the case of a
compartment in which vaccination is being conducted, the ongoing
surveillance and monitoring program (carried out in conformity with the
provisions of Chapter 1.3.6.) based on virus isolation, virus detection, or
serology should be carried out to provide at least a 95 percent level of
confidence of detecting a prevalence of NAI infection of 10 percent. If a
serological test is used, it should be able to distinguish vaccinated birds
from infected birds. Additional security should be provided by the use of
identifiable sentinel birds that can be clinically inspected, or tested, to
help identify field infections in vaccinated flocks.
Article 2.1.14.8. (Under study)
When importing from an NAI free country or zone/compartment, Veterinary
Administrations should require:
for live poultry (other than day-old poultry)

[Chapter 2.1.14 "Highly pathogenic avian influenza" in OIE's Terrestrial
Animal Health Code has included, prior to the 72nd General Session (23 - 28
May 2004), 4 articles, 2.1.14.1. to 2.1.14.4, which may be accessed at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/MCode/A_00043.htm>.
The above new 25 articles, 2.1.14.5. to 2.1.14.29., have been presented by
the Code Commission during the Session. They are regarded, at present, as
"under study," or as awaiting additional information on surveillance and on
the risks posed by various commodities. They should, therefore, not yet be
considered to be finalized requirements to be applied by Member Countries.
Hopefully, the final text, after its approval by the Code Commission, will
be adopted as a standard during the next General Session in May 2005. By
including them already in their present preliminary status in the Code,
member countries, as well as the community at large (industry, public
health, etc), are given a chance to start preparing themselves for
implementation at this early stage. This is a welcome, timely procedure.
The current text may also be useful as a guideline for countries recently
affected by NAI, assisting the efforts to regain their disease-free status.
The changes in chapter 2.1.14, and in other chapters of OIE's Terrestrial
and Aquatic Animal Health Codes, will soon be available on OIE's web-site.
