The suspected leading cause of duck deaths in Beach Haven West [Stafford Township, New Jersey] lagoons is botulism, although final results won't be available for about a week, state Department of Environmental Protection [DEP] officials said today [3 Aug 2017], a day after the ducks were fished from the lagoons in the waterfront community.

"Botulism lives in stagnant waters," Larry Hajna, a public information officer for the state agency, said this afternoon [3 Aug 2017], noting runoff from recent rain storms, high temperatures, and the fact that lagoons don't see a lot of moving water all contribute to the brackish conditions. "Botulism grows in confined spaces with low oxygen."

The DEP's Fish and Wildlife division collected samples of the ducks removed from the lagoons for evaluation. Along with the Marine Water division of the DEP, they were monitoring water quality in the lagoons and found no chemicals. The conditions in the lagoons, he said, were obviously degraded and that promotes algae growth. Samples of the algae taken by the state agency are being tested, Hajna said.

"We're running tests and getting confirmation," he said, noting people should refrain from swimming in the lagoons, even in good conditions, because lagoon waters are often inactive and breed algae. "People should swim on public beaches where the water is monitored and where there are lifeguards."

No swimming is the same message Stafford Township issued to residents after becoming aware of the situation. Residents notified animal control and the mayor's office after they saw the dead ducks. The ducks appeared to be floating in the water, alive, but their heads had fallen into their chests. This set off a chain reaction for local officials, who notified the DEP's Fish and Wildlife division as well as the Ocean County Board of Health.

"We are also requesting that all residents be extremely vigilant with regard to the waterways and inform the township of any incidences of fish kills or sick birds," Stafford Township officials said in a statement posted to the township website late Thursday afternoon [3 Aug 2017].

Anyone who comes across sick, dead, or dying wildlife should call local animal control or the health department, said Brian Lippai, public information officer for the Ocean County Board of Health. Under no circumstances should the public be handling diseased, dead, or dying animals.

"Common sense dictates that you don't approach or handle a sickly animal," he said, "as much as you want to help. It creates a chain reaction."

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin.

There are several types of toxin produced by strains of this bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Type C toxin is found in waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial waterbirds, and others; whereas type E toxin in gulls, loons, and others. - Mod.PMB
