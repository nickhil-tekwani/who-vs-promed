7 people died of strange disease in Ghana
--------------------------------------------
A strange disease has been spreading across Ghana's Volta Region, leaving 7
people dead, according to a report reaching here from Ghana's capital Accra.
The report quoted Nicholas Ahiadorme, chief executive of North Tongu
District, Volta Region, as saying that 10 more people suffering from the
disease were receiving treatment in the hospitals.
He said symptoms associated with the disease, which has mostly affected
children, include severe headache, stiff neck, running nose, and violent
behaviors. According to the district official, symptoms of the disease were
being reported in pockets of settlements in the district.
The official urged the people to refrain from claiming that the disease is
caused by supernatural factors and instead seek prompt medical attention.
Local medical authorities said that samples of fluids were being analyzed.

[According to the GIDEON database (<http://www.GideonOnline.com>), the most
likely diagnosis for the symptoms presented in the news article above is
viral meningitis, followed by yellow fever, enterovirus, measles, dengue,
and syphilis. The apparent high case fatality rate (41 percent) seems to go
against viral meningitis and would be more consistent with yellow fever or
measles. It would be unusual to have measles reported as an unknown disease
in an area where measles is known and feared as a major contributor to
child morbidity and mortality. Clearly more information on this outbreak
would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
