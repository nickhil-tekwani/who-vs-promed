3 more plague cases were found in Colorado, a week after the 1st infection of the deadliest form of the disease was reported in the state in a decade. The man initially reported with pneumonic plague on 11 Jul 2014 is [still] hospitalized; 2 of the new cases also had pneumonic plague, while the 3rd had a milder form. All 4 cases may be linked to the original man's dog, which died from the illness, state health officials said.

The people newly found to be infected were treated with antimicrobials, recovered, and are no longer contagious. Health officials suspect the dog that died may been exposed to plague-infected fleas from a prairie dog or rabbit, said Jennifer House, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment department. "We've had quite a number of cases this year [2014]," House said in a telephone interview. "We do believe the outbreak itself to be over."

Colorado has had 60 cases of all types of plague since 1957, and 9 people have died. 12 cases of plague have occurred in the past decade in the state. The state's investigation is ongoing, House said.

"While this is not a daily, weekly, or monthly occurrence, it isn't without precedence," said Jim Siedlecki, director of public information of Adams County, where the original victim lives, in a telephone interview. "A case of plague where fleas and prairie dogs are involved isn't earth shattering for Colorado."

[As compared to cats, dogs are not considered to be significant in the transmission of _Yersinia pestis_ to humans, as underscored by the following paper. Clearly, however, since this paper, cases from canine exposure have occurred.

Orloski KA, Eidson M: Yersinia pestis infection in three dogs. J Am Vet Med Assoc. 1995;207: 316-318

Abstract:
"_Yersinia pestis_ infection was diagnosed in 3 dogs. Clinical signs included lethargy (3 dogs), pyrexia (2 dogs), and a purulent skin lesion in the cervical region (2 dogs). _Yersinia pestis_ infection is a potentially fatal zoonotic disease of human beings. Human cases have resulted from contact with infected domestic cats; however, the risk of human infection from contact with infected domestic dogs is unknown. Dogs frequently are exposed to _Y. pestis_ in areas in which there are plague epizootics; however, clinical illness in dogs is rare. In the western United States, where _Yersinia pestis_ is endemic, plague should be considered in the differential diagnosis when examining dogs with nonspecific fever and lethargy." - Mod.LL
