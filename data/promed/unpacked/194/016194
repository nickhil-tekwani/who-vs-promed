Bird flu suspected in Denmark
-----------------------------
A flock of free-range chickens on a farm in south-western Denmark is
suspected of being infected with bird flu, the Danish Veterinary and
Food Administration said on Monday [22 Dec 2008].

"The suspicion arose following unexpected results in blood tests done
as part of routine checks for bird flu," the agency said in a
statement. The agency added that it had isolated the flock pending
further tests. Results would take a few days, it said.

[Since no clinical disease seems to have been observed, it is
unlikely that H5N1 or any HPAI virus is involved. In April 2008,
Denmark reported to the OIE the detection of low pathogenic avian
influenza (LPAI) virus (serotype H7) on a farm of waterbirds (geese,
ducks and mallards) in the south. In 2006, LPAI H5N2 was reported in
a hatchery for farmed game birds (mallards), ducks and geese) in
Funen.

H5 and H7 are OIE listed, even if of low pathogenicity.

Test results are expected.- Mod.AS]
