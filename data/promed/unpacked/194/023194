EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN PANAMA
(Date of last previously reported outbreak: 1995).
Emergency report
Translation of an e-mail received on 21 Sep 1998 from Dr E. Evans, National
Director of Animal Health, Ministry of Plant and Animal Production
Development, Panama City:
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 10 June 1998.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Location No. of outbreaks
Darien province, 36
in the south-eastern
part of the country
Total number of susceptible animals in the area:
------------------------------------------------
susceptible 4,530
cases ...
deaths 46
destroyed 0
slaughtered 0

Diagnosis:
----------
A. Background: on 10 Jun 1998, the official veterinary service examined a
one-year-old mixed-breed horse presenting nervous signs. The horse received
symptomatic treatment and subsequently recovered. On 13 Jun 1998, the
service received another report about two horses that were exhibiting
clinical signs of a neurological disorder. The appearance of sick horses
with similar signs in different areas gave cause for concern.
B. Clinical findings: the clinical signs are compatible with neuropathy.
The first animal observed presented a rigidity in the hindquarters. In the
second case, the equid was prostrate and sweating, with a temperature of
40'C. The same signs were present in the cases examined subsequently, along
with stiffness of the neck, grinding of teeth, abdominal respiration and
dyspnea. These animals died in a period of between three and ten days.
Death came when they fell down and became rigid. Ten equids were treated
with anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, antipyretics and
antibiotics. Eight of them recovered.
C. Laboratory studies and field observations: a sample taken from the brain
of a horse suspected of having rabies (for which test results proved
negative) was submitted to histopathological testing. Lesions compatible
with equine encephalomyelitis were found. Serum and whole blood samples
were taken from subsequent cases. Mouse inoculations and peripheral blood
smears were performed to rule out haematozoa. The serum samples were sent
to the Ministry of Health's Laboratorio Conmemorativo Gorgas to test for
antibodies against eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), western equine
encephalomyelitis and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis by means of
immunofluorescence. The tests detected the presence of EEE antibodies.
Three weeks later, samples were taken from some of these animals (paired
serum tests). They indicated a recent EEE infection.
Sanitary measures:
- The province of Darien was placed under quarantine.
- Epidemiological vigilance was stepped up in the affected area and in the
country as a whole, especially in those provinces where, in the past,
outbreaks of encephalomyelitis have taken place.
- The movement of equids in or out of the infected areas was prohibited.
- The vaccination of equids in the focal and perifocal area has begun.
