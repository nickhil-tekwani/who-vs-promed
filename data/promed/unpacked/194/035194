While much attention has been placed on the fight against the spread of
swine flu in Phuket, the island is still suffering from a chikungunya
outbreak and has the highest per capita infection rate of any province in
Thailand.

According to recently released figures from the Phuket Public Health Office
(PPHO), there have been 2155 confirmed cases of the disease in the province
in the 1st half of this year [2009] -- with no deaths. PPHO director Dr
Pongsawas Ratanasang said 98.6 per cent of the victims were Thai, with 31
cases reported among foreigners. Most of the foreign sufferers are low wage
Burmese [Myanmar] laborers, whose work and substandard living conditions
put them at risk of being bitten by the _Aedes_ mosquito that spreads the
virus that causes the disease.

Phuket had an overall incidence of 669 reported cases per 100 000 people
for the 1st half of 2009. The province thus ranks 1st in the country
although the number of cases remain much higher in the lower south, where
the outbreak originated. Dr Pongsawas also noted the high incidence rate
for Phuket is skewed by Phuket's huge unregistered population of migrant
workers, both from other parts of Thailand as well as Burma [Myanmar].

The incidence is calculated as the number of reported cases divided by the
registered population, which is less than half of the actual number of
people on the island according to most estimates. However, chikungunya
cases often go unreported as many sufferers do not seek medical attention
from hospitals, but from private clinics or simply by treating themselves
with non-prescription drugs.

In a breakdown by district, Thalang had the highest incidence overall,
followed by Kathu and Muang Districts. Within Thalang, tambon Srisoonthorn
had the highest incidence in June [2009] followed by Thepkrasattri, Pa
Khlok, Cherng Talay, and Sakoo. [A tambon is a local government unit below
district (amphoe) and province (changwat) levels. - Mod.TY]

A statistical breakdown by month reveals the outbreak has gotten much worse
in the province in recent months. In March and April [2009], the incidence
was less than 2 cases per 100 000, but jumped dramatically in May (297/100
000) and again in June (1352/100 000).

The PPHO has adopted a "blitz" campaign in its efforts to rid the island of
the disease using a variety of measures including disease control and
prevention units at both district and tambon levels.

The units are tasked with collecting statistical data to track the spread
of the outbreak, organizing preventative measures such as spraying mosquito
breeding sites, and raising public awareness about how to avoid mosquito
bites. They also advise people about what steps to take if they do contract
the disease.
