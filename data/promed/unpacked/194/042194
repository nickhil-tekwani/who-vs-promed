Serum samples collected in early March from four suspected dengue patients
from the Cook Islands were forwarded to the WHO Collaborating Centre for
Arbovirus Reference and Research, Queensland Health for investigation.
Recent dengue 2 virus infection was confirmed by PCR in one of the four
patients. He had recently travelled to Fiji. No evidence of recent dengue
virus infection was detected in specimens (2 paired, 1 single) from the
remaining three suspected cases.
