The death toll mounts after the massive food poisoning, including those from Mahambo Fenerive East who were victims last week [17-23 Oct 2016].

The final toll released by the gendarmerie reported 5 dead and 22 people admitted to hospital. 3 infants aged 4, 7, and 15 months respectively were the first to die after the intoxication. According to the doctor's explanation breastfeeding would have been fatal. Their mothers have, however, survived.

After these 3 deaths, another 2 people, including a boy of 2 and a young man of 18, have died.

A sea turtle weighing nearly 25 kilos, caught by a fisherman on [Mon 17 Oct 2016] is the origin of this massive poisoning. Having brought (the turtle) home, the fisherman sold the remaining meat in the market.

A source from the regional fishing service for the Analanjirofo region, said marine animals such as sardines and some species of turtles feed on highly toxic marine algae in the warm season, as is this time of the year. These reptiles are immune to toxins in plants, however, their consumption may be deadly to humans.

The 22 people hospitalized are out of danger.

[Sea turtle products are common food items form many communities worldwide. There are health hazards associated with their consumption, as meat and eggs can be infected by bacteria, parasites, bio-toxins, and pollutants. Human fatalities and illness have been hypothesized as resulting from the consumption of sea turtles throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including Madagascar. How individual turtles become poisonous is not clear. It is generally believed that one or perhaps multiple toxins originate in the invertebrate or algal food species of the turtles. Lyngbyatoxin A was isolated from the meat of a green turtle that caused a fatality in Madagascar. This toxin probably originated from a cyanobacterium in the genus _Lyngbya_ that was ingested by the grazing turtle.
