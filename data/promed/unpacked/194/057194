ProMED-mail readers can find an interesting article titled 'Infections and
atherosclerosis: new clues from an old hypothesis' in the November 15, 1998
issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology (Nieto J., AJE, 1998, Vol.
148, No. 10, 937-948).
The article comprehensively reviews the century-old history of
investigation into a possible role of infections in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and gives an update on ongoing laboratory, epidemiologic
and pathology studies. Although atherosclerosis is not an emerging disease
as such, this review has important bearing and implications for current
initiatives to more fully appreciate and understand possible infectious
origins of this and other chronic diseases.
The major finding of this review is that current animal models of
experimental atherosclerosis with _C. pneumoniae_ or CMV are nothing but a
replicate of earlier experiments conducted in the late Nineteenth and early
Twentieth century that successfully induced experimental atherosclerosis in
rabbits and mice after injection with streptococcus or salmonella.
Furthermore, the author suggests that the introduction of antibiotics in
the 1940's and 1950's may have had an influence on the decline of CHD
mortality in the last third of this century. He proposes that
investigation in this area needs to be extended beyond the current research
focusing on _C. pneumoniae_, CMV, and _H. pylori_.
