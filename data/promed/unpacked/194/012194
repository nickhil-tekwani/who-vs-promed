Rabies ravages rare wolves
--------------------------
The most endangered member of the dog family in the world, the
Ethiopian wolf, is fighting an outbreak of rabies that has killed 30
animals already. The global environment campaign, WWF, says this
latest outbreak could put at risk the wolves' survival in the remote
mountains of southeastern Ethiopia.
Conservationists are trying to isolate affected animals and vaccinate
them. But the wolves face a longer-term threat: conflict with
settlers moving into the national park where they live.
The wolves in the area affected by rabies, the Bale Mountains
national park, number about 300 animals, more than half the global
population.
At least 30 wolves have died since the outbreak began 2 months ago.
The last outbreak, in 1991 and 1992, killed more than 2/3 of the
park's wolves. WWF is appealing for money to expand the vaccination
programme, carried out by the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme
(EWCP), which also vaccinates and sterilises dogs brought into the
park by settlers. Apart from spreading rabies and other diseases, the
domestic dogs sometimes mate with the wolves, eroding their genetic
distinctiveness.
The EWCP receives its core financial support from the Born Free
Foundation, with additional funding from the Frankfurt Zoological
Society, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and other donors.
Dr Claudio Sillero, of Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation
Research Unit (WildCRU), is an adviser to the programme. He told BBC
News Online: "The vaccination of the wolves began only about 10 days
ago -- vaccinating wild canids has been very controversial, because
people thought the deaths of African wild dogs in the Serengeti some
years ago had been caused by vaccinations. The programme has
vaccinated 15 wolves so far, going just beyond the edge of the
epidemic. They're going about 5 km (3 miles) beyond the last known
dead wolf."
The settlers use the park for grazing their sheep and goats, which
may then compete for resources with the rodent species, which are the
wolves' main prey. The vaccination programme has treated about 80
percent of the domestic dogs in the area. It is often accepted by
local people because of its help in limiting human health risks and
livestock losses from rabies.
Some of the settlers are long-established, having moved into the area
before it was declared a national park 30 years ago. Others moved
there in 1991 after the fall of the Mengistu government, and a third
group migrates into the park seasonally, though some individuals stay
for good.
Settlers sometimes kill the wolves (known also as simian jackals) in
the belief the animals are a threat to them and their livestock. WWF
is working with the Ethiopian Government on a regional resettlement
plan to move some of the settlers out of the park.

[10 additional reported cases since the previous posting; hopefully,
the oral vaccination program, now operational, will help. See
