Investigations into the rapid spread of glanders, a fatal disease affecting equidae, have resulted in panic sales of horses by stud farm owners across Gujarat.

So far, 44 positive cases have been reported in Gujarat, and 33 equines have been "put to sleep (culled)" since outbreak of the disease was detected in January this year [2016], said Bhagirath Patel, deputy director of animal husbandry, Jamnagar.

Veterinary officers said Saurashtra horse owners panicked when they were told that their animals could be infected with _Burkholderia mallei_, the bacteria that cause glanders, and resorted to selling their horses to prevent loss.

The disease is characterised by serial development of ulcerating nodules that are most commonly found in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and skin.

"More than 33 equines have been put to sleep. We have collected samples of all the equines (horses, donkeys and related animals) kept in a 5-km radius of Jamnagar city. Samples of 50 per cent of randomly selected animals in Jamnagar taluka have also been collected and sent to the National Research Centre on Equines in Hissar, Haryana for testing," said Patel. Veterinary officers have issued a notification banning the sale and transportation of equines.

The outbreak of glanders was reported when cases came to light at Chiyada village in Bavla taluka of Ahmedabad. According to veterinarians, some donkeys bought to Chiyada as beasts of burden for brick kilns suffered from glanders, and from there the disease started to spread.

Since then, cases have been reported from Kheda, Banaskantha and Patan in north and central Gujarat and Bhavnagar, Jamnagar and Gir Somnath districts of Saurashtra.

"As soon as owners come to know that their horses have been affected by glanders bacteria and will have either to be put to sleep or shall die of the disease, they swiftly sell the animals to less experienced people to reduce their loss. Depending on its breed and health, a horse can fetch a price from Rs 60 000 to 250 000 [USD 894-3725]. Compared to this, the state government compensation for culling a horse is Rs 25 000 [USD 372] only. Therefore, they try to reduce their losses by selling their horse at some discount," Ramesh Vala, deputy director of animal husbandry in Botad district said.

"Soon after reports of 4 horses in Palitana town came positive for glanders and owners came to know of it, they started selling their animals. One of them was sold in Amreli district. We had no option but to trace that horse to Amreli and euthanise it there. A few weeks after that, reports of 3 more horses in Palitana came positive, and the owner managed to sell and transport one of them to Jamna gar. That horse had to be put to sleep in Jamnagar," said Reva Mali, in-charge deputy director of animal husbandry of Bhavnagar district.

The transportation of the male horse from Palitana apparently brought the infection to Jamnagar and took the life of another equine. The male horse in question was purchased by one Hanif Rabia, a resident of Nageshwar area of Jamnagar. Weeks later, veterinary officers told Rabia that reports of his 2 male horses had come positive and that they will have to be put to sleep. Accordingly, both of them were culled last Saturday.

Ghanchi, however, claimed that he thought the horse was alright. "Veterinarians came to my home 3 months ago and took samples of my horses. They asked me to quarantine the white male. I did so accordingly, and nobody came back to me to convey the result for almost one-and-half-months. Then I thought the horse was healthy and, therefore, sold it to Rabia for Rs 50,000 [745]," said Ghanchi.

A similar case also was reported from Veraval in Gir Somnath. After veterinarians took blood samples of his 3 horses for the 2nd time, saying they could be affected by glanders, Kishor Gareja sold one of them in Palitana. Rajsi Solanki, deputy director of animal husbandry of Gir Somnath, said the horse subsequently died in Palitana. The remaining 2 horses were euthanised after their results came back positive.

However, Gareja contended that his animals were healthy. "They were healthy, but the officers said their blood was infected, and therefore they needed to be killed. The one I sold to Palitana was a weak male, and despite feeding it well, it did not become sturdy. Therefore, I sold it," Gareja told The Indian Express.

In Bhavnagar, 10 positive cases have been reported. Authorities have culled 7 while 2 have died due to the disease. Two each have been put to sleep in Jamnagar and Gir Somnath, while one had been euthanised in Amreli.

[During the years 2010-2015, India reported to the OIE a total of 12 outbreaks of glanders in equidae. The most recent outbreaks were reported in late 2015 in Jammu & Kashmir: October 2015 (1 case), November 2015 (4 cases) and December 2015 (5 cases). All the said 10 cases reportedly died, none destroyed.

The following summarised review, updated 2015, is derived (references omitted) from OIE Manual of Terrestrial Animal Diseases (chapter 2.5.11):

"Glanders is a bacterial disease of perissodactyls or odd-toed ungulates. It has zoonotic potential and has been known since ancient times. It is caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ (previously known as _Pseudomonas mallei_) and has been classified in the past as Pfeifferella, Loefflerella, Malleomyces or Actinobacillus. It is a serious contagious disease in equids, and outbreaks may also occur in felids living in the wild or in zoological gardens. Susceptibility to glanders has been proved in camels, bears, wolves and dogs. Carnivores may become infected by eating infected meat, but cattle and pigs are resistant. Small ruminants may be infected if kept in close contact with glanderous horses.

Glanders generally takes an acute form in donkeys and mules with high fever and respiratory signs (swollen nostrils, dyspnoea, and pneumonia), and death occurs within a few days. In horses, glanders generally takes a more chronic course, and horses may survive for several years. Chronic and subclinical 'occult' cases are potential sources of infection due to the permanent or intermittent shedding of bacteria.

In horses, inflammatory pustules and ulcers develop in the nasal conchae and nasal septae, which give rise to a sticky yellow discharge, accompanied by enlarged firm submaxillary lymph nodes. Stellate scarring follows upon healing of the ulcers. The formation of reddish nodular abscesses with a central grey necrotic zone in the lungs is accompanied by progressive debility, febrile episodes, coughing and dyspnoea. Diarrhoea and polyuria can also occur. In the skin form ('farcy'), the lymphatics are enlarged, and 0.5-2.5 cm sized nodular abscesses ('buds') develop, which ulcerate and discharge yellow oily pus. Dry ulcers may also develop. Pyogranulomatous nodules are sometimes found in the liver and spleen. Discharges from the respiratory tract and skin are infective, and transmission between animals, which is facilitated by close contact, inhalation, ingestion of contaminated material (e.g. from infected feed and water troughs), or by inoculation (e.g. via a harness) is common. The incubation period can range from a few days to many months.

Glanders is transmissible to humans by direct contact with diseased animals or with infected or contaminated material. In the untreated acute disease, the mortality rate can reach 95 percent within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies. A chronic form with abscessation can occur.

When handling suspect or known infected animals or fomites, stringent precautions must be taken to prevent self-infection or transmission of the bacterium. Laboratory samples must be securely packaged, kept cool (not frozen) and shipped [in accordance to guidelines included in Chapter 1.1.3 Transport of Specimens of Animal Origin]. All manipulations with potentially infected/contaminated material must be performed at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis.

Glanders has been eradicated from many countries by statutory testing, culling of infected animals, and import restrictions. It persists in numerous Asian, African and South American countries and can be considered a reemerging disease. Glanders can be introduced into glanders-free areas by movement of equids."

Glanders has last been included among the zoonotic diseases reported by India to the OIE in 2007. It will be helpful to obtain annual statistics on human infection with _Burkholderia mallei_ in India during recent years. - Mod.AS
