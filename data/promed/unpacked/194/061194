Even though the winter is not the season for enterovirus infections,
according to surveillance from the Centers for Disease Control, 7 cases of
enterovirus infections with complications were reported in December 2008.
Six of the cases were caused by enterovirus-71. There have been 2 cases
reported so far in 2009. The etiology of these infections is still pending.

The Centers for Disease Control are concerned about the future trend of the
disease. They urge parents of infants or young children and educational
institutions to practise good hygiene for themselves, their infants and
young children, and students to decrease the chance of enterovirus
infection [transmission] and to avoid development of complications.

Children under the age of 3 are especially at risk because of their weaker
immunity. When children are diagnosed with enterovirus infections, parents
should look for prodromal complications, such as drowsiness, consciousness
changes, decreased activity, weakness of limbs, myoclonic jerks, continued
vomiting, prolonged fever, anxiety, neck stiffness, paralysis of limbs,
tachypnes or tachycardia. If any of these symptoms are present, please seek
help immediately. Doctors are also urged to refer children with these
symptoms to hospitals.

[Enteroviruses are small RNA-containing viruses that include the
polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and other enteroviruses. In
addition to the 3 different polioviruses, there are at late 62 non-polio
enteroviruses that can cause disease in humans: 23 Coxsackie A viruses, 6
Coxsackie B viruses, 28 echoviruses, and 5 other enteroviruses. Enterovirus
71 infection has been a cause for concern in Taiwan (see ProMED-mail
archive references below) and other countries in South East Asia for
several years, in particular because of its association with more severe
forms of hand, foot and mouth disease in children.

According to Wang SM and colleagues (Pediatr Neonatol 2008 Aug; 49(4):
113-5), "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a significant cause of
brainstem encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis in Taiwan. It may be
complicated by autonomic nervous system dysregulation and pulmonary edema
(PE). Cytokines in the central nervous system and systemic inflammatory
responses play important roles in the pathogenesis of EV71-associated PE.
Pathogenesis-based management with intravenous immunoglobulin and milrinone
has been associated with reduced mortality in children with severe EV71
infections."

LY Chang has recently reviewed enterovirus infection in Taiwan (Pediatr
Neonatol 2008 Aug; 49(4):103-12): "The enterovirus 71 (EV71) outbreak in
Taiwan in 1998 proved fatal in many children. A seroepidemiological study
performed prior to the 1998 outbreak showed pre-epidemic (1997) EV71
seroprevalence rates to be about 60-70 per cent in adults and children
older than 6 years of age. A retrospective case review carried out from
1980-81 identified 16 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease associated with
central nervous system involvement, 2 of whom died soon after
hospitalization. There were 405 severe cases and 78 deaths reported in the
1998 epidemic, and dozens of fatal EV71 cases were still reported from 2000
to 2002. A stage-based management strategy was developed to reduce
fatality, but most survivors of brainstem encephalitis with cardiopulmonary
failure have neurologic sequelae and impaired cognition. Continuous
clinical and laboratory surveillance of EV71 disease is required to enable
earlier implementation of control and prevention measures. Development of
EV71-specific antiviral therapy, a novel class of imidazolidinones, and
development of a vaccine are ongoing."
