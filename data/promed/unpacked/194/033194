The UK Minister of Agriculture said today on radio "It is NOT true that we
are running behind the disease." A legal challenge (request for a judicial
review) is being launched to MAFF's "mass cull" (ring depopulation)
strategy. The army has started burying thousands of sheep in a mass grave
on a disused airfield in Cumbria.
