Clarification of a statement in the press attributed to Dr. Peter Horby
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In reference to the Reuters report posted on ProMED-mail on Sat 12
Mar 2005 [see part [1] of Avian influenza, human - East Asia (47):
Viet Nam 20050312.0733] under the heading "Viet Nam: Symptom-free
Avian Influenza [Virus Infections] Pose No Risk," in which I am
quoted, I would like to clarify the context of the comments, which
have been misinterpreted by the reporter as implying that I believe
that asymptomatic cases pose "no risk."
The comment, "There is no evidence that asymptomatic infection like
this poses any significant risk of onward transmission," was
specifically referring to previous experience with H5N1 in Hong Kong
in 1997, where there was no evidence of onward transmission from
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic H5N1 cases.
Our office has advised that these asymptomatic cases should be
isolated, or placed under home quarantine, and treated with
Oseltamivir, and, that an active search for evidence of
asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic infections be conducted in a wider
circle of contacts to ascertain the extent of any possible human to
human transmission and of asymptomatic infection.
