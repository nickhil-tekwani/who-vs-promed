Turkey has been hit by a new anthrax outbreak in the southeast, as a district in Turkey's southeastern province of Bitlis has been quarantined after 81 cows died over a week because of anthrax, Cumhuriyet newspaper said on Thursday [6 Sep 2018], citing a Milli Gazete [Turkish newspaper] report. All cattle in the Gunkiri district in Bitlis have been vaccinated, and local authorities have said the animals in surrounding areas will also be vaccinated as a precaution against an outbreak. Security forces have been checking cattle entering and leaving the district, and sales of meat and dairy products have been banned.

Dozens were taken to hospital on Saturday [1 Sep 2018] over suspicions of anthrax in Istanbul, after anthrax was detected in Turkey's capital of Ankara and eastern province of Sivas among cattle imported from Brazil. The Turkish Animal Rights Federation on Thursday [6 Sep 2018] claimed that a Panama-flagged ship allegedly carrying anthrax-infected animals has been waiting at the southern entrance of Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait. "We also received reports that animals dying of anthrax were thrown into Marmara Sea," the animal rights group said on Twitter.

Ali Seker, a deputy of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), has filed a parliamentary question asking the Minister of Agriculture to inform the public about the ship, which he said had been waiting at Istanbul's Ahirkapi anchor point for 20 days and carried cattle bought from Brazil, Cumhuriyet reported on Thursday [6 Sep 2018].

Meanwhile, reports of anthrax outbreaks in different parts of Turkey have created panic and outcry on social media. "Help! Doesn't this country have willpower? We are being poisoned," Gokhan Ozoguz, the singer of the famous Turkish band Athena said on Twitter on Thursday [6 Sep 2018]. "Not just anyone would be able to add the fear of contracting anthrax when we eat meatballs for lunch to all our other day-to-day worries. I'd like to congratulate all those involved," another Twitter user said.

Binali Yildirim, Turkey's former Prime Minister and Parliamentary Spokesperson in office, asked the Minister of Health to taste the meat first during a reception in Turkish Parliament on Wednesday [5 Sep 2018], Diken news site reported. Yet pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak on Tuesday [4 Sep 2018] said that some domestic producers, which it labeled as "meat barons," were using the reports of anthrax outbreaks to manipulate the market and increase prices.

Anthrax is enzootic in eastern Turkey and a constant problem, so I am puzzled as to why this outbreak in Bitlis got away from them. Getting all the district cattle promptly vaccinated after the event will slow down new cases. It is hoped that authorities are getting on with vaccinating the cattle in the surrounding districts as well because with 81 sick and dead cows to feed on, the Gunkiri tabanid female flies will be ranging outward to snack with their mouthparts already contaminated on cattle and even the occasional human. - Mod.MHJ
