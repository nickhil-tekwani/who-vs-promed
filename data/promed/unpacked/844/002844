MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay: Thousands of soldiers, police and veterinary
inspectors fanned out across western Uruguay to cordon off farms in an
effort to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The measures
came after the discovery of 56 more outbreaks.
Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Gonzalo Gonzalez warned "many
more new outbreaks could be discovered" before the epidemic is brought
under control. Most of the new outbreaks have been discovered in areas
along the border with Argentina, which itself has been fighting an FMD
epidemic.
The government quarantined affected farms, erected roadblocks in rural
areas, and is spraying passing vehicles with a disinfectant. Under pressure
from outraged farmers, authorities opted to launch a massive livestock
vaccination campaign, which is expected to cost Uruguay 30 million dollars
over 4 years. A total of 10.5 million head of cattle are expected to be
vaccinated in the course of the drive.
The epidemic has already dealt a heavy blow to Uruguay's cattle and
meatpacking industries and was expected to do even more damage. As many as
5000 workers have been laid off by companies producing and maintaining
industrial refrigerators, while 1500 others have been forced to take leave
from their jobs.
Uruguay, which annually exports 150 million dollars worth of meat products
to North America, Japan, and Russia, could lose lucrative export contracts.
Last year, Uruguay exported 370 million dollars worth of beef and 110
million dollars worth of lamb and pork.
