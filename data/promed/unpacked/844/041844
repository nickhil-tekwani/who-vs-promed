Abstract
--------
Background. Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) is a newly discovered tick-borne virus that can cause disease in humans. This virus has been authenticated as being extremely widespread worldwide and as posing a significant threat to public health and safety.

Methods. We collected 35 ticks belonging to 2 tick species from wild boars in Nanping, Fujian Province, China. JMTV-specific genes were amplified by qRT-PCR and nested PCR to confirm the presence of this pathogen.

Results. More than 1/3 of all ticks collected (11/35) were positive for JMTV. Viral sequences were obtained from 3 of the JMTV-positive ticks, including the complete genomic sequence from one tick. This was the 1st time that JMTV was identified in the hard-bodied tick _Amblyomma testudinarium_. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that JMTV from Fujian Province shared > 90% identity with other isolates derived from China, but was distinct from those reported in France and Cambodia.

Conclusions. JMTV is characterized by relatively low mutations and has its own local adaptive characteristics in different regions. Our findings provide molecular evidence of the presence of JMTV in an overlooked tick species from an area not unrecognized as being endemic. They also suggest that JMTV occupies a wider geographical distribution than currently believed and is a potential disease vector.

[Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) was initially detected in _Rhipicephalus microplus_ ticks in the Jingmen region of Hubei province in China, and its global distribution has been subsequently described. Reports have described closely related virus genomes in ticks and cattle from Brazil (Mogiana tick virus, MGTV) and Uganda, and in ticks from China. A similar virus, Manych virus, was found in Russia (see Manych virus - Russia: (RO) 20210911.8661849i). JMTV is in the Jingmen virus group in the family Flaviviridae. JMTV is a human pathogen in China, where the virus was detected in skin biopsies and blood as well as detached ticks from individuals with local and systemic symptoms that could be severe. Since its initial identification in ticks in 2010, evidence of JMTV infection has been detected in cattle, rodents, and primates. The occurrence and range of symptoms in human and animal infections are yet to be determined and merit further investigation. - Mod.TY
