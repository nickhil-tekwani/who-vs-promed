Lumpy skin disease in Israel
----------------------------
The last outbreak of lumpy skin disease in Israel was reported to the Office
International des Epizooties in September 1989.
Information received on (and dated) 26 Jun 2006 from Dr Moshe Chaimovitz,
director of veterinary and animal health services, Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development, Beit-Dagan:
Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease or
infection in a country or zone/compartment following a report declaring the
outbreak(s) ended.
Identification of agent: lumpy skin disease virus.
Date of start of the event: 20 Jun 2006.
An outbreak of lumpy skin disease has been reported in a farm at En Zurim in
Hadarom province. There were 30 cases (dairy cows). The affected farm (295
milking cows, 175 fattening bulls and 135 female calves) is a closed unit
into which no new animals are introduced.
The diagnosis was made by the Kimron Veterinary Institute using
histopathological examination, electron microscopy and PCR.
Control measures undertaken:
control of arthropods;
modified stamping out;
quarantine in a 3 km radius zone around the outbreak;
movement restrictions in a 3 km radius zone around the outbreak;
screening in a 10 km radius zone around the outbreak;
ring vaccination in a 3 km radius zone around the outbreak (4000 animals
vaccinated with live attenuated sheep pox vaccine RM65); dipping/spraying.
The Israeli veterinary services have taken steps to prevent the spread of
the disease. So far, no new outbreaks have been observed.

[There are scattered reports of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in the Middle East
- Oman in 1984; Bahrain in 1993 and 2002-2003; Kuwait in 1991, and UAE in
2000. But the disease is regularly reported throughout Africa including
Egypt in 2006 and 1990; regularly from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan
in 2003. LSD is also commonly reported from other parts of Africa.
I'll repeat a short description of LSD that I provided in a previous posting
on LSD in Egypt in April 2006. A quick summary of LSD can be found in USDA's
Foreign Animal Disease "Gray Book" at
<http://www.vet.uga.edu/VPP/gray_book/FAD/LSD.htm>.
The disease is characterized by fever and the formation of nodules 1-7 cm in
size in the skin which eventually become necrotic. The skin of the muzzle,
nares, back, legs, scrotum, perineum, eyelids, lower ear, nasal and oral
mucosa, and tail are particularly likely to be affected. Biting insects play
a major role, and transmission increases in the rainy season. Morbidity can
range from 3 to 85 per cent and mortality is usually low, although some
high-mortality outbreaks have been documented. The disease occurs over much
of sub-Saharan Africa with previous outbreaks also in Kuwait, Egypt, and
Israel in the late 1980s. - Mod.PC]
