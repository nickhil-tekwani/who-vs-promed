AVIAN INFLUENZA TEST RESULT ON POULTRY
---------------------------------------
The State Veterinary Service has today been investigating a case of
suspected avian notifiable disease on a poultry farm near Lowestoft in
Suffolk. [Map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map//map/browse.cgi?lat=52.4812&lon=1.7534&scale=1000000&icon=x>www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=52.4812&lon=1.7534&scale=1000000&icon=x>.

Preliminary tests have this evening indicated that the avian influenza
virus is present in samples from poultry found dead on the premises.
These preliminary results show that it is the H5 strain of the virus but
further confirmatory tests are in progress to identify the strain more
fully, and more will be known tomorrow.[3 Feb 2007].
The affected premises were put under restriction on Thursday (1 Feb 2007)
evening and the appropriate contingency plan has been put into effect.
When the additional laboratory results are known further action will be
taken and all available information will be provided.
Notes to editors
1. Avian Influenza is a disease of birds and whilst it can pass very rarely
and with difficulty to humans, this requires extremely close contact with
infected birds, particularly faeces. At this stage there is no definite
confirmation that this is a virus that has human health implications. As a
precautionary measure those who might have been exposed would be offered
the appropriate treatment and protection in line with established
protocols. Advice from the Food Standards Agency remains that properly
cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.
2. All avian influenzas (H1 to H16) can be low pathogenic but only H5 and
H7 are known to become highly pathogenic.
3. Targeted surveillance for high pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza and other
avian influenza viruses in wild birds is in place throughout the UK and is
ongoing. If you find dead wild gulls, waders, ducks, geese or swans and you
are within a survey area or are unsure whether you are in a surveillance
area you may wish to contact the Defra Helpline (08459 33 55 77) and choose
the Avian Influenza option or visit the Defra website:

[A swan, found to be infected with HPAI H5N1, was detected in early April
2006 in Cellardyke, Fife, Scotland; see map at
<<http://www.multimap.com/map//map/browse.cgi?lat=56.2276&lon=-2.6827&scale=10000000&icon=x>www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=56.2276&lon=-2.6827&scale=10000000&icon=x>.
Too early for clear-cut conclusions; however,in view of the fact that both
cases have taken place on UK's eastern coasts, one is inclined to wonder
if this is a mere coincidence or indicative of the wild-bird origin of the
current outbreak. - Mod. AS].
