Genome analysis of Al-Ahsa MERS-CoV case cluster
------------------------------------------------
Dr Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, minister of health, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA] is pleased to announce that researchers from the KSA and the United Kingdom have urgently examined the genetic characteristics of an outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In collaboration with scientists from University College London and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the KSA Ministry of Health examined the cluster of healthcare acquired MERS coronavirus infections and has rapidly sequenced the entire genomes of MERS-CoV viruses from an outbreak of MERS-CoV infections in Al-Ahsa, in the eastern province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The complete sequences from 4 patients are being released onto the GenBank database (GenBank Accession numbers KF186564-KF186567) as of today [Tue 11 Jun 2013].

[The rapid whole genome sequencing of several virus isolates from a localised site in a developing outbreak of a novel virus disease marks a new development in epidemiology. It is difficult at this stage to predict what this will achieve. The coronaviruses are not the simplest target for analysis, being RNA viruses with relatively large genomes (up to 25 kilobases) and a complex 'nested set' system of transcription of genetic information. It has been established already that MERS-CoV is a member of the betacoronavirus species, which also includes the agent responsible for the global SARS outbreak of 2002/3 and other virus from different species of bats and other animals. The sequences of the viruses from the Al-Ahsa site are now publicly available. - Mod.CP]
