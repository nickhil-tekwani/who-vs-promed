Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):
Health Canada -- Protection Branch - Laboratory Centre for Disease
In collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and the cruise ship line, Health Canada is investigating an outbreak of
cyclosporiasis aboard a cruise ship between March 29 and April 5, 1997.
All 62 Canadian passengers were [sent letters] to determine the number of
passengers who had experienced illness compatible with cyclosporiasis and to
facilitate diagnosis and appropriate treatment for those persons who might
still have been ill. As of June 17, ten persons had had a diarrheal illness
of whom 8 were defined as cases of cyclosporiasis. The cases were ill for an
average of 11 days (range 3-30 days) and four had sought attention from a
physician; none were hospitalized.
The Canadian data will be included in the overall analysis of this cruise
ship investigation. In addition CDC is conducting a case-control study to
determine the most likely cause for this outbreak. Clusters of
cyclosporiasis occurring in the United States this year have implicated
either raspberries from Guatemala or imported mesclun lettuce; both
items were served during the cruise.
