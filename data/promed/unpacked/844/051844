Regarding inactivation of infective agent:
See:
J. Infect.Dis (1982) 145:683-687 Brown, Rohwer, Green, Gajdusek
Effect of chemicals, heat, and histopathologic processing on high-
infectivity hamster-adapted scrapie virus.
Nature (1984) 308:658-662 Rohwer, R.G. Scrapie infectious agent is
virus-like in size and susceptibility to inactivation.
Science (1984) 223:600-602 Rohwer, R.G Virus like sensitivity of
the scrapie agent to heat inactivation.
J. Infect. Dis. (1986) 153:1145-1148 Newer data on the inactivation
of scrapie virus or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease virus in brain tissue.
These may add some insight into inactivation.

BSE, CJD and Brains as food.
I am reassured by Ralph Blanchfield's careful comments. On a working
visit to Turkey I used to enjoy pitta bread and sheep's brain soup as my
routine lunch at the local restaurant, and in Scotland I liked to eat
potted heid (jellied sheep's head) and other preparations from sheep's
heads, brains included - until European Union hygiene regulations (well,
that's what my butcher blames) made sheep's heads impossible to buy.

[- When I was a boy in north Oxfordshire, my mother regularly fed us broiled
sheeps' brains on toast. I later checked our family butcher's record books
for 1935-1944 and found that he had sold brains to everyone, farmers, nuns,
even the Duke of Blenheim ... Jake Brody had an idea that MS might be
related to sheep consumption and asked to look around. MH-J]
