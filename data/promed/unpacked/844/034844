Confirmation of case of Ebola virus disease in Uganda
-----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) have confirmed a case of Ebola virus disease in Uganda. Although there have been numerous previous alerts, this is the 1st confirmed case in Uganda during the Ebola outbreak on-going in neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The confirmed case is a 5-year-old child from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who travelled with his family on [9 Jun 2019]. The child and his family entered the country through Bwera Border post [Kasese district] and sought medical care at Kagando hospital where health workers identified Ebola as a possible cause of illness. The child was transferred to Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit [ETU] for management. The confirmation was made today [11 Jun 2019] by the Uganda Virus Institute (UVRI). The child is under care and receiving supportive treatment at Bwera ETU, and contacts are being monitored.

The Ministry of Health and WHO have dispatched a Rapid Response Team to Kasese to identify other people who may be at risk, and ensure they are monitored and provided with care if they also become ill. Uganda has previous experience managing Ebola outbreaks. In preparation for a possible imported case during the current outbreak in DRC, Uganda has vaccinated nearly 4700 health workers in 165 health facilities (including in the facility where the child is being cared for); disease monitoring has been intensified; and health workers trained on recognizing symptoms of the disease. Ebola Treatment Units are in place.

In response to this case, the Ministry is intensifying community education, psychosocial support and will undertake vaccination for those who have come into contact with the patient and at-risk health workers who were not previously vaccinated.

The Ministry of Health has taken the following actions to contain spread of the disease in the country:
- The District administration and local councils in the affected area have been directed to ensure that any person with Ebola signs and symptoms in the community is reported to the health workers immediately and provided with advice and testing.
- The Ministry of Health is setting up units in the affected district and at referral hospitals to handle cases if they occur.
- Social mobilization activities are being intensified and education materials are being disseminated.

There are no confirmed cases in any other parts of the country.

The Ministry is working with international partners coordinated by the World Health Organization.

The Ministry of Health appeals to the general public and health workers to work together closely, to be vigilant and support each other in helping anyone with symptoms to receive care quickly. The Ministry will continue to update the general public on progress and new developments.

The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Uganda has announced the presence of the 1st patient with Ebola virus disease in Uganda since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak in the Congo DR provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. This is a 5-year-old child who crossed the border with 5 family members on the evening of [Mon 10 Jun 2019].

The mother of the child is a woman of Congolese origin married to a Ugandan man and they reside in Kasese district in Uganda. She had traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo in May 2019 to take care of her father, who unfortunately died of Ebola on 27 May 2019 in Cantine-Aloya, in the health zone of Mabalako [North Kivu].

On [10 Jun 2019], 14 members of this family, 12 of whom were already symptomatic, arrived in Kasindi [North Kivu], a town on the border with Uganda. They were listed as contacts of a confirmed Ebola case who died on [27 May 2019] in Mabalako. They were detected by the teams of the National Border Health Program (PNHF) installed at Kasindi health checkpoint.

Recognizing the symptoms of Ebola, PNHF teams did not let the family pass and transferred the 12 symptomatic people to the transitional isolation center at Kasindi Hospital pending transfer to the Ebola Treatment Center [ETC] in Beni to take the samples. Of the 12 suspected cases, there were 7 children aged 7 months to 12 years.

On the evening of [10 Jun 2019], 6 members of this family left the Kasindi isolation center and crossed the border on foot through secondary tracks to avoid health checks. Congolese health authorities immediately notified the Ugandan authorities and provided them with the names and phone numbers of suspected cases. Ugandan health workers found the child and his family at Kagando Hospital in Uganda. The child and 5 other members of his family were then transferred and isolated to the Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit where the samples were taken. 8 Ugandan contacts have been listed and will be followed for 21 days.

The remaining 6 family members in Kasindi were transferred to the Beni Ebola Treatment Center on [Tue 11 Jun 2019], and their samples are being analyzed. A cross-border meeting between the Congolese and Ugandan health authorities is scheduled for [Wed 12 Jun 2019] in Kasese, Uganda, to discuss the possibility of repatriation of the family to the Democratic Republic of Congo to continue their treatment in Beni.

The DRC Ministry of Health thanks the Ugandan health authorities for this effective cross-border collaboration. As a reminder, from the beginning of the tenth Ebola outbreak in the DRC, the Ministry of Health is working in full transparency with the health authorities of neighboring countries to prevent the spread of the epidemic in the region. This collaboration takes the form of regular technical meetings, a permanent exchange of information on the evolution of the epidemic, as well as the sharing of identities of contacts of confirmed Ebola patients wishing to cross, or having crossed, the border.

A sanitary control system at the entry points of the DRC is organized by the PNHF in collaboration with the World Organization for Migration (IOM). It is this system that allows for the rapid detection of contacts of confirmed Ebola cases who are traveling and trying to cross borders to escape health control. On average, 20 to 25 000 passengers cross the border daily at the Kasindi port of entry. Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 65 million travelers have been checked at the various entry points and checkpoints set up.

[This is the 1st known case from the DRC North Kivu-Ituri outbreak to have been exported beyond the DRC's borders. A selection of the many news items about this event is included below, but the essential facts are all contained in the above communications from the Uganda Ministry of Health, WHO Africa, and DRC MOH. To quote from the Washington Post article [link below], "Uganda accepts refugees from Congo, and many health workers felt that despite their best efforts, spread of the virus to Uganda had just been a matter of time." Indeed, what is remarkable is how long it has taken for this 1st cross-border case to occur. Consider the numbers: 65 million travelers have passed through various checkpoints within and on the borders of the DRC, with 20-25 000 travelers daily (that is, 1000 per hour) at the Kasindi, DRC border town where this incursion took place.

As made abundantly clear in the DRC MOH communication, 12 out of 14 family members were already symptomatic and were appropriately recognized and isolated at the Kasindi Hospital on [10 Jun 2019] pending transfer back to the Beni, DRC ETC, but that night 6 family members escaped the Kasindi holding unit, surreptitiously crossed the Ugandan border, and were found the next day at the Kagando Hospital in Kasese, Uganda. These 6 family members were then transferred to the Bweri ETU (Ebola Treatment Unit), just over the border from Kasindi, whereas the other 6 family members have been transferred to the Beni ETC as originally planned. As reported by the Associated Press [Daily Mail link below], the 1st confirmed case in the family, a 5-year-old boy, has since died, and Ebola has been confirmed in 2 more family members. It is extremely likely that additional cases from this family, in both Bweri and Beni, will be confirmed and prove fatal. 8 Ugandan contacts have been identified and are under observation, which may include health care workers as well as individuals who may have assisted family members in traveling overnight from the border to Kasese, about 60 km [about 37 mi] away.

It is not clear thus far whether the index case in this family cluster, the grandfather who died on [27 May 2019] in Cantine-Aloya, Mabalako, died in the ETU there. Regardless, it seems highly likely that the family members knew that the grandfather died of Ebola, and that therefore they had acquired Ebola once they became ill in the 1 to 2 weeks after his death, and yet they chose not to seek local medical care and instead evaded both border control and health care workers in attempting to reach Uganda despite being seriously ill. These are the same noncompliant and evasive behaviors that have bedeviled Congolese efforts to control the epidemic within its own affected provinces.

Uganda is very well-prepared to handle this and other potential incursions of the DRC outbreak into Uganda. As reported above, 4700 health workers in 165 health facilities have been vaccinated (this compares to about 30 000 front-line providers who have been vaccinated in DRC). Uganda has experienced its own Ebola outbreaks before, including the largest outbreak prior to the 2014 West African epidemic, and provided many experts to the WHO Ebola control effort in the latter epidemic. Of note, prior "endemic" outbreaks in Uganda have been caused by strains other than the Ebola-Zaire strain currently involved in the DRC outbreak, so that it should be straightforward to track cases that emerge whether inside or outside of known contact cohorts.
