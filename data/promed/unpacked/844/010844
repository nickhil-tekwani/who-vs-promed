Rift Valley fever (RVF) confirmed in South Africa
Over the weekend of 24-25 January [1999 6/50 pregnant buffalo cows in
holding pens at Skukuza camp in the Kruger National Park (approximate
coordinates 24o59'S, 31o36'E), were observed to abort, and shortly
thereafter an adult giraffe was found dead about 15 km south of
Skukuza without obvious signs of being killed by a predator. A further
two giraffe deaths were reported in an adjoining game reserve about 15
km west of Skukuza, and a waterbuck death in yet another game reserve
100 km north-west of Skukuza. Three veterinary staff members in the
Kruger Park developed benign febrile illness after coming into contact
with the tissues of the diseased animals. Lesions characteristic of
Rift Valley fever, and positive immunohistochemical staining, were
observed in tissue samples of two buffalo fetuses at the Faculty of
Veterinary Science of the University of Pretoria, and positive PCR
reactions and virus isolations were recorded at the ARC Onderstepoort
Veterinary Institute and at the National Institute for Virology in
Johannesburg (= WHO Collaborating Centre for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers
and Arboviruses) from tissues of all six aborted buffalo fetuses, one
giraffe and the waterbuck, plus the serum of one veterinarian.
Deaths have been reported to be occurring in goat kids outside the
Kruger National Park, about 15 km north-west of Skukuza, but no
laboratory investigations have yet been conducted.
The Kruger National Park and adjoining game reserves are situated in
the so-called lowveld region (altitude generally below 600 m), and
west of this there is the escarpment above which the important
livestock farming areas lie on the inland plateau of South Africa.
RVF occurs in the country at irregular intervals of many years when
particularly heavy rains favour the occurrence of population
explosions of the floodwater-breeding aedine mosquito vectors of the
virus. The last big outbreaks occurred on the inland plateau during
the heavy rains of 1974-76, and a small outbreak on the coast of
northern KwaZulu-Natal Province in 1981 -- since when the disease has
not been diagnosed in South Africa.
The comparatively heavy rains of recent years have been followed by
good rains in parts of the country again this year, and satellite
images suggest that suitable conditions for the occurrence of Rift
Valley fever exist widely over the eastern half of the country. Past
outbreaks in South Africa have tended to start in February after
mosquito populations and virus circulation have built up during the
early part of the wet season, are at their peak in March and April,
and decline sharply after the first frosts in May suppress mosquito
activity.
It remains to be seen whether the present outbreak extends
to the inland plateau, but meantime farmers are being encouraged to
vaccinate livestock, and information is being disseminated on public
health precautions to be taken by those involved in the livestock
industry.
Human infections in southern Africa result mainly from contact
with infected tissues of livestock, and rarely seem to be associated
directly with mosquito bite. Consequently, there is little or no
perceived risk to the public at large, or specifically to visitors to
national parks and other game reserves. Neverthelss, mosquito control
measures have been increased in tourist locations.
