2 New York City residents diagnosed with LGV
------------------------------------------------
Health officials announced today, 2 Feb 2005, that 2 New Yorkers have been
diagnosed with a rare form of Chlamydia known as lymphogranuloma venereum,
or LGV. In the past few decades, LGV has been uncommon in industrialized
nations, although several cases have recently been found in the Netherlands
and the United Kingdom. To date, CDC -- which is coordinating a national
investigation -- has confirmed 6 recent cases in the USA, including the 2
announced today, and cases in San Francisco (3) and Atlanta (1). CDC is
also investigating other potential cases. The illness appears to have
primarily affected gay and bisexual men.
Among cases identified thus far, most have also had HIV/AIDS infection.
Most people infected report having multiple sex partners and engaging in
unprotected anal intercourse and other high-risk practices. Symptoms of LGV
include painful, bloody rectal infection that may be confused with
inflammatory bowel disease. Genital ulcers can occur, as can painful,
draining lymph nodes in the groin area. If identified early, LGV can be
treated with antimicrobial agents. Untreated LGV can cause permanent damage
to the bowels and disfigurement of the genitals (elephantiasis). LGV can
also fuel the spread of HIV/AIDS.
At a press conference in lower Manhattan, Health Commissioner Thomas R.
Frieden said, "LGV is a serious condition and its emergence in New York
City reflects continuing high levels of unsafe sexual activity among men
who have sex with men. Medical providers who care for gay and bisexual men
should be alert for symptoms of LGV. It is also critical for gay and
bisexual men to minimize risky sexual behaviors and practice safer sex --
including limiting the number of sex partners and using condoms every time
you have sex -- to help prevent the spread of this illness and HIV/AIDS.
Unprotected anal intercourse, in particular, is extremely risky in terms of
spread of LGV as well as HIV."
Information about lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in NYC
-------------------------------------------------
LGV can cause acute illness and, while it can be treated, it can lead to
life-long disability and disfigurement and fuel the spread of HIV/AIDS.
Symptoms include genital lesions or painful draining lymph nodes in the
groin area, pain in the rectum and bloody diarrhea. Infection is slow to
heal and can lead to recurring infections.
LGV is difficult to definitively diagnose. Commercially available testing
does not reliably distinguish between different Chlamydia strains;
definitive testing is currently available through CDC (which is how the New
York City cases were diagnosed).

[Cases of LGV are uncommon but do occur each year in the USA. In 2004,
ProMED posted cases in Texas and California.
The LGV organism gains entrance through skin breaks or abrasions, or
crosses the epithelial cells of mucous membranes. Traveling via the
lymphatics, it multiplies within mononuclear phagocytes in the regional
lymph nodes. Transmission is predominantly sexual. However, transmission by
fomites, nonsexual personal contact, or laboratory accidents has been
documented. The creation of aerosols has been associated with infection
associated with pulmonary symptoms.
The disease occurs in 3 stages. The majority of infections in the primary
and secondary stages may go undetected. The primary stage is marked by the
formation of a painless herpetiform ulceration at the site of inoculation.
The secondary stage classically is described as the inguinal syndrome, and
it is characterized by painful inguinal lymphadenitis and associated
constitutional symptoms:
Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, usually unilateral, is the most common
clinical manifestation.
Heterosexual men are affected most often in the inguinal lymph nodes.
Homosexual men and women who are receptive to anal sex may develop
perirectal and pelvic lymph node involvement. In women, these nodes may be
involved as a result of lymphatic spread from the cervix and posterior
vaginal wall.
Suppurative granulomatous lymphadenitis and perilymphadenitis occur over
time with matting of the nodes. Frequently, these nodes coalesce to form
stellate abscesses. Histologically, these abscesses are nearly diagnostic,
but they may be similar to those seen in other infections, including cat
scratch fever and mycobacterial granulomatous infections.
The tertiary stage of LGV occurs years after the initial infection. In this
stage, an anogenitorectal syndrome may occur, with resultant rectal
stricture or elephantiasis of the genitalia. This syndrome is found
predominantly in women and homosexual men, because of the location of the
involved lymphatics. This late stage is characterized by proctocolitis,
which is caused by hyperplasia of intestinal and perirectal lymphatic
tissue. This inflammation forms perirectal abscesses, ischiorectal
abscesses, rectovaginal fistulas, anal fistulas, and rectal stricture. In
very late stages, fibrosis and granulomas are characteristic. Chlamydial
organisms are scarce at this stage. - Mod.LL]
