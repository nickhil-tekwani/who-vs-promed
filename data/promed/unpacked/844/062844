A Tampa woman says her dog died after coming into contact with a bufo toad this week. [She] explained she let her 3 dogs outside, and she noticed Otis had not come back inside after a while. [She] went outside and saw her dog standing in the yard with a huge toad in his mouth. She immediately knew it was a bufo toad. [Her dog] soon collapsed.

[He] ran inside to grab a jug of water. By the time she returned, [The dog] was seizing and foaming at the mouth. She tried to flush [the dog's] mouth out with water, but soon [He] passed away in her lap.

BK now wants to warn others about the dangerous amphibian lurking in her Riverside Heights neighborhood. She wants others to know what the toads look like and how to get rid of them.

Wildlife experts say bufo toads are more active at night and after periods of heavy rains. The toads secrete a poison from glands on the back of their heads that is extremely toxic for dogs and cats.

Some precautions you can take include keeping your pet's food and water indoors. Also, keep a close eye on your pet when they are outside. You can also remove bushy plants where the toads could hide from your yard.

The bufo (or cane) toad is reddish-brown to grayish-brown with a light-yellow belly, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. They have enlarged glands behind their eyes that angle down toward the shoulders. Those are the glands that secrete the toxin.

The cane toad (_Bufo marinus_), also known as the bufo, giant, or marine toad, is a large, nonnative amphibian that has been introduced into Florida. Cane toads are considered to be an invasive species and are poisonous to most animals that try to bite or consume them.

Please see https://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/nonnatives/amphibians/frogs-and-toads/cane-toad/ for some photos to help you see the differences between more common toads and the bufo toad.

Toad poisoning (or toxicity) occurs when a dog is exposed to the toxins secreted by certain species of toads. The 2 most common species of toads that cause poisonings in the USA are the cane or marine toad (_Bufo marinus_) and the Colorado River or Sonoran desert toad (_B. alvarius_). These toads are most commonly found in Colorado, Arizona, Texas, Hawaii, and Florida (https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/toad-poisoning-in-dogs).

Bufotoxins are a family of toxic steroid lactones. They occur in the parotoid glands, skin, and poison of many toads (genus _Bufo_) and other amphibians. The exact composition varies greatly with the specific source of the toxin. It can contain 5-MeO-DMT, bufagins, bufalin, bufotalin, bufotenin, bufothionine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The term bufotoxin can also be used specifically to describe the conjugate of a bufagin with suberylargine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufotoxin).

The toxic substances found in toads can be divided by chemical structure into 2 groups:
1. bufadienolides, which are cardiac glycosides (e.g., bufotalin, bufogenin) [affecting the heart]; and
2. tryptamine-related substances (e.g., bufotenin)

Toads known to secrete bufotoxin include
- _Bufo alvarius_
- _Bufo americanus_
- _Bufo arenarum_
- _Bufo asper_
- _Bufo blombergi_
- _Bufo boreas_
- _Bufo bufo_
- _Bufo bufo gargarizans_
- _Bufo gutturalis_
- _Bufo formosus_
- _Bufo fowleri_
- _Rhinella marina (formerly _Bufo marinus_) [This change in naming may not be accepted universally, as other sources disagree with the name change. - Mod.TG]
- _Bufo melanostictus_
- _Bufo peltocephalus_
- _Bufo quercicus_
- _Bufo regularis_
- _Bufo valliceps_
- _Bufo viridis_
- _Bufo vulgaris_

The clinical signs of toad toxicity usually begin with brick-red mucous membranes, increased salivation, pawing at the mouth, and vocalizing. This is usually followed by disorientation, circling, stumbling and falling, and seizures. Some dogs demonstrate an increase in breathing rate, anxiety, and vomiting and/or diarrhea.

These signs occur within minutes after exposure. Physical examination may include any of the above clinical signs, as well as an increased or decreased heart rate and increased body temperature.

As time progresses, the clinical signs can become more severe, leading to seizures, collapse, and severely irregular heart rhythms, and eventually death. The time may be quite short, as this article suggests. Factors affecting the timing may be the size and health of the animal encountering the toad. Smaller and/or older animals, or those with other health problems, such as heart conditions, may succumb to the toxin much quicker.

Toad toxicity is primarily diagnosed by history of contact with a toad and physical examination. There are no tests available to confirm absorption of toad toxins; however, general blood work, radiographs (X-rays), and electrocardiograms are helpful in determining the required supportive therapies.

The most effective treatment for acute toad toxicity is a complete flushing of the mouth with running water. Owners should do this immediately and prior to seeking veterinary care. It is important to point the dog's head down so the water is not swallowed. If the dog is having seizures, the mouth should be flushed so the water flows away from the throat to prevent drowning. Quick action is crucial for a good outcome.

Once at the clinic, treatment will depend on the clinical signs that develop. Seizures will need to be controlled with medications. Abnormal heart rates and rhythms must be corrected. Blood glucose, body temperature, blood pressure, and hydration will be monitored and controlled. There is no specific antidote for toad toxins. Once the clinical signs resolve, no further care is necessary, and your dog can return to normal activities (https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/toad-poisoning-in-dogs). - Mod.TG
