The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia has announced a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.

The case was a 2 year old boy from Banteay Meanchey Province. He developed symptoms on 3 Jan 2012 and was admitted to hospital on 9 Jan 2012. He is on Tamiflu [oseltamivir] and has been ventilated.

There have been reports that the boy was exposed to sick poultry in his village. He is the 19th person in Cambodia to become infected with the H5N1 virus; to date, 16 of these cases have died from complications of the disease.

The national and local Rapid Response Teams (RRT) are conducting outbreak investigation and response following the national protocol. Hospital staff who had contact with the case have been offered oseltamivir. To date, none of the human contacts have tested positive for avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection.
