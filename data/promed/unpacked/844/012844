Abstract
Cross-species transmission of viruses from wildlife animal reservoirs poses a marked threat to human and animal health1. Bats have been recognized as one of the most important reservoirs for emerging viruses and the transmission of a coronavirus that originated in bats to humans via intermediate hosts was responsible for the high-impact emerging zoonosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Here we provide virological, epidemiological, evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in China that has caused the death of 24 693 piglets across 4 farms. Notably, the outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS pandemic. Furthermore, we identified SADS-related CoVs with 96-98 percent sequence identity in 9.8 percent (58 out of 591) of anal swabs collected from bats in Guangdong province during 2013-2016, predominantly in horseshoe bats (_Rhinolophus spp._) that are known reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs. We found that there were striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in geographical, temporal, ecological and aetiological settings. This study highlights the importance of identifying coronavirus diversity and distribution in bats to mitigate future outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health and economic growth.

A newly identified coronavirus that killed nearly 25 000 piglets in 2016-17 in China emerged from horseshoe bats near the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2002 in the same bat species. The new virus is named swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). It does not appear to infect people, unlike SARS-CoV which infected more than 8000 people and killed 774. No SARS-CoV cases have been identified since 2004. The study investigators identified SADS-CoV on 4 pig farms in China's Guangdong Province. The work was a collaboration among scientists from EcoHealth Alliance, Duke-NUS Medical School, Wuhan Institute of Virology and other organizations, and was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. The research is published in the journal Nature.

The researchers say the finding is an important reminder that identifying new viruses in animals and quickly determining their potential to infect people is a key way to reduce global health threats.

SADS-CoV began killing piglets on a farm near Foshan in Guangdong Province in late October 2016. Investigators initially suspected porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as the cause. PEDV is a type of coronavirus common to swine that had been identified at the Foshan farm. Detection of PEDV ceased by mid-January 2017, yet piglets continued to die, suggesting a different cause. Scientists say separating sick sows and piglets from the rest of the herd helped stop the outbreak of SADS-CoV by May 2017.

Investigators confirmed the connection of SADS-CoV to bats by identifying the new virus in the small intestine of piglets from the outbreak. They then determined that the genetic sequence of SADS-CoV is similar to that of a bat coronavirus discovered in 2007 and looked for evidence of SADS-CoV in bat specimens collected from 2013 to 2016 in Guangdong Province. The new virus appeared in 71 of 596 specimens (11.9 percent).

The researchers also tested 35 farm workers who had close contact with sick pigs, none of whom tested positive for SADS-CoV.

Currently 6 coronaviruses are known to cause disease in people, but so far only 2 of them -- SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus -- have caused large outbreaks of fatal illness in people.

[The following segment from the full paper adds useful information (figures and tables omitted):

"To fulfill Koch's postulates for SADS-CoV, 2 different types of animal challenge experiments were conducted. The 1st challenge experiment was conducted with specific pathogen-free piglets that were infected with a tissue homogenate of SADS-CoV-positive intestines. Two days after infection, 3 out of 7 animals died in the challenge group whereas 4 out of 5 survived in the control group. Incidentally, the one piglet that died in the control group was the only individual that did not receive colostrum due to a shortage in the supply. It is thus highly likely that lack of nursing and inability to access colostrum was responsible for the death.

"For the 2nd challenge, healthy piglets were acquired from a farm in Guangdong that had been free of diarrheal disease for a number of weeks before the experiment, and were infected with the cultured isolate of SADS-CoV or tissue-culture medium as control. Of those inoculated with SADS-CoV, 50 percent (3 out of 6) died between 2 and 4 days after infection, whereas all control animals survived. All animals in the infected group suffered watery diarrhoea, rapid weight loss and intestinal lesions (determined after euthanasia upon experiment termination. Histopathological examination revealed marked villus atrophy in
SADS-CoV inoculated farm piglets 4 days after inoculation but not in control piglets and viral N protein-specific staining was observed mainly in small intestine epithelial cells of the inoculated piglets.

"The current study highlights the value of proactive viral discovery in wildlife, and targeted surveillance in response to an emerging infectious disease event, as well as the disproportionate importance of bats as reservoirs of viruses that threaten veterinary and public health. It also demonstrates that by using modern technological platforms, such as NGS, luciferase immunoprecipitation system serology and phylogenetic analysis, key experiments that traditionally rely on the isolation of live virus can be performed rapidly before virus isolation".

According to OIE's glossary, an 'emerging disease' means "a new occurrence in an animal of a disease, infection or infestation, causing a significant impact on animal or public health resulting from:
a. a change of a known pathogenic agent or its spread to a new geographic area or species; or
b. a previously unrecognised pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the 1st time".

The new disease entity in porcine, "Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)" may thus be considered as an emerging porcine disease.
