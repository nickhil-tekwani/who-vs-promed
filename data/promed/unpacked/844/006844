A 16 year old boy has survived a rare brain-eating amoeba [_Naegleria fowleri_], doctors at Florida Hospital for Children in Orlando said Tue [23 Aug 2016]. "He's done tremendously well. He's walking, he's speaking, he went outside for the first time to get some fresh air -- he's ready to go home," Dr. Humberto Antonio Liriano, a critical care physician, told reporters.

It's remarkable because he is only the 4th person in the United States to survive an infection from this parasite, called _Naegleria fowleri_.

On vacation with his family in Orlando, D.L. had a severe headache while they were at a theme park on 7 Aug [2016]. The pain became so bad, Dr. Liriano explained, the teen "couldn't tolerate people touching him."

When D.L. arrived at the hospital, Dr. Dennis Hernandez, the ER doctor working at the time, immediately identified symptoms of meningitis and took a sample of the teen's cerebral spinal fluid. The samples were positive for the brain-eating amoeba.

The brain-eating amoeba cannot infect you if you drink contaminated water, explained Dr. Rajan Wadhawan, chief medical officer at Florida Hospital for Children. The parasite becomes a danger "only when it goes up the nose forcibly," Wadhawan said. Most patients survive only 12 to 13 days.

The Florida Department of Health said D.L. was infected earlier this month while swimming on private property in Broward County.

Hearing D.L.'s test results, the entire hospital worked together, sparing no effort to save D.L.'s life, Dr. Liriano recounted. Calls were placed to Profounda Inc., the Orlando-based drug company that makes an anti-parasitic called miltefosine (sold as Impavido), that was FDA approved in March [2016] for another use. The patient will need rehab, but is ready to return home to South Florida with his family.

According to the CDC, between 1962 and 2015, there were 138 known cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis [in the USA].

In 2013, then 12-year-old K.H. was infected with the parasite while swimming at a water park. After nearly 7 weeks in the hospital, the Arkansas pre-teen was able to return home. K.H. recovered and went back to school that fall. The same summer, an 8-year-old boy in Texas also survived, although he suffered brain damage. According to the CDC, that outcome was believed to be due to a delay of "several days after his symptoms began" before treatment started. The only other known survivor in the United States, who was not treated with miltefosine, was a patient in California in 1978.

Having worked with amoeba cases in the past, Dr. Liriano appeared to savor the rare outcome for his patient.
