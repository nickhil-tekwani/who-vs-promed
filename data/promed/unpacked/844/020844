The Fresno Mosquito and Vector Control District has confirmed that _Culex_ mosquitoes in Fresno have tested positive for the Saint Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus.

According to a press release from the Fresno County Department of Public Health (FCDPH), the infected mosquitoes were found in the areas of East Floradora Avenue and Highway 41, and Shields and Van Ness avenues. The notification was made by the FCDPH on Thursday [3 Jul 2018].

SLE virus is mosquito-transmitted and causes inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Most infected persons have no apparent signs of illness, but symptoms can include fever, headache, dizziness, nausea and fatigue. The time from when an individual is bitten by an infected mosquito to onset of illness can range from 5-15 days. Signs and symptoms last from a period of several days to a week.

Severe symptoms include fever, headache, stiff neck, confusion, and an altered level of consciousness. Coma, convulsions, paralysis and sometimes death may occur (with a 5-15 percent overall case fatality ratio). Elderly people and those with a weakened immune system are more at risk for developing severe symptoms of the disease.

There is no specific vaccine for SLE, and health care providers should evaluate individuals who believe they are at risk. FCDPH has recommended the use of repellent along with permethrin, an insecticide used for clothing. The department further advised persons to wear protective clothing and avoiding the peak biting hours between dusk and dawn when possible.

FCDPH also cautioned against leaving standing water around the house and changing it whenever possible to avoid the laying of eggs.

[This is the 1st report of the presence of St Louis encephalitis [SLE] virus in California this year [2018]. Active SLE virus transmission occurred in several locations in California last year (2017) in localities where it has been absent for many years. Residents in the Fresno area will be wise to follow the advice for avoidance of mosquito bites that is offered above by the FCDPH, since there is a long transmission season of several months ahead.

SLE virus is endemic in the southwestern USA, and sporadic cases in humans occur there infrequently. In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona, and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005.

Wild birds are the reservoir hosts, and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are the vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the above report. - Mod.TY
