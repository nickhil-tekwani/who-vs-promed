[This outbreak is over 8 months old, but is just now being diagnosed
and reported. The species of birds involved in this outbreak was not
given. There was morbidity but no mortality, suggesting that the
birds were chickens. Previously, West Nile virus infections of
lemurs has been reported in Madagascar, and the virus is likely to be
endemic there. In ProMED post of 10 May 1997, Dr. Jacques M. Morvan
reported, "In Madagascar, West Nile virus has been isolated from
human blood, birds (parrots _Coracopsis vasa_, and egrets _Bulbicus
ibis_) and from several mosquito species (_Culex decens_, _Cx.
quinquefasciatus_, _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_, _Cx. antennatus_, _Cx._
univittatus_, _Aedes albocephalus_, _Ae. circumluteolus_, _Ae.
aegypti_, _Ae. madagascarensis_, _Anopheles brunnipes_, _An.
maculipalpis_)." (see proMED archive no. 19970528.1095).
