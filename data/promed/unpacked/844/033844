The Ministry of Health and Sports confirmed the presence of the 1st
indigenous case of dengue fever in France, Nice (Alpes-Maritimes).
This is an isolated case and no further cases have been reported to
date. The patient is cured and healthy.

This is level 2 of the national anti-dengue dissemination plan in
France, which is coordinated by the Directorate General of Health and
whose implementation is local, in this case, the Regional Agency for
Health PACA, the Prefecture of Alpes-Maritimes, and local communities.

To prevent any further spread of the virus, the epidemiological
surveillance measures and entomological (that is to say mosquito)
will be strengthened. Mosquito control actions have been implemented
around the area of the residence of the person who was affected.

The risk of development of an epidemic is considered limited, but can
not be excluded, due to the significant presence of the tiger
mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] locally. The Ministry of Health
therefore calls upon the individual and community mobilization and
calls for people residing in and around Nice to adopt a number of
measures to prevent any further spread of the virus:
- destroy the larvae and potential mosquito breeding habitat in and
around (removing saucers under flowerpots and empty at least once a
week all the containers of still water: garbage, gutters ...);
- protect yourself from mosquito bites by wearing long sleeve shirts
and long pants, using insect repellents (following the proper dosage,
especially for children and pregnant women) as well as mosquito nets
crib for newborns and infants.
- protect habitat (mosquito nets, electric diffusers. ...).

Dengue is transmitted from person to person, only through a bite of
the _Aedes_ mosquito. In the south of France the _Aedes albopictus_
(tiger mosquito) is present. During a bite, the mosquito takes the
virus on an infected person. After an incubation period in the
mosquito of up to a few days and [then] it can transmit the virus to
a healthy person after another bite. Individual measures of
protection against mosquito bites are essential to fight against the
development of an epidemic.

[The occurrence of a locally-acquired dengue virus infection is not
surprising. _Aedes albopictus_ has become established in various
parts of the Mediterranean Basin, including Nice (see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20100731.2564). Many individuals have become infected
with dengue viruses acquired in endemic areas and become ill after
their return to France (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100616.2008).
When a viremic individual is located in an area with _Aedes
albopictus_, there is a risk of ongoing infection similar to the
chikungunya outbreak that occurred in Italy in 2007 (see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20071210.3980).

[2] USA (Florida): correction
Date: Tue 14 Sep 2010
From: Danielle Stanek <Danielle_Stanek@doh.state.fl.us> [edited]


We would like to provide a correction to the PAHO dengue alert
recently published in ProMED-mail that erroneously reported both
dengue 1 and dengue 3 virus circulation in Monroe County, Florida.
This is not the case; dengue 1 [virus] has been the only dengue
serovar detected in multiple samples collected in Monroe both in the
fall of 2009 and since re-emergence or re-introduction in March of
2010.

Dengue 3 serovar was identified by the Florida Department of Health
Bureau of Laboratories in a single patient from Broward County,
Florida several weeks ago (patient onset date was 1 Aug [2010]).
Since that time no further locally acquired cases have been
identified in Broward even following initiation of active
surveillance conducted by the Broward County Health Department.
Broward County does not directly border Monroe County.

We thank PAHO for quickly correcting their report and webpage once we
alerted them to the error. The Florida Department of Health Bureau of
Environmental Public Health Medicine weekly arbovirus surveillance
reports include all confirmed human and veterinary arbovirus cases as
well as positive results from sentinel chickens and may be viewed at

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Stanek for bringing this correction to our
attention. The failure to detect ongoing dengue virus transmission of
dengue virus 3 in Broward County is good news, indeed.

Researchers in the Roraima Central Laboratory, the Roraima Federal
University, and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) confirmed that
the dengue virus serotype 4 circulating in the state came from
Venezuela and is the same one that circulated in the country 28 years
ago, according to the state Secretariat of Health. They compared
current [virus] samples with information from a world bank of
genomes. From that point the virus was identified as having come from
Venezuela, where the disease is common, and has not mutated since
1982.

The discovery of the origin of the virus will help Epidemiological
Surveillance in fighting dengue in the state. In Roraima, 3 cases of
dengue [virus] type 4 were confirmed with 4 new suspected [cases].

After 28 years, this virus has returned to Brazil. The majority of
Brazilians do not have immunity to [dengue] virus type 4, which
increases the chances of an epidemic. At the beginning of the month
[September 2010], the Minister of Health, Jose Gomes Temporao, stated
that the disease is contained in the state and that there is no
evidence that it will spread to other parts of the country.

The mosquito-borne disease [virus] continues to wreak havoc in the
province, claiming at least 8 lives of children just this month
[September 2010], the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (RESU)
7 revealed late last week.

The latest fatalities expired midweek last week inside the Vicente
Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC), a RESU 7 personnel said. There
were at least 270 patients brought to the VSMMC during a one-week
period from 1 Sep [2010]; 5 of them died. These patients, whose ages
range from 9 months old to 35 years old are from the different parts
of Cebu, including Cebu City.

DoH 7 director Susana Madarieta said from January to September of
this year [2010], the region has recorded 5571 dengue cases or 1229
cases more compared to the same period of last year [2009].

With the number of dengue cases in Cebu and the rest of Central
Visayas rapidly increasing, local government officials and the DoH 7
are stepping up its measures against the mosquito-borne dengue
disease here.

Cebu City Medical Center (CCMC) has been jam packed with dengue
patients being brought in almost daily, prompting Cebu City mayor
Michael Rama to ask those from outside the city to go to other
hospitals so as not to drain the city's resources.

[5] India (Delhi)

<http://www.indiatalkies.com/2010/09/dengue-stalks-delhi-hospitals-struggle-cope-feature.html>


With 4 deaths and over 1800 infected by the mosquito-borne disease
[virus] here [in New Delhi], medical institutions have their hands
full. While the bigger hospitals are trying to cope by joining beds,
there are some where patients have little option other than the
floor. At Safdarjung Hospital, run by the government and one of the
biggest here, the rush of dengue patients has become difficult to
manage. Prathap Dutta, joint secretary of resident doctors
association, told IANS. As many as 150 patients, Dutta said, land up
at Safdarjung Hospital in a day. "We are running out of medicines,
intravenous fluids and saline drips," Dutta said.

The incessant rains lashing the city and the debris created by
construction for the upcoming Commonwealth Games are the main reasons
cited for the dengue outbreak in the capital. The Municipal
Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has confirmed 4 deaths from the disease.
Over 1836 dengue cases have been recorded so far in Delhi.

According to MCD, the number of dengue cases this year [2010] will
cross the 2006 figure of 3366 cases.

The corporation has found a high density of mosquito breeding in the
south and central areas of the city. So far, they have issued 45 532
notices to errant residents and housing societies.
