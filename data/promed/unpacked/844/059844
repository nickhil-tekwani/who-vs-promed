A girl of 8 years living in Villa 25 de Mayo died on Friday night, 14 Feb 2014, and it is suspected that she contracted botulism after eating marinated vizcacha at a family dinner. It all began the night before when the girl, her father, a friend and 2 other women related to the family ate the homemade product.

The next day, they all began to have fever, vomiting and diarrhea until, for unknown reasons, the girl suffered from asthenopia [an ophthalmological condition with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, red eyes, eye strain, pain in or around the eyes, blurred vision, headache and occasional double vision] and had a cardiac arrest. Apparently, according to the preliminary results of the autopsy, it was found that the girl "suffered a pulmonary edema which would have caused death," noted reliable sources. After the autopsy, the medical corps from forensic samples sent gastric fluids and stool to the National University of Cuyo to determine if the girl had botulism.

The suspicion of botulism grew after her father and a friend began to have difficulty speaking and forced hospitalizations in the intensive care units of the Schestakow and the Spanish Hospital of San Rafael, Mendoza Province. These symptoms, according to the specialists, "are very common in patients with botulism." In this context it was learned that 2 more women who had consumed the escabeche had vomiting and diarrhea.

The director of the Schestakow, Armando Dauverne, reported that "speaking with Aldo Sergio Saracco, [head of] the provincial level of Toxicology, accelerated studies of the samples sent to the National University of Cuyo will be done," and added that "for now, all indicate that we are faced with 3 cases of botulism and [2 other suspected cases]." Regarding the death of the girl, the Director pointed out that "the girl was pronounced dead on arrival at the health center and then transferred to the Judicial Morgue," and he added that "apparently choking was the cause of death."

In this framework, the pediatrician Gonzalo Herrera, who works at the hospital, explained that "it is very likely that the girl had the toxin in her body, because she had vomiting, diarrhea and fever, as [did] the father, who is now in the hospital intensive care."

Background: A woman of 84 years and a man of 69 died of botulism in 2013 as a result of having ingested homemade food. The 1st case took place in March 2013 in General Alvear, when the man died, and the 2nd was in October 2013 when a woman died after a month of confinement in the Spanish Hospital. In the latter case, 2 other women became ill after consuming packaged peppers. All patients underwent treatment with antitoxin that the Ministry of Health of the province provided.

[Viscachas or vizcachas (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscacha) are rodents of 2 genera (_Lagidium_ and _Lagostomus_) in the family Chinchillidae. They are closely related to chinchillas, and look similar to rabbits, apart from their longer tails. Pictures of viscachas can be seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscacha.

Escabeche (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escabeche) is a typical Mediterranean cuisine which refers to a dish of either poached or fried fish (escabeche of chicken, rabbit or pork is common in Spain) marinated in an acidic mixture before serving, and to the marinade itself. The dish is common in Spain and Latin America, and popular in Catalonia, Portugal, Provence and the Philippines. Influences of the dish appear as far as Asia-Pacific with adjustments to local food staples. It is usually served cold after marinating in a refrigerator overnight or longer. The acid in the marinade is usually vinegar, but can also include citrus juice. Escabeche is a popular presentation of canned or potted preserved fish, such as tuna, bonito or sardines. In the New World, versions of the basic marinade are often used with foods other than fish and meats -- for example, cassava or green bananas and chicken gizzards (Puerto Rico), jalapeno peppers (Mexico), etc. The origin of the word escabeche is Persian, and was brought to Spain by the Arabs during the Moorish conquests. The word derives from al-sikbaj, the name of a popular meat dish cooked in a sweet and sour sauce, usually vinegar and honey or date molasses.

Given this background information regarding the source of the meat and how escabeche is prepared, it is certainly possible that either the source of presumed botulism was not the meat dish or the preparation was not escabeche as the vinegar in the marinade should provide enough of an acidic environment to prevent germination of botulinum spores.

These cases may well be botulism as clusters of individuals with muscular weakness which can produce respiratory paralysis and begin with eye muscle weakness almost always represent botulism. The initial combination of gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea with fever are probably not due to botulism altogether. As stated by Sobel (references removed): "In foodborne botulism, particularly types B and E, gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea and vomiting may precede neurological symptoms. It is unknown if these are caused by direct action of botulinum toxin, other products of _C. botulinum_, or some other contaminant of spoiled food. These symptoms have never been reported in wound botulism nor have corresponding signs been observed in primate experiments in which pure toxin was administered intragastrically or intravenously" (1). The diarrhea and fever are not linked to botulism and also may represent other agents in the food.
