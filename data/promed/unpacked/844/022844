California Day-Fresh Foods Recalls All Fresh, Un-Pasteurized Citrus Juice
Products Because of Possible Health Risks
Due to the possibility of _Salmonella_-related contamination, California
Day-Fresh Foods today announced a voluntary recall of all un-pasteurized
orange and grapefruit juices, as well as tangerine, lemonade, strawberry
lemonade and old-fashioned lemonade, sold under the Naked Juice and
Ferraro's brand names.
The recall covers product sold in California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado,
Washington and Oregon, with "best if used by" dates on or before May 4. It
also includes un-pasteurized orange and grapefruit juice sold under Von's
private label (in Southern California only), and un-pasteurized blood
orange juice sold under the Trader Joe's label in Oregon, Washington,
California and Arizona. Isolated cases of [salmonellosis have been
reported in Southern California, Nevada and Colorado.
_Salmonella_ is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal
infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with
weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with _Salmonella_ often
experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with _Salmonella_ can
result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing severe
illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms),
endocarditis and arthritis.
"At this time _Salmonella_ has not been found in any of the Company's
products," California Day-Fresh Foods President David Sperry said. "We feel
that in the interest of public safety it is prudent to recall these
products until conclusive testing can be completed. This recall action is
being taken with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
and we are working closely with them to identify the exact cause of these
illnesses."
Unaffected by this recall are California Day-Fresh Foods' all-natural fruit
and vegetable juice blends and smoothies, including its frozen juice
products.
Consumers who have purchased Von's, Naked, Trader Joe's or Ferraro's
un-pasteurized citrus juice products covered by this voluntary recall are
urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers
who have consumed this juice and have become ill should see their
healthcare provider so that appropriate testing and treatment can be
provided.
For further information customers are urged to visit the California
Day-Fresh Foods Web site at WWW.NakedJuice.com, or call 1-888-836-1823.
