A new case of Ebola virus has been confirmed in the city of Beni [North Kivu province] in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the country's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) said on Mon.

Testing showed the case was genetically linked to the 2018-2020 outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which killed nearly 2300 people, said a statement from Placide Mbala, chief of the Pathogen Genomics Laboratory at INRB.

Another flare-up from that outbreak killed 6 people last year [2021]. Congo's most recent outbreak was in a different part of the country and was declared over in July [2022] after 5 deaths.

Ebola can sometimes linger in the eyes, central nervous system, and bodily fluids of survivors and flare up years later.

The case was confirmed in a woman who died on 15 Aug 2022 after being admitted to a hospital in Beni on 23 Jul 2022, the statement said.

"Our initial findings indicate that this case likely represents a new flare-up of the 2018-2020 North Kivu/Ituri outbreak, initiated by transmission of Ebola virus from a persistently infected survivor or a survivor who experienced a relapse," it said.

Investigations are ongoing to determine the source.

At least 131 contacts of the woman have been identified including 60 front-line healthcare workers, 59 of whom are vaccinated against Ebola, said the statement.

Congo's dense tropical forests are a natural reservoir for the Ebola virus, which causes fever, body aches, and diarrhoea.

The country has recorded 14 outbreaks since 1976. The 2018-2020 outbreak in the east was Congo's largest and the 2nd largest ever recorded, with nearly 3500 total cases.

[Although the woman who sadly died was hospitalized from 23 Jul until 15 Aug 2022, clearly exposing numerous healthcare workers and family members to Ebola virus, 131 in total, most of the healthcare workers, fortunately, were vaccinated.

It is not clear whether the woman herself had previously been vaccinated, but she had exacerbating conditions including TB and HIV, for which she was receiving treatment.

It was reported her burial was secure ("Our team on site in Beni has carried out a dignified and secure burial and also decontaminated the hospital where the patient stayed," the ministry said). Unfortunately, "This latest announcement in Beni comes as the region is under threat from various rebel groups, including the Allied Democratic Forces rebels who have killed more than 2000 people in over a year, according to various rights groups." (https://apnews.com/article/science-health-africa-genetics-ebola-virus-5ea7741c386592f8d1e4233c6c2422c5). One hopes that the violence in the region will not interfere with healthcare workers' attempts to vaccinate contacts to control virus spread.

This may have been a relapse from an earlier infection or exposure to another persistently infected individual from the 2018-2020 outbreak in the region. An alternative possibility is a low level transmission of Ebola virus undetected in the community background of multiple active diseases. - Mod.LK]

[2] Identification of virus

A new case of the Ebola virus has been confirmed in the city of Beni [North Kivu province] in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the country's National Institute for Biomedical Research said on Monday [22 Aug 2022].

Genetic sequencing showed the case is linked to the 2018-2020 outbreak in North Kivu province, the institute said in a statement.

The case received care at the Beni Referral Hospital, initially for other ailments but subsequently exhibited symptoms consistent with Ebola virus disease, said the statement, noting that the country's National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) is in the process of testing samples to determine if the patient contracted Ebola, citing a Xinhua report.

"While the analysis is ongoing, WHO is already on the ground supporting health officials to investigate the case and prepare for a possible outbreak," said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

On Mon 15 Aug 2022, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) Beni mobile laboratory received an oropharyngeal secretion sample taken from a deceased patient who was being treated at the Beni General Reference Hospital (HGR-Beni), according to Virological.org.

The sample tested positive for the Ebola virus (EBOV) using the Cepheid Xpert Ebola assay with ct-values of 32.5 for viral glycoprotein (GP) and 28.2 for viral nucleoprotein (NP). For quality control and confirmation, samples were sent to the Rodolphe Mérieux INRB-Goma Laboratory on Tue 16 Aug 2022, where the analysis confirmed the EVD case, said health authorities.

"The patient was admitted on 23 Jul 2022, to the Internal Medicine department of the HGR-Beni for cough, headache, polyarthralgia, intense physical asthenia dating back several days and for which she had self-medicated with non-specified drugs."

"She was HIV-positive on antiretroviral treatment, and she had also presented with tuberculosis for which she was receiving anti-tuberculosis treatment. On 13 Aug 2022, her health condition deteriorated with the onset of bronchial congestion and kidney failure, which prompted her transfer to the intensive care unit for better care. She died on 15 Aug 2022."

In total, her hospitalisation lasted 23 days. The body was collected by the family the same day for burial.

On 17 Aug 2022, 131 contacts were listed, including 60 front-line healthcare workers [[HCW] and 71 co-patients. Of the 131 pre-listed contacts, 59 of the 60 HCWs are vaccinated. The vaccination status of the index case and 71 co-patients is not yet known.

[The Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) Beni mobile laboratory is to be complimented on its rapid sequencing of the virus. This was important because it demonstrated it was unlikely to be a new spillover event. - Mod.LK]

[3] Link to earlier outbreaks

Smaller outbreaks in 2021
-------------------------
Persistent virus in survivors are known to trigger flare-ups, and following the large outbreak, there were 2 other small events in the same area, both thought to be linked to earlier human cases in the area.

Both occurred in 2021. One that began in February 2021 resulted in 12 cases, 6 of them fatal. And one that started that October led to 11 cases, 6 of them fatal.

The current outbreak marks the DRC's 15th. Earlier this year [2022], an outbreak in Equateur province -- located in the northwest -- was declared over in early July after 4 confirmed cases and one probable case. All 5 patients died.

Unlike the recent flare-ups in North Kivu province, the Equateur province event was thought to be the result of a new spillover from an animal source.
