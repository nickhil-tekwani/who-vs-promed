Scrub typhus, a mite-borne disease, has gripped Nagpur and has claimed the lives of at least 12 people in the city. Over 55 patients have tested positive, including a 2-year-old girl who is currently being treated in the pediatric ICU at the Government Medical College and Hospital in Nagpur. The latest victim of scrub typhus was a 43-year-old of Madhya Pradesh, who died on [Sat 1 Sep 2018].

A team from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has been sent to the city to ascertain the cause of the outbreak.

The disease is caused by a bacterium called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ and is spread to people through bites of infected chigger mites that are 0.2 mm to 0.4 mm [0.008 to 0.015 in] in size. These mites are mostly found in areas with lots of vegetation and on bodies of large animals. The outbreak usually happens with the onset of monsoon season. Reports indicate that 50 percent of people affected by scrub typhus die if they do not get immediate medical attention.

Dr Milind Ganvir, assistant director of health said, "The disease is under control in Nagpur. People should focus on maintaining cleanliness. The number of patients is increasing, as patients from Madhya Pradesh are also coming to Nagpur for better treatment."

Out of 12 deaths, 7 have been reported from Nagpur, with 1 each from Bhandara and Akola and 3 from Madhya Pradesh.
