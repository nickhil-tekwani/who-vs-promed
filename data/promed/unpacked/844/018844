Agricultural diseases have hit 50-80 percent of Iraq's agricultural crops
and fruits, said an Iraqi Agriculture Ministry report. The report, carried
by the Iraqi News Agency on Saturday, said the spread of epidemics and
agricultural diseases were "unfamiliar before the imposition of the U.N.
sanctions on Iraq in August, 1990."
