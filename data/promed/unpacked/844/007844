Measles outbreak in Jahra
----------------------
Medical officials at the Ministry of Health disclosed that 25 cases
of measles were registered at the Jahra Hospital after 25 patients
were admitted there with symptoms of the dangerous disease, reported
Al-Qabas. They said that around 60 cases of suspected infections of
the disease were transferred to the infectious diseases hospital.
[The] recent cases were discovered in Jahra after a Kuwaiti family
who was in a spring camp from a neighboring state was responsible for
spreading the disease in the Naeem area in Jahra.
Medical officials also said that the infectious diseases hospital
transferred 2 children to the intensive care unit after diagnosis
revealed that they were infected with the disease. [In addition], 15
persons were quarantined inside the hospital in order to avoid [the
spread of the infection]. Officials also disclosed [that treatment of
the disease was slowed down by several setbacks at the Ministry of
Health], such as an acute shortage of intensive care units, shortages
in medical equipment, and inadequate quarantine rooms, which are a
must in containing the spread of such diseases.

[The Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) of the WHO has
embarked on a measles elimination strategy with the goal to interrupt
transmission of measles in the region by 2010. Data on the annual
number of reported cases of measles in Kuwait during the period 1990
through 2005 can be found at
<http://www.emro.who.int/vpi/measles/Reportedcases_90_05.htm>.
Reported measles cases between 1990 and 2005
1990 / 71
1991 / 165
1992 / 383
1993 / 260
1994 / 432
1995 / 12
1996 / 15
1997 / 26
1998 / 90
1999 / 13
2000 / 6
2001 / NA
2002 / NA
2003 / NA
2004 / 23
2005 / 10

The above report of 60 suspected cases is the highest number of cases
reported since 1998. The curiosity question is where was the import
from? There is mention of a family returning from a neighboring state
where apparently there is significant measles activity. - Mod.MPP]
