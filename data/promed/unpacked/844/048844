The updated statistics of the Congolese Ministry of Health on the epidemic of Ebola virus disease plaguing the Boende health zone south of Equateur province in north western DRC indicate that 5 new cases have recently been reported, thus raising the number of cases from 53 to 58 between 1 Sep and 3 Sep 2014.

According to the Ministry of Public Health, there is a cumulative total of 58 cases, with 13 confirmed, 22 probable, and 23 suspected, and 31 deaths (mortality rate 53.4 per cent), including 6 health workers. To date, 291 people have been in contact patients are followed which 285 were seen.

The minister of health, Dr Felix Kabange Numbi, arrived on Tuesday [2 Sep 2014] in Boende after a 24 hour stopover in Mbandaka, capital of Equateur, at the head of a delegation that includes the representative of World Health Organization (WHO) in the DRC, Dr Joseph Waogodo Cabore, director of the Department of Vaccines and Immunization at WHO in Geneva, Dr Jean Marie Okwo Bele (originally from the DRC) and director of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) Kinshasa, and the professor and virologist Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum.

According to a press release from the WHO office in the DRC, the Congolese minister of public health said during his visit to Mbandaka the DRC and its partners are launching a major challenge, which has the capacity to interrupt the chain of transmission of this deadly virus within 45 days. He also said it is crucial that the Ebola virus disease remains confined in the one area of Boende and it does not reach Mbandaka, the provincial County seat, with access and exchange with Kinshasa via the Congo River.

The Boende Health Zone is located 1200 kilometers [746 mi] from Kinshasa, and 600 km [373 mi] south east of Mbandaka, in a region with a large amount of water, including large Lomela, Salonga, and Tshuapa rivers, experiencing intense fishing activities and trade of food products with other border communities of 2 neighboring provinces further south, Kasai Occidental and Kasai Oriental. In the city of Boende, located 68 km [42 mi] from Lokolia which is the epicenter of the epidemic, there is the International Committee of Technical and Scientific Coordination (CICTS), which coordinates the management of all the statistics of the epidemic, developing an update of the status report of the disease. CICTS must ensure infection control in the Isolation Centre set up by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

Dr Jean-Marie Okwo Bele WHO/Geneva appreciated the efforts of both national and provincial authorities for their leadership and coordination for the ownership of the fight against Ebola in this vast province of Equateur. Dr Okwo Bele also called for intensified epidemiological surveillance so that there are no silent areas that do not report data in a time of epidemic. "It is very important to raise awareness to detect the sources of infection of the disease spread, in most cases, at funerals and unsecured burials," he said.

To achieve a strategic and appropriate response to face the current epidemic in the northwest of the country, the WHO representative in the DRC explained, for its part, requires commitment and close collaboration between the government and key partners. "WHO provides epidemiologists and experts in various fields, protection kits and is also responsible for the management of payment to providers in Boende," said Dr Cabore. He summed up the main line contributions of other partners: UNICEF, WFP, UNDP, OCHA, MONUSCO [United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC], CDC, USAID, MSF, etc., in lending a helping hand to the authorities in terms of logistics and telecommunications.

[2] WHO: virological analysis

Virological analysis: no link between Ebola outbreaks in west Africa and Democratic Republic of Congo

Situation assessment -- 2 Sep 2014 (updated 3 Sep 2014]
-------------------------------------------------------
Results from virus sequencing of samples from the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were received last night. The virus is the Zaire species, in a lineage most closely related to a virus from the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, DRC. The Zaire species of the virus is indigenous in the country. Ebola first emerged in 1976 in almost simultaneous outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire) and South Sudan (then Sudan).

Confirmatory testing was done at Gabon's Centre International de Recherches Medicales in Franceville, a WHO collaborating centre. Earlier, testing in DRC confirmed Ebola in 6 of 8 samples.

The outbreak is located in the remote Boende district, Equateur province in the north western part of the country.

Results from virus characterization, together with findings from the epidemiological investigation, are definitive: the outbreak in DRC is a distinct and independent event, with no relationship to the outbreak in west Africa. As the Gabon laboratory report clearly stated, "the virus in the Boende district is definitely not derived from the variant currently circulating in west Africa." These findings are reassuring, as they exclude the possibility that the virus has spread from West to Central Africa.

Epidemiological investigation has linked the index case, who died on [11 Aug 2014], to the preparation of bushmeat for consumption. This is the country's 7th Ebola outbreak since 1976. The introduction of the virus into the human population following contact with infected bushmeat (usually fruit bats or monkeys) is consistent with the pattern seen at the start of previous outbreaks. The virus is now spreading from person to person.

The response team has, to date, identified 53 cases consistent with the case definition for Ebola virus disease, including 31 deaths. 7 of these deaths were among health care workers. More than 160 contacts are being traced. The government has rapidly mounted a robust response by reactivating emergency committees at national, provincial, and local levels, setting up isolation centres, and providing community leaders with facts about the disease. The government will ensure that all burials are safe. The WHO team confirmed that collaboration between the government and its key partners is excellent.

The outbreak zone, where the most intense transmission is occurring, is remote, located some 1200 kilometres [746 mi] from the capital city, Kinshasa. No paved roads run from the outbreak zone to Kinshasa. However, cases have been detected or transmission is ongoing at three sites, underscoring the need to watch the outbreak's evolution closely. Motorcycles, canoes, and satellite phones have been supplied to facilitate outbreak investigation and contact tracing. A dedicated helicopter will be made available soon.

[There is little additional information available.

The media report above indicates that the DRC MOH is reporting 5 new cases since the 1 Sep 2014 update. The WHO press release appears to be the source of much of the information contained in the most recent media reports. - Mod.LM
