cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts caused by _Xanthomonas
campestris_ pv. _campestris_ in the Mediterranean region of Turkey.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
During warm and humid periods in the winters of 2004 to 2006, severe
leaf necrosis and vein rot symptoms were observed on cabbage
(_Brassica oleracea_ var. _capitata_ L.), broccoli (_Brassica
oleracea_ var. _italica_ Plenck), and Brussels sprouts (_Brassica
oleracea_ var. _gemmifera_ D.C.) in the Mediterranean region of
Turkey. Symptoms were characterized by yellow, V-shaped areas of the
leaf margin, with the internal tissue turning from brown to black.
Infected seedlings were also observed in commercial nurseries in
Adana with a disease incidence [from] nearly 10 [up] to 25 percent.

A total of 20 isolates recovered from diseased leaf samples were
selected at random to identify the causal organism. The isolates were
identified as _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _campestris_. Fatty acid
methyl ester (FAME) profile similarity indices ranged from 80 to 94
percent. Indirect ELISA [enzyme linked immunosorbent assay] further
confirmed the identity of the pathogen in both pure culture and
infected plant.

Pathogenicity of the isolates was tested on 5-week-old cabbage plants
by spray inoculation. Sterile saline buffer was sprayed on negative
control plants. Inoculated and control plants were maintained for 5
days. No symptoms developed on negative control plants. The bacterium
was reisolated from inoculated cabbage plants and identified as _X.
campestris_ pv. _campestris_ by FAME and an ELISA. To our knowledge,
this is the 1st report of the occurrence and outbreak of _X.
campestris_ pv. _campestris_ in the Mediterranean region of Turkey.

[2] Clubroot - Nepal
Date: February 2008

92(2): 317 [edited]

in Nepal. Plant Dis 2008; 92(2): 317; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-92-2-0317]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cultivation of brassica vegetables has the highest potential for
generating income among more traditional rice and maize farmers in
Nepal. Among brassica vegetables, the most important are cauliflower
(_Brassica oleracea_ var. _botrytis_ L.) and cabbage (_B. oleracea_
var. _capitata_ L.).

Although clubroot disease, caused by _Plasmodiophora brassicae_
Woronin, has been observed in Nepal since 1993, severe and widespread
epidemics have been observed since 2004 in the Bhaktapur, Kathmandu,
Lalitpur, and Palung Valley production areas. Typical disease
symptoms are widespread, and disease severity has been particularly
severe in the Kathmandu Valley and Palung/Daman area of the Makwanpur
District. Many cauliflower fields in these areas have had as much as
100 percent yield loss between 2004 and 2006 with an estimated 40
percent overall loss from clubroot. Estimates from interviews with
growers in the Palung production area during an intensive farmers'
interaction program indicated that cauliflower production was reduced
from 5-6 metric tons per household (1500 square meters) prior to
2004 to less than 300 kg per household in 2004 and beyond. The
economic loss in this area alone was estimated at USD 1.4 million in
2004 and 2005.

Examination of transplant nurseries indicated that frequently more
than 80 percent of the seedlings have symptoms of clubroot at the
time of transplanting. Soil samples from throughout the production
areas indicated that the sandy loam soils were predominately acidic
(pH range of 4.2 to 7.2 with more than 90 percent below 6.0). Several
management practices are being employed to reduce disease severity,
including the use of clubroot resistant cultivars, raising the soil
pH to above 7.0 by using dolomitic lime, testing of the fungicide
flusulfamide and biopesticide (_Trichoderma viride_), and
biofumigation and solarization of the nursery beds in an effort to
reduce disease pressure on transplant material.

[Black rot
----------
The bacterium _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _campestris_ is the causal
agent of black rot, which affects crucifers including cabbages,
oilseed rape, and a number of weeds, which can serve as pathogen
reservoirs. The disease affects primarily aboveground parts of plants
at any stage of growth and causes high yield and quality losses,
especially in tropical and subtropical regions. It is favoured by
high humidity and warm temperatures. Symptoms may vary according to
host and environmental conditions and generally include
characteristic V-shaped lesions, leaf chlorosis, darkening of
vascular tissue, extensive wilting and necrosis. Pre-existing fungal
lesions may increase the susceptibility of crops to black rot by
providing entry points for the bacteria.

The pathogen is seed-borne and can also be spread by mechanical means
(including insects), plant debris, water, and wind. Disease
management includes clean planting material (seed or transplanted
seedlings), cultural practices, removal of weed reservoirs, and
copper sprays. Some black rot resistant brassica cultivars are
available.

Clubroot
--------
Clubroot caused by the fungus _Plasmodiophora brassicae_ is a
destructive soil-borne disease which affects nearly all cultivated,
as well as many wild and weed members of the cabbage family. It is
found worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and
tropical highlands. The fungus enters root hairs and wounded roots,
and multiplies rapidly, causing abnormal enlargement of the
underground stem, taproot, or secondary roots. These roots often
decay before the crop has matured, releasing many resting spores,
which can survive for a decade in the absence of a susceptible host
plant. Affected plants are stunted and may have discoloured purple
leaves. Due to the distortion of the root, plants may wilt in dry
weather and then recover at night.

Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores
and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides.
Raising soil pH by addition of lime has been shown to be effective
but is hardly practicable on large fields. Use of clean planting
material is essential. The pathogen includes numerous pathotypes
which makes it difficult to breed host cultivars with durable
resistance.

_Trichoderma viride_ is a fungus used as a biocontrol agent for seed
and soil treatment to prevent a range of fungal root diseases in many
crops. It counteracts other fungi by the release of growth inhibitors
and cell wall dissolving enzymes.
