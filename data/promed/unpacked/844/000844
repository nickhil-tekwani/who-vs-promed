[Two pigeons with NCD are not alarming news; the main reason for
posting this information is its encouraging demonstration of the
prevailing local alertness for avian diseases, particularly avian
influenza.

For information on earlier NCD outbreaks in Russia this year and for
background, see ProMED-Mail post 20070502.1425. - Mod.AS]
