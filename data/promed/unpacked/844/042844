BLUETONGUE - EUROPE (08): BTV-8 ORIGIN
***************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Chris Oura <Chris.Oura@bbsrc.ac.uk>

We would like to respond to the ProMED posting from the World Reference
laboratory in South Africa entitled "Bluetongue - Europe (07): BTV-8
Origin" [20061002.2826]. This is a response to the last paragraph of the
post, which states: "If we can initiate cooperation or if the BTV strain
from Europe is made available to our BTV OIE Reference Centre, we can
compare it with the South African isolates."
Our response is as follows:
Following publication of the ProMED article submitted from the WRL for
Bluetongue on 2 Oct 2006, we would like to state that the CRL proactively
contacted the WRL a week earlier than the ProMED article [27 Sep 2006] and
requested examples of BTV-8 from their data banks, indicating that we
wished to conduct detailed molecular epidemiological investigations. We
have also offered to supply them with a European strain of BTV-8 to assist
their own investigations.
