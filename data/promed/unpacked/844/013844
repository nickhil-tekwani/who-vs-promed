The Hepatitis C Trust has now urged people in Tayside who may unknowingly be caught in the epidemic to get tested now. Former and current injecting drugs users and people who received a blood transfusion before September 1991 are most at risk. Petra Wright, Scottish Officer for the UK charity, told The Courier: "The introduction of dried blood testing by NHS Tayside in 2009 means that access to testing has never been easier. NHS Tayside now delivers testing for all bloodborne viruses in 12 centres across Tayside. This initiative has seen the number of new diagnoses increase by 77 percent -- from 245 in 2007-2009 to 435 in 2009-2011 -- bringing the total for the area to 2432. This represents around half of those believed to be infected in Tayside and it is vital that those who may have been at risk in the past come forward to be tested before drug therapy is no longer an option."

It's thought that up to 5000 people in Tayside are infected with the virus. Ms Wright added: "In the last year, new drug treatment therapies have been introduced which will significantly increase the number of patients being cured. If you don't know that you have it, you can't take steps to be cured or put in place simple lifestyle changes, such as reducing alcohol intake, cutting down on smoking and improving your diet, all of which can make a significant difference to the health of someone with Hepatitis C."

Hepatitis C is a bloodborne virus that predominantly infects the cells of the liver. If left untreated, the virus can cause cirrhosis, liver cancer and death. There is no vaccine, but early treatment can successfully clear the virus in the majority of patients, and ongoing infection can be managed.

The Hepatitis C Trust's outreach and testing van is to tour a number of locations across Scotland in a bid to reach people who may not have access to the service otherwise. Organised with the support of the Scottish government and in collaboration with local health services and community groups, the aim is to offer information and testing to people who might not realise they are at risk. On Monday [10 Sep 2012], the van will visit Morrisons [supermarket] in Arbroath to provide education and testing specifically designed for Central and Eastern European immigrant populations living in the area.

[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water, or by casual contact with an infected person. The incubation period for hepatitis C is 2 weeks to 6 months. Following initial infection, approximately 80 percent of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes). About 75-85 percent of newly infected persons develop chronic disease, and 60-70 percent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 percent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 percent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C.

There is no vaccine to provide protection against infection, but hepatitis C is now a treatable disease if diagnosed early enough. The charitable organisation The Hepatitis C Trust is showing commendable initiative in targeting the population of the Tayside region of Scotland, where there is a considerable number of immigrant workers from Eastern Europe where rates of hepatitis C virus infection are high.

Tayside is a local government region of Scotland comprising a 2-tier system of regional and district councils now divided into the council areas of Perth and Kinross, Angus, and the City of Dundee, with joint police service, fire service and health boards.
