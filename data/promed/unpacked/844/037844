[1] Cholera - Tanzania (Zanzibar)

3 people have died and 9 others admitted to hospital following a cholera
outbreak on Tanzania's semiautonomous Island of Zanzibar, government
officials said on Fri, 24 Mar 2006. The deaths occurred in Pemba Island, a
sister island of the mainland of Unguja Island that forms Zanzibar. By Fri,
24 Mar 2006, 9 patients had been admitted to the cholera special centre, 2
in critical condition, Zanzibar's minister of health and social welfare,
Sultan Mohamed Mugheiry, told a news conference in Stone Town, the Zanzibar
capital.
"We had diarrhea patients last Sat, 18 Mar 2006, and one patient died
before receiving treatment at Abdallah Mzee Hospital in Pemba," he said.
"Diarrhea cases increased on 20 Mar 2006, and after the laboratory
examination, the cholera bacterium was identified in at least 5 patients."
Mugheiry said his ministry had launched awareness campaigns on how to
contain the disease. He said the ministry had also sent a team of 3 health
officials to Pemba to help curb the epidemic. He attributed the outbreak to
negligence in keeping the environment clean and public consumption of
unsafe drinking water.
The African Development Bank has supported the construction of about 180
public toilets mainly in rural areas in both islands of Unguja and Pemba,
but, according to Mugheiry, some people in villages were still relieving
themselves in bush or on the beach, instead of using the toilets.

1 person died out of 65 new cases of cholera registered in the last 24
hours, as the epidemic outbreak worsens in the Angolan capital, Luanda.
The Health Provincial Director, Vita Vemba, said that 43 cases had been
notified at Sambizanga, 20 at Boavista and 2 at Cazenga, totalling 18
deaths in 551 cases since the epidemic started in 13 Feb 2006.
Sambizanga municipality alone has registered 280 cases, surpassing
Ingombotas, the municipality where the outbreak started.
Vita Vemba has expressed concern over the occurrence of cases at Cazenga
for being the most populous municipality with around 1 million inhabitants
and presenting major basic sanitation problems.

Cholera in southern Sudan - update 2
--------------------------------------
Between 28 Jan and 20 Mar 2006, a total of 8923 cases and 238 deaths (case
fatality rate, 2.67 percent) of acute watery diarrhea have been reported
for the whole of southern Sudan. The 2 most affected areas, Juba and Yei,
reported a cumulative number of 4543 cases and 88 deaths and 1807 cases and
54 deaths, respectively.
The situation in Yei is stable and improving daily with the last reported
case received on 20 Mar 2006 and only sporadic cases appearing in the town.
The outbreak in Yei was declared officially over by the Under Secretary of
Health of the Government of southern Sudan on 14 Mar 2006. The situation
in Juba is improving as the number of cases has consistently decreased over
the past 3 weeks, although the full rainy season has not yet arrived.
However, a total of 2573 cases and 96 deaths (case fatality rate, 3.73
percent), with some cases laboratory confirmed for _Vibrio cholerae_ Inaba,
have been reported in the locations outside Yei and Juba. Monitoring of the
outbreak is crucial.
Control measures including strengthening of the surveillance and reporting
system, improving uniform case management and water chlorination are
continuing.

An undiagnosed cholera-like disease has hit a district in northern Uganda,
killing at least 8 people over the last 10 days, local media reported on
Wed, 22 Mar 2006. The unusual abdominal infection with symptoms similar to
those of cholera had killed 2 in Maduga village, Obongi county, south of
Moyo district.
Hassan Kaps Fungaroho, Obongi county MP-elect said Tue, 21 Mar 2006, that
the 6 people died over the weekend, making the death toll to at least
8. The first victim of this unknown infection died on 11 Mar 2006 while
the 2nd died last Wed, 15 Mar 2006, showing signs of the disease, include
vomiting, watery diarrhea and rapid dehydration.
Fungaroho, a trained medical clinical officer, said 22 people had been
admitted to Obongi health center in critical condition, with the same
symptoms as the deceased. He said at least 5 people were admitted everyday
with diarrhea, adding that the strange disease might have been caused by
the unsafe water sources after the breakdown of the water source that
forced people to draw water from River Nile.
Earlier reports said the disease could be cholera, but turned out to be
inaccurate, according to Dr Sarafin A'dibaku, the District Director of
Health Services. "It is a kind of diarrhea we cannot explain, but
certainly, it is not cholera," A'dibaku said.

[6] Cholera - Mozambique (Nampula)
Date: Tue, 21 Mar 2006

Last week's outbreak of cholera in the northern Mozambican province of
Nampula, which has so far claimed at least 9 lives, is spreading to other
districts, reports Tuesday's issue of the daily paper "Noticias". The
outbreak was first noted in Monapo and Malema districts, but has now
reached Meconta district, where 30 new cases were recorded in the last 2
days, all admitted to the Namialo health center.
The Namialo administrative post, on the crossroads between the main highway
from Nampula city to the port of Nacala, and the road to the northernmost
province of Cabo Delgado, had been notifying a number of cases of acute
diarrhea in adults over the last few days, and laboratory analysis, carried
out in Nampula city, confirmed that this was indeed cholera. But no deaths
have so far been reported here.
Namialo has been facing a serious water supply crisis, and with the recent
heavy rains people started using water directly from the Monapo river,
drinking it without any treatment. The health authorities believe this is
the source of contamination. To deal with the situation, district and
health authorities in Meconta have launched a joint awareness campaign to
mobilize people to observe prevention measures, namely the use of chlorine
or boiling the water before drinking it.
According to health minister Ivo Garrido, since the start of this year
about 3000 cases of cholera have been notified. The overwhelming majority
-- over 80 percent -- have been in the central province of Sofala. The
other provinces that have notified cases are Manica and Zambezia.
