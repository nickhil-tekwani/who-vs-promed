Six die of cholera in Mailsi [unconfirmed
------------------------------------------
VEHARI, July 4: More than 100 cholera patients were admitted to government
and private hospitals in Mailsi on Wednesday. According to unconfirmed
reports, at least 6 people have so far died in various private hospitals of
cholera.
A Vehari district health office official said cholera epidemic had broken
out in Faddah Town, where more than 3000 people out of 6000 residents [50
percent were admitted to hospitals during the last 2 days. A doctors' team
with anti-cholera vaccine and other medicines had been sent to Mailsi,
where it has set up a camp.
Some people told this correspondent that the medicines were insufficient in
view of the number of patients, and at least 3 more medical camps should be
set up in the area. They said a large number of patients belonged to poor
families and could not afford to purchase medicines.
According to some people, the epidemic broke out due to mixing of sewage in
clean drinking water from a leaking pipe. They said they had informed the
municipality about it. According to a health official, they had collected a
drinking water sample and sent it to Lahore for laboratory testing.
Meanwhile, the Vehari District Health Officer has advised the people to use
boiled water and avoid over-eating [sic.

There are 4 people dead from diarrhea and many others affected in Yamin
Jokhio Goth, 58 km from Karachi and 3 km from Super Highway. The Edhi Trust
attributes the outbreak of diarrhea to the consumption of contaminated
water, food, and the heat.
The exact cause of the deaths could not be established, but medical experts
said these could be the result of cholera, as many of the victims had shown
symptoms of cholera, such as rice water stool. An Edhi team that has set up
its medical camp in the village told visiting newsmen that every second
house in the 50-house village had been suffering from long bouts of
vomiting and diarrhea for the past many days. Dr Liaquat, posted at the
camp, said they had been providing patients with ORS [oral rehydration
salts, an effective treatment and other medicines and were referring
serious cases to Karachi's hospitals.
Residents told newsmen that they got panicked when they found that one
young person had died with the symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea after the
death of a 90-year-old woman. The woman, residents said, had also developed
the same problems before she died. According to a resident, both the deaths
took place in a matter of days, and gradually about 50 residents of the
small village of laborers also began to develop similar symptoms.
According to experts, a number of people, particularly those living in
Kutchi Abadis and on the periphery of Karachi and interior of Sindh, have
contracted cholera resulting in the death of a number of people in the past
weeks. The experts said although there existed no proper documentation
about the number of deaths claimed by the disease in the city, the cholera
positive cases had been reported in various city hospitals, including Aga
Khan University Hospital.

[Travelers should beware; a case of cholera arrived in Germany recently, in
a worker returning from Pakistan -- see: Cholera, imported - Germany,
Kazakhstan (02) 20010701.1261 It is interesting that a national newspaper
reports probable cholera when the official position of Pakistan is that
cholera does not occur there, and the country has not reported a single
case to WHO for years. - Mod.JW
