Saskatchewan Horses Test Positive for West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------------
Six horses in Saskatchewan have been diagnosed with West Nile Virus. Horse
owners are encouraged to take preventative measures. A vaccine can be
obtained through your veterinarian for conditional use.
West Nile virus is a flavivirus that can infect many different types of
animals but causes sickness only in a small number of species. In North
America, humans, horses, and especially members of the crow family (crows,
ravens, magpies, blue and gray jays) are at most risk for serious illness.
Illness due to West Nile Virus has not been found among sheep, pigs, and
cattle. The main reservoir for the virus is thought to be wild waterfowl.
The West Nile Virus is spread from bird to bird, and to other animals, by
the bites of mosquitoes. The horse is a dead-end host for West Nile Virus;
the virus does not spread from horse to horse, or to other animals,
including humans.
West Nile virus first appeared in North America in 1999 and has spread
steadily across the country over the past 3 years. The virus was detected
in birds in Manitoba in early July 2002, and has now been found in some
locations in Saskatchewan. On Wed 4 Sep 2002, Saskatchewan confirmed its
first positive case of the virus in horses.
The West Nile virus vaccine for horses is not licensed for use in Canada
but can be obtained as a conditional-use vaccine. The vaccine is available
through veterinarians only. The veterinarian must keep detailed records on
what horses are vaccinated (breed, age, reproductive status, etc.), lot
numbers, results, and reactions. A blood sample before vaccination may be
recommended especially if the horse could be exported.
