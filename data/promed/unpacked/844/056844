Known as paralytic rabies or 'derriengue', cattle farmers from Perla
de la Chontalpa [popular name for the municipality of Comalcalco]
fear for the terrible disease that is causing death among their
herds, and even say it is difficult to cope with the disease due to
the high cost of inputs required to counteract the disease.

In this regard, the president of the Regional Livestock Associations,
Juan Daniel Chavez, said it is hard to determine where the disease is
originating because they [Perla de la Chontalpa] are connected by a
large road to the communities of Paraiso, Cunduacan, and Cardenas,
and the situation negatively affects the producers in general.

He said that health authorities focused medical attention on 3 people
from the cattle farms who had contact with livestock that tested
positive for bovine paralytic rabies according to a diagnosis.

Municipal authorities confirmed that at least 10 of 12 animals tested
positive for the disease and therefore urgently implemented a
vaccination campaign to prevent paralytic rabies among the more than
1600 local cattle farmers.

He mentioned that apart from this locality, [he] is aware that the
federal government is implementing vaccination programs throughout the state.

Paralytic rabies is transmitted by a bat, according to data from the
Sedafot [Secretariat for Agricultural and Forestry Development]. A
practice called "trapping" which consists of trapping some species of
the vampire bat and adding an ointment (Vampiret) on the body, so
that the bat will bring it to the caves or nests [of the bats] and
infect the rest of the animals so they will then die. [They groom the
anticoagulant off of each other. - Mod.TG]

He added that close to 10 000 [doses of] the vaccine called
"Alurabiffa", which costs MXN 2.50 [USD 0.20], have been distributed
among the producers for them to vaccinate their livestock.

In an interview MVZ [veterinarian] Donato Alvarez Heredia explained
that rabies encephalitis is caused by a Rhabdovirus and it affects
all warm-blooded animals. The transmission [of rabies] is through
bites from other animals that have the virus in their saliva. In
cattle the most significant agent is the vampire bat, called
_Desmodus rotundus_, followed by the dog. The disease can also be
spread by wild animals such as foxes, raccoons, and some cats.

Finally, he said that when "we suspect an outbreak of rabies, no one
should touch these animals. And if there are personnel to remove the
brain for laboratory examination, they must wear gloves, and the job
should be done with great care, because if during the work [for
example,] they get saliva in their eye(s), they must be vaccinated.
[Hopefully these workers wear eye protection or preferably a face
shield. - Mod.TG]

In cattle, the incubation period ranges from 25 to more than 150
days. And, while the duration of illness is usually 2-5 days, it may
extend to 8-10 days, and we must say that just from the signs we
cannot distinguish whether the rabies came from a dog or a vampire bite.

[Vampire bats have frequently been known to transmit rabies and
finding a bat shelter with large number of bats, does not mean all
the bats have rabies and consequently a larger number of animals will
be found ill.

Rabies is a method of controlling vampire bats, as it will cause them
to die. In addition, since most vampire bats feed at the same
location, spearing anticoagulant on the bovines in locations where
the bats feed will provide a dose of anticoagulant that will kill the
bat in 3 or 4 days. Capturing some of the bats and spreading
anticoagulant on the back of the bats allows them to take it to their
roost where they groom each other and the anticoagulant reaches more
of the colony. This has been shown to be effective in Mexico, but is
labor intensive and not without its own risk.

Vaccination of the animals is a good idea, prior to providing a
buffet of new blood for the rabid vampire bats.

Vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) are small (25-35 grams/0.8-1.2
oz), winged mammals, with a wingspan of 25-35 cm (10-14 in) and a
body about the size of an adult's thumb. They use echolocation to
find their prey. Having once found their prey, they use sharp teeth
to make an incision and lap the blood as it flows from the wound.
Vampire bats do not chew their food, rather they lap it, and
consequently have fewer teeth than other bats. Vampire bat saliva is
better at keeping blood from clotting than any known medicine.
Vampire bats may one day help prevent heart attacks and strokes,
according to many bat researchers.

Although there are 3 species of vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_,
the common vampire bat; _Diphylla ecaudata_, hairy-legged vampire
bat; and _Diaemus youngi_, the white-winged vampire bat), as far as I
understand, only the common vampire bat is significantly involved
with bovine paralytic rabies. This is supported by Brass (1994) who
notes the following (p. 58-59): "although they may become infected
with the rabies virus, _Diaemus_ and _Diphylla_ are generally not
considered to be significant in the cycle of rabies transmission to
livestock or humans. Few investigations have been made of these bats
and little is known of their habits or biology" (Greenhall, 1972a).
_Desmodus_ is the most common of the vampires, has the widest
distribution, and is the most well known of the 3. _Diaemus_ is the
rarest and least studied. The relative abundance of _Desmodus_ may be
related to its more liberal tastes in animal blood and the wider
range of its host populations (Villa-Ramirez, 1969). Of the 3 species
of vampire bats, the common vampire bat, _Desmodus rotundus_, is
implicated almost exclusively in the transmission of paralytic rabies
to livestock (Greenhall, 1974).

A lack of a significant link between the other 2 species of vampires
and bovine paralytic rabies is somewhat to be expected. _Diphylla_
and _Diaemus_ both apparently prefer avian blood rather than
mammalian blood. They are much less likely to use cattle as a host
species. Indeed, _Diphylla_ is thought to be close to an avian blood
specialist. More information can be found in Greenhall (1988).

Clinical signs of rabies in cattle may include evidence of
neurological disease, loss of coordination (specially in hind legs),
excessive salivation, anorexia, tenesmus, ataxia, drowsiness,
dyspnea, aggressiveness, and in some cases, diarrhea and pneumonia.
Rabies is preventable in cattle with a vaccine.

The paralytic form of rabies is first manifested by paralysis of the
throat and masseter muscles, often with profuse salivation and
inability to swallow. Dropping of the lower jaw is common in dogs.
Owners frequently examine the mouth of dogs and livestock searching
for a foreign body or administer medication with their bare hands,
thereby exposing themselves to rabies. These animals may not be
vicious and rarely attempt to bite. The paralysis progresses rapidly
to all parts of the body, and coma and death follow in a few hours.
The latter is very much what seems to be happening with the livestock
described above.

Rabies is known to be transmitted by the 'bite' of the vampire bat
because the virus resides in the saliva. Rabies is identified through
testing of the brain of a deceased animal.

Rabies can pass from bovines to people, but the animal must bite the
person or the person must have contact with saliva of the animal and
it must enter the human body, through a cut, scratch, the mucus
membranes of the eye, the nose, or the mouth. So it is not casual
contact that will infect the person. The bovines usually have a
distinctive bellow when they are infected with rabies. Although this
is not a diagnostic quality, it is unusual enough that many
veterinarians recognize it. Nevertheless consumption of diseased
animals is not recommended.
