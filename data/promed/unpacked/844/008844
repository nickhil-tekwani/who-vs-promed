A 10-month-old girl has been struck down by "swine flu", in the first case
of its kind in Hong Kong and only the third known infection from pigs
worldwide.
Experts at the United States Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta are
investigating, as the Hong Kong Department of Health tries to find out how
the girl who had no contact with pigs became infected.
The girl was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital last month and discharged after
treatment for an upper respiratory infection; her unusual condition did not
emerge for several weeks.
During her hospital stay, a nasal swab was taken for testing by the
Department of Health, which on Tuesday confirmed that she had the influenza
H3N2 virus. The highly infectious human strains of influenza, Sydney and
Harbin flu viruses, are also H3N2, but in this case swab tests revealed the
girl did not catch the bug from another person.
"The initial analysis suggests that this virus may be of swine origin and
therefore we are carrying out further investigations," department
consultant on community medicine Dr Mak Kwok-hang said.
"According to her family members, this baby girl has had no history of
contact with pigs." A Tuen Mun Hospital spokeswoman said the girl, an only
child, had been discharged in good health on 10 Sep 1999, two days after
being admitted to the paediatrics ward with a cough and fever. She had not
been ill since and had not been readmitted to hospital. The girl's
parents, who live in a Tuen Mun public housing estate, have not been
unwell, and have tested negative for the H3N2 flu virus.
Dr Mak said H3N2 had been transmitted between humans for decades, and had
been passed from people to pigs. In this case, pigs had passed it back to a
human.
Only two other cases of such transmission have been reported in unrelated
cases in the Netherlands in 1993, a boy and a girl were diagnosed with H3N2
picked up from pigs.
The boy's father worked on a pig farm, but the girl's family reported no
connection with pigs. Symptoms again were mild and the children recovered
without infecting family members.
Dr Mak said this particular H3N2 did not appear to be particularly
infectious, and said comparisons with the H5N1 bird flu outbreak of 1997
were "unfair", as this virus was not a new disease.
"We're of the opinion that this present case is a scientific discovery
which does not appear to pose any major threat to public health." He said
flu was picked up by breathing in airborne secretions from an infected
person or animal, and was not food-borne.
"There's no risk of getting influenza by eating pork," he said. Hong Kong
Medical Association infectious diseases specialist Dr Lo Wing-lok said he
was not worried by the Hong Kong girl's case. "In fact, I'm encouraged,
because this shows that our surveillance system is very sensitive," he said.
Epidemics humans picked up and passed between each other a disease
previously found only in animals, Dr Lo said. "I don't think it's very
likely to happen in this case," he said.
Both Dr Lo and Dr Mak said health care workers needed to be vigilant and
watch out for any further cases. The results of more tests on the sample
sent to the US are expected by the end of the week. In 1997, six people in
Hong Kong died of "bird flu", the H5N1 strain of influenza previously known
only in birds.

COMMENT
As the article suggests, because of intensive surveillance in Hong Kong,
transmission to humans of avian and porcine influenza A viruses is likely
to be documented with increasing frequency. Hong Kong's H5N1 avian
influenza outbreak two years ago caused international alarm, and led to
expanded surveillance for human and zoonotic influenza A circulation.
Although human infection with porcine influenza viruses has long been
known, the implications for viral evolution and development of pathogenic
potential are incompletely understood. In addition to H1N1 viruses, H3N2
viruses also circulate in pigs. Pig to human and human to pig H3N2
transmission have both been documented, and it has long been thought that
pigs may play a role in the generation of new human strains. As pigs may
be infected with human, pig, and avian influenza strains, they are a
potential source of new viral reassortants. Pigs, for example, might play
a catalytic role in "transforming" avian viral strains into human viral
equivalents. The Hong Kong newspaper report does not suggest that this was
the case, however.
Important additional questions include whether pig to human transmission is
common, whether clinically apparent human cases are the exception to the
rule, and whether such instances are background noise, or constitute a
potential risk for emergence of a new pandemic viruses. Based on the
information provided, Dr. Mak's comment that there seems to be little human
threat seems reasonable. That CDC is assisting in the investigation is
also good news. This and recent influenza events provide continuing
opportunities to learn more, via coordinated epidemiologic and viral
genetic study, about critical aspects of human-zoonotic influenza virus
relationships, leading to a better understanding of where human viruses
come from and how to control and prevent them.
