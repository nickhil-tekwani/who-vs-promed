The caseload of cholera is rapidly increasing in South Sudan and the potentially deadly, contagious disease appears to be spreading, UNICEF said today, 19 May 2014.

Since the outbreak of cholera in the capital Juba late last week, the reported cholera caseload has doubled every day; now with new reported cases in 2 additional states, Jonglei and Upper Nile. After the 1st case was confirmed in Juba 4 days ago, more than 130 additional cases are now being treated. There are 3 confirmed deaths. Dozens of children are among the affected. "The severity of the cholera outbreak is just one manifestation of a country failing its children," said Jonathan Veitch, UNICEF representative in South Sudan. "Cholera puts ever more strain on the most vulnerable, whose health is already compromised by a nutritional crisis."

Since January 2014, UNICEF has warned of the threat of cholera, due to the desperate overcrowding of camps following continued violence, and now the rainy season. In April 2014, UNICEF said that unless nutrition treatment is scaled up immediately, up to 50 000 children under the age of five are likely to die.

In response to the cholera outbreak, UNICEF has helped establish a Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC) at the Juba Teaching Hospital. It also provided life-saving supplies, including medicines, protective gear and equipment, and is expanding preventive measures to halt further spread across the country.

[The Upper Nile state is north of, and bordering with, the Jonglei state as can be seen on a map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SouthSudanStates.svg. Over the few days since the cholera outbreak has been reported, the number of cases has increased by an order of magnitude and now 3 states are involved. - Mod.LL
