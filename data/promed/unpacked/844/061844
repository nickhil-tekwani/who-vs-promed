Poultry recall for Listeria outbreak widens
-----------------------------
WASHINGTON - A New Jersey poultry company linked to a _Listeria
monocytogenes_ outbreak that sickened 50 people in the Northeast expanded
its recall of ready-to-eat turkey and chicken to 4.2 million pounds, the US
Agriculture Department said today, 21 Nov 2002.
Privately held Jack Lambersky, which does business as J.L. Foods Co. Inc.,
launched the recall after inspection of a product sample collected on 14
Nov 2002 tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_, a potentially deadly
bacteria for especially immune suppressed individuals and pregnant women.
"The sample is being further analyzed to determine whether or not it
matches the outbreak strain," the USDA said in a statement.
The company said the recalled products were produced between 1 June 2002
and 6 Nov 2002 and distributed to retail stores and institutions
nationwide. The product bears establishment code "P-4340" inside the USDA
seal of inspection.
Spokesman Lynn Kettleson said officials "assume a goodly portion of the
product was consumed."
On 2 Nov 2002, the company recalled 200 000 pounds of poultry, after its
products were linked to an outbreak in the Northeast that has killed 7
people. USDA said the strain found in both incidents were
"indistinguishable." Despite the government's findings, the company said
"to our knowledge, no one has become ill as a result of consuming these
products."
Pilgrim's Pride, the No. 3 poultry producer based in Pittsburg, Texas, was
also linked to the listeriosis outbreak. It recalled 27.4 million pounds of
its Wampler brand turkey and chicken, a record recall. Despite USDA
test results finding the listeria outbreak strain at its plant, Pilgrim's
Pride also has said its products were not to blame for the illnesses.
Jack Lambersky's plant in Camden, N.J., was voluntarily closed after the
initial recall of 200 000 pounds. USDA said last week it would allow the
plant to resume operations after inspectors approved the company's new food
safety measures.
Despite the expanded recall, the USDA said the plant remained open because
the 14 Nov 2002 sample that tested positive for listeria was actually
produced on 30 Aug 2002. "The plant is still open because all the (USDA)
action took place at the 2 Nov 2002 recall," said Steve Cohen, spokesman
for USDA's Food Safetyand Inspection Service. "The complete plant was
cleaned up."
The company said it was working closely with USDA determining the origin of
the listeria contamination. "We are communicating to all of our impacted
customers and are providing instructions on how the should handle the
products covered by the recall," the company said in a statement.
Faced with severe criticism from consumer groups and some Democrats on lax
enforcement, the USDA said it would increase listeria testing at certain
plants. About 1 500 meat plants that either do not test for listeria or
choose not to share their results with USDA were subject to USDA's
directive, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on 18 Nov. The directive
will take effect on 9 Dec 2002.
The new directive would not have prevented the listeria recalls at Jack
Lambersky or Pilgrim's Pride because both claim they routinely test their
plants and products for the bacteria.

Recall Notification Report 098-2002 Expanded, 21 Nov 2002
---------------------------------------------------------------
Product(s) Recalled: Fresh and Frozen Ready-To-Eat Turkey and Chicken Products
In response to an ongoing food safety investigation, FSIS collected
microbiological investigative sample on 14 Nov 2002, that returned positive
results for _Listeria monocytogenes_ on 20 Nov 2002. Based on this positive
the firm has voluntarily expanded the recall 098-2002 to include turkey and
chicken products produced between 29 May 2002 and 2 Nov 2002. The sample is
being further analyzed to determine whether or not it matches the outbreak
strain.
Production Dates/Identifying Codes:
Produced between 29 May 2002 and 2 Nov 2002. Each product label bears the
establishment number "P-4340" inside the USDA mark of inspection. [The long
list of the products under recall can be found at the above web site. -
Mod. LL]
Problem/Reason for Recall:
The products may be contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_.
How/When Discovered:
On 3 Oct 2002, FSIS collected samples from retail as part of an ongoing
food safety investigation of illnesses in the Northeastern United States.
An intact sample was reported positive for _L. monocytogenes_ by the FSIS
Outbreaks Laboratory. The positive results strongly suggest that the
recalled products may be linked to the source of the widespread illnesses
in the Northeastern US. Based on this information firm has voluntarily
initiated the recall and suspended its operations.
In response to an on-going food safety investigation, FSIS collected
microbiological investigative sample on 14 Nov 2002, that returned positive
results for _L. monocytogenes_ on 20 Nov 2002. Based on this positive the
firm has voluntarily expanded the recall 098-2002 to include turkey and
chicken products produced between 29 May 2002 and 2 Nov 2002. The sample is
being further analyzed to determine whether or not it matches the outbreak
strain.
