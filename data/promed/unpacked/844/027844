Mystery disease perplexes doctors in Narmada district
-----------------------------------------------------
The symptoms are such that the patient sometimes can't even walk due to
severe joint pain and can barely eat one roti. Though officials say the
condition isn't fatal, it has left patients and doctors in areas of Narmada
district perplexed, for they are unable to diagnose the disease, which
locals call Tutiawa. The disease has now been reported in Rajpipla, the
district headquarters for the Narmada district, Lachhras and Sisodra. About
a week ago, similar cases were reported from Wajeria, also in Narmada district.
Health officials said that for 4 days now, they have been treating about 40
cases of this mystery disease each day. Earlier, an NGO working in Narmada
said that there were 1250 cases of Tutiawa in Wajeria and its surrounding
areas.
Chief physician of the Netra Seva Trust Hospital in Rajpipla, Dr J R Singh,
says he's never seen anything like this. "We have been treating about 40
patients every day who complain of severe body pain and fever. I have never
in my experience come across an illness like this," he said. But government
and private health doctors say the disease is not fatal and that patients
showed signs of recovery after 5 days and were completely cured after 10 days.
Singh also said that some cases were so severe that the patients were
carried by friends and relatives to the hospital. He added that the
patients were coming not only from Rajpipla, but surrounding villages as
well. However, Narmada chief district health officer, Dr B N Patel said
that the disease was being spread by mosquitoes, which the government is
working hard to eliminate. He also said that the situation was under
control and that blood and serum analysis reports had been sent to
Ahmedabad last week.

[Given the level of chikungunya activity already reported in India in areas
neighboring the above mentioned Nargada district in Gujarat (see
ProMED-mail postings below), it is highly probable that the "unknown
outbreak" described above is due to chikungunya virus infection in the
area. Dengue fever is another possibility.
Obviously, ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from knowledgeable
individuals in the area and results of laboratory tests as they become
available. Irrespective of a chikungunya or dengue fever diagnosis,
reduction of vector _Aedes_ mosquitoes is indicated in order to reduce
transmission.
A district map of Nargada can be found at
<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/gujarat/districts/narmada.htm>; a map of
the state of Gujarat can be found at
<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/gujarat/gujaratroads.htm>. On this latter
map, one can see that Nargada borders Maharashtra state where there has
been significant chikungunya activity, as well in Gujarat state itself (see
prior ProMED-mail postings). - Mods.MPP,JW,TY]

New illness in town
-------------------
Viral fever has taken a more menacing avatar this season. In the capital,
people are reporting high fever accompanied by nausea, joint pain and
headache that refuse to respond to medication, like paracetamol, for the
1st few days.
Frightening though it may sound, the symptoms are like chikungunya's, a
viral disease that spreads through _Aedes_ mosquitoes and has struck parts
of Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. Says Dr Sunil Gambhir, professor of
pediatrics, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital: "Though chikungunya has never
occurred in Delhi, I wouldn't be surprised if some cases are reported here,
as people traveling to other states may come back infected with the virus."
The symptoms are fever that lasts 7-10 days, headache, fatigue, nausea,
muscle pain, and rashes. Acute infection may need hospital treatment and
last up to a couple of weeks. Joint pain and fatigue last for several weeks
in some patients. "In severe cases, joints also swell up," says Gambhir.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for chikungunya, and
the only way to treat it is to bring down the fever and pain by taking
paracetamol, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Since it is a form of platelet
dysfunction like dengue, patients should avoid aspirin. The only way to
detect the virus is to send blood samples to the National Institute of
Communicable Diseases (NICD) for serology tests. Since the disease has
never occurred in Delhi before, no one -- neither health officials nor
those infected -- [has done] the tests.

[It appears that chikungunya virus continues to spread rapidly across
India. As with the situation in Gujarat posted above, ProMED-mail requests
the results of the laboratory tests as they become available. A major
chikungunya epidemic in a city with a large population like New Delhi's
would seriously tax the health care delivery system and place significant
demands on vector control programs. A map of India can be accessed at
