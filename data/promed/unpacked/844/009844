Health organisations in Angola are scrambling to identify a disease
that has surfaced in Uige Province, in the north, and in Huila
Province, in the south, to prevent further transmission and treat
fatally ill patients -- half of whom have already died.
"We have seen more than 35 cases since November and 50 per cent of
the patients were dying," Karen Godley, head of mission in Angola for
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)-Switzerland, told IRIN.
Although located at opposite ends of Angola, Uige and Huila, both
have a growing number of patients with symptoms like "bloody
diarrhoea", Godly said. "We have no idea what we are dealing with --
there is an urgency to identify the pathogen to protect communities
and health workers, and to provide the best treatment for patients."
Pathogens are disease-causing agents, such as bacteria or viruses.
Of the 16 cases in Uige, 6 have been fatal, according to Monica
Camacho, head of mission in Angola for MSF-Spain. "There are few
patients, but the fatality rate is high."
Health organisations are still in the dark as to how the disease is
spread. "We are trying to find out, together with the government and
the World Health organisation [WHO], if there is a common link to
determine how the illness is transmitted -- experts are trying to
find out if it is water, food or mosquitoes," Camacho said.
According to Dr Satounata Diallo, WHO country representative in
Angola, "this is not Ebola or Marburg". In 2005 Angola saw the
largest-ever recorded outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, a rare
but fatal disease caused by a virus from the same family as the Ebola
virus.
Patients have shown bleeding of the gastro-intestinal tract and
perforations in the stomach. Diallo said, "judging by the symptoms,
doctors suspect yellow fever, typhoid or leptospirosis, with yellow
fever as the main suspect."
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease, with symptoms that include high
fever, muscle aches, vomiting, and sometimes jaundice, with abdominal
pain, diarrhoea, or a rash. Left untreated, it can lead to kidney
damage, meningitis, liver failure and respiratory distress.
Large outbreaks of yellow fever, a viral disease spread by
mosquitoes, have occurred in Africa. According to the WHO, infection
can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms, from mild discomfort to severe
illness and death, but 15 per cent of patients enter a "toxic phase"
within 24 hours and complain of abdominal pain with vomiting.
Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes and/or stomach and,
once that happens, blood appears in the vomit and faeces.
Godley said there was no indication to suggest that the outbreaks in
Huila and Uige were related. "We are probably looking at 2 different
things, but it is urgent that the pathogens are identified. We do not
believe that we are dealing with a viral hemorrhagic fever [like
Marburg] in Huila, but we cannot completely rule out the possibility
without proper and highly sophisticated laboratory testing."
Angola lacks the capacity to conduct adequate testing and
epidemiological surveillance. Disease samples were sent to the US
National Health Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
laboratories in Dakar, in Senegal, and Atlanta, in the United States,
earlier this week. "We are waiting for results and remain on high
alert," Camacho said.
