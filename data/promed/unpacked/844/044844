Background data, fatal malaria cases, Germany
------------------------------------
The 2 cases initially suspected of haemorrhagic fever [were finally
[confirmed as falciparum malaria.
_Plasmodium falciparum_ accounted for 59.4 percent of cases imported to
Germany during 1989 to 1995, with a case-fatality rate of 3.60 percent
among patients infected with this species. Eighty percent of cases reported
in 1999 were due to _P. falciparum_.

[_P. falciparum_ malaria is a potentially lethal disease if not treated in
time.
Malaria has no specific symptoms and should be suspected in all febrile
patients returning from malaria-endemic areas. Apparently the patients in
this case were not aware that they could get malaria in Burkina Faso and
that fever was a key symptom. Information to travellers and
chemoprophylaxis is mandatory for travellers to Africa south of the Sahara.
