A new type of the H5N2 avian influenza virus detected at goose farms in southern Taiwan has never been seen before, the director-general of Taiwan's government-run Animal Health Research Institute said Sunday [11 Jan 2015].

Tsai Hsiang-jung said the H5N2 subtype flu strain is a recombinant virus, and "after reporting the case to the World Organization for Animal Health, it will be the 1st of its kind in the world."

The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture confirmed Sunday [11 Jan 2015] an outbreak of the new H5N2 strain at 4 goose farms in Yunlin County and a duck egg farm in Pingtung County.

It also confirmed an outbreak of H5N8 avian flu at a goose farm in Chiayi County.

A total of 24 farms raising ducks and geese around Taiwan sent tissue samples to be tested amid suspicions that their birds may have been infected with avian flu.

6 farms were found to be infected by 2 viruses that had never been detected in Taiwan before, the bureau said.

After analyzing the new H5N2 subtype, the bureau said the H5 subtype was 99 percent similar to that seen in the H5N8 flu virus that attacked South Korea in 2014, while the N2 subtype was 96 percent similar to the virus that hit China's Jilin Province in 2011.

The H5N8 infection found in tissue samples from geese raised on a farm in Dalin Township in Chiayi County was identified as similar to the South Korean H5N8 avian flu virus, according to the bureau.

The H5 subtype is 99 percent similar to the Korean strain, while the N8 subtype is 98 percent similar, the bureau said. Both the new H5N2 and the H5N8 virus strains are highly pathogenic, the bureau noted.

[According to information published on 17 Dec 2014 by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD), HPAI H5N2 virus detected earlier in poultry in British Columbia (BC), Canada, was sequenced and found to contain gene segments from the HPAI Eurasian H5N8 virus, including the H5 gene, and segments from typical North American viruses, including the N2 gene; see a detailed media report in 20141221.3047300.

The CFIA report included the following information: "this is the 1st time a Eurasian lineage highly pathogenic H5 virus has caused an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry in North America".

"The appearance of this particular reassortant virus is significant due to its ability to cause high mortality in domestic poultry. The CFIA continues to take swift action in response to this virus.

"While there are no reports of H5N2 related illness in humans, as a precautionary measure public health officials are monitoring workers who are exposed to affected poultry" (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/2014-ai-investigation-in-bc/statement-2014-12-17/eng/1418831375455/1418831451437).

Further information on the HPAI H5N2 virus reportedly found in domestic ducks and geese in Taiwan's counties Yunlin and Pingtung, including its comparison to the Canadian HPAI H5N2 recombinant, will be of interest. Is the Taiwan outbreak a reflection of the apparent intercontinental spread of the current Eurasian lineage highly pathogenic H5 virus by wild birds?

Taiwan has submitted on Mon 12 Jan 2015 a notification to the OIE informing an HPAI H5N8 outbreak in a breeding goose farm in the county Chiayi. This report (covered under a separate posting) does not mention the HPAI H5N2 outbreaks discussed above. - Mod.AS]
