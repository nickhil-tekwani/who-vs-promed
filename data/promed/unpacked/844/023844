----------------------------------------------------------------------
_Vibrio cholerae_ serogroups O1 and O139 are toxigenic strains associated with epidemic cholera; however, other _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroups, such as O75 and O141, can also produce cholera toxin, leading to a cholera-like illness identified as vibriosis (1). Cholera and vibriosis are more common in the Gulf Coast region of the USA and are related to exposure to coastal water sources and consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish. Persons typically become ill approximately 24-72 hours after exposure. Symptoms can last from 3 to 7 days and range from mild diarrhea to profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to severe dehydration, hospitalization, and death (2).

In October 2017, Nebraska state and local health department officials received an electronic laboratory report of stool culture positive for _V. cholera_. The Three Rivers Health Department in Fremont, Nebraska, began an investigation and completed a patient interview using the Cholera and Other _Vibrio_ Illness Surveillance (COVIS) system form.

The patient, a woman from Nebraska aged 51 years, had recently traveled to Florida. She reported exposure of her feet in the Gulf of Mexico and consumption of raw oysters at a local restaurant. She developed diarrhea approximately 36-48 hours after eating at the restaurant. Upon return to Nebraska, she sought medical care and a stool specimen was collected, from which _V. cholerae_ was isolated. The patient was not hospitalized and recovered from the illness. The isolate was forwarded to the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory where additional phenotypic testing presumptively identified the isolate as _V. cholerae_. The isolate was subsequently submitted to CDC for serotyping and molecular testing to confirm the species identification and to test for the presence of cholera toxin genes. The isolate, which was confirmed as _V. cholerae_ by rpoB gene sequencing, was subsequently identified as serogroup O141 and reported as positive for the ctxA cholera toxin gene and the ompW gene but negative for the toxR and tcpA genes. Although genes coding virulence within the _V. cholerae_ strains can vary, these virulence genes can be used to assess the epidemic potential of this species. For example, both the ctxA gene and the toxR gene (the regulatory gene that controls expression of cholera toxin) are commonly found in the O1 and O139 epidemic strains of _V. cholerae_. A traceback investigation by the Florida Department of Agriculture found that the oysters consumed were harvested from the Gulf Coast region in either Florida or Louisiana. No other cases were identified.

Although O141 has not been found to be an outbreak-associated strain, toxigenic _V. cholerae_ serogroup O141 has been associated with sporadic illness in the USA (1,3). These infections have been associated with seafood exposure in Florida and New Jersey and freshwater exposure in Arizona, Michigan, Missouri, and Texas. Since the initiation of COVIS in 1988, 16 cases of toxigenic O141 have been reported in the USA. This is the first case reported from Nebraska.

Vibriosis has been a nationally notifiable condition since 2007. Vibrio species are difficult to culture, because they are not easily identified using routine enteric media and often require selective media. However, detection of _Vibrio _species might become more common with increased use of culture-independent diagnostic testing (CIDT) using molecular-based methods, which are considered to be more sensitive than are standard cultures. Some of these CIDT assays are designed to detect a subset of _Vibrio_ species and might not identify all cases or only identify cases as vibriosis without species information. For example, the FilmArray Gastrointestinal Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) has genomic targets for both _Vibrio_ species and _Vibrio cholerae_. The manufacturer's instructions for this assay indicate a limitation for detecting strains of _V. cholerae_ that do not carry the toxR gene, suggesting that the isolate in this case, without culture follow-up, could have been detected only as a _Vibrio_ species. Therefore, CDC asks that state health departments submit all _V. cholerae_ isolates for confirmatory testing and additional characterization and suggests that states consider reflex culture testing on specimens identified through CIDT as _Vibrio_ species or _V. cholerae_. States that require reporting of vibriosis cases should consider the role confirmatory culture testing plays in the assessment of relevant risk factors to improve public health detection and case management.

[As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are non-virulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

Not here, but in almost all cases, non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ isolates do not possess the genes for cholera toxin as the non-toxigenic O1 in this posting. Some isolates can cause substantial diarrhea (1-4). The type III secretion system (TTSS) is a mechanism for Gram negative bacilli to introduce effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm (5). It has been reported that a functional TTSS is required for at least in some non-O1, non-O139 isolates to induce diarrhea in an animal model associated with small bowel damage and production of proinflammatory cytokines (6). In addition, TTSS contributes to virulence even in the presence of cholera toxin and TCP [toxin coregulated pilus (TCP), an intestinal colonization factor] (6).
