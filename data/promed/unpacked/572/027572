Spread of bird flu virus in N. Sumatra still worrying
-----------------------------------------------
The spread of the bird flu (avian influenza/AI) virus in North
Sumatra is still worrying despite the cull of some 73 096 poultry in
the province recently, a provincial government official said. The
poultry cull was intended to break the chain of the HN51 virus's
transmission, a spokesman of the North Sumatra Administration said
here on Wednesday [6 Sep 2006]. Of the total 73 096 culled poultry,
some 37 458 were in Karo District, 20 012 in Simalungun, 14 727 in
Dairi and 899 in Deli Serdang District. For every chicken or bird
culled, the government provided compensation worth Rp 12 500 [USD
1.37] each.
Bird flu cases have occurred in 16 districts out of the total 25
districts in North Sumatra up to August 2006 [i.e. the disease is
continuing in spite of the extensive cull. - Mod.MHJ].
Among the affected districts are Deli Serdang, Binjai, Dairi, Medan,
Tebing Tinggi, Langkat, Samosir, Serdang Bedagai, Simalungun,
Tapanuli Selatan, Tapanuli Utara, Toba Samosir, Mandailing Natal,
Humbang Hasundutan, and Kabupaten Karo. The bird flu virus infection
has badly affected the poultry business in the province.
A total of 10 nations have detected outbreaks of the animal disease
in humans. Indonesia had reported some 67 cases, the highest figure
in the world. Indonesia's Ministry of Health recently reported the
country's 43rd death resulting from infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. Like the vast majority of other human cases detected
throughout the region, contact with ailing chickens around the
household is the apparent means by which the latest human case
occurred. Human cases appeared for the 1st time in Indonesia in 2005.
