The [Salvadoran] Government reported yesterday [Thu 14 Feb 2008] that
a team of technicians had been sent to Honduras to investigate the
suspicious deaths of 200 poultry. "Until now, we don't know what
happened," said Carmen de Sol, presidential commissioner for
agriculture, after finding out about the die-off of chickens in the
department of La Paz in neighboring Honduras. According to Honduran
newspaper Proceso Digital, the poultry die-off occurred in 52
households in San Miguelito and Los Almendros, both in the
jurisdiction of La Paz. The [Salvadoran] government has clearly
indicated it has not taken a stance on whether it is avian influenza.

Rafel Gonzalez, from the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry
directorate for Animal and Plant Health, confirmed that the 2
researchers who traveled to La Paz yesterday [14 Feb 2008] are
sharing field information and scientific sampling with competent
authorities in Honduras. Analyses are still in progress, but he
added, "there are no definite laboratory results to confirm or reject
the diagnosis of avian flu. There is no cause for alarm."

Jose Vasquez, head of epidemiology of the Honduran Health Secretariat
discarded the possibility of the lethal H5N1 virus and added that a
team from the Farming Health Department has been sent to the area to
investigate. Vasquez explained that the tests will reveal the cause
of the massive die-off but that it is likely the result of a
bacterial infection brought on by contaminated water. A cordon has
been implemented in the zone, and residents have been advised to
abstain from eating eggs or poultry meat for 2 weeks.

Salvadoran health authorities reported today [14 Feb 2008] that the
government in Honduras has declared a sanitary quarantine in several
communities on the border with El Salvador following the sudden
deaths of 200 poultry.

The die-off occurred in some 52 households of San Miguelito and Los
Almendros, in the border department of La Paz.

Health authorities collected samples of the dead birds and indicated
that although some tests have yet to be confirmed, avian influenza
H5N1 virus can be discarded. Jose Angel Vasquez, head of epidemiology
of the Health Secretariat reported that a group of technicians from
the Secretariat and the department of Farming Health traveled to the
area and are carrying out the necessary investigations, including
finding out whether the birds had symptoms such as diarrhea, eye or
nasal secretions, and falling out of feathers. He explained that the
cause of death is likely a bacterial infection from contaminated
water and that the laboratory analyses will determine whether it is a
case of avian cholera, Newcastle disease, or another avian disease. A
sanitary cordon has been implemented in the zone, and residents have
been advised to refrain from eating eggs or chicken meat for 2 weeks.
Should any of them start showing symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea,
or fever, they should consult the nearest health center.

Vasquez reported that so far there have been no reports of symptoms
in the people who live in the area and no reports of further animal
deaths. Personnel have been assigned to maintain strict surveillance.
In addition, Salvadoran health authorities have carried out
surveillance in the border communities and no similar cases have been reported.

The only suspicious case reported recently occurred in Dominican
Republic, where a gamecock died apparently as a result of [avian
influenza], although this has not been confirmed. [see prior
ProMED-mail postings Avian influenza (07): Dominican Rep. low path.
H5N2 20080106.0079 and Avian influenza (06): Dominican Rep. low path.
H5N2 20080105.0059 - Mod.MPP]

Dario Caballero, an expert from SENASA (National Service for Farming
Health) commented that if it is determined that the cause of [the
poultry die-off] was a disease for which there is no treatment, such
as Newcastle disease, all sick animals will be culled in an effort to
eradicate the outbreak. The Agriculture and Livestock Secretariat
will compensate the owners of the culled animals.

[The likelihood of this being H5N1 is slight, but there is always a
1st time for the Americas. If it had been a country on the Pacific
coast, one might be more suspicious. But having said that, the 2
countries are wise to be cautious. In 2001, influenza was confirmed
in some Salvadoran poultry on the Guatemala border, and the Honduran
veterinarians participated in the investigation with the host
country. This is key to the trade between the 2 countries and an
example to the rest of us. It is clear, see below, that they have had
this arrangement in place since 2000-2001.

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on the outcome
of the investigations into this poultry die-off.
