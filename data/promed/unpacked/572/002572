The New Mexico Department of Health's Scientific Laboratory Division
this week confirmed a case of plague in a dog in Santa Fe County just
east of the Santa Fe city limits and has confirmed animal plague cases
in another dog from Santa Fe County just west of the Santa Fe city
limits and in a cat from Rio Arriba County near Abiuqui, according to
a health department news release.

The cases are the 1st to be reported in 2011, the release said. All
the animal cases have recovered, and no human plague cases have been
confirmed, according to the health department.

"Plague cases in pets serve as a warning that there is plague
activity in rodents and their fleas and human cases can follow, so I
encourage all New Mexicans to follow the prevention recommendations to
keep themselves and their families safe," health secretary Dr
Catherine Torres said in the release.

To prevent plague, the Department of Health recommends:
- avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and
burrows;
- keep your pets from roaming and hunting and talk to your
veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product;
- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as
woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles;
- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;
- see your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden
and severe fever;
- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your
home;
- don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it;
- veterinarians and their staff are at higher risk and should take
precautions when seeing suspect animal plague cases.

Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the
western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected
flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals, 2) direct contact
with contaminated tissues, or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of
respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a category A potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections
are rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate
depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or
pneumonic) and timing of antibiotic therapy initiation; if untreated,
the case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and
approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague (1). Rapid laboratory
identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas.
They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially
cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea
treatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some
products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for
an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your
veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and
puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under
the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front
leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please
take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities in
your pet.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when
examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the
veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one
palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire
this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians
through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the
respiratory infection as well.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home
via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner or
caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been
associated with plague in enzootic areas (2). Plague patients with no
history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their
pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always
should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.
