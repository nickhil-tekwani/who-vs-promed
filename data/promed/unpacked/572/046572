Hepatitis C rates continue to explode among young people on Cape Cod (Massachusetts) leaving the area with the state's highest infection rate for people age 15 to 25 years old, according to the state Department of Public Health [DPH]. Cape public health officials say they are doing a good job of tracking the disease, but they also tied rising infection rates to another epidemic, that of opiate addiction.

About 15 to 20 Cape Cod Healthcare patients have been prescribed Sovaldi [generic name sofosbuvir, a drug used for hepatitis C infection, with a high cure rate. It inhibits the RNA polymerase that the hepatitis C virus uses to replicate its RNA. - Mod.LL], the new hepatitis C drug that comes with fewer side effects but a hefty price tag, said Valerie Al-Hachem, manager of the health care organization's infectious disease clinical services. She said Sovaldi costs USD 1000 a pill, USD 93 000 for a course of treatment.

"Part of it [the increase in HCV recognition] is better surveillance. We're becoming much more diligent in reporting new infections," said Max Sandusky, director of prevention and screening services for the AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod. "But part of it is concentrated areas of infection. It's spreading. Once it gets into the population, it's spreading."

In 2012, the last year for which the state has figures, the hepatitis C rate for 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County was 344.3 cases per 100 000 population -- far higher than the next highest county, Plymouth, which had 194.57 cases per 100 000 population. "The hepatitis C epidemic is going to far exceed what we saw with HIV," Sandusky said. "It is a public health time bomb."

The 2012 infection rate for 15- to 25-year-olds is the highest it has ever been in Barnstable County. The incidence rate per 100 000 people in that population was 298.05 in 2011 and 154.16 in 2010, or 58 and 30 people. In 2012, reported confirmed cases among 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County numbered 67.

A 2013 report by the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School and the Treatment Access Expansion Project shows particularly high rates of hepatitis C infection among teens and young adults in Falmouth, which Sandusky attributes in part to the Upper Cape presence of treatment centers and halfway houses. A lot of injection drug users stay in the community after they leave treatment, Sandusky said. "It's a recovery destination," said Nate Robertson of Mashpee, who with Sam Tarplin of Falmouth is making a documentary about the opiate epidemic called "What Happened Here: The Untold Story of Addiction on Cape Cod." Many people who are treated on the Upper Cape "stay around," he said. "Not everybody stays clean."

As recently as 2002 the spike in confirmed chronic hepatitis C rates was among middle-aged people. A state DPH report shows that year the age group with the most cases was people aged 45. By 2012, the age with the highest caseload -- about 700 -- was 25-year-olds.

Statewide there were 5223 cases of confirmed chronic hepatitis C in 2012, a decrease from 5881 in 2011. On Cape Cod there were 245 cases in 2012 and 234 in 2011 among all age groups. The DPH has developed a "point of care" document to capture new cases of hepatitis C, Sandusky said. He said the form is completed by the diagnostic organization and includes demographic information on the person who contracted hepatitis C, along with medical history and the type of test used. The result is state officials are missing fewer cases, Sandusky said.

"Screening is better," said Valerie Al-Hachem, manager of infectious disease clinical services at Cape Cod Healthcare. "But the injection practices are more prevalent here on the Cape."

Despite awareness campaigns, "there's still a lot of shared needles going on," said Robertson, who is a recovering heroin addict. He said people who are using drugs aren't thinking about taking care of their health. Drug users typically delay getting tested for the liver-damaging disease until they are in recovery or in jail, Robertson said.

Sandusky said his organization started a pilot project to do rapid testing of high-risk people in August [2013]. A finger prick test tells within 20 minutes whether a person has developed antibodies to hepatitis C, showing that they were infected at some point, Sandusky said.

The rapid testing is being done at the Barnstable County Correctional Facility and among high-risk people in the general population, Sandusky added.

Between 28 Aug 2013 and 31 Mar 2014, the AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod tested 102 people, 70 of whom identified themselves as injection drug users, he said. Of those getting the finger prick, 25 -- or 24 percent -- tested positive, Sandusky said. He said that is a very high infection rate. "Most of the folks we have tested are under the age of 30," Sandusky said. "We are definitely focusing on the younger population because we are seeing increases in substance abuse among youth."

[Without longitudinal studies of a cohort, it is not clear over what period of time the HCV infections were acquired as, in most individuals, chronic infection develops. That intravenous drug use is a substantial risk factor for HCV acquisition is quite clear and preventing such transmission can be assisted by needle exchange programs which, despite the issues inherent in such programs, are effective modalities. The treatment regimens for HCV can also diminish transmission by clearing the viremia and we are about the enter a time with therapy without interferon and even ribavirin, both of which have therapy-limiting side effects and have disappointing results with certain genotypes of the virus. - Mod.LL
