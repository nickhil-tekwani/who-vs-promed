Public Health Wales and Carmarthenshire County Council's Environmental Health department are investigating an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Carmarthen. There are currently 3 cases, and all have links to Carmarthen. All were admitted to hospital as a result of their illness but have since been discharged.

Legionnaires' disease is contracted by breathing in droplets from contaminated water sources. It cannot be caught from another person. Investigations into the possible source are ongoing. Information has been circulated to general practitioners (GPs) and hospitals in the area to advise them to be alert to the symptoms of Legionnaires' disease.

Anyone who lives or works in the Carmarthen area and has symptoms suggestive of Legionnaires' disease is advised to contact their GP. Symptoms include breathlessness, chest pain and a dry cough, as well as fever, muscle aches, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea. Legionnaires' disease can lead to pneumonia and can be fatal and so it is important for anyone with symptoms to seek medical advice.

Dr Mac Walapu, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control for Public Health Wales, said: "We are continuing to speak to the 3 people who have been unwell to gain a better understanding of their movements in the days before they became ill in order to try and identify the source of the disease. It is important to note that Legionnaires' disease is very rare and most people who come into contact with the bacteria that cause infection will not become ill. People over the age of 50, particularly men and smokers, are most at risk."

_Legionella_ bacteria can live in all types of water but only become a risk to health when the water temperature allows the bacteria to multiply rapidly. Water systems used for air-cooling or for use in commercial, tourist and other buildings should be maintained to standards that minimise risk from the disease and do not harbour the bacteria that cause Legionnaires' disease.

Information about Legionnaires' disease is available from this website at: http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/888/page/44350.

[For a discussion of Legionnaires' disease, see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - UK (02): (Scotland) 20120605.1156972.

A diagnosis of a single case of Legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. It is therefore a public health imperative to find that source to prevent further cases.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype in patient specimens suggests transmission from a common source. Because _L. pneumophila_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir should be demonstrated by means of genotyping methods (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks because the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is commonly made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens, in which case genotyping of clinical isolates is, of course, not possible.

Carmarthen, with a population of 14 648 (2001 Census), is a town and administrative center of Carmarthenshire in southwestern Wales. For a map of Wales showing the location of Carmarthenshire, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carmarthenshire_UK_location_map.svg.
