Angry tourists have complained about the the 4-star Holiday Village in the Costa Los Gigantes [Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands] resort.

People staying at the Holiday Village Tenerife have claimed a bug [_Cryptosporidium_] has struck guests. British holidaymakers are fuming after claims more than a dozen fell ill with sickness and diarrhoea at a holiday resort in Tenerife.

Angry tourists have complained about the the 4-star Holiday Village in the Costa Los Gigantes resort, where a number of guests claim to have caught the bug cryptosporidium. And now doctors have been drafted in to the resort to deal with sick tourists as well as an independent expert to carry out checks.

Customers have been posting about their concerns on tour operator First Choice's Facebook site.

GettyHoliday Problems: Tenerife is a popular tourist spot for Brits but not everyone is having a good time. Mum Amanda Brannen who has been staying at the resort posted a picture of her son, who she says has lost weight through illness. "I had a meeting with the hotel manager and the First Choice manger yesterday who deny any reported cases and there is no problem. "A doctor has been called out for the 2nd time to a family we know as the little girl is coughing up blood, what is it going to take to get you to do something?"

One holidaymaker who has just returned from Tenerife said that there were large queues and waits of up to an hour to see the reps and at the onsite pharmacy and for Brits who are ill. Lawyers for affected holidaymakers at the 518-room Tenerife resort hotel claim the outbreak of illness spread rapidly throughout the hotel complex.

[Outbreaks of Cryptosporidia in holiday resorts are well known. There can be several sources; especially swimming pools should be suspected here, as it seems that the infection is primarily seen in children. Cryptosporidiosis is frequently reported from swimming pools and water parks (see below). - Mod.EP
