A bacterial ailment known as scrub typhus has turned out to be the 2nd most frequent infectious disease in Kolkata [West Bengal] this year [2017] after dengue, according to a survey by a private hospital. Even though the disease -- which has symptoms similar to those of dengue -- affected a far smaller number of people, the mortality rate of scrub typhus patients was higher. Out of the 838 patients admitted in Peerless Hospital [Kolkata] with fever between June and November [2017], 47 had scrub typhus, second only to dengue. But while just 9 out of the 569 dengue patients died [a case fatality rate of 1.58 percent], 4 scrub typhus patients succumbed to the illness, which makes its mortality rate [actually the case fatality rate] 8.5 percent -- 8 times that of dengue [actually 5.37 times that of dengue].

Most private hospitals have received around 30-40 scrub typhus patients since June [2017]. Other than dengue and undetected viral fever, scrub typhus turned out to be the most common, according to Sujit Kar Purakayastha, senior consultant at Peerless Hospital who led the study.

"Those seeking admission with fever were made to undergo blood tests for dengue and malaria. In case the fever didn't subside, we went for a scrub typhus check. This year [2017], the number of scrub [typhus] patients was high among the detected illnesses. But what was more worrying was that the mortality rate [case fatality rate] was higher in scrub typhus than dengue. If detected early, before complications have set in, scrub patients can recover fairly quickly," said Kar Purakayastha.

Scrub typhus is caused by a bacterium called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, which is carried by a mite called _Leptotrombidium_.

Antibiotics can help control the disease in 2 to 5 days, according to Arindam Biswas, consultant, RN Tagore International Cardiac Sciences. "This year [2017], the number of scrub patients was exceptionally high. I have treated 3, including one very serious patient. Fortunately, all of them recovered. Usually, the mortality rate [case fatality rate] in scrub is 2 percent. It's rarely fatal unless detected late. But since we had a dengue outbreak, delay in detection may have pushed up the number of deaths," said Biswas.

Some experts, however, pointed out that scrub typhus can't be conclusively diagnosed in India.

[How the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated. Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions.

ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (05): background 20111208.3546.

Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, with a population of 4.5 million residents in 2011, is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal; it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of East India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata).
