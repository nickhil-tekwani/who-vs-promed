Two cases of foodborne botulism were reported in Berdyansk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast in southeastern Ukraine. On 17 Nov 2021, it was reported that botulism was found in 2 residents of the city. An outbreak of the disease occurred among members of the same family. Homemade dried fish (roach, bream) could be a source of botulism. The state of health of the sick is not reported.

Foodborne botulism is a severe intoxication caused by eating the preformed toxin present in contaminated food. Typically, in a few hours to several days after you eat the contaminated food, you will start to show the classic symptoms: blurred vision, dry mouth, and difficulty in swallowing. Gastrointestinal symptoms may or may not occur. If untreated, the paralysis always descends through the body starting at the shoulders and working its way down. The most serious complication of botulism is respiratory failure, where it is fatal in up to 10% of people. It may take months before recovery is complete.

If the disease is caught early enough, it can be treated with antitoxin. If paralysis and respiratory failure happen, the person may be on a ventilator for several weeks.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of a preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the most common. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E, which is usually associated with fish and marine life-associated cases, is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (1). A recent review regarding botulism in Ukraine (2) reported that from 1955 to 2018, 8614 cases of botulism were recorded in Ukraine, causing 659 deaths. The distribution of types of botulism toxins was represented by type A (7.97%), B (59.64%), suspected as C (0.56%), E (25.47%), others (5.33%), and unidentified (1.04%).
