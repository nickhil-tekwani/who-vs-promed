7th cow with BSE found in Hokkaido
-----------------------------------
A cow in Hokkaido was found to have contracted brain-wasting bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the seventh BSE case in Japan, the Health,
Labor and Welfare Ministry said Thu, 23 Jan 2003.
The announcement came just 4 days after the finding of the 6th BSE
infection case, involving a cow in Wakayama Prefecture.
The ministry said it will hold a meeting of experts later Thursday to
confirm the diagnosis. If confirmation is made, the cow's meat and organs,
which have been kept pending the outcome, will be incinerated. According to
the ministry, the cow was born on a Hokkaido farm in March 1996, roughly
the same time the previous 6 BSE-infected cows were born.
The previous 6 BSE cases involved the calves having been fed substitute
milk produced at a factory in Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture, and the farm
ministry will investigate to see whether the 7th infected cow consumed the
same milk and to determine how it contracted the disease.
The Hokkaido cow tested positive in a preliminary test and again tested
positive in a more reliable test at the Obihiro University of Agriculture
and Veterinary Medicine.
The proximity of the birthday of the 7th BSE cow to those of the previous 6
adds strength to allegations that feed contaminated with abnormal prions
was distributed within the country during a specific time frame. Prions are
the infectious agents widely believed to be the transmitters of BSE and
scrapie from one cell to another and from one animal to another.
Except for one animal born in December 1995, the other BSE-positive cows
were born between February and April 1996, 4 of them within the 2-week
period from late March to early April. The 7th BSE cow was born on 28 Mar 1996.
"I think feed or some other stuff was contaminated during that
period," said Morikazu Shinagawa, head of the Prion Disease Research
Center at the National Institute of Animal Health. He also chairs the
ministry panel in charge of BSE diagnosis.
Although the 6 cows consumed the same milk, the government has not pinned
the blame on the milk as the source of prion contamination. Japan's first
BSE case was discovered in Sep 2001.
