From: Cecilia Abelenda <cecilia_abelenda@yahoo.com>

The source of information [is a personal communication through the family
of the farmer who died, because they are my neighbors in Uruguay. Also I
received a national newspaper from my country talking about the death of my
neighbor. The headline of "La Republica" published on 6 Nov 1998 stated:
" Murio la tercera victima fatal del asesino hantavirus " which means "The
third victim of the lethal hantavirus is dead."
I do not know how many new cases are confirmed to date but I will try to
contact the Ministry of Public Health of my country to seek further
official information. Unfortunately, this may take a couple of weeks.
