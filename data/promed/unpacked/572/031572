The steady pace of new H7N9 influenza infections in China continued today [10 Jan 2014] with reports of 6 more cases, one of them fatal, and the 1st notification of the year [2014] from Fujian province, the country's 4th to detect the novel virus over the past several weeks.

Of the patients, 2 are from southern China's Guangdong province, which seems to be a hotspot of H7N9 activity, which started picking up again in October 2013 after a lull over the late spring and summer.

In a related development today [10 Jan 2014], animal health officials in Guangdong reported more H7N9 findings from a restaurant and some live poultry markets, according to media reports.

Details on the 6 new cases were reported today [10 Jan 2014] in 2 separate statements from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP). The patients from Guangdong are both from Foshan and are a 42-year-old woman who works with poultry and a 59-year-old woman.

The 2 women have mild infections, according to a report from Xinhua, China's state news agency. Today's [10 Jan 2014] official notices and media reports contained no details about poultry exposure in the other new cases.

Of the new patients, 2 are from Zhejiang province, a 30-year-old man and a 79-year-old woman, both of whom are in critical condition, according to the CHP.

In a separate statement, the CHP said a 54-year-old man from the Jiangsu province city of Nanjing started having symptoms on 28 Dec [2013] and was hospitalized on 5 Jan [2014], where he is currently in serious condition.

The latest death from the disease is related to a newly reported case from Fujian province, in a 38-year-old man from Quanzhou who had an underlying medical condition, according to the CHP. His infection is the 1st H7N9 case reported in Fujian since late April 2013.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) today [10 Jan 2014] acknowledged that it had received reports of 2 other H7H9 [virus infection] cases that were detected over the past week, those involving a 65-year-old man reported on 8 Jan [2014] as Hong Kong's 3rd infection imported from the mainland and a 51-year-old woman from Zhejiang province, whose illness was 1st reported yesterday [9 Jan 2014] [see http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_01_10_h7n9/en/index.html].

Today's [10 Jan 2014] new H7N9 cases raise the unofficial total of infections in the outbreak to 163 and the death toll to 50; 15 cases have been reported since the 1st of the year [2014] by China and its close neighbors.

In other developments, the H7N9 virus has been found in environmental samples from a restaurant and near wet markets in Guangdong, Want China Times, an English news web site based in Taiwan, reported today [10 Jan 2014]. The report cited Southcn.com, a Guangdong-based news web site.

According to the report, 3 of 17 samples from a restaurant in Guangzhou tested positive for the virus. The report also said a recently confirmed H7N9 patient had delivered live chickens from Foshan to the eatery; 2 of the 3 samples were from poultry, and another was from a chopping board. Authorities have sterilized the restaurant and have found no illnesses among the restaurant staff.

According to the story, 4 positive samples were also found in testing near Guangzhou wet markets in Zecheng and Zuhan districts. Also, 8 of 34 samples taken outside a wet market in the city of Shantou's Jinping district were positive for the virus, according to the Times report.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) verified with the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) today [12 Jan 2014] 2 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Zhejiang.

Regarding the 1st case, the patient is a 78-year-old male who is now in critical condition. He is currently receiving treatment in a hospital in Hangzhou. His specimen was laboratory confirmed on 11 Jan 2014.

The 2nd case involves a man aged 34 who is in serious condition. He is now receiving treatment in a hospital in Ningbo. His specimen was laboratory confirmed today [12 Jan 2014].

As of 9:00 pm today [12 Jan 2014], a total of 165 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the mainland, including Zhejiang (58 cases), Shanghai (36 cases), Jiangsu (30 cases), Guangdong (14 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Fujian (6 cases), Anhui (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Beijing (2 cases), Hunan (2 cases), Shandong (2 cases) and Hebei (one case).

The CHP will follow-up with the mainland health authorities for more case details.

"Locally, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures, and health education against avian influenza are ongoing. We will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations," a spokesman for the DH said.

"All border control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travelers. Random temperature checks by handheld devices have been arranged. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added.

Regarding health education for travelers, distribution of pamphlets, display of posters in departure and arrival halls, in-flight public announcements, environmental health inspections, and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are all proceeding.

The spokesman advised travelers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected countries and areas, with fever or respiratory symptoms to immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected countries and areas.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and take heed of the preventive advice against avian influenza below:

- Do not visit live poultry markets. Avoid contact with poultry, birds, and their droppings. If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;

- Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;

- Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;

- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin; avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and

- Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

[3] Shantou, Guangdong province

Tests detected 8 samples positive for H7N9 avian influenza virus nucleic acid in 34 samples from Jinping District, Taipei Dragon OTC collected during environmental monitoring. Reporters learned on 11 [Jan 2014] from the CDC of Shantou City [Guangdong province] that the outbreak currently associated with Shantou has not been found in other markets. [Shantou CDC] has launched emergency response to take effective measures for relevant prevention, control, and disposal.

Shantou City CDC has been established to carry out surveillance efforts and manage the epidemic team, while increasing supplies of drugs and medical devices and other reserves. Environmental monitoring and sterilization management will continue in live bird markets.

According to reports, the market environment is complex, with live poultry, feathers, and feces making it easy to pollute the market environment. Shantou Long North Market on 8-10 Jan 2014 was vacant, free of all live poultry, completely cleaned and disinfected twice a day.

Experts recommend that people do not need to panic or even talk about bird flu. The public is advised to avoid direct contact with live birds, fresh poultry meat for home consumption, and to not touch their mouth and nose with hands after touching poultry, and to wash hands with soap and water as soon as possible. Raw poultry, meat, and eggs must be fully cooked before eating.

It is understood that combining joint prevention and control of the avian influenza situation in Guangdong Province, Shantou City, strictly requires that live poultry operations adhere to the requirements of each market, with the implementation of "Three Ones" (i.e., "One day a wash; one week a disinfectant; closed in January"). The city's 131 dealers in poultry markets were closed New Year's Day for intensive cleaning and disinfection before the Spring Festival holiday.

[4] Virus transmission
Date: Sat 11 Jan 2014
Source: Focus Taiwan [edited]
http://focustaiwan.tw/news/acs/201401110017.aspx


Chinese researchers have discovered mutations in the new strain of avian influenza A, known as H7N9, and have found that the virus has the ability to spread from human to human, the latest issue of China's Southern Metropolis Weekly reported.

George F. Gao, the vice-president of Beijing Institutes of Life Sciences under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and deputy director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Weekly that he and his research colleagues have broken down the mechanisms of transmission of the H5N1 and H7N9 avian flu viruses.

The research team pointed out in a study published in Science magazine in September last year [2013] that they have identified mutations in 4 key sites of amino acids of the H7N9 strain and found that the virus has an ability to bind to human cells in the upper respiratory tract.

Although the H7N9 and H5N1 viruses have not had the ability to widely spread from human to human, after undergoing genetic mutations and redistribution through mutations, they become better able to bind to human cells in the upper respiratory tract and can evolve into bird flu strains with the ability to transmit among humans, the team says.

In nature, H7N9 is an avian flu virus, but it tends to bind to poultry cells in the lower respiratory tract, Gao said.

He added that although the H7N9 virus can invade cells in the human upper respiratory tract, it only has a limited ability to transmit among humans.

Gao said that closing live poultry markets, adopting more intensive livestock farming practices, and using the mass slaughter of live poultry are good measures to control the spread of the H7N9 epidemic.

The Shanghai City government has announced it will shut down live poultry markets from the Lunar New Year holiday (31 Jan 2014) until 30 Apr 2014.

[5] Cases by age and sex
Date: 11 Jan 2014
Source: Virology Downunder Blog [edited]
http://virologydownunder.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/h7n9-by-sex-and-weekare-female-cases-on.html


I have plotted 163 of the 164 lab-confirmed H7N9 cases (includes surviving and fatal cases) by the sex of the H7N9-positive person and the week in which they acquired their illness (if date of onset was noted), or else the date the case was reported to the world [see charts at the above source URL].

The chart above shows that overall, male cases dominate the H7N9 landscape each week (69.5 per cent of all cases are male), except that among the new appearances of H7N9 in China, there seems to be a greater number of weeks in which females are equally represented among the cases. While the case numbers are low, this still begs the question, as does the cause of the apparent start of the H7N9 season, what is driving these patterns?

[The sporadic appearance of cases of influenza H7N9 continues in various provinces. The above reports provide a comprehensive picture of the geographic spread of diagnosed cases. It also indicates the proactive surveillance and diagnosis systems that are in place in China, and the transparency with which cases are reported. There is still no confirmed evidence of person-to-person transmission of this virus.
