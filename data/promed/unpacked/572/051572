Poultry Produced in Thailand Declared Free of BSE Risk
------------------------------------------------------
Local authorities maintain that Thai poultry is free from bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) or mad-cow disease, because the Livestock Development
Department applies stringent controls on imports of animal meat and bones
for use in the feed industry. The department was responding to a report in
an English newspaper of possible adulteration of poultry in processed
chicken in the Netherlands with pork and beef proteins that might present a
risk of BSE to consumers.

The article said that the Dutch processors obtained poultry from
cheap-labor suppliers such as Thailand, Russia, and Brazil. Although the
report did not specifically identify Thailand or the other countries as
individual sources of adulterated meat, Thai poultry exporters are worried
about the impact of such reports in the European Union (EU). The EU is the
second largest market for Thai poultry exports, accounting for 33.4 percent
of total shipments of 437 797 tonnes worth 38 billion baht [more than USD
926 million] last year.

Rapeepong Wongdee, the Department's Director-general, said he was certain
that the country had no cases of BSE infection in animals raised locally,
whether they were cows, goats or deer. The Livestock Department is
accredited as a competent authority in certifying the quality of poultry
before export. Mr Rapeepong said Thailand banned imports of animal meat and
bones from countries with BSE cases and regularly conducted DNA tests
[presumably to detect bovine DNA?] on products originating from non-BSE
countries. A case was found 2 years ago when imported ground pig bones were
mixed and the product was destroyed. The department thoroughly studied the
brains of dead cows raised in Thailand that had brain-related symptoms and
found no indication of BSE, he said.

A poultry industry executive said the strict EU safety standards should
already ensure European consumers about the quality of Thai poultry;
otherwise the products would not have been allowed to enter the region.
"Thai chicken is subjected to 100 percent inspections and DNA tests [for
what purpose?] to ensure no use of banned chemicals like nitrofurans.
Products that meet the requirement and enter the market are certainly
safe," the executive said.

Both the Thai government and the private sector view negative reports about
the quality of Thai products as a kind of non-tariff barrier to reduce
imports of Thai chicken, as European poultry industries are facing a
serious oversupply. A source from the Thai Broilers Processing Exporters'
Association said the revised export target for Thai frozen chicken this
year was only 380 000 tonnes worth approximately 32 billion baht [more than
USD 780 million]. This would represent a 13.2 percent drop in volume and a
16.7 percent drop in value from last year.

[These statements provide some reassurance about the quality of the frozen
chicken exported from Thailand to the European Union. However, the
implication of the report in the Guardian newspaper was that chicken
imported into the European Union was being adulterated by processors in the
Netherlands by addition of beef protein powder of unknown origin, possible
from another European country with a history of BSE in cattle. The absence
of BSE from Thailand is not necessarily relevant to the potential risk
associated with the addition of beef protein powder during processing of
imported chicken in the Netherlands. It should be stressed, however, that
the perceived risk is extremely low if hydrolyzed protein is being used,
since any potential infectivity would be reduced, although perhaps not
entirely eliminated. - Mod.CP]

1. Due to import tariffs, the Dutch plants import deep-frozen chicken from
cheap sources outside the EU. The additives are intended to improve their
tenderness, and sometimes the taste as well. (methods - eg "Tumbling" -
covered in the previous ProMED-mail posting [see references below]).

2. In order to secure the water contents of the chicken meat, some plants
have added animal products such as collagen, which is not necessarily of
chicken origin but may be derived from pigs and cattle.

3. DNA of the said species was detected by the Irish in chicken breast
filets from five Dutch suppliers. In one case, the protein was of milk
origin, in the other ones no clear clarification could be obtained.

4. On top of not-mentioning the additives on the labels, some of the
chicken were signed "Halal" approved for Muslims, in spite of the
pig-protein which is taboo for them.

5. The tests in Great Britain have indicated, mainly, bovine material in
the filets. The matter has two aspects - first, such product is taboo for
Hindus; secondly , there is the BSE issue. However, the Dutch Commodities
Inspection Service regards this fear as unrealistic since risk material -
such as bovine brains - has been kept out of the food chain already for
five years.
