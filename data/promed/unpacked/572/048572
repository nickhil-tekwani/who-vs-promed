[1] Liberia: Chinese-built Ebola center dedicated

Chinese-built Ebola center dedicated in Liberia
-----------------------------------------------
China, one of the 1st countries to send aid to battle Ebola in West Africa, ramped up the assistance significantly Tue 25 Nov 2014 by opening a 100-bed treatment center in Liberia. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf toured the Ebola treatment center, calling it "1st-class." "We want to commend China for this exceptional response," Sirleaf said.

The facility, which is air-conditioned and has digital document keeping instead of paper, will start accepting patients next week, Chinese Embassy officials said. The giant white building was built in the parking lot of a stadium, outside Monrovia, Liberia's capital. Soldiers from USA, which has also sent troops and is building treatment units in Liberia, were present at the ceremony.

China is Africa's largest trading partner and has especially close ties with Liberia, where many Chinese firms won contracts for post-war reconstruction projects. It has pledged USD 81 million in aid to West Africa, including the money for the treatment center, to stem the Ebola outbreak and has also sent at least 200 medical staff and promised more.

Fighting Ebola in Liberian "hotspots"
-------------------------------------
On Fri 21 Nov 2014, Buchanan's 1st Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU), constructed by the US Department of Defence [DoD], was opened, to be run by IOM [International Organization for Migration] international, with local staff currently being trained by WHO and Liberia's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. The ETU is equipped to receive and treat up to 50 patients and will likely begin receiving transfers and suspected cases in the 1st week of December 2014. Training includes educating communities about the importance of seeking early treatment at an ETU.

The Buchanan ETU is one of 3 facilities planned for Bomi, Grand Bassa and Grand Cape Mount counties. The 1st was opened in mid November 2014 in Tubmanburg in Bomi county. A team of 22 foreign medical workers and 138 national staff are running that unit. The 3rd ETU will open shortly in Sinje, Grand Cape Mount country, with the capacity to serve up to 50 patients. All 3 ETUs have all been built by the US Department of Defense, with the support of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL).... -- more

Monrovia Medical Unit is aiding healthcare workers in the fight against Ebola
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The United States has been engaged with the Ebola outbreak since the 1st cases were reported in March 2014 -- and on Wed 5 Nov 2014, opened the Monrovia Medical Unit, to provide care to healthcare workers who become infected with Ebola while treating patients.

Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was present to mark the inauguration of the Monrovia Medical Unit (MMU), a 25-bed field hospital located in Margibi County, Liberia. The MMU is currently [22 Nov 2014] treating 3 Liberian health care workers.

The MMU was constructed by the US Department of Defense and [is] staffed by the men and women of the U.S. Public Health Service. [In response to the Ebola outbreak], the U.S. government has deployed more than 2500 personnel to West Africa, making this the largest-ever U.S. government response to a global health crisis.

Liberia: Ebola doctor alarmed over male survivors infecting partners
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Atai Omurutu, head doctor at the Island Clinic Ebola treatment unit, has raised an alarm over the disturbing incidents of male Ebola survivors infecting their partners and putting entire families at risk. Dr. Omurutu said wives of male survivors are being admitted to the facility because they have contracted the disease from their partners. She appealed to the Ministry of Health for condoms to be given to male survivors in order to stop this mode of transmission of the Ebola virus.

She disclosed this new wave of infection to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf when the President toured the Island Clinic ETU and the Alpha OAU ETU in Tweh Farm and Virginia, respectively. Dr. Omurutu, a Ugandan doctor, stated that once a man survives Ebola, he still has the virus in his semen for up to 3 months, therefore it is extremely important that male survivors abstain from sex during that period or use a condom to avoid infecting their partner.

[6] Sierra Leone: 8 day wait for test result in health care unit

Sierra Leone: 8 days in a health care unit before tests proves negative
After the long wait for an Ebola test, a patient is told he can go home
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A wonderful thing happened today. I was able to give a patient in our unit the news that he tested negative for Ebola and was free to go home. He leapt out of bed and danced for joy, praised the Lord and us -- and even, mortifyingly, bowed to our PPE-clad feet. Throughout the unit, we could hear him singing and I know I'm not the only one who got a bit weepy. As a qualified doctor in 2006, and then a paediatrician studying for a PhD in infectious diseases at the UCL Institute of Child Health, a month ago I volunteered to work in Freetown with the UK's King's Sierra Leone Partnership and am working at the Connaught Hospital Ebola Isolation Unit.

When a patient attends a health care unit, they are immediately screened for symptoms of Ebola -- fever plus abdominal pain, vomiting, headache and so on. The symptoms are non-specific and [they can also result from] anything from malaria to flu. If there is any suspicion of Ebola, they are admitted to an Isolation Unit -- beds permitting -- to be tested for the Ebola virus. And there they are kept until the results are available. This is intended to be within 24 hours.

The implications of delayed laboratory results are that those who turn out to be negative may be in beds next to positive patients with profuse diarrhoea, vomiting and even bleeding. The potential risk of infection is considerable. Patients are separated from each other by a wall of plastic sheeting; chlorine is used to decontaminate our gloved hands in between tending each patient; they are told to not leave their bed. [Even delayed, the news today was welcome.]
