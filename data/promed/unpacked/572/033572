A horse in Lowndes County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], according to officials. EEE is the inflammation or swelling of the brain caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus. EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The virus is transmitted to horses and humans by mosquito bites. "Even though it's rare for a human to be infected with these illnesses, anyone can become ill after being bitten by an infected mosquito," said Kenneth Lowery, epidemiologist. "The risk is higher for people who spend a lot of time outdoors, live in wooded or swampy areas, or have traveled overseas to certain areas."

Several additional cases of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] have been confirmed in horses in South Carolina. The state veterinarian's office received laboratory confirmation of 3 new cases of EEE as of Tuesday [12 Jul 2016].

The 1st was a Tennessee Walking Horse in Dorchester County, the 2nd was a 13-year-old pony in Horry County and the 3rd was a 2-year-old Quarter Horse in Kershaw County. None of the horses survived. These are the 1st cases in Dorchester and Kershaw counties and the 3rd case in Horry County. South Carolina now has 8 confirmed cases statewide [this year 2016]

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, EEE is a rare disease that is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes. The EEE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). The disease is rarely transmitted to humans.

In horses, EEE affects the central nervous system. Signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, facial paralysis, difficulty swallowing, behavioral changes like aggression or drowsiness, gait abnormalities or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness and seizures. Death usually occurs 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs with fatality rates reaching 75 percent to 80 percent among horses.

Vaccinations are highly effective deterrents and can be administered at any time. Horse owners should consult their veterinarians.

The state totals are:
3 Horry County
2 Colleton County
1 Marion County
1 Dorchester County
1 Kershaw County
