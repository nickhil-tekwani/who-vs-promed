Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has announced a cholera outbreak in Kamukunji Constituency in Nairobi County. Speaking on [Thu 5 May 2022], Kagwe alerted Nairobi residents to observe high standards of hygiene after health officials noted that there was an outbreak. He attributed the outbreak to the failure of Kenyans to adhere to simple hygienic measures such as hand washing, but did not disclose the number of reported cases.

"Because sanitizing is in disuse in some cases, and because people are no longer wearing masks and so on, cholera is back. We have a bit of an outbreak of cholera in Kamukunji," Kagwe stated. "I have absolutely no doubt at the height of the COVID-19, there would have been no cholera because everyone would have been washing their hands and sanitizing," he added.

The last time Nairobi had a notable cholera outbreak was in 2019 when more than 10 cases of cholera were recorded in Nairobi.

Nairobi County Health Chief Officer Washington Makodingo stated that 14 patients were diagnosed with cholera symptoms and had been admitted to different hospitals in Nairobi. "I can confirm that 14 cases of cholera have been reported in various health facilities with some of the patients having been treated and discharged," Dr. Makodingo stated while appearing before the Nairobi County Assembly Health Committee.

To curb the disease, the Nairobi health department distributed chlorine tablets to areas where cholera was reported. Further, the department also gave antibiotics to those prone to cholera in order to lessen the burden of the disease. The county managed to distribute 50 000 antimicrobial tablets.

Dr. Makodingo stated that the county was liaising with the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company to super-chlorinate its water as well as establish cholera treatment units in all health facilities in the capital city.

[3] Cholera - Cameroon

The USA CDC recently announced there is an outbreak of cholera in Cameroon's Centre, Littoral, South, Southwest, and North regions.

To prevent cholera, people should follow safe food and water guidelines and wash their hands frequently.

The CDC issued a Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions, to alert potential visitors to these Cameroon regions. Vaccination against cholera is not routinely recommended because most travelers do not visit areas of active transmission. Travelers (including children) planning to visit regions with active cholera transmission should discuss getting vaccinated with their doctor or pharmacist at least 1 month before travel.

The Vaxchora oral vaccine is FDA authorized in the USA for active immunization against the disease caused by _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1. Vaxchorea is approved for use in adults 18 through 64 years of age traveling to cholera-affected areas.

[4] Cholera - Malawi

The Ministry of Health says Malawi has recorded 100 cholera cases and 5 deaths since February 2022. This is according to a statement released by the Ministry today [Wed 4 May 2022]. So far, 5 districts have been affected, namely Blantyre, Nsanje, Neno, Chikwawa and Machinga.

The 1st case in Malawi was reported at Machinga District Hospital on [28 Feb 2022] but affected a resident of Balaka District. On [14 Mar 2022], the next case was reported at Nsanje District Hospital.

Although the disease is dangerous and can spread and kill people quickly if proper preventive and control measures are not followed, no person is supposed to die quick action is put in place when a person shows signs and symptoms of the disease. Symptoms of cholera can be mild, or severe. Severe symptoms can include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In such cases, rapid loss of body fluids can lead to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. Dehydration can be rapid, so fluid replacement is essential. If you have oral rehydration solution (ORS), start taking it immediately, it can save a life. Continue to drink ORS at home and while traveling to get medical treatment. If an infant has watery diarrhea, continue breastfeeding.

The South Sudanese Ministry of Health on [Sun 8 May 2022] declared a cholera outbreak following confirmation of 8 cases in Rubkona county in the country's Unity State. The ministry said the move follows tests conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory in Juba that confirmed the outbreak. "The public is being urged not to panic but remain calm and observe all the precautionary measures to prevent community transmission and spread in populations with inadequate access to safe drinking water, poor personal hygiene, and inadequate access to improved sanitation facilities," the ministry said in a statement issued in Juba, the capital of South Sudan.

It said that so far, a total of 31 cases including 1 death have been reported from Rubkona town and Bentiu IDP camp. The ministry said the confirmed cases presented with watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration and were admitted and managed at MSF Bentiu protection of civilians (PoC) hospital, noting that all cases have been discharged. The ministry reported a confirmed case of cholera from Bentiu IDP camp on [14 Apr 2022]. The first cholera case to be reported in South Sudan since the devastating cholera outbreak in 2017, affecting more than 28 000 people with 644 deaths.

According to the ministry, the government with support from its partners conducted 2 rounds of oral cholera vaccination in Rubkona county in January and March [2022], respectively. "The ministry of health activated a national and a state cholera task force on [14 Apr 2022] to coordinate all response interventions, heighten surveillance in the Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps and at community levels," it said.

According to the ministry, the cholera risk is typically high during the rainy season that starts from May to the end of October. For the last couple of years, the country has experienced devastating floods affecting more than one million people, mainly women and children and displacing them from their homes, livelihoods, and social services.
