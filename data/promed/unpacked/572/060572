The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 10 Oct 2017 that additional New York horses have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSDAM) reported that an Oswego County horse tested positive for EEE and has been euthanized, the EDCC said.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2-3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool for EEE. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually, one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

The Oswego County Health Department reported today (11 Oct 2017) that a horse in the town of West Monroe tested positive for the eastern equine encephalitis virus in the state lab.

The horse was seen by a veterinarian and euthanized on Thursday, 28 Sep 2017.

Oswego County Public Health Director Jiancheng Huang said horses are very susceptible to mosquito-borne diseases if they are not vaccinated.

He added, "Despite low mosquito counts, the EEE and West Nile viruses are still active in southern and central Oswego County. People need to continue to limit their exposure to mosquitoes until there is a killing frost."

Health officials believe the source of the virus contracted by the horse is likely the same area that was previously treated by aerial spraying.

County and state health departments continue to monitor the situation.

Huang said, "The purpose of aerial spraying is to control mosquito populations; however, it does not eliminate all mosquitoes."

Test results reported last week indicated the presence of the EEE and WNV in mosquito pools located in the towns of Hastings, Palermo and West Monroe.

The report listed 2 pools as positive for EEE and 4 pools as positive for WNV for the week of 18 Sep 2017; and 2 pools as positive for EEE and 2 pools as positive for WNV for the week of 25 Sep 2017.

"Preventing mosquito bites is the best way to protect ourselves from mosquito-borne diseases," said Huang. "People need to take precautions when they are hunting, fishing, and enjoying any outdoor activities. It is very important for everyone to continue to follow their personal protection practices."

The Oswego County Health Department advises people to:
- Use a mosquito repellent according to label directions.
- Wear shoes, socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt if you are outdoors for long periods of time, and when mosquitoes are most active, between dusk and dawn.
- Drain or remove standing water around the home and yard, and replace or repair broken screens, as usual.

For more information about protecting your family against mosquitoes, call the Oswego County Health Department at 315-349-3564 or visit the New York State Department of Health's Web site at https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/west_nile_virus/.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) has reported that Oklahoma has confirmed its 3rd case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse for 2017.

The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry told the EDCC that "the adult quarter horse mare located in Kay County was showing moderate neurologic signs. The vaccination history is unknown."

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

Two horses in Marquette County have tested positive for EEE.

EEE is a serious viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The Marquette County Health Department says it mainly causes neurological disease in horses but can also cause illness in people, poultry, and other animals, such as deer and even dogs.

The Department recommends people take steps to protect themselves against mosquito bites by applying repellant and wearing protective clothing.

Officials say while it's unusual to detect EEE in the U.P, a horse from Menominee County tested positive, and one human case was diagnosed in the U.P. in 2016.

Although there is no vaccine for humans, vaccines for horses are available. The 2 that tested positive were not vaccinated against the disease.

The Health Director for Onslow County is asking residents to be on their guard after a horse is believed to have contracted EEE.

EEE can be transmitted through the bite of a mosquito and can infect both horses and humans, according to Health Director Angela Lee.

Some people infected with EEE have no symptoms. However, those who do develop symptoms may have fever and joint or muscle pain.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those with a severe form of the disease will have "sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma."

The diagnosis for the horse is presumptive because it is based on the pony's clinical symptoms and a preliminary test that shows the pony had recently been exposed to the EEE virus.

Although there is no vaccine for humans, there is one for horses, so owners should have their animals immunized. Owners should check with their veterinarian to determine the best vaccination schedule for their horses.

Another case of EEE has recently been identified in a North Carolina horse. Two of the cases are horses from Sampson County. The virus, which can infect both humans and horses, was 1st detected in the 1st Sampson County horse on 15 Sep 2017, and in a 2nd horse on 9 Oct 2017. Due to the severity of the disease, both of the animals were euthanized. No human cases of EEE have been identified in N.C. so far this year [2017].

EEE is one of the most severe diseases in both horses and humans in the United States. Although rare in North Carolina, once a person is infected, there is a 33 percent likelihood of death. Survivors of EEE may suffer from long term effects to the nervous system including brain damage. Those under age 15 and over age 50 are at greatest risk of developing severe disease.

In North Carolina, EEE is more common in the eastern part of the state, where the virus is normally passed back and forth between wild birds and mosquitoes. In most cases, a particular species of mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, is responsible for EEE. This mosquito spends most of its time in freshwater hardwood swamps and prefers to bite birds rather than horses and humans, which is why human and horse cases are rare. From 2011-2015, only 4 human cases of EEE occurred in N.C., with infection occurring from July through October.

There is a vaccine for horses. The American Association of Equine Practitioners recommends vaccination against EEE as a part of a core vaccination protocol for all horses: https://aaep.org/guidelines/vaccination-guidelines/core-vaccination-guidelines. Once a horse is infected, therapy is limited to treating the symptoms of the disease, and there is no specific cure.

There is no vaccine to protect humans from EEE, and no cure once a human is infected. Therapy is limited to treating the symptoms of the disease. However, humans can protect themselves from EEE with repellents during the months that mosquitos are prevalent, with particular focus on the months of July through October. Extended periods of warm weather can prolong the mosquito population season. Use of repellants as protection is very important during this time https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you. A 2nd method is judicious suppression of mosquito populations, especially in areas near freshwater hardwood swamps https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/controlling-mosquitoes-at-home.html.

The health department advises the public to remain diligent in their personal mosquito protection efforts. These efforts should include the "5 D's" for prevention:

- Dusk and Dawn - Minimize time outdoors when mosquitoes are seeking blood. The common species that transmit EEE to humans often bite at just before or after sunset or sunrise.

- Dress - Wear loose, light-colored clothing that covers your skin.

- DEET - When the potential exists for exposure to mosquitoes, repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide,) are recommended. Picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus are other repellent options. See www.epa.gov/insect-repellents for options.

- Drainage - Check around your home to rid the area of standing water, which is where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.

- Dispose of any tires. Tires can breed thousands of mosquitoes.

- Drill holes in the bottom of recycling containers.

- Clear roof gutters of debris.

- Clean pet water dishes regularly.

- Check and empty children's toys.

- Repair leaky outdoor faucets.

- Change the water in bird baths at least once a week.

- Turn over canoes and other boats, or treat them with approved larvicides.

- Avoid water collecting on pool covers.

- Empty water collected in tarps or any other items that can hold water around the yard or on woodpiles. Even the smallest of containers can breed hundreds to thousands of mosquitoes. They don't need much water to lay their eggs. (bottles, barrels, buckets, overturned garbage can lids, outside garbage cans without lids, etc.)

- Plug or fill tree holes.

- Add minnows to isolated water such as rain barrels and ornamental ponds

- Use screened windows and doors and make sure screens fit tightly and are not torn.

- Keep tight-fitting screens or lids on rain barrels.

If you have specific questions pertaining to your horse and EEE, please consult your veterinarian or the NCDA&CS at 919-733-7601. Recently, NCDA&CS stressed the importance of vaccination for horses: http://www.ncagr.gov/paffairs/release/2010/6-10Equinevaccinations.htm.

For specific questions regarding mosquito control and prevention, contact the Sampson County Health Department at 910-592-1131.

A horse in Marathon County has tested positive for a mosquito-borne disease known as eastern equine encephalitis.

The disease, caused by the EEE virus, is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, according to the Marathon County Health Department. The positive test result in the horse means there are mosquitoes in the area carrying the virus that could infect other animals and people.

In response, the Health Department is urging people to take measures to avoid mosquito bites until cold weather eliminates them. The department recommends limiting time outside at dusk and dawn, using insect repellent on clothing and exposed skin, and trimming tall grass and weeds. It also suggests ways to eliminate or monitor sources of still water.

Most people infected with EEE don't have symptoms, the agency said, but it can cause brain inflammation in some. No cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin since 2011, and only 2 known cases have occurred since 1964.

Signs of EEE in horses include depression, drooping eyelids and lower lip, and loss of appetite. Owners can vaccinate their horses to prevent the illness.

More information about EEE can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection has confirmed 2 new cases of EEE in horses for 2017. Those cases bring the total to 23 in the state this year [2017].

The 1st horse, located in Price County, was a yearling Friesian stallion of unknown vaccination history purchased this spring. He began showing clinical signs (fever, ataxia, head tilt, head pressing and disorientation) on 20 Sep 2017, and a veterinarian was called to the farm that day. The horse was euthanized.

The 2nd confirmed EEE case in a horse occurred in an unvaccinated 10-year-old Appaloosa gelding from Marathon County. The horse began showing clinical signs (fever, recumbency, paddling) on 2 Oct 2017 and was sampled and euthanized that day.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) works to protect horses and the horse industry from the threat of infectious diseases in North America. The communication system is designed to seek and report real time information about disease outbreaks similar to how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) alerts the human population about diseases in people.

[There are a number of EEE cases as well as other arboviral-associated cases being posted on a regular basis this year [2017]. With very good vaccines available, I cannot seem to figure out why horse owners are failing to vaccinate. There are other diseases that we almost beg for a vaccine to protect our animals from, and yet when we have one, there are so many people who think there is no need to vaccinate.

The reality is, regardless of where you live, mosquitoes can transmit diseases to your horses. Please use the vaccine. It is effective in preventing the disease. - Mod.TG
