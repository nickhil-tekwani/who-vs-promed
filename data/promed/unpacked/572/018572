Regarding the editorial comment that this case was not considered a
preventable case because the child was younger than the age for beginning
vaccination, this is not the case for travelling children, according to WHO
and Health Canada. Canadian Immunization Guidelines (1998) state: "...for
children travelling to countries where measles is endemic...measles vaccine
[may be given as early as 6 months of age, but then the primary series of
two doses must be restarted after the child is 12 months old" (p195).
The question is whether measles is considered "endemic" in Japan.
GIDEON provides the following information:
* in 1998 there were 33 cases of measles in the US linked to a single
visitor from Japan to Alaska.
* in 1998 the vaccine coverage rate in Japan was 94%
* in 1998 there were 9799 cases reported (Japanese data)
* Japanese children receive 1 dose of vaccine at 12 months of age.
It would be informative to know what current rates of disease are in Japan.
If Japan has not implemented a 2-dose program, the number of susceptibles
may be significant, especially in heavily populated areas.
Also, in the reported case, how old was the uncle of the child and was he
immunized?

[As per Hasana Birk's comments above, Health Canada, the WHO (and the USA)
recommend vaccination with measles vaccine at 6 months of age if travelling
to an area of risk of infection. According to our Brazilian colleagues at
FUNASA, there is no current recommendation for measles vaccination of
children traveling to endemic areas. Of additional information from our
Brazilian colleagues is that the child in question was born in Japan and
just travelled to Brazil for tourism with his mother to visit their
relatives in Sao Paulo. The age and vaccination status of the uncle are
under investigation.
With respect to current information on measles transmission in Japan, there
is a graph on the Japanese NIID (National Institute for Infectious
Diseases) website showing the weekly incidence of measles by year since
1991, current through week 23 of this year. From this graph it is clear
there is continued transmission through this year suggesting that measles
is still endemic in Japan.
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/kanja/weeklygraph/measles.html>. Current
immunization recommendations are to start vaccinations at 12 months of age,
but in special circumstances of risk (such as an outbreak in Okinawa in
1999, <http://idsc.nih.go.jp/> vaccination is recommended beginning at age
9 months. - Mod.MPP
