Viet Nam: common source suggested for the H5N1 viruses circulating in East
Asia
-------------------------
[The current issue of the Journal of Virology contains a paper by Doan C.
Nguyen and 20 others entitled: "Isolation and Characterization of Avian
Influenza Viruses, Including Highly Pathogenic H5N1, from Poultry in Live
Bird Markets in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2001," which suggests a common source for
the H5N1 viruses circulating in East Asia. - Mod.CP]
The Abstract of the paper reads:
"Since 1997, outbreaks of highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 and circulation of H9N2
viruses among domestic poultry in Asia have posed a threat to public health.
To better understand the extent of transmission of avian influenza viruses
(AIV) to humans in Asia, we conducted a cross-sectional virologic study in
live bird markets (LBM) in Hanoi, Viet Nam, in October 2001. Specimens from
189 birds and 18 environmental samples were collected at 10 LBM. 4 influenza
A viruses of the H4N6 (n = 1), H5N2 (n = 1), and H9N3 (n = 2) subtypes were
isolated from healthy ducks for an isolation frequency of over 30 percent
from this species. 2 H5N1 viruses were isolated from healthy geese.
The hemagglutinin (HA) genes of these H5N1 viruses possessed multiple basic
amino acid motifs at the cleavage site, were HP for experimentally infected
chickens, and were thus characterized as HP AIV. These HA genes shared high
amino acid identities with genes of other H5N1 viruses isolated in Asia
during this period, but they were genetically distinct from those of H5N1
viruses isolated from poultry and humans in Viet Nam during the early 2004
outbreaks. These viruses were not highly virulent for experimentally infected
ducks, mice, or ferrets. These results establish that HP H5N1 viruses with
properties similar to viruses isolated in Hong Kong and mainland China
circulated in Viet Nam as early as 2001, suggest a common source for H5N1
viruses circulating in these Asian countries, and provide a framework to
better understand the recent widespread emergence of HP H5N1 viruses in Asia."
