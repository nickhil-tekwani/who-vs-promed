[BTV - 1 has also been identified by the reference laboratory in
Pirbright in both Morocco and Algeria in 2006. Thus, it is not
surprising to find it nearby in Tunisia.
BTV- serotype 1 was the cause of an outbreak of BT in Sardinia
earlier this month but we don't yet know the serotype for this week's
outbreak in Israel. See
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/outbreaks.htm>.
Similarly, we don't have serotype information on the outbreak in
Portugal and Bulgaria.
All this is important to understand the epidemiology of bluetongue in
this unusual year that includes the first-ever BT8 outbreak in
Northern Europe. For the location of the outbreak see -
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/TS/33/Sidi_Bouzid.html> - Mod.PC]
[No information on the current serotype in Israel, though it will be
most surprising if it is not one of the 5 serotypes known in this
country for decades, namely BTV serotypes 2,4,6,10 or 16. - Mod.AS]
