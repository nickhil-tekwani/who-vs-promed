Biosecurity Queensland has moved to quarantine a property near
Beaudesert, south of Brisbane, where a horse has died from hendravirus
[infection].

Deputy premier Paul Lucas says Queensland Health and Biosecurity
Queensland were contacted tonight [28 Jun 2011] after a vet treating
the horse on a farm at Kerry confirmed the animal had died from
hendravirus.

Mr Lucas says people on the farm will be quarantined and residents
living in the surrounding area will be contacted.

"A horse that has died near Beaudesert has tested positive for
hendravirus," he said.

"Queensland Health will be out in the community there at Kerry [and]
at the farm talking to locals, talking to people at the farm site.

"At this stage we only know of one horse and that horse is deceased
as a result of hendravirus and that is a positive result."

The virus was first detected in September 1994 at a property in the
Brisbane suburb of Hendra. Since then, there have been 14 outbreaks of
the virus.

Of the 7 people ever diagnosed with the virus 4 have died. The last
person to die from the virus was 55-year-old vet Alister Rodgers,
after he caught the virus during an outbreak at a Cawarral property
near Rockhampton in August 2009. 4 horses died during the outbreak on
the Cawarral property.

There is no known cure for the virus, which has never been reported
in human s outside Queensland.

The CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation; Australia's national science agency] is currently
developing a hendravirus vaccine for horses, which has had early
success.

The virus is considered too aggressive to be treated in horses once
they have contracted it.

[If this situation develops into an outbreak, then one has to wonder
if the vaccine mentioned in ProMED-mail post 20110525.1589 could be
used on a provisional basis?

Some background information about hendravirus from the ABC fact box
(http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/11/2652404.htm):
"Hendravirus (genus _Henipavirus_, family _Paramyxoviridae_) affects
horses and humans and is potentially deadly for infected people.
Hendravirus first emerged in Australia in August and September 1994
when 13 horses died in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra (hence the name),
and 2 horses died in an apparently unrelated outbreak in Mackay. In
Hendra, the horse Drama Series became the 1st recorded death from the
virus, and 2 people became infected after contact with the mare. One
of them, prominent horse trainer Vic Rail, died as a result. In
October 1995, a Mackay farmer, Mark Preston, 35, became the 3rd person
to be infected with the virus, and he also died as a result. It was
only after Mr Preston's infection and death that authorities
discovered the initial August 1994 infection of 2 of his horses and
made a retrospective diagnosis.

Since 1994, there have been 13 outbreaks of the disease; [7] people
have become infected, and 4 people have died.

The mortality rate for horses is extremely high, with 70 per cent of
infected animals dying from the virus. Hendravirus is commonly spread
by fruit bats. They are the natural carriers of the virus, and they
are thought to spread the virus through their urine, faeces, or
reproductive fluid. It is believed that hendravirus is not highly
contagious in people, but because all [7] cases of human infection
have been in people who have close contact with infected horses, there
are strict quarantine guidelines.

There is no evidence of human-to-human spread or human-to-horse
spread of the disease. The incubation period in humans is estimated at
5-14 days. The virus commonly affects the respiratory system, and
symptoms can often resemble influenza and pneumonia.

The virus may affect the brain as well with encephalitis type
symptoms, such as headaches, high fever and drowsiness, which can lead
to convulsions or coma." - Mod.TG]

[Since "There is no evidence of human-to-human spread or
human-to-horse spread of the disease", it is difficult to understand
why people on the farm have to be quarantined. - Mod.JW]
