A 63 year old woman from Cisne Medio was moved to the Coyhaique
Regional Hospital, suspected of having a hantavirus [infection]. The
patient felt unwell and consulted the [health] post in Villa Amengual,
an area in Coyhaique, after an explosive increase in rodents in the
area.

"We had a notice of a suspected hantavirus pulmonary infection ... in
a 63 year old woman and we now know that an explosive increase in
rodent populations occurred, so that this case does not surprise us.
However, we are on alert and are obliged to intensify our preventive
measures and warnings," said the Health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional
Ministerial de Salud; Regional Ministerial Secretariat of Health]
Claudio Vallejos, who called on the populace to adopt pertinent
preventive measures.

Alerted by what was occurring in the area, the patient consulted the
Villa Amengual health post early on. Given this, the 1st samples were
taken and were sent to the Public Health Institute in Santiago in
order to confirm or discard the presence of the virus.

case and the one following it is Andes virus.

A 73 year old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit of the
Puerto Montt Regional Hospital after having a positive rapid test for
[a] hantavirus [infection]. The patient is currently receiving
mechanical ventilation. Meanwhile health authorities are investigating
those close to her for possible infection. The diagnosis [prognosis]
is serious due to compromise of her respiratory and hemodynamic
systems, a situation that is under review by specialists.

The affected woman comes from the El Azul area of the Palena
province. On account of her respiratory problems she was sent to the
main health center in the Los Lagos region.

[Andes virus is the only hantavirus thus far shown to be
transmissible from person to person, among very close contacts. This,
and the occurrence of abundant rodents in the area, is why other
people in the patient's immediate area are being investigated for
possible infection.
