Suspected case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Spain
------------------------------------------------------------
According to medical records of the University Hospital "12 de Octubre" in
Madrid obtained by Europa Press, on 20 Dec 2002, a 30 year old man from
Madrid was diagnosed with possible variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail]. If the diagnosis is
confirmed, the patient will become the first Spanish victim of the disease.
The patient could have acquired the disease while living in the United
Kingdom between 1994 and 1996. The patient's mother informed Europa Press
that the results of the tonsil biopsy performed by the High Council for
Scientific Research (CSIC) and the Edinburgh Institute, a European
reference center for this disease, have not been received. The results are
essential for confirmation of the disease and for the family to have access
to the aid offered by the British government to victims of the disease.

The patient's mother claims, however, to have in her possession medical
notes from her son's medical records that include a positive result of the
test. The family is attempting to have the patient undergo a new
experimental therapy based on the intracerebral injection of pentosan
polysulphate, applied for the first time to a terminally ill male patient
in Northern Ireland (Belfast), but they do not know who to contact. The
Spanish patient has already received the experimental therapy developed by
Stanley Prusiner, based on the combination of quinacrine and
chlorpromazine, but the treatment had to be suspended because, according to
the mother, the patient developed hepatic side effects from the quinacrine.

The patient has been in a vegetative state for more than 2 years but his
heart, kidney, and liver functions are normal. Since last spring, he has
had multiple respiratory infections and in December 2002 he was admitted to
the "12 de Octubre" hospital with an acute febrile syndrome. He was
discharged after 17 days, and is currently at home.

There have been no "probable or confirmed" cases of vCJD in Spain,
according to the most recent data (updated on 10 Sep 2002) of the National
Registry of Transmissible Human Spongiform Encephalopathies. The registry
is part of the National Center for Epidemiology and the data are obtained
from the epidemiological surveillance services of all the autonomous
communities. The registry has collected data from all the diagnosed cases
in Spain since 1993, and includes 444 cases of CJD, of which 419 are
sporadic, 20 are of the genetic type, and 5 are iatrogenic (acquired
through the treatment with growth hormone and gonadotrophin from the
pituitary of cadavers, and to grafts of dura mater tissue).

[An earlier report of this case appeared in the La Vanguardia
<http://www.lavanguardia.es/> on Thu 25 Sep 2002. It stated that: "A 29
year old patient from Madrid, who could be the first Spanish victim of
vCJD, has been admitted to the "12 de Octubre" Hospital where he will
receive experimental therapy. The patient, who lived in England for 16
months between 1994 and 1996, had already been hospitalized in 2000 with
symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The physicians treating him state
that the tests performed [have not confirmed a diagnosis of vCJD and must
await the postmortem analysis of cerebral tissue]. However, given the age
of the patient, the possibility of vCJD cannot be discounted.

The Health Department recently approved that this patient and another,
whose identity is not known, receive "compassion therapy", a new treatment
developed by Nobel Prize winner Stanley Prusiner. The patient's mother
commented that the family hopes for his recovery. On 11 Sep 2002, she filed
a complaint against the hospital, claiming that it had not informed them of
such treatment. The family is also upset because in August 2002 they
learned through a judicial notification that the health council of the
community had ordered that, if the patient were to die, an autopsy be
performed to determine whether it was a case of the human form of mad cow
disease."

Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) contains extensive
information on surveillance in Spain <http://193.146.50.130/ecj/ecj.htm>. -

Suspected vCJD case in Spain remains unconfirmed
------------------------------------------------
Juan Jose Badiola, professor of animal health and director of the National
Reference Center for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) stated
today in Zaragoza that confirmation of vCJD in a Spanish patient will not
be possible until he dies. Badiola took part in a workshop on TSE
surveillance and control, organized by the government of Aragon, and held
at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Zaragoza.

Professor Badiola stated that the case has been known about for some months
and that it is necessary to wait for its confirmation. Nonetheless, he
added, Spain must be prepared for the emergence of cases given that there
has been "risk." Regarding bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Spain,
Badiola noted that [the peak number] of cases in the country might be
detected in 2004 and 2005 and, therefore, it could be present until 2010.

He acknowledged that veterinarians, to whom the workshop was directed, know
the disease and are aware of it, and also urged the public administrations
to take the right attitude and apply the recommended programs. Badiola
noted that the incidence of BSE in Spain is above the European mean, which
indicates that more meat meal has been consumed than was initially thought,
but that the current situation is well under control.

[There are a number of conflicting statements relating to this patient, and
as yet no positive evidence for identifying this as a case of vCJD, apart
from the young age of the patient. However, residence in the UK at the
beginning of the vCJD outbreak is a potential risk factor. - Mod.CP]
