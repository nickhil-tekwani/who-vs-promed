Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 105
---------------------------------
As of Sun 13 Jun 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of
pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18 172 deaths. WHO is actively
monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with
the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of
multiple sources of information.

Situation update
----------------
The situation remains largely unchanged since the last update [11 Jun
2010]. Overall pandemic influenza activity remains low worldwide with
geographically limited circulation of pandemic influenza virus in parts of
the tropics, particularly in parts of Central America and the Caribbean and
in parts of South and South East Asia. Seasonal influenza type B viruses
continue to circulate at low levels across Asia and to a lesser extent
across parts of Africa and South America. Recently re-emerged seasonal
influenza H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in East Africa. As countries
of the temperate southern hemisphere enter winter, overall only sporadic
influenza activity has been detected so far.

In tropical region of the Americas, low or waning circulation of pandemic
virus has been primarily reported in Costa Rica (since early 2010) and in
Cuba (last reported at the end of May 2010), respectively. In Cuba and to a
lesser extent in Costa Rica recent pandemic influenza activity has been
associated with small numbers of fatal cases. In Colombia, during the 1st
week of June 2010, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases was
associated with regional spread of pandemic influenza activity and a small
number of new fatal cases, likely reflecting increasing but low level
circulation of pandemic influenza virus. Throughout the rest of the region,
there have been only sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus during
the past month. In several countries of the region, there has been recent
circulation of seasonal influenza viruses including type A (Venezuela since
May 2010) and B (Bolivia since March 2010). Throughout the region there has
been variable ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses,
particularly RSV [respiratory syncytial virus].

In Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to actively circulate in
Malaysia, Singapore, and to a much lesser extent in parts of India,
Bangladesh, and Bhutan. In Malaysia, limited data suggest that virus
transmission persists but continues to decline; the number of new cases
reported per week plateaued during mid-April 2010 and began to decline at
the end of May 2010. In Singapore, during the 2nd week of June 2010, the
levels of ARI [acute respiratory infections] remained near the warning
level but below the epidemic threshold; tests on about 28 per cent of
respiratory samples from patients with ILI [influenza-like illnesses] were
positive for pandemic influenza virus. In South Asia, low level circulation
of pandemic influenza virus has persisted in western India (since early
2010) and Bangladesh (since late February 2010); in India but not
Bangladesh, regional, low intensity transmission during 2010 has been
associated with small numbers of fatal cases over time. Seasonal influenza
type B viruses continue to co-circulate with pandemic influenza virus in
Bangladesh and have only recently emerged and become predominant in India,
although at low levels. Of note, there have been recent media reports of
increasing pandemic influenza activity in the southern Indian state of
Kerala and more information is expected to become available soon. In
Bhutan, there have recent reports of school outbreaks of pandemic influenza
virus infection in 3 separate areas of the country, however, the overall
intensity of respiratory diseases in the population was reported to be low.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate at
low levels in limited areas of East and West Africa. During the 1st week of
June 2010, 10 per cent and 16 per cent of all respiratory samples tested
positive for pandemic influenza virus in Tanzania and Ghana, respectively.
Small but significant numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be been
detected in Kenya and Tanzania since late May 2010.

Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, pandemic
influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically in the past month.
In the temperate southern hemisphere, only 2 countries, Chile and Uruguay,
have recently reported small numbers of pandemic influenza virus
detections. Other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV, are known to be
circulating in Chile and Argentina. During 1st 2 weeks of June 2010, small
numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses have been detected in
South Africa. In New Zealand and Australia, overall levels of ILI remain
low; only sporadic detections of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses
have been recently reported in Australia.

The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the
global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal, and
other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans
including seasonal influenza.

The displayed data reflect the most recent data reported to Flunet
(<http://www.who.int/FluNet>), WHO regional offices, or on Ministry of
health websites in the last 2 weeks. The percentages of specimens tested
positive for influenza include all specimens tested positive for seasonal
or pandemic influenza. The pie charts show the distribution of virus
subtypes among all specimens that were tested positive for influenza. The
available country data were joined in larger geographical areas with
similar influenza transmission patterns to be able to give an overview
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/transmission_zones/en>).

*The reported number of fatal cases is an under representation of the
actual numbers as many deaths are never tested or recognized as influenza
related.
**No update since 7 Mar 2010
