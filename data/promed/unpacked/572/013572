The veterinary services at the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed the registration of 109 outbreaks of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, of which 108 were recorded in cattle and only one outbreak in wild ruminants (deer). No deaths were recorded. Veterinary services have warned of the risks of its spread.

[On 23 Oct 2021, Tunisia officially reported to OIE 4 epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) outbreaks in cattle located in Kasserine, Ariana, and El Kef governorates. The results of gene sequencing aren't available yet (see http://promedmail.org/post/20211026.8699248). Outbreaks in cattle were also recorded in Siliana governorate. Cases in wild ruminants (deer) were recorded in Jendouba governorate (https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8699333).

EHDV serotype 6 emerged for the 1st time in Tunisia in 2006, almost simultaneously with Morocco and Algeria. During this 1st outbreak, clinical cases were reported in cattle herds. In Tunisia, the previous occurrence dates from September 2015, when a bovine outbreak was recorded in Mahdia governorate (20151002.3685159). - Mod.SF

Samples from affected animals were submitted to the OIE reference laboratory in Teramo (IZS, 'G. Caporale', Abruzzo and Molise) for serotyping and gene sequencing; results are pending. According to media reports, there is an ongoing epizootic of another orbivirus, bluetongue (BT), in Tunisia, affecting sheep and cattle. Most of the (27) BT virus serotypes cause viraemia in cattle with very mild or no clinical signs; BTV-8 is exceptional. The results of the laboratory tests are expected to determine the definitive diagnosis of cattle presenting clinical signs in Tunisia, addressing ProMED's RFI (20211125.8699865).

EHD, an OIE-listed disease, is a vector-borne infectious noncontagious viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants, primarily white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) and cattle. Sheep, goats and camelids might also be susceptible, but usually do not develop overt disease.

Tunisia's information about EHD in deer, in Jendouba governorate, most likely refers to the endangered sub-species Barbary deer, _Cervus elaphus barbarus_, kept in the El Feidja reserve (map at <tinyurl.com/36935kz5>). Background on the Barbary deer can be found at https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/14/prop/E14-P09.pdf and pictures at https://storyteller.travel/african-deer/. - Mod.AS
