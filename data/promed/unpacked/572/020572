There are now some scant, but several, lines of evidence for the
existence of a hantavirus in India, and of its pathogenicity for
humans. The problem is that neither the exact hantavirus species, nor
its small mammal host are known so far, and that we probably have to
do with a new, hitherto unknown hantavirus species, hence the
difficulty of pinpointing it. An additional difficulty is that medical
awareness for isolated hantavirus cases in India is only recently
growing (as admitted for the Maharashtra patient), but nevertheless it
is improbable that large outbreaks, such as occur elsewhere in the
world, would have gone unnoticed in the past.

Although exceptional for Old World hantavirus infections (wherein the
kidney is the main target organ), some of these have clear lung
involvement as well, as in the described female Maharashtra patient.
The symptoms consist of rapid-onset, non-cardiogenic acute lung edema
(ARDS) that is, a complication hitherto mainly described in the New
World as "hantavirus pulmonary syndrome" (HPS). It is a common
misconception however, often repeated in the literature, that fatal or
non-fatal lung involvement should be typical only for New World
hantavirus infections. Already in 1994 a series of 7 Belgian Puumala
virus (a European hantavirus) patients was described with an HPS-like
complication, but non-fatal (Clement J, Colson P, Mc Kenna P:
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New England and Europe. N Engl J Med.
1994 Aug 25; 331(8): 545-8;
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/331/8/545?ijkey=6e6c5a28ac9c1dc7ee1d684850e21f0772a0e9dd&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha>).

Other symptoms that are almost always present are fever, myalgiae, and
varying degrees of acute renal failure (ARF), with typical lab
anomalies, such as initial thrombocytopenia and proteinuria. It would
be interesting to see if these anomalies were also present in the
patient described here. All these symptoms and lab anomalies are
rapidly self-remitting, as was apparently the case here, but bilateral
interstitial lung edema may be so extreme as to necessitate mechanical
ventilation in an ICU. In fact, one of the 2 fatal hantavirus patients
previously described in South India developed ARF and an HPS picture
with extreme hypoxia, prompting not only dialysis for fluid removal,
but additionally, also mechanical ventilation. Despite this intensive
care treatment, the patient died in refractory shock on hospital day 7.

As indicated earlier, the 2 fatal and other cases in India showed
serologic evidence in 2 different test formats for a Puumala virus
(PUUV) (Clement J, Maes P, Muthusethupathi M, Nainan G, Van Ranst M:
First evidence of fatal hantavirus nephropathy in India, mimicking
leptospirosis. Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2006 Mar ;21(3): 826-7;
<http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/3/826>).

In Europe and Russia, PUUV infections are spread by bank voles
(_Myodes glareolus_), but this rodent is absent from India, as are all
other related species of the Arvicolinae subfamily. Consequently,
[since hantaviruses are highly reservoir-host specific - Mod.JW] PUUV
cannot be expected to be endemic in India, and we had to do with
cross-reactions. In the meantime, we found similar serologic evidence
for PUUV-like infection in non-fatal hantavirus cases in Sri Lanka,
considered to be leptospirosis cases, some of which also presented
with cough or dyspnea (manuscript in preparation, and see ProMED-mail
20080606 "Leptospirosis- Sri Lanka (02): Hantavirus also suspected").
Sri Lanka is a country neighbouring India, with a fauna very similar
to it, including the total absence of rodent species of the
Arvicolinae subfamily. We applied RT-PCR on all these "PUUV-positive"
sera, including the 2 fatal cases, with primers specific for most of
the hitherto known hantaviral pathogens: PUUV, SEOV [Seoul virus],
Hantaan virus (HTNV), Dobrava virus (DOBV), and Andes virus (ANDV).
All turned out to be negative. Moreover, we also performed RT-PCR for
Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), which was equally negative. TPMV is the
only indigenous hantavirus with a documented presence in India, since
it was isolated already in 1964 from a house shrew (_Suncus murinus_)
captured in Thottapalayam, near Vellore in south India. No human TPMV
pathogenicity has been demonstrated so far, and it should be noted
that shrews are insectivores, not rodents. So far, human hantavirus
pathogenicity has been linked to rodents only.

Of all of the pathogenic hantaviruses known to date, none has a small
mammal reservoir with a spread in India or Sri-Lanka. Detecting
unknown or "new" viruses is not an easy task. Moreover, RT-PCR
negativity in clinical samples can have multiple causes, including
poor conservation characteristics of the samples or (too) late
sampling. We are now in the process of developing new tests for this
problem, including primers for RT-PCR for several other newly
discovered insectivore-borne hantaviruses. Examining acute serum
samples of the described female Maharashtra patient, if available,
with these new techniques could be very rewarding.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Clement and Maes for this interesting and
thorough assessment of the hantavirus situation in India. ProMED
awaits with considerable interest further information about the
presence of new hantaviruses in India as it becomes available.
