One more case of sylvan yellow fever has been confirmed in 2002. This time
it was in the municipality of Breves, on Marajo Island in Para state, where
there was an outbreak in 1998-99.
During the case investigation, dead monkeys & sloths were found near the
probable focus of infection. In Amazonas state also, there have been
reports of dead sloths in places where human cases occur.
In 2002 the total is already 6 cases & 2 deaths (case fatality rate of 33%).

[As far back as the 1930s, Fred Soper & other researchers suspected the
sloth to be a reservoir of sylvan YF. - Mod.LJS]
