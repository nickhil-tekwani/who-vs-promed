An E coli [O157] outbreak at the SSE Hydro arena affecting 22 people was due to "under-cooking" of beef burgers at the venue, a report has found. The Glasgow [Scotland] venue was hit by an outbreak of cases of the infection in January and February of 2014 among people attending events there.

Of the 22 confirmed cases, a total of 19 of those cases attended had eaten beef burgers at the SSE Hydro's food stall, Big Grill, between Friday 17 and Sunday 19 Jan 2014. The remaining 3 individuals were infected after having household contact with the initial cases. The majority of those affected were not severely unwell, however 3 individuals need hospital treatment as a result. 9 people were formally excluded from work or education as a result, and for one of those affected this resulted in a prolonged absence from their workplace.

An investigation by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) alongside other public health bodies concluded: "Descriptive evidence gathered by environmental health officers strongly suggests processing errors leading to under-cooking as well as the potential for cross contamination in the preparation and serving of the beef burger products.

"These processing errors would provide plausible mechanisms for exposure to EHEC (a strain of _E. coli_)."

Health inspectors then visited the popular music venue after reports of the infection to examine how food was prepared by staff. They found that preparation of food at "The Big Grill" at the venue involved a lack of consistency in the searing and cooking process of burgers.

Inspectors observed inadequacy of temperature monitoring records and weaknesses in temperature monitoring of food to test how cooked items were by staff.

It was also discovered there was "an inappropriate cleaning and disinfection regime, and an absence of documented evidence of a hazard analysis" at the venue.

All of the 19 confirmed primary cases had eaten a 6 ounce burger served on a bread bun from the Big Grill stall. 10 of the 19 confirmed cases had cheese on their burger. No other additions to the burger such as salad or condiments were consumed by the confirmed cases.

[The seminal outbreak of EHEC O157:H7 was associated with undercooked ground beef, and this vehicle will remain prototypically associated with the infection. Commercial ground beef is not simply a piece of meat that is run through a grinder but rather it is usually produced in bulk using the parts of the cow remaining after primal cuts of beef (to produce steaks and roasts) are removed, usually from multiple cows and even different slaughterhouses. This lower grade product, called beef trim, tends to be cut from the parts of the cow more likely to have had contact with bovine sources of EHEC.

Even if contaminated, the risk of transmission of EHEC in ground beef can be eliminated by adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen hygiene, which did not occur here. - Mod.LL
