The CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) on 30 Jun
2007, ordered a biodefense research laboratory at Texas A&M
University to stop all work on select agents and toxins while it
investigates reports of lab workers infected with the category B
bioterror agents _Brucella_ and _Coxiella burnetii_.
The Sunshine Project, an Austin, Texas, nonprofit group that monitors
biodefense research safety, recently reported the alleged lab
accidents, along with related alleged violations of federal law. The
group used Texas freedom-of-information requests to obtain documents
about the lab incidents.
In April 2007, the Sunshine Project reported that a Texas A&M
researcher had been infected with _Brucella_ after a February 2006
aerosol chamber mishap and that the school did not immediately notify
the CDC as required by federal law.
[On 26 Jun 2007], the watchdog group reported that the exposure of 3
other Texas A&M workers to _C. burnetii_, which causes Q fever, was
confirmed in April 2006 but also was not reported to the CDC.
The Sunshine Project said its investigation of Texas A&M came about
through its review of select-agent labs that are vying to host the
federal government's planned new national biodefense facility,
according to a 27 Jun 2007 report in the Dallas Morning News.
The laboratory is affiliated with the Foreign Animal and Zoonotic
Disease Defense Center, a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
center of excellence that focuses on the study of foot-and-mouth
disease, avian influenza, and Rift Valley fever, according to the
center's website. The center is funded by a USD 18 million DHS grant,
according to an Associated Press report.
According to the Sunshine Project, Texas A&M notified the CDC about
the case of brucellosis in April 2007, a year after the worker's
illness was confirmed. Shortly after Texas A&M report,
representatives from the CDC's Select Agents and Toxins Division
inspected the laboratory and, in a 30 Jun 2007 memo, obtained and
released by the Sunshine Project, ordered the lab to stop its work on
all select agents and toxins until further notice.
Von Roebuck, a CDC spokesman, told CIDRAP News that the agency has
never issued such a broad suspension order to a lab before. He said
the 30 Jun 2007 order applies to every agent the lab works with. The
list of affected agents is not public information because of security
concerns, Roebuck said. In the letter, the CDC outlined the concerns
it has about the lab, which include the adequacy of biosafety plans,
security of the facility from unauthorized visitors, occupational
safety protocols, authorization from the CDC to work with certain
agents, and compliance with federal select agent regulations.
Roebuck said CDC officials would visit the Texas laboratory again in
the next few weeks to gather more information about its procedures
and protocols. "Then the agency will move forward with any
recommendations to get them under compliance," he said.
In a statement sent to Texas A&M faculty and staff on Fri 29 Jun
2007, the school's interim president, Eddie J. Davis, said the
laboratory incidents did not pose a threat to anyone on or off
campus, but conceded that the university should have reported the
worker's brucellosis in a more timely manner. (The university
provided CIDRAP News with a copy of the statement.)
Davis said none of the workers who were exposed to the Q fever agent
got sick and that Texas A&M was going beyond health monitoring
standards at other select-agent labs by monitoring workers' blood for
the organism. He said the University believed that the threshold for
reporting worker exposure was a confirmed illness.
"We are unequivocally committed to taking all appropriate steps to
ensure we are in full compliance with all CDC and any other relevant
policies and regulations," he said.
_Coxiella burnetii_ causes an influenza-like disease in humans that
is rarely fatal, according to the CDC. However, it is highly
infectious when it becomes airborne and is inhaled by humans. The
agent has previously been weaponized and is considered a potential
terrorist threat.
Brucellosis presents prolonged fever and a wide range of other
possible manifestations, such as arthritis, hepatitis, and
meningitis. Symptoms can be prolonged, but the disease is rarely
fatal. In livestock, brucellosis causes infertility and abortions. As
bioterrorism agents, _Brucella_ strains are inexpensive to produce
and disperse, according to an August 2005 article in the CDC journal
Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID).
