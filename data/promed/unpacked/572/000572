The North Carolina State Fair [13-23 Oct 2011] remains the focus of
the investigation into an _E. coli_ outbreak that resulted in 9
confirmed and 15 suspected cases, state health officials said Mon 31
Oct 2011.

Those numbers could fluctuate in the coming days as investigators
continue to interview people about their comings and goings at the
fair, officials with the state Division of Public Health said.

All 24 sick people were at the fair, said Dr Megan Davies, the state
epidemiologist. But investigators had not determined whether the cases
were linked to a petting zoo, an animal exhibit or food vendor. "If
there were a contaminated food or water source, we would have expected
to see more people," Davies said.

But at this point, Davies said, she was not prepared to eliminate food
as a possible source of the contamination. Health officials have
distributed lengthy questionnaires to those who got sick, asking them
what they did and what they touched while visiting the fair. They also
randomly selected 70 people who attended the fair but who did not get
sick to help compare their experiences with those who did.

4 children and an adult remain hospitalized, according to Davies.

The outbreak has touched 7 counties, with the bulk of the cases
reported in Wake County. Sampson County reported 7 cases, and Wilson
County has 2. Durham, Orange, Johnston, and Cleveland counties each
have reported a single case.

Brian Long, a public affairs official with the state Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services, said he and his colleagues are
working with health officials to determine the source of the
outbreak.

"We're very concerned at even the possibility that it could have
originated at the fair," Long said. "We want some answers." Long added
that ultimately the source may never be known. "That would be really
frustrating to us because if we know the source, then we can determine
whether or not it's something that can be fixed," he said.

In 2004, state health officials found more than 100 cases of _E. coli_
tied to a petting zoo at the fair. Many children were sickened, and
the outbreak resulted in new state laws governing such events. Fencing
and hand-washing stations are now required at petting zoos. Food and
drinks are prohibited in areas where there are live animals, and signs
must caution visitors of the potential for danger.
