Epidemiology of Hepatitis E in Spain
------------------------------------
According to research at the Hospital Valle de Hebron in Barcelona, the
epidemiology of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) in non-endemic countries must
be reviewed, given that there are sporadic cases of HEV hepatitis in which
pigs may be the animal reservoir. In industrialized countries, HEV may be
associated with sporadic imported cases, although some studies show that
1-5% of the population of those countries have antibodies.
The research project describes the detection and genetic characterization
of HEV strains in Spain, in a region not considered endemic, and the
identification of pigs as animal reservoirs of HEV. In order to identify
the viral strains, researchers used nested RT-PCR followed by sequencing of
the resulting amplified fragments. ELISA was used for antibody detection in
human and swine serum samples.
Tests showed that 20% of the analyzed samples of serum from pigs of various
ages and locations had antibodies against HEV. In addition, some strains of
HEV have been detected in residual waters in Barcelona and in the sera of
patients from the same area with acute hepatitis. Over the past year, HEV
RNA has been detected in 8 samples of residual waters. Of the 67 samples
from hepatitis patients tested, 10% had anti-HEV antibodies.

[This report is an excerpt from ref. 1 below. The initial report
identifying the relationship between Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and a swine
virus was published in 1997 (ref. 2). Since then, HEV has been under
consideration as a zoonotic disease. In addition there have been concerns
with respect to HEV and xenotransplantation -- use of pig organs for human
transplants. Clearly it is an emerging disease in terms of our knowledge
and recognition of the organism.
Hepatitis caused by HEV is clinically indistinguishable from hepatitis A
disease. Symptoms include malaise, anorexia, abdominal pain, arthralgia,
and fever. HEV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Waterborne and
person-to-person spread have been documented. The potential exists for
foodborne transmission. Major waterborne epidemics have occurred in Asia
and North and East Africa. The first reported outbreaks occurred among
Ethiopian refugees in Somalia and the Sudan in 1985 and 1986 (MMWR
36(16):1987 ) and in Mexico in 1986 ( MMWR 36(36):1987). The incubation
period for hepatitis E varies from 2 to 9 weeks. The disease usually is
mild and resolves in 2 weeks, leaving no sequelae. The fatality rate is
0.1-1% except in pregnant women. This group is reported to have a fatality
rate approaching 20%.
