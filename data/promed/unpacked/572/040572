Experts pinpoint reason for 300 duck deaths in Guangzhou
--------------------------------------------------------
The deaths of some 300 ducks in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, was caused by a virus [sic; in fact a bacterium -- see comment at
end] and not the H5N1 bird flu, reports the provincial agriculture department.
The dead and affected ducks were culled by 27 Feb 2006, and the duck farm in
the Huadu District of the city has been disinfected, according to department
officials.
A villager in Huadong Township purchased 650 ducklings in December
[2005] and January this year [2006] and had been raising them at a
pond he contracted, according to the district agriculture department.
The deaths occurred on 24 Feb 2006. The virus [sic] is also known as
New Duck Disease, as it usually infects only ducklings. The duck
farmer did not take measures to cope with the epidemic.
The district agriculture department sent experts to the pond on 27
Feb 2006. They found that the water quality of the pond was bad and
that it contained many dead fish.
Experts culled the remaining ducks and disinfected the pond.
The disease is quite infectious among ducklings aged 2 to 4 weeks. It
is usually triggered by an unclean breeding environment and spreads
quickly in cold weather.

[Infectious serositis is one of the various names of a bacterial
disease in ducks caused by _Rimerella anatipestifer_. The other names
are new duck disease and _Pasteurella anatipestifer_ infection. For
further details, see
<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp>.
A bacterin and, more recently, a live vaccine, which include the 3
most common immunotypes of _R. anatipestifer_ , are available for use
in ducks.
The disease does not affect humans. Laboratory confirmation of the bacterium
as the only causative disease agent, excluding avian influenza, is
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
