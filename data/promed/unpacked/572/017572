Reports from Vaiola Hospital have confirmed that dengue fever has
claimed 2 lives as of yesterday [2 Mar 2008]. A senior doctor at the
hospital, Dr Malakai 'Ake (Pusiaki), has stated that a 23-year-old
male police officer and an infant died as a result of serious
complications caused by the fever.

Dengue fever is a flu-like illness spread by the bite of an infected
mosquito. It seems like the 2 victims suffered from dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which is a more severe form and is often
fatal.

According to Dr 'Ake, the 2 victims had hemorrhagic symptoms and, as
a result, died from the complications.

The Health Department has renewed its call for the public to take
extra precautions during this epidemic by:
- Destroying mosquito larvae habitat;
- Using mosquito nets, coils and insect cream as protection; and
- Taking lots of panadol if you notice any symptoms, and take plenty of rest.

Dr. 'Ake said that the dengue epidemic started showing up between
June and December last year [2007], when it claimed one victim. There
were also between 50-60 people who received treatment for the fever.
However, this year [2008], the number of people contracting the fever
has tripled, with over 200 now seeking treatment.

The potentially deadly dengue fever tally in Port Douglas has risen to 14.

Health officials yesterday [7 Mar 2008] revealed that the infection
rate of the disease continues to climb, despite mosquito traps laid
around the town and spraying at sites where dengue has been reported.

Public Health officials again called for residents to crack down on
mosquito breeding sites.

"Now would be a good time for everyone to check their yards and
gutters and make sure they're not breeding mosquitoes," entomologist
Brian Montgomery said.

Dozens of houses and apartments around Port Douglas have been
included in dengue warning zones, including residences and shops in
streets surrounding Macrossan St.

In the centre of Mossman, streets to the west of Front St, between
Grogan and Harper St, have been declared a warning zone.

In 2003, more than 30 people contracted dengue in the inner-Cairns
suburb of Parramatta Park, and a 1997-98 outbreak struck down 500
people in the Cairns and Port Douglas area with dengue fever.
