From: Ellicott McConnell <eck@shore.intercom.net>

It would be interesting to know if other, predisposing, factors are
currently present in Nepal, poor nutrition induced by crop failure, for
instance.
Incidentally, if the spleen is enlarged and hard, as is typically the case
in kala azar patients, more infections will be picked up if that organ is
biopsied instead of the liver.
Also, there was an interesting comment concerning leishmaniasis in Europe,
to the effect that treatment may abolish symptoms, but does not eliminate
the infection. I suspect that may often be the case, but have not seen it
stated before. Does anyone know the source of that information?

[Thank you very much for your comment. Does anyone from Nepal have any
data? It was Andreas Pospischil from the Institute for Veterinary
Pathology, University of Zurich, Switzerland <apos@vetpath.unizh.ch> who
stated that treatment may reduce symptoms but not cure the infection, and
maybe he can come up with a reference. - Mod.EP
