Epidemic mycoplasma, Boston area
--------------------------------
90 percent attack rate, whole families ill, with individual family
members suffering varying degrees of clinical severity. Often
misdiagnosed as a viral syndrome.

Features
--------
Fever (101-103 deg F/38.5-39.5 deg C), although milder cases may be
afebrile; fever resolves over 2-3 days.
Malaise (moderate-severe), although patient appears non-toxic.
Nasal congestion (mild-moderate), with scant rhinorrhea or postnasal
drip.
Pharyngitis, often severe enough to make swallowing difficult.
Pharyngeal appearance: unimpressive compared with reported
odynophagia/sore throat; no exudate, no tonsillar swelling; no
enanthem; mild injection common.
Some anterior cervical LAD [lymphadenopathy]; mild, without notably
enlarged nodes.
Sometimes accompanied by otalgia (e.g. yellowish exudate behind
protruding TM [tympanic membrane], with muffled hearing in affected
ear)
A non-productive cough, severe, spasmodic, worse at night (often
prohibiting sleep), persistent, no dyspnea; scant findings on
auscultation
Mild abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite
Prompt clinical improvement (about 2 days) after starting for example
doxycycline in adults or azithromycin in children

Source: Pediatrician of my child who exhibited the features above
especially severe, spasmodic, non-productive cough (largely nocturnal,
without dyspnea), otalgia with otoscopic findings as noted. The whole
family had similar syndrome with variability in severity of features.
After evaluation of my child, was informed by Eleanor Menzin, MD of
Longwood Pediatrics that this was regionally epidemic mycoplasma with
high attack rate, prominent sore throat and severe, non-remitting
nocturnal cough.

[According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the
clinical features of the majority of cases of _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_
are upper respiratory tract infections with fever, cough, malaise, and
headache, that may lead to tracheobronchitis with fever and
nonproductive cough
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/mycoplasmapneum_t.htm.
Radiologically confirmed pneumonia develops in 5-10 percent of cases,
and rare extrapulmonary syndromes, including cardiologic, neurologic,
and dermatologic findings. The etiologic agent _Mycoplasma
pneumoniae,_ is a small bacterium.

Each year an estimated 2 million cases and 100 000 pneumonia-related
hospitalizations occur in the United States. Persistent cough is
common during convalescence; other sequelae are rare. Fatal cases are
reported occasionally, primarily among the elderly and persons with
sickle-cell disease.

Person-to-person transmission occurs by contact with respiratory
secretions. Persons of all ages are at risk but rarely children less
than 5 years old. It is the leading cause of pneumonia in school-age
children and young adults. Outbreaks can occur especially in crowded
military and institutional (such as a college) settings.

Diagnosis of acute infections remains difficult; therefore, early
recognition of outbreaks has been problematic. Prevention of secondary
cases in outbreaks requires prompt initiation of control measures.

ProMED-mail thanks Frederick Lee for drawing attention to this
outbreak in the Boston area. - Mod.CP]

[Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ belongs to the class of bacteria that are
especially notable for the total lack of a cell wall. Because of
their
small size and the presence of a deformable surface membrane, they can
pass
through filters with pore diameters that would retain non-deformable
cell-wall-covered bacteria and therefore, were first thought to be
viruses. They do replicate in cell-free media and contain both DNA
and
RNA, which distinguishes them from viruses.

Outbreaks of respiratory disease with pneumonia caused by _M.
pneumoniae_
do occur especially in closed groups of susceptible individuals such
as a
military recruit camp or a school. Data on such events can be found
in the
postings from a cluster of mycoplasmal respiratory disease in the USA
midwest in 1998 (See archives listed below). Classically, the disease
bullous myringitis is linked to _M. pneumoniae_ infection but the
associations were mainly made prior to the available of specific and
sensitive tests for the infection. It is not stated in the post how
the diagnosis of mycoplasma infection was made in these cases.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis with a macrolide (such as erythromycin,
azithromycin, or clarithromycin) or a tetracycline has been used in
such
outbreaks or in endemic settings with apparent success. - Mod. LL
