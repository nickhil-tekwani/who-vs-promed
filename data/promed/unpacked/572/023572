Diphtheria Â­- Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh
---------------------------------------
From 3 Nov 2017 through 12 Dec 2017, a total of 804 suspected diphtheria cases including 15 deaths were reported among the displaced Rohingya population in Cox's Bazar (Figure 1 [Epidemic curve: Number of diphtheria cases among the displaced Rohingya population in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh reported by date of illness onset from 3 Nov 2017 through 12 Dec 2017 available at source URL]).

Of the suspected cases, 73 percent are younger than 15 years of age and 60 percent females (the sex for 1 percent cases was not reported). 14 of 15 deaths reported among suspected diphtheria cases were children younger than 15 years of age. To date, no cases of diphtheria have been reported from local communities.

Public health response
----------------------
Since August 2017, more than 646 000 people from neighbouring Myanmar have gathered in densely populated camps and temporary settlements with poor access to clean water, sanitation, and health services. A multi-agency diphtheria task force, led by the Ministry of Health Family Welfare of Bangladesh, has been providing clinical and public health services to the displaced population. WHO has mobilized USD 3 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) to support essential health services in Bangladesh.

WHO is working with health authorities to provide tetanus diphtheria (Td) vaccines for children aged 7 to 15 years, as well as pentavalent vaccines (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b, and hepatitis B) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) for children aged 6 weeks to 6 years [of age]. A list of essential medicines and required supplies to support the response is being finalized by WHO and partners. The Serum Institute of India has donated 300 000 doses of pentavalent vaccines for use in the response.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The current outbreak in Cox's Bazar is evolving rapidly. To date, all suspected cases have occurred among the displaced Rohingya population, who are living in temporary settlements with difficult and crowded conditions. The coverage of diphtheria toxoid containing vaccines among the displaced Rohingya population is difficult to estimate, although diphtheria outbreaks are an indication of low overall population vaccination coverage. Available vaccination data for Bangladesh indicates that the coverage of diphtheria toxoid containing vaccines is high. However, spillover into the local population cannot be ruled out. WHO considers the risk at the national level to be moderate and low at the regional and global levels.

WHO advice
----------
WHO recommends timely clinical management of suspected diphtheria cases that is consistent with WHO guidelines consisting of diphtheria antitoxin, appropriate antibiotics, and implementation of infection prevention and control measures. High-risk populations such as young children, close contacts of diphtheria cases, and health workers should be vaccinated on priority basis. A coordinated response and community engagement can reduce the risk of further transmission and help to control the outbreak.

[Rohingya refugees from Myanmar arrived in Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh, joining an existing refugee population, some of whom have been in the camps for years, others displaced more recently; as of late September 2017, Bangladesh was said to be sheltering 800 000 displaced Rohingya (https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/unicef-ramps-relief-myanmar-refugees/32834).

UNICEF USA reports, "The refugee camps and makeshift settlements in Bangladesh are well over capacity. There is tremendous pressure on already scarce resources. There are shortages of food, water, and other necessities. The overcrowded, unhygienic conditions are increasing the risk of cholera and other disease outbreaks. Malnutrition and exhaustion make children especially vulnerable." "UNICEF and partners have been trucking in clean water, installing latrines, and distributing hygiene kits and water purification tablets. Response teams are also screening and treating malnourished children, and mobilizing teams of vaccinators in preparation for what will be the second largest cholera immunization campaign ever, after Haiti in 2016."
