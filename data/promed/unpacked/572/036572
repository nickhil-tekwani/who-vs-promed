Health officials report 2 additional confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis. The cases were in the Eastern District of Chiayi City and the Zuoying District of Kaohsiung City.

The Department of Disease Control said that the 2 new cases were a 50-year-old male from Chiayi City and a 50-year-old female from and Kaohsiung City. Both had no recent history of foreign travel. They developed fever/symptoms on 21 and 23 May 2019, respectively. The 2 cases are currently being treated in the intensive care unit.

Among the cases in Chiayi City, there are several pig houses, paddy fields, and poultry houses within 3 km [1.9 miles] of the residents of the Eastern District and the vegetable gardens of Zhongpu Township in Chiayi County. As for the Kaohsiung City case, there are no pig houses near the home, but there are paddy fields and otters. The health unit has gone to the surrounding homes to carry out environmental surveys, remove un-hygienic sources, and to place mosquito traps in pig houses and poultry houses to reduce the density of vector mosquitoes, and to strengthen publicity of the issue to the local people.

There are 4 confirmed cases in the current year, including 3 cases in Kaohsiung City and one case in Chiayi City.

[The above cases indicate that the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season is now underway in Taiwan. We expect cases to occur sporadically until the transmission season ends in October 2019. The mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, and other related Culex species are efficient vectors of JEV and breed in wet areas such as rice paddies. These Culex mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease. It is not stated whether the affected individuals above had been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites. - Mod.TY]
