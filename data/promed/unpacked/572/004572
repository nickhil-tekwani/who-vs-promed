It's a disease that is often associated with persecution and isolation, but leprosy has been reported in Brevard County 5 times in the last year.

Most of the folklore and fear have dissipated over the centuries though, and a large majority of people are immune. Most cases are routine and easily treated. "95 percent of people cannot get leprosy," said Barry Inman, epidemiologist with the Brevard County Health Department. "You have to have a defect of the immune system to acquire leprosy."

Hammerling [a physician assistant with Florida Dermatology Associates] added that about 15 patients with leprosy have come to their offices since 2008.

Inman said the disease can be transferred through such contact as sneezing, but also through direct contact with infected 9-banded armadillos, which somehow carry _Mycobacterium leprae_, an agent that causes leprosy. "It may be more of a sentinel than a reservoir for transmission," said Inman.

A theory that Hammerling has heard is that armadillos somehow take the _Mycobacterium leprae_, naturally produced in monkeys and chimpanzees, and transfer the agents from there, though monkeys and chimps aren't typically found in Florida. "People don't really know how it's being transmitted," said Hammerling. "A lot of people have talked around this area and that people are in their gardens, and the armadillos are in their gardens, and then people put their hands in the soil."

The Brevard Zoo allows patrons to pet their 9-banded armadillos. Those animals, like all animals at the zoo, according to marketing director Andrea Hill, receive regular check-ups, and zoo guests are unlikely to contract the disease from them. She also noted that the disease is "usually severe and fatal" to the armadillos, and it shows itself much faster than in humans.

Hammerling also noted that one recent patient at the Florida Dermatology Associates office previously had cancer, which she believed lowered her immune system.

The spread of the disease can be halted quickly with proper medical care. "After one day of treatment, they're no longer infectious," said Inman. The bad news is that the recovery time from the illness can be lengthy. "People may have to go on therapy for a while, 6 months to a year," said Inman. Hammerling added that those with the illness may be on antibiotics for "2 years." Above all, she advises that those with a numb area or spot on their skin visit a doctor to test whether they have the disease. "If someone gets a rash, don't just keep slapping cream on," said Hammerling.

According to the World Health Organization and WedMD, 180 000 people worldwide are infected with the disease, with the majority of those cases coming from Africa and Asia. The Brevard Zoo says about 150 people in the U.S. are infected each year.

[In the US, about 150 new cases of leprosy are reported yearly. About 70 percent of these cases are believed to be "imported," that is, they lived or worked abroad in regions where leprosy is prevalent and may have acquired their disease there. However, about 30 percent of new cases in the US report no foreign residence in regions where the disease is prevalent and, therefore, likely acquired leprosy in the US. Most of these indigenously acquired cases reside in Texas and Louisiana, where wild _Mycobacterium leprae_-infected armadillos can be found.

The armadillo population in these south-central states (Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama) is derived from armadillos that migrated northward from Mexico and Central and South America and are naturally infected with _M. leprae_. Armadillos are particularly susceptible to leprosy due to their unusually low body temperature of 34 C (93 F), similar to human skin, which is hospitable to _M. leprae_. In addition to humans, 9-banded armadillos (_Dasypus novemcinctus_) are the only other natural host of _M. leprae_, and armadillos develop a systemically disseminated disease with similar structural and pathological changes as observed in tissues and nerves of humans with leprosy (http://dmm.biologists.org/content/6/1/19.full). A picture of an armadillo can be found at the source URL.

Armadillos are only found in the Americas and range from northern Argentina to the south-central United States. When armadillos became infected with _M. leprae_ is unknown, but the animals must have acquired the infection from humans sometime in the last few hundred years.

Armadillos 1st arrived in Florida during the 1920s and 1930s, having been released from a zoo and escaped from a traveling circus (http://armadillo-online.org/expansion.html). _M. leprae_, however, has not yet been detected in the armadillo population residing in Florida or Georgia (http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw362).

A study reported in 2011 that 39 of 50 patients with multibacillary leprosy reported residence in Mexico or US states where leprosy-infected armadillos are found, and 29 of the 39 reported no foreign residence. Genotyping confirmed the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ in 28 of the 33 armadillos that were captured in the wild in 5 southern states in the US (Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) and in 22 of 29 patients who had never lived outside the US and Mexico and who resided in states with leprosy-infected armadillos (1). Interviews with 15 of the leprosy patients further revealed that 8 had had direct contact with armadillos. This genotype had not been reported previously elsewhere in the world. In patients whose risk was foreign residence only, the genotype was typical for the strains found in that foreign region.

Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995; see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml. Patients are believed to be no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months, and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months.

It would be interesting to learn whether the 5 Brevard County, Florida patients in 2014 in the news report above or the previously reported 3 Volusia County, Florida patients (ProMED-mail post Leprosy - USA: (FL) human, armadillo, transmission, susp) had foreign residence at any time in leprosy-endemic regions, if genotyping _M. leprae_ from these Florida patients reveals the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ found only in the Western Hemisphere, and if _M. leprae_ has been detected in any wild Florida armadillos. Information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Brevard County, with a population of 543 376, is located along the east-central Florida coast along the Atlantic Ocean, immediately south of Volusia County.
