As of [Thu 7 Sep 2017], there have been a total of:
1715 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
690 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.2 percent],

22 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[From the above summary report from Saudi Arabia, with the absence of new cases reported from Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region), the epidemiologic picture has returned to sporadic cases reported, with a mix of history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, and those where high risk exposure histories have not been fully investigated by the time of the report of the case.

†Case was detected through contact tracing of a previous MERS-CoV case.
**Hospitalized for other unrelated condition prior to symptom onset.

Among the 12 newly reported cases, 6 were associated with a MERS cluster in Dawmet Aljandal City Al Jawf region, Saudi Arabia. This cluster is not linked to the cluster of MERS that was previously reported in Al Jawf in the Disease Outbreak News posted on [Thu 17 Aug 2017]. In this new cluster, the 6 cases are among 17 household contacts who were being followed up by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health.

Globally, 2079 laboratory-confirmed cases with MERS-CoV, including at least 722 related deaths have been reported to WHO.

Public health response
The source of infection of this cluster is under investigation by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has identified and is following up health care workers and household contacts of known MERS patients. As per Saudi Arabian policy, listed contacts are not allowed to attend Hajj.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[As per the above update, there have now been 2079 laboratory confirmed cases/infection with MERS-CoV reported to the WHO including at least 722 related deaths (reported case fatality rate: 34.7 percent).

Additional outcome information available for some of the above mentioned cases includes: case No.2 reported as a fatality on [Thu 31 Aug 2017], and cases Nos. 4, 6, 7 and 9 were reported as recoveries on 6 Sep 2017, 31 Aug 2017, 1 Sep 2017 and 1 Sep 2017 respectively.

The above report also confirms a 2nd cluster of cases in Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region) all associated with household contacts. It does appear that since Saudi Arabia changed its contact tracing/testing policy to include all individuals with known contact with a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection,, irrespective of clinical status/illness (including asymptomatic individuals) there have been more and larger clusters of cases identified. So, either the virus is changing and now producing more asymptomatic infections, or, there have always been many more asymptomatic infections that were missed because they did not meet the clinical criteria for testing. (seek and you shall find).
