2000/140 New ELISA test to distinguish between Markus and Dideron strains of
plum pox potyvirus
-------------------------------------
A new ELISA test which [distinguishes] between the Markus and Dideron
strains of plum pox potyvirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) has been tested in
France. This new test gave good results and [is especially useful for
routine surveys]. In 1999, 100 Prunus samples (apricot, cherry, plum and
peach) from Languedoc-Roussillon were tested by this method, and the
majority of peach samples were [shown to be] infected by [the] Markus
strain.

[Rapid distinction between the Markus (M) and Dideron (D) strains of PPV
will facilitate strain distinction. The M strain is more aggressive and
spreads more rapidly. Neither strain is seed-transmitted. A publication is
in press (Pasquini G., Simeone A.M., Conte L., Barba M., 2000. RT-PCR
evidence of the non-transmission through seed of Plum pox virus strains D
and M. Journal of Plant Pathology, 82). The paper will appear in the
November issue of the journal. Thanks to Giovanni Martelli for providing
information about the forthcoming publication. - Mod.DH]
