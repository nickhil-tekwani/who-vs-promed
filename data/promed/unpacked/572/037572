[There is clearly a major outbreak ongoing in Riyadh that appears to have started around 21 Jul 2015. Since 21 Jul 2015, there have been a total of 58 cases of MERS-CoV reported by Saudi Arabia of which 53 (91.4 percent) were from Riyadh. Since the beginning of August 2015, there have been a total of 48 cases reported in Saudi Arabia of which 45 cases (93.8 percent) were from Riyadh. I refer readers to section [2] below where the Saudi Press Agency report from the MOH discusses the ongoing outbreak in the King Abdul Aziz Medical City, involving exposures in the Emergency Department, other Outpatient Departments, and on the hospital wards, with overcrowding, including of outside visitors, and reduced isolation capabilities in these areas. It does appear as though the outbreak has been escalating, with the identification of 9 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours and the identification of 27 new cases in the past week.

Of note is that on 16 Aug 2014 there was a single case in a healthcare worker from Najran who denied history of contact with known cases of MERS-CoV in the 2 weeks prior to onset of illness. It is noteworthy because on 4 Aug 2015 there was another case in a healthcare worker from Najran who also denied a history of contact with known case of MERS-CoV in the 2 weeks prior to onset of illness. One wonders if there is ongoing transmission in Najran that is being missed. ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on the situation in Najran.

A map showing the locations of the newly reported cases can be found at the source URL above. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3584526,131. - Mod.MPP]

On [17 Aug 2015], the Preventive Medicine Management and Infection Control and Health Affairs at the Ministry of National Guard revealed the existence of 31 MERS-CoV infected individuals at the King Abdul Aziz Medical City in Riyadh, associated with patients who visited the Emergency Medicine departments in addition to 4 cases among healthcare practitioners during the period June 2015 through [14 Aug 2015].

The Executive Director of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Infection Control and Health Affairs at the Ministry of National Guard [Dr. Hanan?] and a Member of the National Scientific Committee of Infectious Diseases at the Ministry of Health and the National team member explained that there is an ongoing epidemiology and infectious diseases investigation. They have been monitoring the number of suspected cases during the past 48 hours, and, currently, all the clinical and laboratory tests needed to follow their health status [have been] conducted. [To date - 14 Aug 2015] there have been 12 fatalities [associated with this outbreak]. This type of respiratory virus is the most deadly to those who suffer from chronic diseases such as diabetes, stress and failure kidney.

Dr. Hanan reported that affected healthcare workers have not included fatalities, and the majority of them have been under home isolation.

[Dr. Hanan] said: "Because of the latest developments about the increasing number of cases of MERS-CoV infection, and due to the large daily congestion [24/7] in the emergency medicine departments of King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, and the difficulty of isolation [of patients] in these overcrowded sections, the National Guard has implemented strict measures to reduce the number of patients in the emergency departments and outpatient clinics as well as to stop the operations of non-emergency and urgent care. In addition, there have been 3 isolation wings in the hospital designated to accommodate suspected and confirmed cases [of MERS-CoV infection] [suspected and confirmed in separate or the same wings? - Mod.MPP] and the allocation of an intensive case unit to accommodate and isolate those cases in critical condition as well as reducing and limiting visiting hours and the number of visitors.

Dr. Hanan stressed that they emphasized that healthcare practitioners consistently adhered to infection control measures according to internationally established standards, policies and procedures recommended by the Command and Control Center [CCC] at the Ministry of Health, since they [healthcare workers] are the most vulnerable to infection as a result of contact with infected patients, indicating that the epidemiology plan will be evaluated on a daily basis and adjusted according to the need for new developments.

Dr. Hanan showed that it is recorded that infected cases of MERS-CoV came from various health sectors and were presenting on a daily basis to the Ministry of Health system, and there was communication with the Command and Control Center at the Ministry of Health continuously in order to activate the procedures to be followed at the national level to fight infection and reduce the spread of infectious diseases. [Dr. Hanan] confirmed that the Ministry of Health of the National Guard Affairs was dealing with the current situation with complete transparency and high professional norms in the ongoing cooperation between them and the Ministry of Health and the concerned authorities.

[Dr. Hanan] noted the importance of active cooperation by patients and clients and visitors to the civilian King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh by following the awareness tips that are distributed across publications and presented through visual aids in the majority of media channels and social networking sites on the avoidance of going to emergency departments, except in critical situations or injuries that require ambulatory procedures, in addition to the reduction of visits to [hospitalized] inpatients as much as possible, and a commitment to apply the correct ways to avoid the spread of droplets caused by coughing and sneezing, as well as being careful to wear a mask in case of colds or flu and not mixing in public places.

[Reading the above press release is a deja vu of the press releases surrounding the outbreak in South Korea; it appears as though there has been significant transmission of the MERS-CoV in the emergency departments [EDs], outpatient departments [OPDs] and among visitors to individuals originally admitted to the hospital for other reasons. So a question that arises is have they (the public health system) in Riyadh identified superspreaders in this ongoing outbreak, similar to those identified in the recent outbreak in South Korea, and given the recent experience in South Korea, are we now seeing more superspreaders than in earlier outbreaks in 2012, 2013 and 2014? Has the virus changed? Or has the virus been "lucky" in finding the perfect storm situations and taking advantage of them (overcrowding of healthcare institutions with prolonged exposure in EDs, OPDs, and crowded hospital wards with multiple patients in rooms and multiple visitors in quasi residence with their hospitalized family members)?

ProMED-mail would welcome information on the ongoing epidemiologic investigations in Riyadh from knowledgeable individuals in the area. - Mod.MPP]

MOH: "21 MERS-CoV Cases Reported Last Week" [16 Aug 2015]
-----------------------------
In its weekly press release, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that 20 confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported in Riyadh and another case in Abha last week, from [9-15 Aug 2015], corresponding to Shawwal 24th to 30th, 1436H (the 33rd International Week).

"During the same period, 844 samples were tested for coronavirus at the MOH laboratories across the Kingdom, including 5 cases at the MOH hospitals and 16 other cases at the other health sectors. The total number of visits by public health teams to persons in contact with positive cases was 21," the Ministry said, adding that the number of persons who were in contact with positive cases at homes was 119, and the number of visits by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) was one.

The Ministry also announced that 588 cases out of the total of 1092 confirmed cases have been cured, at a rate of 54.8 percent. There are 25 other cases still receiving treatment, and 4 cases have been isolated at home.

The Command and Control Center (CCC) keeps up its efforts around the clock by carrying out epidemiological surveillance tasks, making sure that all governmental and private health facilities abide by infection control measures, as well as coordinating with the relevant governmental sectors, international health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), and think-tanks to follow up on all developments regarding coronavirus. Over and above, the Ministry keeps up its efforts and full coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to launch anti-coronavirus awareness campaigns at gathering places of camels to urge camel owners and shepherds to be careful and take protective measures when dealing with camels. Finally, the MOH highlighted that it will remain committed to the preset preparations and cooperative efforts with other parties, including the Saudi community and healthcare staff, who represent the cornerstone in this regard.

[The above overview of the week's experience demonstrates the intensive screening effort that has gone on (844 specimens were tested for evidence of MERS-CoV infection, and 21 cases were confirmed during the 7-day period from 9-15 Aug 2015).

On an additional note, the situation in South Korea remains unchanged, with no new cases reported since 4 Jul 2015 and one individual still reported as not being MERS-CoV negative. (http://www.mw.go.kr/front_new/al/sal0301vw.jsp?PAR_MENU_ID=04&MENU_ID=0403&page=1&CONT_SEQ=324855). - Mod.MPP]
