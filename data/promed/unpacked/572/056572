It will be Joypurhat district instead of Gazipur.

[The ProMED-mail posting mentioned above included the following 1st paragraph:

"Some 531 chickens were culled at a poultry farm in Gazipur on Monday
[25 Jan 2010] in presence of the district livestock officer after it
was affected by bird flu virus H5N1."

Gazipur (the location indicated by the Dhaka-based media source) was
erroneous. The poultry farm where the outbreak was detected is located
in Joypurhat district.

Thanks to Dr Afzal Hossain for the correction. - Mod.AS]
