A variant of the fungus _Plenodomus biglobosus_ that causes blackleg on oilseed rape and other brassicas has been discovered in Europe for the first time in Southern England and Northern Ireland. The 'canadensis' variant was discovered on wasabi plants, marking also the first time the disease has been found on that vegetable. The variant 'brassicae' was also discovered infecting wasabi at a third site in the West Midlands. DNA analysis from infected plants confirmed the identification, said Rothamsted's Dr Kevin King. Infectivity tests showed that both variants can cause disease on wasabi as well as oilseed rape and some vegetable brassicas.

'Canadensis' has been reported from Australia, Canada, China, Mexico and the US. However, this is its first report for Europe and therefore extends its known geographic range. Previously, only 'brassicae' had been reported from Europe. Wasabi [_Eutrema_ species] is also a new global host record for both variants.

In recent years, there is evidence that _P. biglobosus_ has become an increasingly problematic pathogen of UK oilseed rape. Further work is needed to determine if this is as a result of the new 'canadensis' variant or due to recent varieties being more susceptible to blackleg in general. Surveys of _P. biglobosus_ variants in current pathogen populations on wild and cultivated brassicas in the UK and continental Europe are needed to determine the current distribution of variants in the region.

Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) of brassicas can be caused by two different fungi: _Leptosphaeria maculans_ inducing severe disease; or _Plenodomus biglobosus_ which has previously been reported in some areas in association with milder symptoms. Blackleg is the most serious disease of crops in the Brassicaceae family with a possible yield loss of 50% or more. The disease affects oilseed rape, turnip, radish, mustard, vegetable brassicas (including various cabbages), as well as brassicaceous weeds which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Depending on the host, symptoms may include lesions on leaves, stems and seed pods, with stem cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse of the plant. Root infections have also been reported (ProMED post 20010819.1959). Symptomless infections may occur.

The pathogens are seed borne; spores are also spread by wind, splash dispersal, mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment) and infected plant litter. They may overwinter in crop residues, which are therefore often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum, as well as fungicides. Cultivars with different levels of blackleg resistance are available for some of the crops. However, new strains of the pathogens evolve frequently and may be able to overcome host resistances or show new fungicide resistances. Pathogen adaptation may be counteracted by frequent changing of crop cultivars and/or mixing fungicides with different modes of action.
