The ministry of Health has confirmed a case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and warned of a possible outbreak in the eastern district of Jinja.

"A 32-year-old male, who passed on at Entebbe General Hospital in Wakiso, tested positive with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. He was buried in Jinja," said ministry of Health spokesperson Emmanuel Ainebyoona.

The deceased was a builder and was staying in Bendegere village, Kasenyi parish-Katabi sub county in Wakiso district. His body was transported by relatives from Entebbe hospital and buried in Butagaya, Nakakulwe village, in Jinja on [12 Apr 2019].

Jinja district chairman Titus Kisambira said that 11 suspected cases have been quarantined in their homes in Nakakulwe village, LC 1B. "We have quarantined 11 people who have shown signs and symptoms of the disease. Some are relatives of the man who died and others participated in his burial," said Kisambira.

The symptoms are sudden onset of fever, general body weakness, headache, severe pain in limbs, bloody diarrhoea, and bleeding from body openings.
