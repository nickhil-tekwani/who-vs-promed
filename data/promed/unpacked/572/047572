Many years ago when type E botulism was a first recognized as a serious
problem in common loons on Lake Michigan, I wondered how they were picking
up the toxin. The stomach contents of many of the loons I examined had
crayfish remains. It crossed my mind that perhaps crayfish feeding on dead
toxic fish on the bottom were concentrating the toxin with no harm to
themselves. I had always intended to look into the possibility, but never
got around to it. Botulism type E is a very strange organism. Some of the
wild strains I isolated produced protoxin almost exclusively and for all
practical purposes were nontoxic. However, when activated it was as hot as
any of the E strains being studied at the time and hotter than most.

_Clostridium botulinum_ Type E [source of botulinum toxin type E - Mod.JW
can be recovered from detritus and sediment in most coastal areas, and of
course crayfish feed on those materials. I can't cite any references off
the top of my head as to the role of crayfish in its transmission, but it
sure seems a plausible hypothesis.

I have not personally tested for type E toxin in crayfish, although I have
tested for and found type C toxin. Thus, I would suspect that crayfish could
easily ingest and in effect concentrate type E toxin in the Great Lakes.
Invertebrates are not affected by botulinum toxin.
