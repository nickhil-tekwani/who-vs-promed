China and Pakistan have announced bird flu outbreaks among poultry a
day after 2 women, one in China and one in neighbouring Viet Nam,
died of the virus.

China
*****
The Chinese outbreak, 1st noticed on 17 Feb 2008 in Zunyi in the
southwestern province of Guizhou, had killed nearly 4000 birds and
triggered the culling of more than 238 000, Xinhua news agency said
late on Monday [25 Feb 2008], citing the Ministry of Agriculture.

China has reported 4 outbreaks of the disease in poultry since
December [2007], when average temperatures across the country hit
their lowest in decades. Bird flu tends to be more active in the cold.

Experts fear the H5N1 strain could mutate or combine with the highly
contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic. With the
world's largest poultry population and hundreds of millions of farmers
raising birds in their backyards, China is seen as crucial in the
global fight against the disease.

China has struggled to combat the virus with mass inoculations for
birds [poultry] and an education campaign for those who handle them.

Pakistan
--------
Pakistani authorities found a fresh outbreak of H5N1 in chickens, the
4th case in a month, in the southern city of Karachi, a government
official said on Tuesday [26 Feb 2008].
