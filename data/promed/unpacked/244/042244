Federal officials have called on the public to be cautious following a
salmonella outbreak traced to a brand of headcheese [jellied meat].
Canada's public health agency said consumers should not eat Freybe
brand headcheese, produced by G. Brandt Meat Packers in Mississauga,
Ontario.

18 people have been reported sick after consuming the product in
Ontario and British Columbia. Most of the cases have affected people
over the age of 70. Two companies have recalled headcheese products,
although only the Freybe brand is linked to the illnesses.

[The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ in this outbreak of foodborne
disease is not stated in the report.

Head cheese (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_cheese>) or brawn is a
cold cut originating in Europe. Another version pickled with vinegar
is known as souse. Head cheese is not a cheese but a meat jelly made
with flesh from the head of a calf or pig (sometimes a sheep or cow)
in aspic. While the parts used can vary, the brain, eyes, and ears are
often removed. The tongue, and sometimes even the feet and heart may
be included. Head cheese may be flavored with onion, black pepper,
allspice, bay leaf, salt, and vinegar. It is usually eaten cold or at
room temperature as a luncheon meat.

Historically meat jellies were made of the cleaned (all organs
removed) head of the animal, which was simmered to produce stock, a
peasant food made since the Middle Ages. When cooled, the stock
congeals because of the natural gelatin found in the skull. The aspic
may need additional gelatin in order to set properly. - Mod.LL]
