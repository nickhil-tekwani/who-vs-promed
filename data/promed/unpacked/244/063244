The La Araucania Health SEREMI [ministerial administrative government unit], confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the region.

The affected individual is a 50-year-old man and resident of a rural area in Villarrica, who received medical attention on 15 Dec [2016] in that community with symptoms of that virus [infection].

From that locality, he was taken to the Hernan Henriquez Aravena Hospital [Temuco, Araucania], where he is being kept in the intensive care unit on mechanical respiration and is in stable condition.

Samples were taken and sent to the Public Health Institute where the diagnosis was confirmed, and [he] becomes the 7th case in the region so far this year [2016].

[As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the Araucania region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides little information about the circumstances under which the man acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
