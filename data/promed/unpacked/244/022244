Department of Health and Family Welfare of Shimoga confirmed the death of one person of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) in Konandur hobli of Tirthahalli taluk on 17 Jan [2012]. District Health and Family Welfare officer Dr Channabasappa told Express that of the 30 blood smears [whole blood or serum samples?] tested in December 2011 and January 2012, 6 samples confirmed KFD [virus or antibody?].

The person (age 65 years) died due to KFD [virus infection] and the remaining 5 cases were recovering.

The DHO said blood smear [samples] of 6 cases were tested in 2 different laboratories. 5 cases tested positive for KFD at Shimoga's Virus Diagnostic Laboratory and one case at National Institute of Virology, Pune. The death of the person was confirmed by the Shimoga lab. Cases of fever were reported in Chittinakoppa, Hirekallalli, Chickakallalli, Kadegodu and Agashinakoppa of Konandur hobli.

In the past 15 days, 9 persons have tested positive for Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), known as Monkey disease in Theerthahlli taluk in the a top district official said here today [10 Feb 2012].

Kyasanur Forest Disease is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to South Asia. The disease is caused by a virus belonging to the family flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever and dengue fever. "9 of the 89 samples sent to virus testing laboratory in Bangalore tested positive," Shimoga Zilla Parishad CEO Sanjay Bijjur told reporters after a review meeting with health officials here today. He said he has directed all medical staff to complete the inoculation of KFD vaccine to all villagers before 14 Feb [2012] in all 3 primary health divisions covering Konandur, Hombuja and Rippenpet in the taluks. Bijjur said there is sufficient quantity of vaccine and vehicles with paramedics, doctors and health staff are visiting all areas to provide immediate relief to people.

[The number of KFD cases has increased by 3 in 7 days. Apparently, the Shimoga district in Karnataka state is an endemic focus for KFD virus. There have been human cases there in 2011 and 2009. In the 28 Feb 2009 post on KFD in India (ProMED-mail archive number 20090302.0860), Mod.CP posted this excellent comment:

"Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_. KFDV was identified in 1957 when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur forest in Karnataka (formerly Mysore) state, India. The main hosts of KFDV are small rodents, but shrews, bats, and monkeys may also carry the virus. KFD is transmitted from the bite of an infected tick (_Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector). Humans can get this disease from a tick bite or by contact with an infected animal, such as a sick or recently dead monkey. Larger animals such as goats, cows, and sheep may become infected with KFD, but they do not have a role in the transmission of the disease. Furthermore, there is no evidence of the disease being transmitted via the unpasteurized milk of any of these animals. It occurs principally in the Shimoga and Kanara district of Karnataka, India and is common in young adults exposed during the dry season in the forest.

After an incubation period of 3-8 days, the symptoms of KFD begin suddenly with fever, headache, severe muscle pain, cough, dehydration, gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding problems. Patients may experience abnormally low blood pressure and low platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell counts. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms, some patients recover without complications. However, in most patients, the illness is biphasic, and the patient begins experiencing a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and signs of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). The diagnosis is made by virus isolation from blood or by serologic testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay. There are approximately 400-500 cases of KFD per year with a case fatality rate of 3-5 percent.

Some of this information has been extracted from the CDC fact sheet (see:
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf)."

KFD virus and its variants are found in a wider geographic area than just India. A variant of KFD virus, Alkhurma virus, was isolated in Saudi Arabia. The gene sequence of a Nanjianyin China virus isolate obtained from a febrile patient is highly homologous to that of KFD virus. ProMED-mail archive number 20090303.0871 cites Prof. Steve Berger saying, "... 22.4 percent of persons living in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were found to be seropositive for KFD in 2002," and that "there is a safe and effective inactivated vaccine available in India."
