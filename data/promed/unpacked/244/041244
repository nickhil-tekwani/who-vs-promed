Source of Cyclospora infection probably identified
-----------------------------------------------
Contaminated fresh basil is suspected as the most likely cause of an
outbreak of the parasitic illness cyclospora, which has sickened 300
Floridians, state health officials said on Friday [3 Jun 2005].
Officials don't know where the basil came from or where it is being sold,
said state Health Secretary John O. Agwunobi. "Doc" Kokol, a spokesman for
the Florida Health Department, said the federal Food and Drug
Administration has agreed to try to trace the product and find out where it
came from. "And they're going to do something called a traceback. With
their experts, they'll be able to trace this tainted or contaminated fresh
basil all the way back, hopefully to the fields, and they'll be able to
tell us where it came from," said Kokol.
The disease isn't fatal, but can cause severe diarrhea and other painful
symptoms. Cases have been reported in 32 Florida counties in all regions of
the state going back to April 2005.
Health officials say people should wash fresh produce to prevent food-borne
illnesses, but say that washing may not prevent cyclospora infection. "As
always, we're recommending to people that they wash their fruits and
vegetables, and, while it may not eliminate cyclospora infection, it's just
good common sense. Cyclospora is easily treated with antibiotics, and there
have been no deaths from cyclospora," said Kokol.
Cyclospora are microscopic, one-celled organisms that can contaminate fresh
produce and burrow in the small intestine. The illness can be treated with
antibiotics or could pass naturally within a period of a few days up to a
month.

[This is a classic route of infection, and, as pointed out in the article,
thorough washing of the herb is the only way to reduce risk of infection. -
