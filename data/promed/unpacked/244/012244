A record red tide is occurring right now off the south west coast of Florida, and the effects on marine life are horrifying.

A "red tide" is a sudden bloom of microscopic marine organisms, particularly certain phytoplankton and dinoflagellates that contain red or brown pigments. When such species reach sudden abundance, the water can appear any color from a pinkish-tan, to deep blood red. These species are often found near shore, and in places where fresh water flows off the land to make the level of salt slightly lower than in most sea water. Unfortunately, that water can also carry phosphorus and nitrates from fertilizers and other sources into the sea, spurring an explosive cycle of growth.

Because many red tides not only deplete the oxygen levels in surrounding water, they lead to the production of a whole series of toxins that kill fish and other marine life. Hot weather makes these blooms even stronger, which is why these events are not uncommon in the summer months. But what's happening off Florida is exceptional. There are actually multiple blooms of toxic organisms happening at the same time.

Indications are that a major source of nutrients for these toxic events is animal waste from large commercial farms in the area. When the Trump EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] shot down the "Waters of the United States" regulation, it dropped much of the regulation of this waste. Earlier this year [2018], then administrator Scott Pruitt cut back on rules requiring monitoring and treatment of agricultural waste water.

The combination of record heat and record waste results in record red tide -- and an unprecedented level of death on Florida beaches. Rather than going on for just a few summer weeks, this red tide has been going for 9 months ... and it's getting worse.

Florida governor Rick Scott declared a "state of emergency" because of red tide more than 3 weeks ago, but the situation continues to get worse. In some areas, shorelines are limned with dead fish, and glowing green masses of algae are moving sluggishly in red waves. It's not exactly the version of Florida that the state uses to attract tourist dollars.

[Red tide or harmful algal blooms (HABs) are events in which single-celled protists, dinoflagellates, proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities, because under certain circumstances these organisms can produce potent toxins. Normally these toxins enter the food web when they are consumed by filter feeding animals, such as clams, oysters, mussels, in which the toxin bioaccumulates.

_Karenia brevis_ is a marine dinoflagellate common in Gulf of Mexico waters, and is the organism responsible for Florida red tides. The toxin it produces is called brevetoxin, and can cause neurotoxic poisoning.
