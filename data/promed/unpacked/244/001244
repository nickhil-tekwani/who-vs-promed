Egypt asked the World Health Organization [WHO] to help investigate
an outbreak of bird flu after a dozen non-fatal cases of the disease
this year [2009] prompted speculation the virus may be becoming less
virulent. Two WHO doctors and a scientist will travel to Cairo later
this week at the request of Egypt's Ministry of Health, said Gregory
Hartl, a spokesman for the United Nations agency in Geneva, in an
interview today [13 Apr 2009]. The UN team will assist local
authorities to identify how the patients were infected with the H5N1
strain of avian influenza and whether there have been any significant
changes in disease patterns in the virus itself.

Scientists have been following H5N1 for more than a decade because of
concern it could spark a pandemic if it becomes as infectious for
humans as it is for poultry. A less lethal strain could be more
contagious because people would have longer to transmit it through
coughing and sneezing. None of the 12 Egyptian cases reported to the
WHO this year [2009] has been fatal.

These data do indeed suggest that there may have been a reduction in
the virulence of the outbreak strain, and there is a perceived risk
of progression of the virus to a less virulent but more transmissible
form, the International Society for Infectious Diseases said today
[13 Apr 2009] in an e-mail via its ProMED-mail program [see, "Avian
influenza, human (72): Egypt, virulence 20090412.1403"]. The survival
of H5N1 patients in Egypt also may reflect early treatment with
antiviral medicines, ProMED said.

At least 417 people in 15 countries have contracted the virus since
2003. Three of every 5 cases worldwide were fatal. Most cases were
caused by contact with infected poultry, such as children playing
with them or adults butchering them or plucking feathers, according
to WHO.

H5N1 is continuing to circulate in poultry in Egypt, though there is
no evidence so far of any significant changes in the virus, said
Joseph Domenech, chief veterinary officer with the Food and
Agriculture Organization [FAO]. The Rome-based UN agency has also
agreed to a request by Egypt's government to provide technical
assistance, Domenech said in an interview today [13 Apr 2009].

Egypt has the highest number of avian-flu cases outside Asia, with 63
cases reported to WHO since 2006, of which 23 were fatal. In
comparison, more than 80 percent of the 141 people reported to have
been infected in Indonesia died.

Roche Holding AG says its Tamiflu antiviral medicine can reduce the
severity and duration of flu symptoms if taken within 48 hours of the
onset of disease. Early treatment for H5N1 may improve survival, some
uncontrolled studies have shown.

[The participation of the FAO in the WHO-led investigation of the
current H5N1 epidemic situation in Egypt is a logical development. As
of today (13 Apr 2009), the 11 cases of avian H5N1 influenza virus
confirmed in 2009 (all children) remain alive. This is in marked
contrast to the period from 2006 to 2008 when 23 of 51 H5N1-confirmed
patients did not survive infection. This suggests that there may have
been a change in the virulence of the H5N1 virus circulating in Egypt
at the present time. While diminished virulence is clearly
advantageous for the Egyptian population, it is feared that reduction
in virulence may favor increased transmissibility of the virus, which
might have adverse consequences for the global population.

However, other factors such as the role of the age of the victims,
the absence of evidence of person-to-person transmission, and the
effectiveness of treatment protocols have still to be evaluated. An
update on the current situation is awaited. - Mod.CP]
