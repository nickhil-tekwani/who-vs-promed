The reports of a patient presenting with Lassa fever in New Jersey [USA] serve as a reminder that Lassa fever has historically been the most common viral haemorrhagic fever to be exported from West Africa until the current Ebola virus outbreak. Including the 5 previous cases imported to the USA up to 2004 [1], we identified 28 cases in the 4 decades 1969-2009 [2]. The majority of these came from Sierra Leone (14 cases) followed by Nigeria (11 cases), both countries known to have large numbers of cases on a regular basis. Some of these cases were evacuated from West Africa for further medical treatment and the overall mortality was 36 per cent (9/28), rather than the estimated 1 per cent in endemic areas cited in the nj.com and New York Times reports highlighted by ProMED-mail (archive no. 20150526.3386913).

None of the cases were associated with onward transmission to other patients or to fellow travellers, although delays in recognition and isolation of patients continue to occur for a variety of reasons, including failure of patients to report their travel history risks. Other causes of fever in travellers returning from West Africa are much more common, such as malaria, diarrhoeal disease and respiratory infections [3]. However, the recent case of Lassa fever in New Jersey emphasizes the need to consider other viral haemorrhagic fevers in travellers returning from endemic areas of the world and not to focus on Ebola virus disease alone.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Beeching for this overview of Lassa fever cases exported from West Africa. His comments underscore the importance of good travel histories. They are essential in order to initiate treatment as early in the course of disease as possible. Unfortunately, not all patients are forthcoming in providing that history, as in the most recent fatal case in the USA (New Jersey) (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150526.3386913). - Mod.TY]
