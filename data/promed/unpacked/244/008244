On 4 Sep [2007] an unknown woman brought an injured bat into the
Toronto Wildlife Centre and then disappeared [the woman, not the bat
- Mod.TY]. The bat later tested positive for rabies, and now Toronto
Public Health is asking for the public's help in locating the woman.
"We are asking the individual who recently took a bat to the Toronto
Wildlife Centre to contact Toronto Public Health immediately," said
Dr. Rosana Pellizzari, Associate Medical Officer of Health. "People
can become easily infected with rabies if they are scratched or
bitten by an infected bat, and this individual may need to be vaccinated."
The concern is that where there is one bat infected, there are almost
certainly many others, and many other animals also suffering from the
disease and posing a very real threat of spreading the illness to
humans. A rabies vaccination can prevent serious illness in the event
of a bite or scratch, but it must be administered soon after.
Without vaccination, rabies can be fatal, and individuals can also
become infected if a rabid animal's saliva comes in contact with open
cuts or with the mouth, nose or eyes, making bats particularly
dangerous since at this time of year human contact with bats
increases as they start to come indoors looking for places to
hibernate for the winter.
Toronto Public Health is advising that you never touch a bat with
bare hands. If someone has been bitten or scratched by a bat, or
suspects they have been, they should:
- Clean and wash the bite or scratch thoroughly with soap and water,
- Seek medical attention immediately, and report the incident to
[local public health authorities].
To prevent bats from coming indoors, seal holes in screens and any
other openings around your home. Bats can enter holes that are very
small. In Ontario, raccoons, foxes, skunks, coyotes and bats are
sources of the rabies virus. Cats and dogs can also be infected if
they are scratched or bitten by a rabid animal. Ensure your pets are
vaccinated against rabies.

[The important message for the public is underscored here -- do not
handle bats. The scratches that may occur may seem innocuous or bites
inconsequential, as the teeth on many North American bats are small
and the bite wound can go practically unnoticed. Rabies in bats is
widespread in North America. - Mod.TY]
