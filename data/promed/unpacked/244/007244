ANDEAN POTATO VIRUSES - RUSSIA: (MOSCOW REGION)

Potatoes of the Moscow Region appear to suffer from a dangerous virus
-- this fact may lead to quarantine and total export ban for this
vegetable. Russian sanitary inspectors found infection sites of
so-called "Andi" virus in Ramenskiy and Dmitrovskiy districts of the
Moscow Region. Currently inspectors are performing additional tests
of sample potatoes.

"Andi" virus was previously detected only in Latin America. If it
[adapts well in Russia, 30 percent of potato crops would be lost].
The virus lives only inside potato tubers, that is why other cultures
should be grown on a potato field 2-3 years after cropping. Seed
potatoes can spread the virus.

An infected potato plant can be visually distinguished from healthy
ones -- it is smaller and has a light or dark green colour with
mosaic patterns of leaves. This plant won't give any potatoes.

[The term "Andi" virus above is likely to refer to _Andean potato
mottle virus_ (APMoV; genus _Comovirus_) or/and _Andean potato latent
virus_ (APLV; genus _Tymovirus_). Both viruses are known to occur in
South America on domesticated potato and related wild _Solanum_
species. Other species of _Solanaceae_ (including tomato and tobacco)
have also been mechanically infected in experiments.

Symptoms of APMoV include mild to severe leaf mottle and some leaf
malformation. For APLV, infection may be symptomless in many potato
cultivars, but mild to severe mottle, top necrosis, leaf deformation,
and/or stunting may occur in sensitive cultivars. Co-infection of
both viruses has also been reported leading to a synergistic increase
of symptom severity.

Both viruses are transmitted by mechanical means, grafting,
plant-to-plant contact, and seed tubers. For APMoV, insect vectors
and seed transmission are not known, while APLV is transmitted by
beetles (_Epitrix_ species) and seed (at less than 1 percent in
potato). APMoV has been included on the quarantine lists of the
European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

In the situation above, the most likely source of the viruses would
be imported infected seed tubers, or perhaps tissue culture lines as
reported earlier from Russia for _Potato spindle tuber viroid_
(ProMED-mail post 20070423.1323). This appears to be the 1st report
of APMoV or/and APLV from a region outside their area of origin.
However, clarification of the diagnosis is required.
