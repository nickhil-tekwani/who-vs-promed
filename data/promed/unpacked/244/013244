_Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ on apricot and plum in
Switzerland. BSPP New Disease Reports 2009/2010 (Sept-Jan), 20]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
_Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ (Xap), cause of stone fruit
bacterial spot on many _Prunus_ species, is a European and
Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) A2-list quarantine
pathogen. It can cause significant yield loss and tree death. In
Europe, Xap occurs in France, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine,
but appears to be spreading due to changes in trade patterns,
climate, host range, and/or pathogen genotype. This is the 1st report
of Xap in Switzerland, occurring with very limited distribution.

Xap was first detected on apricot trees and fruit (_Prunus
armeniaca_) showing symptoms in 2005 in 4 orchards located in canton
Valais, the primary Swiss production region. It was detected in 2009
on Japanese apricot (_Prunus mume_) inter-cropped with apricot in 2
of these orchards. Isolation from symptomatic fruit, leaf, and canker
samples confirmed Xap based on colony morphology, quinate metabolism,
serology, gene sequencing, and pathogenicity bioassays with detached
peach leaves. Direct detection in symptomatic fruit, leaves, and
cankers was achieved in 100 percent of samples by Xap-specific PCR
[polymerase chain reaction], and in 40 percent using _X.
fragariae_/_arboricola_ primers. These primer sets gave 100 percent
and 93 percent agreement, respectively, with standard identification
methods for Xap isolates. All Swiss isolates were copper sensitive.

During intensive surveys between 2006 and 2009 throughout the region
where Xap was first detected (208 ha/514 acres), no incidence has
been observed outside the 4 originally infected orchards. This
suggests probable introduction via planting material rather than
fruit or aerosols. In 3 of these orchards, Xap is considered
eradicated, with all symptomatic trees removed in the 4th. Xap is
considered present with limited distribution but not eradicated.

[ref: Yuan Fang et al (2009): Bacterial fruit rot of apricot caused
by _Burkholderia cepacia_ in China. Plant Pathol J 25, 429-432]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An unreported disease of apricot was observed in orchards in Zhejiang
province, China. Symptoms started as water soaked lesions on the
fruit surface. Later, water-soaked areas developed and spread to the
entire fruit, resulting in soft rot of the whole fruit.

The causal organism isolated from symptomatic fruits was identified
as _Burkholderia cepacia_ based on its biochemical and physiological
characteristics and confirmed by the cellular fatty acid composition
and Biolog data as well as 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.

The bacterial isolates caused similar symptoms when inoculated onto
fruits of apricot. In addition, European plum, Japanese plum,
nectarine, and kiwifruit were susceptible to the _B. cepacia_
pathogen. However, the _B. cepacia_ pathogen failed to cause any
visible symptoms when it was inoculated onto 16 other fruits.

This is the 1st report of a bacterial disease of apricot caused by
_B. cepacia_ in China.

[Bacterial spot caused by _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ is a
serious disease of peach, nectarine, apricot, almond, and plum.
Symptoms include dark spots or watery lesions on fruits and leaves,
premature leaf drop, cankers, and tip necrosis on young twigs. The
disease can severely reduce tree vigour by defoliation, and it
reduces yield and quality of harvested fruit. Infection occurs via
leaf scars in autumn, and bacteria start to multiply when conditions
become favourable. Bacterial exudate from cankers and lesions is
spread by mechanical means (including insect activity) and water.
Disease management includes agrochemicals (for example copper or
antibiotic sprays), reduction of available inoculum by orchard
sanitation, and use of crop cultivars with resistance, or at least
reduced susceptibility, to the disease.

The _Burkholderia cepacia_ complex consists of at least 9 separate
species called genomovars. It includes plant pathogens (for example
the bacterium causing sour rot of onion), biocontrol agents effective
against plant diseases caused by some fungi, organisms suitable for
use in bioremediation, saprophytes, as well as animal and human
pathogens. The bacteria are naturally abundant in the environment,
for example in soil, water and on plant surfaces. An
interdisciplinary working group to investigate all aspects of the _B.
cepacia_ complex, including agricultural uses and medical risks, has
been established (see link below).
