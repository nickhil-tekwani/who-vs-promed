Herewith more information on the anthrax situation [1999].
We have had two outbreaks so far this year. The first mini
outbreak was at Pafuri (right in the north of the Park)
between February and May. Carcasses of eleven impala
and one zebra were found. Valerius de Voss went there 2
weeks ago and collected bone samples, as well as the usual
soil samples from fixed points in Hapi Pan that we analyze
every year.
As far as the current outbreak is concerned, it started at the
beginning of June [1999] and species affected so far include:
kudu, wildebeest, zebra, impala, giraffe, buffalo, steenbok (1),
elephant (1), lion (1), cheetah (1) and white rhino (1).
The area is the same one that the 1993 outbreak took place --
mainly in the Orpen and Satara areas west of the main tourist
road to the north, so it is going to be very interesting to compare
the two outbreaks.
I just quickly compared the findings and it seems that the spread
of the outbreak is taking place in much the same way as the 1993
outbreak, which started in September and ended in November.
The number of animals that died is very different between the
two outbreaks. During the last [1993] outbreak 145 carcasses
were found in the first month, compared to the less than 20 in
this outbreak.
My theory is that the period 1993 to 1999 was too short for
the kudu population to have built up sufficiently to sustain a
major outbreak. I have not looked at the actual buffalo numbers
in the area, but not many of them have died so far.
If the outbreak spreads beyond the area where the 1993
outbreak took place, the picture may become totally different,
because there are some areas to the south where the kudu
population may be significantly higher (You know that kudu are
the maintenance hosts of the disease in Kruger). This is,
however, pure speculation on my part.
