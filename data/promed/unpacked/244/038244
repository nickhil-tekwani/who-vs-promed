A total of 12 serologically confirmed cases of dengue have now been
reported from Fiji for the period 1/7/97 to 23/12/97. (Information from Dr
Joe Koroivueta, Wellcome Virus Lab, Suva).
In summary,
- in July there were 2 cases from the area around Suva (Central)
- in August there was one case from Lautoka (Western)
- in September there was another case from Lautoka linked to the above case
(both worked in the same hospital)
- in October there were 2 cases from Lakeba (Eastern)
- in November there were 5 cases; 3 from Lautoka and 2 admitted to CWM
hospital in Suva (Central).
- to date in December there has been only one confirmed case; that is in
Lautoka.
That is a total of 6 cases from Lautoka (Western Division), 4 from Central
Division and 2 from Lakeba in Eastern Division.
The earlier cases were detected by screening serum samples collected in
September and October from people with flu-like illness from various sites
around Fiji. They were screened for influenza virus as well as dengue
antibodies. Of 100 specimens, 5 tested positive for dengue. Some of the
sera were sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and
Research, Queensland Health, Brisbane, for confirmatory testing. One
further positive specimen was found, making 6 specimens that tested
positive in at least one of the labs. (One specimen that tested positive
in Fiji was negative on re testing in Brisbane). These people were from 3
widely spread sites; 2 hospital staff from Lautoka (in the West), 2 from a
suburb of Suva and 2 from Lakeba in the East of Fiji. There have been no
deaths.
One of the specimens has been typed as DEN-2. Further serotyping studies
are in progress.
These cases triggered further surveillance for dengue. The Wellcome Virus
lab in cooperation with the National Health Information Unit has set up an
active surveillance system for dengue. Because there are concurrent
outbreaks of measles and influenza A, they have decided to establish a
fever investigation system. Physicians from sentinel sites have been
requested to collect sera and complete a fever investigation for anyone
with an acute fever of unknown origin, as well as anyone with clinically
suspected dengue, measles or influenza. The sera are being tested for all
three pathogens, while the data form the forms are being collated onto an
EpiInfo database. This was initiated in Western division, and will be
expanded to all other divisions.
To date, 300+ people with a history of fever from the areas of Lautoka,
Nadi, Valelevu, Raiwaqa and Lakeba have been screened. Sera from two
children from Ciacia Lau (in Eastern Division) with clinically suspected
dengue (fever, rash and nose bleeding) were negative for dengue and
positive for measles. The additional 6 cases listed above have been picked
up through fever surveillance.
A 1992 review of the dengue situation in Fiji (Andre) noted that clinical
cases of dengue were reported each year except one between 1980 to 1992.
However, most of these were not laboratory confirmed. It is impossible to
determine whether these historical cases were dengue, but the data suggest
that that dengue is endemic. The recent serological confirmation of 12
cases from 3 different parts of the country is possibly a reflection of
improved screening for dengue virus, rather than an increase in virus
transmission. The apparent absence of an explosive epidemic supports the
premise that there is a low level of endemicity in Fiji.
However, due to the arrival of the 1997-98 wet season, vector control
measures and continuing laboratory and clinical surveillance are a high
priority, to detect and control possible epidemics. Control measures have
already commenced in Fiji. Field visits to Lakeba and Lautoka have been
completed, and surveillance is continuing.
