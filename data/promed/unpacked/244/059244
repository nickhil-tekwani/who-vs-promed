Ulaanbaatar threatened by foot and mouth disease
------------------------------------------------
Since 1300h on Sun 23 Apr 2006, the area surrounding the Zaisan Hill in the
south of Ulaanbaatar has been quarantined. A cow belonging to the
Agricultural University died from symptoms resembling those of foot and
mouth disease [FMD]. At that time, there were 94 people in the university.
The State Veterinary Hygiene Center got a specimen from the dead cow and
determined that it was the "O" type of FMD. The Agricultural University
has, in total, 25 cattle, and the City Emergency Commission decided to cull
all of them immediately.
In the Zaisan Valley, there are 24 households with a total of 439 cattle.
There are a total of 10 pregnant women in the area that receive special
medical examination [see comment]. The Emergency commission decided to
release those people who don't live in the Valley. [A map of Mongolia can

Mongolian suburb under quarantine after foot and mouth found
------------------------------------------------------------
A suburb on the outskirts of the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar has been
quarantined after health officials confirmed that a sick cow died of foot
and mouth disease [FMD].
The Mongolian General Authority for Emergency Management said Sunday [23
Apr 2006] that the cow in Zaisan died on 22 Apr 2006 of foot and mouth
disease. Some 430 livestock and 98 people [see comment] in the area have
been put under quarantine, the agency said on national television. No other
details were given.
FMD affects cows, sheep, goats and other cloven-footed animals, causing
blisters on the mouth and feet. It isn't usually fatal, but authorities
usually slaughter animals to stop its spread, because outbreaks often
prompt governments to ban meat imports from the affected country.
While Mongolia doesn't export meat, the disease can have a big impact on
the impoverished former Soviet satellite, where many people are traditional
nomadic herders of cattle and sheep.

[While FMD may cause considerable mortality, mainly in young animals, its
economic impact might also be very significant due to its rapid spread, its
impact upon the productivity of farm animals (mainly ruminants and swine),
its debilitating effect, and extended convalescence period. It is likely
that additional cases will be seen among the quarantined in-contact
animals; a single case in an adult (vaccinated?) animal is unusual.
FMD is not regarded as a zoonotic disease; the movement restrictions on
people mentioned above have most probably been applied by the Mongolian
authorities to prevent the possible mechanical spread of the virus. It is
not clear why pregnant women are being examined in relation to FMD, perhaps
because of an extremely precautionary attitude?!
The previous FMD outbreak in Mongolia, in August 2005, was caused by FMD
virus serotype Asia 1, probably of Chinese origin. An official lab
confirmation of the current causative agent, followed by a notification of
the outbreak to the OIE, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
