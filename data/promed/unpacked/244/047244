Epidemiology and Cause of SARS in Guangdong, Nov 2002 to Feb 2003
--------------------------------------------
[The results of an investigation of the epidemiology and cause of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong, People's Republic of China
have been published by research workers based at several institutions in
Guangzhou, Guangdong province, and at the University of Hong Kong, University
Pathology Building, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR. (full
reference below). This publication includes a map of the geographical
distribution of SARS cases in Guangdong province from Nov 2002 to Feb 2003.
The full text is accessible online. The discussion section, which provides a
balanced summary of the results of this investigation, is reproduced below. -
Mod.CP]
Virological surveillance in Guangdong Province in mid-February, 2003, showed
that the outbreak of a disease fitting the WHO case definition of SARS
started in mid-November, 2002. Epidemiological investigations suggest that
SARS probably first emerged in satellite cities of Guangzhou, circulating for
at least 2 months before causing a major outbreak in Guangzhou itself.
Serological tests and virus isolation confirmed that SARS CoV was the primary
infectious agent of these early cases of SARS. Genetic analysis of these SARS
CoV isolates showed that they belonged to two different subgroups, one
closely related to that noted in Hong Kong and other countries, and one that
seemingly had not spread to people in other regions. Phylogenetic analysis
also suggests that all SARS CoV share the same origin and most probably first
originated in Guangdong, southern China.
In this report, our investigation covered 55 patients with SARS from
Guangzhou and its neighbouring cities in the early phase of the SARS
outbreak. The findings of our study show that most of the patients had
serological evidence of infection with the novel SARS CoV, while healthy
controls did not. Information generated here suggests that SARS CoV was also
the primary infectious agent in the outbreaks in Guangdong Province. Because
most people who had SARS in other countries were directly or indirectly
linked to Hong Kong or Guangdong Province, we believe that the coronavirus
might have originated from this region. Thus, SARS, a new emerging infectious
disease that has become the first pandemic of the 21st century, probably
originated in Guangdong.
Our epidemiological findings suggest that SARS had been spreading in an
unusual pattern. The pandemic began with just a few index cases clustered
mainly in families and hospital health-care workers in cities around
Guangzhou. That specific antibodies were not present in any serum samples
from healthy controls suggests that this coronavirus has not previously been
present in human beings in Guangzhou.
Our analyses of genome function segments excludes the possibility that SARS
CoV was generated by a recombination between human and animal -- or animal
and animal -- coronavirus. SARS virus might be zoonotic and could have been
introduced to humans by inter-species transmission quite recently. Since SARS
CoV had very low homologies with all known coronaviruses, our postulation is
that the new virus might have originally been resident in animals that have
infrequent contact with humans, rather than in domestic animals.
The strains GZ43 and GZ60 from 2 health-care workers affected within the same
hospital seem phylogenetically similar; whereas GZ50, which is an independent
case from the community, is a distinct lineage. This finding suggests that
there were multiple lineages of viruses circulating in Guangdong. One of
these lineages (GZ50) maintains an outgroup relation to the major cluster of
cases in Hong Kong and could represent the precursor virus of the Hong Kong
outbreak. Whether some lineages are more transmissible than others is not
clear. An analysis of more strains from Guangdong is needed to address this
issue.
The spread of SARS CoV in Foshan and Zhongshan in November and December,
2002, did not lead to an outbreak of the same scale as that in Guangzhou in
January and February, 2003. Foshan and Zhongshan, like Guandong, are large
urban conurbations of more than 1 million people. One possibility is that the
virus was adapting to human beings -- i.e. human transmission with time.
However, spread of the disease might have been promoted by the movement of
people during the Chinese New Year holiday season that, in 2003, occurred at
the end of January. Furthermore, Guangzhou, being a premier medical centre,
received transfers of several patients with respiratory complications
associated with SARS.
Viruses that undergo inter-species transmission tend to undergo more rapid
genetic change as they adapt to a new host. In fact, we noted that the
genetic variation in the S gene was associated with mutations that were
mainly non-synonymous. The SCoV isolated in our study are some of the
earliest isolates in the global outbreak. Further genetic analysis of these
isolates might enable us to understand the origins of this virus and how it
became established in human beings.
The index case of the Guangzhou outbreak actually functioned as the trigger
for the pandemic that generated a large number of secondary infections.
Retrospective analysis of the pathway of the SARS spread from satellite
cities to Guangzhou, then Hong Kong and other countries, showed that the
major outbreak around the world could be linked to just a small number of so-
called super-spreading incidents. This finding implies that effective human-
to-human transmission is firmly established and suggests that SARS CoV has
become well-adapted to human beings.
One important question that has arisen from the SARS outbreak is why the new
coronavirus emerged in Guangdong, southern China. There might be a link to
the culinary habits of some southern Chinese, who consume wild game meat as a
delicacy. To satisfy this demand, different kinds of wild animals have been
hunted for consumption, or raised in captivity. These animals are a likely
source of new emergent infectious disease to human beings. In fact, the
emergence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in humans in 1997 and
in early 2003 (unpublished data) is also zoonotic. The SARS outbreak provides
evidence to support the hypothesis that southern China could be a site for
emerging pandemic infectious disease in the future.
The investigation of the infectious agent in SARS emphasises the importance
of international collaboration as an effective strategy to control emerging
diseases in people, especially for those diseases with the potential to
become pandemic. The lesson from SARS outbreaks associated with coronavirus
is that we cannot ignore or underestimate the effect of a new emerging
infectious disease. The best way to control a new emerging infection is to
intervene at an early stage in the outbreak.

as a zoonotic infection in southern China, do not yet provide direct proof
that the SARS outbreak originated as the result of recent transmission of an
animal virus into the human population. - Mod.CP]
