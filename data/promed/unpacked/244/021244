The Health Department continues to identify mumps cases in Brooklyn's
Jewish communities and is encouraging young adults -- especially
males -- in the community to get vaccinated unless they know they
have been fully vaccinated in the past. As the Health Department
noted in a December 2009 medical alert, young men in Williamsburg,
Crown Heights and Borough Park have experienced high levels of mumps
for several months. As of 8 Feb 2010, the agency had confirmed 909
cases and was investigating an additional 344. Most cases have
occurred in males, and an increasing number of cases have been in
young adults, ages 18 to 30. Complications from mumps can include
viral meningitis, hearing loss and reproductive problems for men.

"Vaccination against mumps is important for your health, your
family's health, and your community's health," said Dr. Jane R.
Zucker, the Health Department's assistant commissioner for
immunization. "Mumps can lead to serious complications in people who
are not vaccinated, especially adults. If you have not been
vaccinated against mumps, or do not remember if you have received the
protective vaccine, get vaccinated."

Children should receive a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine on or
after their 1st birthday, followed by a 2nd dose at 4 to 6 years of
age. Families that lack regular doctors can call 311 for information
on where children can get vaccinated. People 10 or older who have no
record of past vaccination can get the vaccine on 17 and 18 Feb 2010
at the locations listed below. Each site will have separate entrances
for women and men and will have separate staff members to vaccinate
them. The staff will be culturally sensitive and respectful.

Mumps spreads by respiratory droplets through infected saliva that
can be released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms
include fever, body aches, headaches, and swelling of the salivary
glands. The gland just below the ear is most often affected.

Among males, mumps can lead to orchitis, a testicular inflammation
that causes pain, swelling, nausea, vomiting and fever. Among some
women with mumps, inflammation of the ovaries or breasts can occur.
Up to 15 percent of people with mumps may suffer headaches and stiff necks.

If you become infected with mumps:
- Stay at home for 5 days after symptoms begin.
- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
- Wash your hands frequently with soap and water.

To protect yourself and your family from mumps:
- Mumps vaccine is given on or after a child's 1st birthday. It is
combined with measles and rubella vaccines in a formulation known as
MMR (measles-mumps-rubella).
- A 2nd dose of MMR vaccine is recommended before children enter
school at 4 to 6 years of age.
- Anyone who has received 2 doses of MMR vaccine is much less likely
to develop mumps. But many adults do not remember their vaccination
history and do not have records of it. Adults who are unsure of their
vaccination history should get vaccinated.

[This outbreak, now with more than 900 confirmed cases, started as an
infection imported from England into a summer camp for Orthodox
Jewish boys in New York State. Since then, it has escalated into a
major outbreak of mumps affecting parts of the Jewish community of
New York City. It is to be hoped that there will be a good response
to the call for vaccination reproduced above.
