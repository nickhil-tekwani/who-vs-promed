[There is no mention of the type of bird involved, although this
report contains information on the confirmation by Weybridge of H5N1
from geese involved in an outbreak a couple of weeks ago . This area
of Hungary -- as mentioned in the references -- exports goose liver
and contains significant duck farming (see Mod.AS comments in Avian
influenza (134) - Hungary 20060610.1616) A WHO map, showing the
region in southern Hungary where wild birds were affected, is accessible at
