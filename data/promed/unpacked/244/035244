The Ministere des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune [Ministry of
Natural Resources and Wildlife] (MRNF) has recently detected the
presence of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in certain bat populations in
Quebec. This infection, although potentially fatal for bats, does not
pose a threat to humans, since to date no human infection connected
to the syndrome has been reported.

WNS has been formally identified in the Outaouais region, but reports
of abnormal behaviour by suspect bats have also been made in the
Abitibi Temiscamingue region in recent weeks. The MRNF is monitoring
the situation with assistance from the Centre quebecois sur la sante
des animaux sauvages and the USGS National Wildlife Health Center.

As indicated by its name, white-nose syndrome is characterized by the
presence of a ring of fungal growth around the muzzles and on the
wings of infected animals. The syndrome can also change bat
behaviour; for example, flying in the daytime in early spring can be
a sign of the syndrome.

Since 2007, a high bat mortality rate in several mines and caves in
the northeastern United States has been attributed to the syndrome,
and the disease appears to be spreading at an alarming rate. The
syndrome was confirmed in Ontario in March 2010.

Bat mortality caused by WNS has become an international issue in the
fight to conserve cave-dwelling bat populations. One example of the
extent of the problem is the fact that over one million bats have
died as a result of the syndrome since its discovery in the northeastern US.

Bats play a key role in the ecosystem and consume large quantities of
insects that could otherwise harm humans or crops. It is important to
note, in this International Year of Biodiversity, that certain
species of bat, including the eastern pipistrelle (_Perimyotis
subflavus_) and the eastern small-footed bat (_Myotis leibii_) are
already likely to be designated as threatened or vulnerable in Quebec
and are, therefore, under a particular threat from the syndrome.

Although WNS is not considered a threat to the human population, it
is important to avoid touching bats, since some may carry the rabies
virus, a fatal disease for humans.

Recommendations:
Because the fungus associated with the syndrome may be carried from a
contaminated site to a healthy site on boots, clothing and other
items, the MRNF recommends that suitable decontamination measures be
applied between visits to caves or former mines as follows:

Wear rubber boots that can be easily cleaned, rather than shoes or sneakers.

Before leaving a cave: remove all mud and debris from boots, clothing
and equipment and place them in a sealed plastic bag for later disinfection.

After leaving a cave: wash exposed skin (especially hands) with an
anti-bacterial disinfectant.

At home: wash clothing with detergent using the hottest water cycle.
If possible, soak clothing in bleach before washing.

Waterproof equipment: clean with soapy water to remove dirt, then
disinfect by immersing in bleach.

Non-waterproof equipment: clean with a soapy cloth and then disinfect
with bleach.

Ropes and harnesses: this type of equipment should only be used in a
single cave, or ideally not at all. The equipment must be
decontaminated, but it is important to note that the repeated use of
disinfectants may reduce its safety.

Reporting of suspect cases:

If you observe suspect animals, for example bats that are dead or
flying in daylight in early spring, report them to the MRNF by
calling 1 866 248 6936 (1 866 CITOYEN). Report all other unusual
sightings, such as bats with white markings in a cave.

Never attempt to capture a bat to avoid all risk of rabies. If you
come into contact with a bat, call Info-Sante immediately by dialing 811.

[White nose syndrome continues its seeming relentless march to every
untouched bat haven there seems to be. It is now in the Canadian
provinces of Quebec and Ontario.

While in the USA, the march of this syndrome is decidedly westward,
it was discovered in Ontario prior to the discovery in Quebec.
Regardless of location, this syndrome is being watched for with
anxiety. - Mod.TG]
