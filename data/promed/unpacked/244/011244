Good point, and as you point out the test has to be reliable enough and the animal has to NOT have another coronavirus. During early SARS (SARS-1) research there were a few research projects with conclusions that pretty much had to be tossed out because they were using way too general coronavirus tests on cats and ferrets without knowing about either FIP [feline infectious peritonitis] or ECE [epizootic catarrhal enteritis] (coronaviruses specific to those genera) even though they were clearly describing the well documented signs of those 2 illnesses in their write-ups.

Regarding this comment from the moderator about lack of awareness for coronavirus tests for dogs distinguishing between these [coronaviruses], it should be pointed out IDEXX Reference Laboratories, a preeminent North American commercial animal diagnostic testing provider, currently provides a PCR test specifically for SARS-Cov-2 testing of veterinary patients meant to be used when indicated after consultation with a public health authority. In addition, they have previously developed a separate PCR test for canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV). Regarding cross-reactivity, the vendor provides this information:

IDEXX Reference Laboratories has developed a real-time PCR test to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on the published genetic sequences of the virus from the human outbreak. The IDEXX SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) RealPCR Test targets the same nucleocapsid gene as the CDC assay but has been adapted with a unique alignment for use in animals. It has been carefully designed to avoid cross-reactivity with other veterinary-specific coronaviruses. Specificity studies confirm there is no cross-reactivity with the new PCR test against common veterinary coronaviruses affecting companion animals. Likewise, currently available RealPCR tests for these veterinary coronaviruses were demonstrated to not detect the SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid.
