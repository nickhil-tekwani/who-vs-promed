[The simultaneous infection on 2 of the geese farms with HPAI H5N2 and H5N3 is noteworthy. The report includes an interactive map showing the locations of the 3 new outbreaks. The total accumulated number of H5N3 outbreaks, as of 28 Jan 2015, is 20.

In addition to the above follow-up report on the epizootic caused by HPAI H5N3, Taiwan has submitted on 28 Jan 2015 2 other follow-up reports informing the massive spread of other 2 HPAI strains, namely H5N8 and Novel H5N2, as follows:

The total accumulated number of H5N8 outbreaks is, as of 28 Jan 2015, 180; see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16935.

The total accumulated number of novel H5N2 outbreaks is, as of 28 Jan 2015, 224; see, with map, at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=17043.

The 4th strain recently recorded in Taiwan is the reoccurring HPAI H5N2 strain. One outbreak was reported on 12 Jan 2015 (see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=16923). - Mod.AS]

Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Israel: follow-up report No 1, submitted 25 Jan 2015
---------------------------------------
Epidemiological commentary:
The epidemiological investigation is ongoing. The 1st time H5N1 occurred in Israel was in March 2006 revealing 9 outbreaks. Since then, all the outbreaks that occurred in commercial flocks were also in March (2011, 2012) except one outbreak that took place in January 2010, in the same region of the Aviel's outbreak (distance of 10 km). The disease had been also diagnosed in a kindergarden's minizoo at the end of December 2007, 3 km from the Aviel's outbreak. This area has numerous water ponds with water birds wintering in them. Backyard birds in the village have also been culled. A few days later, 2 additional outbreaks have been diagnosed in the same region as described in the report. The culling of the flocks has been terminated."

[The Israel report confirms the information included in posting 20150124.3116798, namely 2 new HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, one affecting 10-week turkeys in Magal (farm owned by the same company as the 1st outbreak in Aviel), and the other in a breeding farm in Benyamina-Givat-Ada, affecting "36-week broiler grand parents which are divided in 2 adjacent pens." This brings the total number of outbreaks in Israel to 3.

Israel's ministry of agriculture has issued several updates, the most recent one dated 26 Jan 2015, informing of the absence of new outbreaks on top of the 3 reported ones. All culling and disinfection activities were accomplished, quarantine measures applied within 10-km around the outbreaks.

On 24 Jan 2015, the Palestinian authority submitted its follow-up report No 1, similarly confirming the media-derived information included in posting 20150124.3116798, notifying a 2nd outbreak of HPAI H5 on a layer hens farm in the Qalqelia district. The 1st outbreak affected turkeys in the Jenin district. The Palestinian follow-up report, with map, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=17035.

The H5 causative agent in the Palestinian territory is most likely similar to the H5N1 one in Israel; official confirmation of its serotyping is anticipated. - Mod.AS
