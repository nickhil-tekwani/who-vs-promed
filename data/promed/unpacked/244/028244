[1] Dengue dynamics, South Pacific

[This report summarizes a report by VM Cao-Lormeau published in Emerging Infectious Diseases 2014; 20(6): 1034-6]

The 2013 reappearance of the dengue virus type 3 in the South Pacific islands suggests that birth and immigration rates in this region may promote the recurrence of epidemics every 4-5 years, according to recent findings.

In the study, researchers investigated an outbreak of the dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) at the National Referral Hospital in Honiara, Solomon Islands, in January 2013, after an 18-year absence. By July 2013, more than 6000 suspected cases and 7 deaths were reported.

After screening serum samples from 3141 patients for DENV nonstructural protein (NS1) and immunoglobulin M against DENV, the researchers found that 1220 (39 per cent) of the samples tested positive. Reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed NS1 positivity in 10 additional samples.

In March 2013, DENV-3 also was reported in French Polynesia in 2 family members. One of these family members had recently traveled to Cayenne, French Guiana, and returned with a fever. By July 2013, French Polynesia had 1326 suspected cases of dengue, of which 258 were confirmed by lab testing. Serotype testing identified 170 DENV-1 infections, 73 DENV-3 infections and one case of coinfection with both serotypes.

A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Solomon Islands outbreak was the result of the introduction of a strain from Indonesia. This strain might have been circulating in Papua, New Guinea, for 4-5 years and went unidentified. Prior reappearance of DENV-4 into the Pacific Islands may have originated with the introduction of a strain from India into the Solomon Islands.

Conversely, the researchers found that based on epidemiologic and phylogenetic evidence, the outbreak of DENV-3 infection in French Polynesia was due to a strain carried from South America. Before 1990, most outbreaks of DENV in the South Pacific were transmitted from Latin America. However, the current study determined that since that time, Southeast Asia is the main source of outbreaks.

According to the researchers, births and immigration rates (1.2 per cent and 1.1 per cent, respectively in French Polynesia in 2010) in these regions offered enough susceptible hosts to generate a DENV epidemic every 4-5 years and for one of the DENV serotypes to re-emerge every 12-15 years.

"Moreover, the finding that recent DENV-3 outbreaks were caused by multiple genotypes supports observations made during outbreaks of DENV-1 infection in 2001-2004," the researchers wrote. "These observations also suggest that the principal determinant of DENV reemergence in the South Pacific Islands is herd immunity, rather than the genotype of DENV being introduced."

[This report illustrates the dynamic situation related to dengue virus susceptibility in the Pacific. Going forward, it will be interesting to see if dengue virus outbreak occur with the temporal cycles predicted. The introduction of DENV-3 into French Polynesia in 2013 from French Guiana underscores the importance of long-distance travel in the dissemination of dengue viruses. - Mod.TY]

[2] Dengue - Tanzania: (Dar es Salaam)

Dengue outbreak in the United Republic of Tanzania (situation as of 30 May 2014)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an update on the confirmed dengue fever outbreak notified to the World Health Organization by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoH&SW) on 4 Feb 2014.

As at 30 May 2014, the dengue fever outbreak has spread to 7 regions on the mainland and 2 regions in Zanzibar. The geographical distribution of cases and deaths is as follows: mainland (1017 confirmed cases out of a total of 2121 suspected cases including 4 deaths) and Zanzibar (1 confirmed case out of 8 suspected cases, and no deaths). 99 per cent of the cases of the mainland were reported from the following 3 districts of Dar es Salaam: Kinondoni, Temeke, and Ilala. Of the 4 deceased cases, 1 had presented with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and 1 with multiple organ failure.

Dengue fever response
---------------------
The Dengue Fever Response Task force established by the Ministry of Health continues to hold its regular meetings to review the current situation and propose additional preventive and control measures. The following measures are currently being implemented with support from WHO and partners: advocacy for resources to implement all activities described in the dengue fever response plan; enhancement of surveillance; training of health care workers and laboratory staff on the management of dengue cases and diagnostic, confirmation, and monitoring of dengue fever and integrated vector management. A 2nd press statement on the dengue fever outbreak situation in the country was issued by the Government on 12 May 2014. WHO continues to provide guidance to the MoH&SW mainland and MOH Zanzibar through among others, deployment of experts in the areas of epidemiology/surveillance, vector control, and provision of rapid diagnostic kits.

Based on the current information available for this event, WHO, does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to the United Republic of Tanzania, both mainland and Zanzibar.

[Further to earlier updates issued on this emergency [ProMED-EAFR posts 20140514.410491 and 20140529.413539], this report shows that the dengue fever outbreak in the United Republic of Tanzania has spread to at least 7 regions on the mainland and 2 regions in Zanzibar.

With support from the WHO and partners, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has rolled out comprehensive interventions to curb the raging outbreak.
