The government of Pernambuco state, in northeast Brazil is reporting 36 people with confirmed cases of the drug resistant fungus, _Candida auris_, since the beginning of 2022 when the 1st case was reported in January [2022].

The cases are reported at 2 public hospitals-the Hospitals of Restauração (HR), in Recife and Miguel Arraes, in Paulista.

According to a G1 Globo report, the 1st case of the 'superfungus' was registered in January [2022], in HR. In the same month, the Pernambuco Nursing Assistants and Technicians Union (Satenpe) asked the government, the Public Ministry (MPPE) and the Public Ministry of Labor (MPT), to interdict [?] two rooms of the Trauma Unit of the emergency unit. This request was not granted.

This year [2022], the State Department of Health (SES-PE) notified, in all, of the 41 occurrences in the state network. In addition to the 36 confirmations, 4 are still under investigation and 1 case has been discarded. The collected material was sent for analysis in a reference laboratory.

_C. auris_ is a type of yeast that can cause severe illness, particularly [in] those suffering from serious medical conditions in hospitals and nursing homes. According to the US CDC, patients who have been hospitalized in a health care facility for long periods, have a central venous catheter or other lines or tubes entering their body, or have weakened immune systems are at highest risk of infection and serious complications. The risk of _C. auris_ infection to otherwise healthy people, including health care personnel, is extremely low.

The fungus can cause serious infections, including bloodstream infections and wound infections. It also has been isolated from respiratory and urine specimens and can colonize patients' skin. A laboratory test is needed to determine whether a patient is colonized or infected with _C. auris_, but laboratories should be aware that it can be misidentified as other types of fungi and should know when to suspect _C. auris_, as misidentification could delay treatment and control measures.

[A prior ProMED post (Candida auris - Brazil (02): (PE) nosocomial, alert, RFI 20220212.8701422) in February 2022 reported 3 cases with _Candida auris_ infection in an unidentified hospital in Recife, the capital of the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco. At the time, there likely were additional patients since _C. auris_ tends to spread onto objects and other patients in these initial patients' environment.

The news report above says that the government of Pernambuco state is now reporting 36 people with confirmed cases of the drug resistant fungus, _C. auris_, since the beginning of 2022 when the 1st case was reported, plus 4 additional suspected cases. The cases are reported at 2 public hospitals-the Hospitals of Restauração, in Recife and Miguel Arraes, in Paulista, a city in the Recife metropolitan area. However, we are not told if these patients were infected or colonized by _C. auris_, the clinical characteristics of the outbreak, or its epidemiology. We are also not told if there is one or more outbreak strains of _C. auris_. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Targeted screening can identify these patients who may be asymptomatically colonized with _C. auris_ to control further spread. Screening is done by swabbing bilateral axilla and groin, the commonest and consistent sites of colonization, in high-risk patients (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-screening.html). Patients at highest risk include close healthcare contacts of patients with _C. auris_ infection or colonization (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html). Patients with _C. auris_ colonization should be placed on appropriate transmission-based precautions (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-infection-control.html#transmission).

_C. auris_ is often resistant to multiple antifungal medications. _C. auris_ isolates are usually resistant to fluconazole, and many are also resistant to amphotericin B. Because isolates are uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin), echinocandins remain the initial empiric drugs of choice for infections caused by this pathogen, but _C. auris_ can emerge echinocandin-resistant on therapy.

Pernambuco (estimated population of 9.6 million in 2020) is a state located along the Atlantic coast in northeast Brazil (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco; Recife (pop., about 1.65 million in 2020) is its capital and largest city https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife). Paulista (pop., 334 376 in 2020) is a city in the Recife metropolitan area.
