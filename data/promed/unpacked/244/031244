Reports from Health Protection Scotland (HPS) show that the sexually transmitted infections (STI), chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis have all increased from 2017 to 2018.

Gonorrhea cases increased the most. In 2018, 3233 episodes of gonorrhea were reported, a 24% increase compared to 2017 and the largest number recorded in the last decade. In fact, since 2013, gonorrhea diagnoses have increased by 103% (from 1595 in 2013 to 3233 in 2018). The increase is largely due to a 121% increase in male diagnoses (from 1056 to 2339) and principally, among men who have sex with men (MSM).

Rectal gonorrhea in men, a marker of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), increased in 2018 to 39% of all gonorrhea episodes recorded. The number of male rectal gonorrhea episodes is the largest number of episodes recorded over the last decade.

Genital chlamydia remains the most frequently diagnosed STI in Scotland with 16 338 diagnoses reported in 2018, which represents a 4% increase compared to 2017.

In addition, the number of diagnoses of infectious syphilis increased between 2017 and 2018 by 14% (from 399 to 455). This is the highest annual total recorded since the establishment of the surveillance system in 2002-2003 with the burden of infection among MSM (87% of diagnoses).

[The rising incidence of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has become a problem in many countries worldwide. The reasons for the increase in incidence of STDs are varied and likely differ by locality and the patient population affected. Increased diagnostic testing for STDs could contribute to some extent to the increased incidence in some groups, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). Some of the factors that could promote unprotected (condomless) sex include lack of sex education and access to condoms for teenagers and young adults; the opioid epidemic and sale of sex for drugs; the popularity of cell phone geolocating dating apps that facilitate sexual activity with multiple anonymous partners; use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners; use of psychoactive "party drugs"; and use among MSM of pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is a way to prevent HIV infection for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it by engaging in risky condomless sexual activity (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/PrEP_fact_sheet_final.pdf). The increasing incidence of gonococcal disease has been associated with increasing reports of antibiotic-resistant strains.

The news report above mentions the increase in STDs occurring among MSM in Scotland, but in many countries the increase is also occurring in women, which is associated with rising rates of congenital syphilis, and in teenagers and young adults. However, the news report above fails to mention changes in the incidence of STDs in Scotland in women and in the younger age groups and the incidence of congenital syphilis. - Mod.ML
