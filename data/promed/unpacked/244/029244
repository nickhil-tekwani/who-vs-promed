PREHISTORIC EXTINCTIONS DUE TO DISEASE? (02)

I think that it is wrong to overstate the case that prehistoric extinctions
were due to climate OR man OR disease. All three factors work together, and
a population under stress from new predators and climate change is certainly
more susceptible to disease. A similar thing may be occuring in, for
example, the Australian koala where Chlamydia is a serious threat. The
disease may have come from new species (including man), koalas may be more
susceptible due to increased predation and loss of habitat, etc etc. (Any
comments from the experts, please?)
The same phenomenon is seen in all species, including man.

[I believe that it has been demonstrated that some present Koala populations
live under very severe ecological restrictions and stress, which will
contribute to their high Chlamydual infection prevalence. AHEAD-Mod, MHJ]

Or that 'a few thousand natives' could push mammoths to extinction in
Europe, together with a number of other large species. It is perhaps more
pertinent to inquire why 'a few thousand natives' did not eradicate the game
in Africa. In this case one is perhaps inclined to observe that disease
maintained one species at a low level, and that species was man.
