With more than 70 children in Phuket having contracted Hand, Foot and
Mouth Disease (HFMD) already this year [2010], Phuket City
Municipality has issued an advisory urging parents to be aware of the
highly contagious disease.

Nittaya Panchamedithee, an officer at the municipality's health
section, said: "There is more chance of an outbreak in the rainy
season as the virus can live longer when the weather is cool and
humid." The onset of the rainy season also coincides with the start
of the 1st school semester, which also makes it easy for the virus to
spread, she said.

Ms Nittaya urged parents to keep an eye on all children, especially
those under 3 years old and infants. Indications of the disease
include fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, coughing, a sore throat,
vomiting and diarrhea. The disease is most often identified by mouth
ulcers and rashes on the hands and feet.

Parents whose children exhibit any of these conditions are urged to
seek medical treatment as soon as possible and not to allow their
children to go to school, said the release. Teachers were also urged
to be vigilant against an outbreak. School administrators should
suspend any classes with 2 or more children found to have HFMD, and
any schools with 5 or more children diagnosed with the disease should
be closed temporarily.

[This newspaper article reproduces a poster used to raise awareness
of hand, foot and mouth disease in a rather oblique manner.

Owing to the ubiquity and regularity of outbreaks of HFMD in
Southeast Asia at this time of year, ProMED-mail does not routinely
report individual outbreaks of HFMD. Currently, HFMD is widespread
throughout most provinces of China. The onset of milder weather
facilitates transmission of the infection, and strict attention to
personal hygiene is the only protection against infection.

HFMD is a common illness of infants and children caused by viruses
that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. This genus of viruses
includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and
enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most common cause of
HFMD, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with this
illness. In recent outbreaks in Asia and Australasia, enterovirus 71
has more often been associated with HFMD and linked with rare
neurological complications of infection. In the outbreak of HFMD in
Viet Nam (Ho Chi Minh City) in March 2010 (see the 1st of the
ProMED-mail archived references below), several children suffered
serious neurological complications, so it is probable that
enterovirus 71 is the etiologic agent circulating in Thailand at
present.

Phuket is an island in the south of Thailand, and Phuket city is the
main population centre in the southeast of the island. The
