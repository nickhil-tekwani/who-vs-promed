A bird flu outbreak has been confirmed at 3 poultry farms in Luxembourg. The virus was detected at farms in Keispelt, Niederfeulen and Schrassig. To limit the spread of the disease to other farms, the transport of live poultry has been banned for a week.

Luxembourg's Ministry of Agriculture, Viticulture and Consumer Protection said farmers should report all abnormal poultry deaths immediately to a vet. It also recommended that poultry be kept indoors, and be fed and watered inside a building. The ministry took pains to emphasize that bird flu cannot affect humans, and said it was safe to eat poultry meat and eggs.

[According to Luxembourg's reports to the OIE (updated 2015), highly pathogenic avian influenza has not been reported from this country since 1956. Remarkably, several serotypes of the virus have been repeatedly reported, throughout the years and up to 2017, from all of Luxembourg's neighboring countries (Belgium, France, and Germany) as well as from another Benelux country, the Netherlands.

Official confirmation of the outbreak, details including serotype, and a formal notification to the OIE are anticipated. - Mod.AS
