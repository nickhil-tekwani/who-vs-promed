Remaining with a guarded prognosis, but improving, a 33-year-old was admitted to a hospital in Camposampiero (Padua province) for botulism after eating a bowl of packaged minestrone soup. The young person remains intubated in Intensive Care but seems to be slowly regaining mobility, after the paresis [paralysis] caused by the infection.

Meanwhile, the director of health had immediately alerted the Ministry of Health (to which has been sent a sample of the minestrone soup eaten by the 33-year-old). The ministry has enabled the seizure of the minestrone soup from all points of sale. The young man had eaten a bowl of precooked Buona Terra minestrone soup* during a lunch break.

Botulinum toxin type B has been found in residues of the minestrone soup at the laboratories of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, Legnaro (Padua province). The victim had consumed the envelope of precooked food on 19 Mar 2014, and was hospitalized in the intensive care ward of the hospital of Camposampiero on 21 Mar 2014. He was treated with anti-botulism serum on 22 Mar 2014.

[Most cases of foodborne botulism are caused by home-canned foods. Commercially produced foods can be more problematic because of the potential for more cases. At this point, this is an isolated case. Serotype B botulism tends to be milder than serotype A. - Mod.LL
