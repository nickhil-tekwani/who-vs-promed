Dragon fruit farms blighted
---------------------------
A fungus, that is hard to get rid of has been plaguing dragon fruit
farms in the country, forcing many farmers to switch to other crops.

However, the _Dothiorella_ fungus, which manifests itself in withered
branches and brown rashes on fruits, only attacks red dragon fruit
plants as the white variety are basically more disease-resistant.
This explains why Viet Nam, which has 90 percent of its dragon fruit
farms planted with the white variety, is spared of the fungus.

Malaysia Agriculture Research and Development Institute (MARDI)
officer Hamidah Sulaiman said many dragon fruit farmers had incurred
huge losses as their farms were plagued by the fungus. Though edible,
she said all the fungus-infected dragon fruits could not be sold as
fresh fruit because of their ugly look. "Farmers have no choice but
to dispose of their fruits cheaply for making other food products," she said.

Johor is the main dragon fruit-producing state in the country,
followed by Pahang. In the Kluang district [of Johor] the number of
orchards has dropped from its peak at 50 in 1997 to only 20 at
present. The closure started 2 years ago because of the fungus.
Yields are 90 percent less if the plants are infected with the fungus.

Some farmers have destroyed the crop and replaced them with other
fruit trees or vegetables. "I have maximised my maintenance chores to
minimise the spread of the fungus," a farmer said, adding that most
fungus-infected dragon fruits are used to make jam, wine, and enzyme.
Another farmer said he decided to abandon his orchard as almost half
the plants were affected by the fungus.

Hamidah advised farmers to sanitise their orchards and dip all stalks
in a copper-based fungicide before commencing cultivation. "For
orchards already affected by the problem, the farmer needs to prune
all infected branches, and follow it up by spraying fungicide spray,"
she added. MARDI received its 1st sample of _Dothiorella_ infected
dragon fruits from Kuala Pilah, Negri Sembilan, in 2004.

[Dragon fruit (also called pitaya, strawberry pear) is the common
name for several cactus species and hybrids, mostly of the genus
_Hylocereus_, but also _Stenocereus_ and some other related genera.
These vine-like epiphytic cacti originate in Central and South
America but are also widely grown in Southeast Asia. They are an
important fruit crop in these regions because of their high
nutritional value. Several varieties with varying skin and pulp
colours are planted commercially.

Few diseases are known to affect dragon fruit, mainly bacterial stem
rots and fungal spots caused by _Dothiorella_ species. These fungi
cause brown spots and mottling on fruits (see photo included in the
source above), but have rarely been reported to cause serious damage
on the crop in other areas. The problems in Malaysia may be due to
disease sensitivity of local varieties or other factors specific to this area.

Disease management, as recommended above, is difficult once a fungal
infection is established in a crop, especially since dragon fruit is
propagated by cuttings, which may carry the fungi. _Dothiorella_
species are also a factor in decline syndrome and post-harvest rots
of mango, avocado canker and fruit rots, and elm wilt.
