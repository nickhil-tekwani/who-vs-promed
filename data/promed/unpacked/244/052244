Queensland Rail Gears Up for Q fever
-----------------------------------------
At a meeting of railway union representatives, Queensland Rail (QR)
and a medical officer have decided to conduct a study on the risks of
contracting the potentially fatal disease Q fever. This afternoon's
meeting [18 Jan 2001 follows concerns that 4 people working near a
suburban freight station and cattle yards at Beenleigh have contracted
the virus [actually, it's a rickettsia.
State secretary of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union, Les Crofton, says he is
confident that his members run a minimal risk of contracting Q fever,
but he is confident the task force will come up with an effective risk
management plan.

[Q fever is a rickettsial illness caused by _Coxiella burnetii_ . Sheep,
cattle, goats, cats, dogs, some wild animals (bandicoots and many
species of feral rodents), birds and ticks are natural reservoirs.
Outbreaks have occurred in occupational groups working with
reservoir animals, including stockyard workers, meat packing and
rendering workers, abattoir and dairy workers, and medical and
veterinary research facility workers where reservoir animals are used.
Transmission is usually through airborne dissemination of the
organism in dust particles but also through direct contact with
contaminated material, ingestion of contaminated placentas or ingestion
of milk. Ticks may also be involved in transmission of the organism.
Cases have occurred in individuals with no direct contact with
contaminated animals and their bodily fluids, but have been downwind
from areas that are contaminated.
Prior outbreaks reported in Australia (see refs. above) have involved
abattoir workers and meat workers. The Queensland Department of
Health fact sheet on Q fever (23 Mar 2000)
<http://www.health.qld.gov.au/brochure/phs/qfever.htm> does
mention the
use of vaccine for individuals at high risk of exposure. More
information
on this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod. MPP
