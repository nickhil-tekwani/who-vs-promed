The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, via the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reports a human infection with a novel influenza A virus variant (influenza A H3N2v virus).

The patient is [less than] 18 years of age, was not hospitalized, and has recovered from their illness. An investigation by local public health officials found that the patient had indirect swine exposure at an agricultural fair prior to their illness onset.

A total of 9 human infections with variant novel influenza A viruses have been reported in the United States in 2022, including 4 H3N2v (1 in Michigan, 3 in West Virginia) and 5 H1N2v (Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Wisconsin) viruses.

In the United States, there are 3 previously detected variants of swine influenza type A viruses that can cause disease in humans: H1N1v, H3N2v, and H1N2v. Pigs that are infected with any of these types of swine flu may exhibit signs of illness such as fever, depression, coughing (barking), discharge from the nose or eyes, sneezing, breathing difficulties, eye redness or inflammation, and going off feed. Not all influenza-infected pigs will show signs of illness or may only be mildly ill. Swine flu can circulate at any time of the year, but like the normal flu season for human influenza viruses, most outbreaks occur in the late fall and winter months.

In rare cases, humans that have come into direct contact with infected pigs might develop flu-like symptoms, such as fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing. People have also reported signs of illness including runny nose, sore throat, eye irritation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

[H3N2v is a non-human influenza virus that normally circulates in pigs and that has infected humans. Viruses that normally circulate in pigs are "swine influenza viruses." When these viruses infect humans, they are termed "variant" viruses.

In 2011, a specific H3N2 virus was detected with genes from avian, swine and human viruses and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus M gene. The virus was circulating in pigs in 2010 and was first detected in people in 2011. The acquisition of the 2009 M gene may make this virus infect humans more easily than is typical for other swine influenza viruses.

Influenza viruses can spread from pigs to people and from people to pigs. Spread from infected pigs to humans is thought to happen in the same way that seasonal influenza viruses spread between people; mainly through infected droplets created when an infected pig coughs or sneezes. If these droplets come in contact with the nose or mouth, or are inhaled, humans can be infected. There also is some evidence that people might get infected by touching items that have the virus on them and then touching the mouth or nose. A 3rd possible way to get infected is to inhale particles containing influenza virus. Scientists aren't really sure which of these ways of spread is the most common.

Symptoms of H3N2v infection are similar to those of seasonal flu viruses and can include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, and possibly other symptoms, such as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

These viruses are a cause of concern for various reasons:
1. Infections with influenza viruses (including variant viruses like H3N2v) can sometimes cause severe disease, even in healthy people. This can include complications (like pneumonia), which can require hospitalization, and sometimes result in death.
2. This virus seems to spread more easily to humans from pigs than other swine influenza viruses.
3. Influenza viruses are always changing. It's possible the H3N2v virus could change and begin spreading easily from person to person.
4. Studies conducted by CDC and others have indicated that children born after 2001 (age â‰¤ 9 years at 2010) have little to no immunity against H3N2v viruses.

Adults seem to have more immunity, perhaps because they might have been previously exposed to similar viruses in their lifetimes.

Currently, the severity of human illness associated with H3N2v resembles that of seasonal flu.The same influenza antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu can treat H3N2v in children and adults. The currently recommended drugs include oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and baloxavir, and are available on prescription. Early treatment works best and is especially important for people with high risk conditions.

CDC recommends that people with high risk of serious flu complications who plan going to a fair where pigs will be present, should avoid pigs and swine barns at the fair. This includes children younger than 5 years, people 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions (like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions).

The CDC FluView Interactive Novel Flu A tool reflects the most current case counts for variant virus infections reported in the United States since 2010. A total of 438 cases Influenza A/H3N2v cases have been reported from the United States with 5 cases reported in 2021-22 -- Michigan (1), Ohio (1), and West Virginia (3). - Mod.UBA
