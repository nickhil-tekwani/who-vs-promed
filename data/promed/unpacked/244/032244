Epidemiology of fatal cases associated with pandemic (H1N1) 2009
virus infection
-------------------------------------------
This article describes the characteristics of 574 deaths associated
with influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection up to 16 Jul
2009. Data (except from Canada and Australia) suggest that the
elderly may to some extent be protected from infection. There was
underlying disease in at least half of the fatal cases. Two risk
factors seem of particular importance: pregnancy and metabolic
condition (including obesity, which has not been considered as a risk
factor in previous pandemics or seasonal influenza).

Introduction
----
To date, there are few data on risk factors, severe cases and deaths
associated with pandemic H1N1 influenza 2009. Estimating and
interpreting case fatality ratios (CFR) is difficult, mainly due to
the challenge of accurately estimating the numerator (N deaths) and
the denominator (N cases) [1], especially during a pandemic that is
still evolving. Furthermore, many countries have abandoned individual
case counts and systematic screening of all suspect cases. This
article aims to describe the characteristics of reported deaths and
to assess the CFR and high-risk profiles linked with underlying
disease while assessing possible bias.

Methods
----
The study is based on an analysis of available data until 16 Jul
2009, as compiled by the epidemic intelligence team at the French
institute for public health surveillance (Institut de Veille
Sanitaire, InVS), using a well-defined methodology [2]. The
individual or aggregated data originated from validated official
sources (Ministries of Health, local or national public health
authorities, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World
Health Organization), completed by informal sources when needed.

Results
----
The 1st (retrospectively) confirmed death occurred in Oaxaca State,
Mexico, (onset of symptoms on 4 Apr 2009). As of 16 Jul 2009, InVS
was aware of 684 confirmed deaths reported worldwide since the start
of the pandemic (illustrated by a figure in the original text) for a
total of 126 168 reported cases. At this stage, no deaths had been
reported, and scarce data was available from African countries.

Data were available for 574 deaths associated with pandemic H1N1
influenza 2009: Individual data for 449 cases in 26 countries and
aggregated data for 125 cases in Mexico [3]. The quality and
completeness of the data regarding age, sex, date of death and the
notion of underlying disease varied greatly for each case. The
overall computed CFR (number of reported deaths per number of
reported cases as of 16 Jul 2009) was 0.6 percent and varied from 0.1
percent to 5.1 percent depending on the country and the accurate
quantification of deaths and overall case counts [data tabulated in
the original text].

Deaths by sex and age
----
Data on sex were available for 503 fatal cases worldwide (257 men and
246 women, sex ratio=1.04). Data on age were available for 468 fatal
cases worldwide (343 with individual data and 125 with aggregated
data). Data on both information (age and sex) were available for 448
fatal cases [data displayed graphically in the original text].

Although previous reports suggested that cases of pandemic (H1N1)
influenza 2009 virus infection occurred mainly in children [4], the
mean and median age of the 343 fatal cases in our analysis were 37
years (range 0-85 years). Most deaths (51 percent) occurred in the
age group of 20-49 year-olds, but there was considerable variation
depending on country or continent (Data tabulated in the original
text]. Overall, 12 percent of deaths occurred in cases aged 60 years
or more, but 36 percent of reported deaths in Canada (mainly female)
and 28 percent in Australia occurred in this age group.

Underlying risks
----
Pregnancy: As of 16 Jul 2009, 16 women (10 percent of all
individually documented female cases who died and 30 percent of the
20-39 year-old women who died) were pregnant or had delivered at the
time of their death. Among these 16 women, at least 8 had documented
underlying health risks (obesity, heart disease or a respiratory
disease such as asthma or tuberculosis). No information was available
as to the underlying health status of the 8 remaining women who died.

Underlying disease
----
A sub-analysis examined the 354 cases (241 cases with individual data
and 113 with aggregated data) who died and were also documented for
underlying disease and for sex and/or age [data displayed graphically
in the original text]. Presence or absence of underlying disease was
documented for 241 of 449 (53 percent of the 449 cases with
individual data) deaths with individual data. Of these, 218 (90
percent) had documented underlying disease, and 23 (10 percent) had
documented absence of underlying disease. A further sub-analysis was
conducted on 102 cases of known sex (80 with detailed underlying
disease and 22 without disease) and 93 cases of known age (75 with
detailed underlying disease and 18 without disease). Underlying
disease (or its absence) was equally distributed between the sexes,
but understandably not among age groups [data presented graphically
in the original text]. A high proportion of young children (27
percent of the 0-9 year-olds) and young adults (22 percent of the
20-29 year-olds) had no documented underlying disease, while 60
percent of people over the age of 60 years had heart or respiratory
disease. Diabetes and obesity were the most frequently identified
underlying conditions and were found in fatal cases over the age of
20 years (the World Health Organization defines "obesity" as a body
mass index equal to or more than 30, but as the reporting format
differed between sources and no standard definition of childhood
obesity is applied worldwide, we cannot be sure the same definition
has been applied for all cases). In the 13 fatal cases with
individual detailed data on metabolic conditions, 7 cases had
obesity, 5 cases had diabetes, and one case had both. The available
data for the other cases did not specify whether the metabolic
condition included obesity only, diabetes only, or both.

[The distribution of underlying diseases in pandemic H1N1 influenza
2009-associated deaths by age, worldwide* as of 16 Jul 2009 (116
disorders documented in 93 fatal cases) is presented in the form of a
figure, and another figure displays graphically underlying diseases
in pandemic H1N1 influenza 2009-associated deaths worldwide* as of 16
Jul 2009 (213 diseases documented in 193 fatal cases)].

Discussion and conclusions
----
Most cases described during the 3 pandemics of the 20th century and
during seasonal influenza involve transient illness not requiring
hospitalisation. Most deaths are described in the very young or the
elderly or those with underlying disease. The 1918-1919 pandemic,
however, was characterised by a high mortality rate in healthy young
adults and an estimated CFR of 2-3 percent [5]. Even with a low CFR,
seasonal influenza epidemics cause significant morbidity and
mortality with an estimated 3-5 million cases of severe illness and
about 250 000 to 500 000 deaths worldwide [6].

To date, the CFR attributable to the current H1N1 pandemic has been
estimated at around 0.4 percent, based on surveillance data from
Mexico and mathematical modelling [7]. This CFR is higher than that
of average seasonal influenza but remains of the same order of
magnitude. Whether this will change before the expected epidemic peak
in the northern hemisphere in the autumn [2009] is unknown.

Evaluating CFR during a pandemic is a hazardous exercise. Aside from
the issue of whether or not a death has been caused by the influenza
infection, cases tend to be detected initially among severely ill
patients with a higher probability of dying. This leads to an
overestimation of the computed CFR at the beginning of an outbreak.
The computed CFR subsequently evolves as the case reporting strategy
is adapted to the situation. When the situation no longer requires
exhaustive reporting of cases, the computed CFR will inevitably
increase and grossly overestimate the true CFR.

Specific investigations or modelling allow for a more accurate
estimation of the number of cases. As of 27 May 2009, there had been
820 confirmed cases in New York City, of whom 2 had died, resulting
in a computed CFR of 0.2 percent. A telephone survey estimated that
in fact 250 000 cases had occurred in that city of 8.3 million
inhabitants, resulting in an estimated CFR of 0.0008 percent [8,9].
In the United Kingdom (UK), there were 28 deaths reported for a
documented 10 649 cases as of 16 Jul 2009 and a computed CFR of 0.26
percent. However, health authorities estimated that the cumulative
number in the UK on that date was 65 649 cases and 28 deaths, which
corresponds to an estimated CFR of 0.04 percent [10].

The pandemic, however, is far from over, and deaths will
unfortunately continue to occur. As in previous pandemics, available
data show that age groups are not equally affected. Compared to
younger age groups, the elderly seem to be protected from infection
to some extent, perhaps due to previous exposure to strains akin to
influenza A(H1N1)v virus [11-13]. When infection does occur, however,
the percentage of deaths in elderly cases seems to be higher than in
others. Initial estimates available from Mexico for the period until
16 Jul 2009 showed that the risk of death in aged cases (over 50
years) was higher (6 percent deaths among cases) than in children
(0-1 percent deaths among cases aged 0-19 years) and young adults
(2-4 percent deaths among cases aged 20-49 years) [3].

There was documented underlying disease in at least 49 percent of
documented fatal cases worldwide to date. Diseases most frequently
associated with death were the same as those identified for death
from seasonal influenza. Nevertheless, 2 risk factors are noticeable:
pregnancy and obesity. Pregnancy is a well-documented risk factor for
severe infection and death in seasonal influenza and in previous
pandemics [14-16]. The role of obesity, however, remains to be
further analysed in order to ascertain whether the risk is linked
with complications of obesity during intensive care [17,18] or with a
severe course of disease due to diabetes frequently associated with
obesity [19], or whether obesity plays a specific role in the
pathogenesis of severe influenza A(H1N1)v infection, for example by
interfering with the host's immune responses, as has been shown in
rodents [20].

All the data presented here were from official sources and were
carefully documented. Yet they are to be interpreted cautiously due
to the variable quality of data regarding underlying disease
(especially for pre-existing respiratory disease), small numbers,
incomplete reporting using different formats, a mixture of individual
and aggregated data, epidemic dynamics within the population
(epidemics initially affecting school children or travellers) and
population structure. For instance, we found that deaths in Canada
seem to have been especially frequent in elderly women. Finally, the
difficulty in determining whether the cause of death is attributable
to influenza A(H1N1)v infection or to associated factors remains a
major limitation.

The proportion of deaths with documented underlying disease must be
interpreted with care due to a significant amount of missing data.
There may be an information bias which overestimates the proportion
of underlying disease, since its presence may be reported more
readily than its absence.

The analysis in this article is based on data collected only 10 weeks
after the 1st international alert, and the pandemic is still in its
very early phase. All evidence acquired so far remains to be
completed and confirmed in the coming months, especially in view of
the influenza epidemics currently ongoing in the southern hemisphere.
Surveillance of the progression of the pandemic H1N1 influenza 2009
will focus more and more on severe cases. A more reliable CFR could
be estimated through specific surveys, mathematical modelling,
syndromic surveillance of influenza-like illness and of reported
deaths in the population. Encouraging reporting in a common
international format would also be useful.

[3] Malaysia - fatalities
Date: 20 Aug 2009
Source: Bernama [edited]
<http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsgeneral.php?id=434580>


Three experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) are to study
the mortality rate due to influenza A(H1N1) in the country as the
death toll rose to 68 on Thursday [20 Aug 2009].

Health Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said Malaysia had requested
the WHO to send 3 epidemiologists to look into the H1N1 deaths,
especially why some patients developed pneumonia so fast and died in
a short period.

"They would study the classification of the death due to H1N1. Some
died due to co-morbid (presence of more than one disease or health
condition in an individual at a given time) causes, and some die from
direct infection. We want them to look into the classification of
death for H1N1 so that we will not over report or under report. This
is to ensure that we can set a fair comparison, as we have already
adopted the WHO's guideline on this matter. The WHO will look into
our death cases and observe the situation. The epidemiologists
arrived here yesterday [19 Aug 2009] and have already started their
work today," he told Bernama.

Health Ministry statistics showed that of the 68 deaths, 70 per cent
were due to co-morbid causes, 20 per cent due to late treatment and
10 per cent, mostly involving children, are direct infections.

Liow said the WHO experts would also study the spread of the H1N1 at
the community level to determine why the virus spread so fast in this
country compared with others.

According to health experts, the age group most likely to contract A
(H1N1) flu is between 5 and 24 [years].

However, some experts said the number of influenza A(H1N1) deaths in
Malaysia may be higher than that of its neighbours, but the fatality
rate of people with confirmed H1N1 is not remarkably high. Dr
Christopher Lee, consultant physician and head of infectious diseases
at the Sungai Buloh Hospital, during a recent briefing to the media,
said this was especially pertinent when one considered the WHO
estimation that 15-20 cases went unreported for every case of
confirmed A(H1N1).

Following this, it is understood that the Health ministry has
requested the WHO's help to study the death rate and come up with a
fair comparison to ensure that it does not under-report or
over-report cases.

[Until more specific data are presented, it is difficult to draw
conclusions on the observations surrounding the apparently high
mortality seen in Malaysia. It is unclear what the actual denominator
(the number of cases) is to calculate a meaningful case fatality rate
estimate. As a reminder, in the early days of the pandemic (H1N1)
2009 activity in Mexico, calculated CFRs appeared to be high (greater
than 10 percent in the early reports), but with time, as more
information became available through investigations, this rate
dropped below one percent. The concern facing the international
community is whether the apparently mild pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
that has been circulating will undergo reassortment with other
viruses and evolve into a virus that has a greater severity and
higher mortality associated with it.
