CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE, CERVIDS - USA (ILLINOIS)(02)

[According to ProMED-mail post 20040319.0766 "DNR has long advocated
good hygiene by hunters, including the wearing of rubber gloves when
handling deer. Several years ago, CWD was diagnosed in wild,
free-ranging deer and elk primarily in northeastern Colorado,
southeastern Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana,Oklahoma, Kansas, South
Dakota, Saskatchewan, and Alberta."]
Contrary to information provided in the ProMED-mail posting on 18 Mar
2004 regarding chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Illinois, I would
like to clarify that CWD has _not_ been found in free-ranging deer or
elk in Alberta. This is a rumor that somehow is spreading.
The Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division, in conjunction with Alberta
Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, conducted a pilot program
in 1996 and has maintained ongoing surveillance of hunter-killed deer
and elk as well as road kills and animals that fit the clinical
pattern of emaciation since 1998.
We have tested close to 5000 heads of wild deer and elk and have
_never_ found CWD. As part of the ongoing surveillance in farmed
cervids, Alberta Agriculture has tested some 20 000 heads and found
one case of CWD in a farmed elk and 2 cases of CWD in farmed deer.
