Guidelines for working with free-ranging wild mammals in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wildlife Health Specialist Group (WHSG) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) have recently released guidelines to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from people to free-ranging wild mammals. These recommendations are based on 1st principles of biosecurity and hygiene, current knowledge of human-to-animal SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and the precautionary principle.

There is a possibility that SARS-CoV-2 will become endemic in the human population and thus, presents a risk of a potential reverse zoonosis to wildlife as with infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza. There are valid concerns about the health of wild species if infected with the virus and/or a wildlife population becoming a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. Any wildlife species/taxa that becomes a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 could pose a continued public health risk of zoonosis, a risk for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to other animal species, and risk negative perceptions resulting in human threats to that species or their populations.

These guidelines provide a framework for people engaged in wildlife work in situ, but hopefully will also be useful more broadly for risk reduction and encouraging professionalism and best practices.

The guidelines are posted at IUCN: http://www.iucn-whsg.org/COVID-19GuidelinesForWildlifeResearchers and

[Events in animals: OIE Members have been keeping the OIE updated on any investigations or outcomes of investigations in animals. Information is available at https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/events-in-animals/

It has been shown that carnivores in the Felidae and Mustelidae families are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Felidae confirmed infected by this virus were domestic cats, lions, tigers, and cougars. Further, experiments showed that infected cats can transmit the virus to other cats. It has not been proven as yet that felids can be a source of infection for humans. Animal-to-human transmission of COVID-19, however, has been documented from minks (Mustelidae). According to a recent study which analyzed ACE2 proteins 410 vertebrate species (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010146117), some mammals may be at high risk of infection, as suggested by the affinity for binding between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2. Taxonomic groups with high susceptibility of infection are non-human primates, cervids, and cetaceans. Other mammals with moderate to high infection risk according to this study are New World anteaters (Xenarthra), bovids, ovids, antelopes, and some rodents. - Mod.PMB]
