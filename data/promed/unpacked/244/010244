China's Ministry of Health issued on Mon, 12 Sep 2005, a report on
nationwide epidemic situation in Aug 2005. Statistics of the ministry
showed more cases of cholera occurred in the month compared with the
same period of 2005. The number of cholera cases was 116, much
higher than the same period of 2004. [The higher numbers were mainly
the result of] several big epidemic outbreaks due to dinner parties
in rural areas.

Fruit and vegetable exporters are sustaining huge losses due to
inadequate dissemination of information on the outbreak of cholera in
some parts of Iran, prompting most Persian Gulf littoral states to
refuse to import Iran's farm products, said Head of Trade Development
Organization Mojtaba Khosrowtaj.
Official figures further showed a small rise in the number of
reported cholera cases, with 8 deaths and 626 infections in Aug 2005.
Health Ministry officials said the outbreak has affected 15 out of
Iran's 30 provinces. In mid-August, the Health Ministry banned the
cultivation and distribution of green vegetables for the next 2
months. State television has also warned people to avoid consuming
vegetables and ice sold on the street and many restaurants have been
prohibited from serving salads.

Several West African Countries, including Liberia, Guinea,
Mauritania, Guinea Bissau, and Burkina Faso are said to be faced with
cholera outbreaks. The latest information comes as the Belgium-based
medical group Medecins sans Frontieres sent more staff and medical
supplies in response to the outbreak.
After an initial assessment in Guinea Bissau, where the epidemic is
expanding rapidly, MSF has sent a charter plane with more than 70
tons of medical and logistical supplies. MSF also observed that a
large number of affected patients are from the capital cities of [the
above listed] countries.
MSF said the Antonov 124 flight left from Ostende Airport in Belgium
with drugs, including cholera kits to treat 3000 people, first aid
kits, 2400 meters of plastic sheeting, 12 dispensary tents to set up
cholera treatment centers, water tanks, 1200 jerry cans and spraying
equipment.
"MSF is increasing its response capacity to face the cholera outbreak
all over West Africa," says Stephen Goetghebuer, Operational
Coordinator for this region in Brussels.
Mr. Goetghebuer noted that they treated 282 patients in Burkina Faso
and 2337 severe cases, plus 7291 suspected infections were treated in
Liberia, particularly Monrovia.
The MSF is quoted as saying that in Conakry, Guinea, they have set up
3 treatment centers and given support to another 2, while in
Mauritania, they treated over 1000 people thus far.
"Now we will also open cholera centers in Guinea Bissau. In 2 days we
hope to reach Kachek Island in Guinea, Conakry, from which it is very
hard to get information because radio contacts are unreliable.
Overall, our figures show that the number of cases continues to
increase across many countries in West Africa."

A total of 14 333 people have contracted cholera and 252 have died in
Guinea-Bissau since the disease broke out in the country in Jun 2005,
said reports reaching here Tue, 13 Sep 2005, from its capital Bissau.
The disease affected nearly 5000 people every month since its
outbreak, and the country cannot provide sufficient medical care for
all patients because of its under-developed health care system, said
Guinea-Bissau's healthy ministry in a statement. The ministry asked
the international community to continue efforts to provide medicine
and donations to relieve the pressure that the outbreak is causing.

[5] Cholera - Nigeria (Adamawa)

No fewer than 10 persons have been reported dead following a fresh
outbreak of cholera in the Chikila district of Guyuk Local Government
Area of Adamawa State. This has brought the death toll in the state
to 28 within a month. In Aug 2005, the cholera epidemic ravaged 3
local government areas of the state, where no fewer than 18 persons
were confirmed dead.
Guyuk South Development Area Administrator, Lazarus Gugu, who broke
the news in Yola, the state capital, blamed the outbreak on poor
sanitary conditions and unhealthy practices among the people. Gugu,
who donated drugs, also said 5 persons died in hospital while others
died at home, adding that several others were in various hospitals
receiving treatment.
It was also gathered that the number of casualties could be higher,
as the epidemic is already spreading to neighboring communities
around the state.
Gugu advised the people to ensure good sanitary habits to check the
spread of the epidemic, adding that the state government would do its
best to assist the victims. He organized sanitation exercises for
the people and educated them on the need to always insist on good
drinking water, toilet facilities and clean cooking environment.
