In regions where malaria is highly endemic, persons are infected so
frequently that they develop acquired immunity, meaning that they
become more or less asymptomatic carriers of the parasite.

Mr Alfredo Villanueva, representative of a group of mining workers in
the state of Bolivar, announced that next Wednesday [20 Oct 2010]
they will present a report to the National Assembly (Venezuelan House
of Representatives), in which they describe the sanitary situation in
the mines in the Guayana region, with special emphasis on the
increase in malaria cases, mainly in Km 88, Las Claritas, and some
native communities in La Paragua, such as Alcarabi and Guaniamo, as
well as the Ikabaru community, in the municipality of Gran Sabana,
where the disease is rampant.

Mr Villanueva assured that the El Dorado hospital does not have the
resources necessary for taking care of the many persons affected. He
pointed out that he will request plans to be made for prevention and
therapy of malaria cases. He asked for more cooperation between
Public Health Institutes, Bolivar State Government, and the Malaria
Center.

Mr Villanueva urged miners to participate in workshops and meetings,
and to work according to their communities' interests rather than
according to political purposes.

According to the most recent issue of the Epidemiological Bulletin
from the Ministry of Health (no. 40, corresponding to the week of 3-9
Oct 2010), the municipalities of Sifontes, Cedeno, Piar, Angostura,
and Sucre are the areas where the disease has been reported as most
prevalent, representing 94.2 percent of the national number of cases.

According to the official figures, this region has a cumulative total
of 34 741 cases , that is, a 60.5 percent increase compared to the
same period for 2009, when 21 642 cases were reported. The fact that
Guayana region is still suffering from a malaria epidemic is evidence
that preventive policies have not been complied with.

[Malaria is prevalent in the eastern part of Bolivar State, including
Las Claritas and La Paragua located south of the Guri water
reservoir. Most diamond mining in this area is done illegally by
individuals under primitive conditions. Under such conditions it is
not surprising that malaria is a problem in an endemic area.
