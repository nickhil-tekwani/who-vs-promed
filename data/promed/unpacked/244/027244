Two die of tick-borne fever in south Kazakhstan
--------------------------------------------
Ten cases of Crimean haemorrhagic fever, two of them fatal, have been
registered since early March in South Kazakhstan and Zhambyl (south of
the republic) Regions of Kazakhstan, a deputy head of department at the
state public health and epidemic service of the healthcare committee of
the Kazakh Ministry of Health, Albert Askarov, reported.
He said that the republican healthcare committee had sent to these
regions "additional blood substitution and purifying preparations",
which are necessary for the treatment of people infected with the
fever. Askarov said the government had been asked for about
2m tenge (114.5 tenge equal one dollar) in extra funds to purchase
the necessary preparations to treat patients with the disease.
Crimean haemorrhagic fever is an infectious disease carried by
ticks. When suffering from the disease the patient suffers a great
number of haemorrhages.

[The registered name of the disease is Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and it occurs over a wide area of the
former USSR & neighboring countries, & parts of sub-Saharan
Africa. The correct name should in fact be Congo-Crimean
haemorrhagic fever, since the type strain was first described by
myself & colleagues in 1967 from a specimen sent from the
[Belgian Congo. However, the Russians persuaded the
International Committee on Viral Nomenclature that since they had
known the disease for decades earlier, it didn't matter that they
hadn't managed to isolate the virus, the word "Crimean" should
come first. Yes, it still rankles! - Mod.JW
