[Cases are continuing to occur with today's (30 Oct 2014) newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths raising the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 to 789 including 337 deaths (case fatality rate 42.7 percent). There have been 35 cases confirmed since 1 Oct 2014. All 3 of the newly confirmed cases today are most likely due to nosocomial transmission, as 2 have a "possible" history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment, and the 3rd is a healthcare worker who had known contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment.

The 3 newly reported fatalities involved a 45-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Taif who was confirmed on 24 Oct 2014 who at the time was admitted to the ICU and had a history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment; a 61-year-old expat female non-healthcare worker who was confirmed on 27 Oct 2014, and at the time was admitted to the ICU with no identifiable risk exposures; and a 77-year-old Saudi male non-healthcare worker from Taif who was confirmed on 23 Oct 2014, who at the time was admitted to the hospital ward with no identifiable risk exposures. All 3 newly reported fatalities had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities.

[2] Indonesia (Jambi), 2 susp cases, returning pilgrims

Two Jambi [Jambi province] residents, who just returned from performing a haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, are reported to have contracted Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a viral respiratory disease caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

They are undergoing medical treatment in an isolation facility at the Pinang Minang Masak pavilion of Raden Mattaher Hospital (RSUD), Jambi.

The pavilion's head, Neli Wirlis, said the 2 pilgrims suspected of being infected with MERS-CoV were a married couple and were now undergoing intensive treatment.

To confirm MERS-CoV infection in the 2 patients, RSUD Raden Mattaher, together with the Jambi administration's health agency, conducted laboratory testing.

"We continue to give intensive treatment to the 2 patients while waiting for lab test results from Jambi Health Agency," said Neli on Thursday [30 Oct 2014].

The agency's head of disease control and environmental health (P2PL) directorate, Kaswendi, said the married couple showed symptoms that were similar to MERS CoV infection shortly after they arrived in Jambi.

"They developed a high fever, severe cough and are short of breath," he said.

Dewi Juli Arta, a health official from the Haj Health Team at the Jambi Port Health Office, said the status of the 2 haj pilgrims was still "suspected MERS-CoV", as it had not been confirmed yet.

"They are suspected of having contracted MERS-like symptoms one day after a health checkup held at the Indonesian haj health post in Saudi Arabia prior to their departure," said Dewi.
