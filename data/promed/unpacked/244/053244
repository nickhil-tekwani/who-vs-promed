The Ecuadorian Agricultural Quality Assurance Agency (Agrocalidad,
according to its Spanish initials), reported an outbreak of bovine
rabies caused by bat bites, in the Amazonian Province of
Morona-Santiago (southeast part of Ecuador), near the Peruvian
border.

Agrocalidad issued a report stating that the outbreak "has been
properly taken care of in order to control the effects caused by the
disease."

The Ecuadorian Sanitation Agency pointed out that the outbreak had its
origin in Sevilla Don Bosco parish, an area in the Amazon jungle where
many cattle ranches are located.

Agrocalidad also stated that "every measure for controlling this
disease has been taken," and its spokesperson indicated that cattle
from the affected area had been immunized, and permanent surveillance
has also been implemented.

"We are planning to capture and control populations of blood-eating
chiropters (_Desmodus rotundus_)," the animals responsible for
infecting cattle in the (affected) area, declared the spokesperson
from Agrocalidad. He also pointed out that training programs will be
implemented in this area so that people may become aware of the
disease and they may also be able to report new cases.

[These bats can be captured in mist nets at night, and warfarin
(Coumadin) -- and related anticoagulants -- can be applied in jelly.
The treated bats return to their communal roosts, groom themselves and
others groom them as well, ingesting the anticoagulant and die. Oral
administration of anticoagulants to cattle, in doses that do not
adversely affect the cattle, can attain blood levels sufficient to
kill vampire bats.

Of the 3 species of vampire bats in South America, the most common is
_Desmodus rotundus_, which responsible for the rabies virus
transmission in this case. An image can be accessed at
