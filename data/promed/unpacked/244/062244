An outbreak of serious and contagious Newcastle disease has been discovered in the province of Orebro, following test results from the Swedish Veterinary Institute (SVA). "Avian influenza and Newcastle disease viruses circulate regularly in wild birds. To avoid the spread of infection to domestic birds, it is always important to ensure that direct and indirect contact between domestic and wild birds is avoided," says infection control farmer Caroline Busval, according to a press release.

The authority imposed restrictions in the area to avoid further spread. An infection control investigation has been initiated in order to ascertain the source of the infection and whether there is a risk of further spread. This disease is harmless to humans [see comment].

The disease is relatively uncommon and she is not aware of any previous outbreaks in the county, says Ella Siegvardsson, an Orebro County veterinarian.

Since 1995, 20 outbreaks of Newcastle disease have occurred in Sweden. The most recent outbreak recorded in Vastra Gotaland County was in 2018. In the previous year, farms were affected in Ostergotland County, Skane County, and Kalmar County.

[Paramyxovirus type 1 (PMV-1), which causes Newcastle disease (NCD), an OIE-listed animal disease, occurs in most countries, worldwide. Several major pandemics have occurred since the disease was first detected in 1926. Within the EU, all countries except Sweden and Finland are currently vaccinating their poultry. Despite vaccination, outbreaks occur in several European countries every year. Sweden has experienced occasional sporadic outbreaks while managing to maintain its officially-recognised status as a non-vaccinating country.

Sweden's previous NCD event, in 2018, was caused by the virus variant pAAvV-1, a virus type adapted to pigeons (20181115.6148287); this event remained solitary in 2018. Earlier NCD outbreaks reportedly occurred during the years 2017 (3 outbreaks), 2016 (1), 2014 (3), 2011 (2*), 2009 (1), 2008 (1), 2006 (1), 2005 (1), 2004 (2), 2003 (1*), 2001 (1), 1997 (1), 1995 (1).
(* Outbreaks caused by the virus variant pAAvV-1).

Further information on NCD in Sweden is available at https://www.sva.se/produktionsdjur/fjaderfa/sjukdomar/djursjukdomar-a-o/newcastlesjuka (in Swedish).

NCD is not dangerous to humans, but in close contact may cause conjunctivitis.

The genotype of the current event is yet to be established/published. - Mod.AS
