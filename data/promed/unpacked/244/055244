The country's listeriosis outbreak shows no sign of slowing down. In the last week alone, 57 people died from the food-borne disease, bringing the death toll to over 160. The source of the outbreak remains unknown.

The manner in which food is prepared in businesses and in homes has been under the spotlight since the outbreak of the disease in December 2017. Fruit and vegetables must be washed well and meat cooked thoroughly.

But awareness of the outbreak remains low. "Somebody preparing food in Pretoria to a small group of people will not have that food available in the Northern Cape, for example, so I doubt very much that it's a preparation process in a home kitchen. I believe this is a processed product of some sort that is distributed across the entire country," said food safety expert Dr Lucia Anelich. Anelich believes processed foods and cold meats and ready-made salads found at local delis could be the culprit for the outbreak. "Environmental hygiene from an industry perspective is really important ... to find it and to kill it so it doesn't continuously contaminate different products."

Another expert believes taking charge of how your food is being prepared is the safest bet. "If it's been made outside of your control, keep yourself away from that. Get into the habit of cooking thoroughly and make sure you have handled your own food, because that is the only way you can be under control until we hear more about sources of infection," said Unisa researcher, Dr Prudence Kayoka-Kabongo.

While the National Institute for Communicable Diseases tries to locate the source of the outbreak, over 800 cases in all 9 provinces have been confirmed. The majority of deaths, 98, have occurred in Gauteng.

In the midst of the largest listeriosis outbreak to date in the world, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) is asking victims in South Africa to list everything they can remember eating in the past month with the hopes of identifying a source.

Of the 872 confirmed cases, 164 people have died, 43 percent of whom were babies less than a month old.

"Given the scale of our mystery outbreak, it has led to what one delegate termed 'listeria hysteria', at a listeriosis workshop hosted by the South African Association of Food Science and Technology (SAAFoST) in Johannesburg on Wednesday [14 Feb 2018]," according to a story from The Times in Johannesburg.

Lucia Anelich, SAAFoST president, said given that a single, unique "homegrown" strain of listeriosis was identified in more than 90 percent of the confirmed cases, it was likely that the source was a single food product or range of food products consumed often and by both rich and poor across South Africa; "Cold meats, for example, range from Viennas and polony to more expensive slices of ham."

Since proper cooking temperatures kill _Listeria_, the food source is thought to be a fruit, vegetables, or a ready-to-eat food item. Additionally, the possibility of ill-treated irrigation water is a likely culprit.

A food safety expert and an epidemiologist with listeriosis experience have been sent to South Africa by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help identify the source of the outbreak. According to a WHO spokesman, a "strong lead" is pending with laboratory results.

South Africa is in desperate need for an update to their entire food system, a call for "a dramatic overhaul of our legislation and the entire food safety system."

For example, there were fewer than 2000 environmental health practitioners responsible for monitoring all food outlets from restaurants to informal vendors; the WHO said that South Africa needs 5000 of them.

[When last reported by ProMED-mail (Listeriosis - South Africa (05): fatal, more cases 20180131.5596282), there was a total of 820 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases, including 82 deaths. Now, there are 872 confirmed cases nationally, including 164 deaths, a case fatality rate of 18.8%.

Previous ProMED-mail posts said that molecular typing identified ST6 in over 90 percent of clinical isolates from all 9 provinces, which supports the current working hypothesis of a single source of food contamination causing the outbreak, that is, a single, widely consumed food product, or multiple food products produced at a single facility and distributed nationally. However, no ST6 food/environmental isolates have been identified to date, and the source of this outbreak remains unknown. - Mod.ML
