An outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the South Bronx has claimed 2 more lives, bringing the death toll to 12, with a total of 113 people infected since early July, New York City officials said on Monday [10 Aug 2015].

The 2 deaths were the first to be reported since last week and served as a reminder that while the outbreak appears to have ebbed in recent days, the toll is still emerging. People can become sick by inhaling contaminated mist from a water source that contains the legionella bacteria, which cause the disease.

City health officials have said they believe they have traced the source of the outbreak to a group of 5 water-cooling towers in the South Bronx that initially tested positive for legionella. The towers are at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center; the Opera House Hotel; Concourse Plaza shopping mall; a Verizon office building; and Streamline Plastics Company. All of the sites have been treated and disinfected.

At least 5 more towers also tested positive in the last few days, but health officials have said they do not believe any of those five are responsible for the outbreak. Cooling towers are bulky structures on rooftops on modern buildings that help control hot and cold air in buildings.

The outbreak prompted city health officials to take the unprecedented step last week of ordering every building with a cooling tower in the city to inspect and disinfect it within two weeks. Investigators with the State Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have stepped in to help test and collect water samples from cooling towers in the Bronx.

The arrival of the Opera House Hotel in the South Bronx two years ago was a turning point for a poor corner of New York City. A rundown theater building where Harry Houdini and the Marx Brothers performed was transformed into a boutique hotel with terrazzo floors, custom furnishings and concierge service. It became an instant landmark among the bodegas, fast-food restaurants and pharmacies that drive the neighborhood commerce. But now the Opera House, on East 149th Street, is at the center of the worst outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the city's history, with investigators identifying a cluster of three patients who had direct contact with the hotel, and a second cluster of three who live in an apartment building on the street behind the hotel.

The airborne disease has killed 12 people and infected at least 113 since early July, overshadowing an economic success story and highlighting the public health risks that have long plagued the city's poorest borough.

The hotel's water-cooling tower was one of five in the South Bronx that initially tested positive for legionella bacteria and, on Monday night, a city official said that the investigation so far pointed to the hotel, though the official cautioned that test results were still out and that no final conclusions had been reached. "The preponderance of medical and scientific information available now points to one of the original five sites as the source of this outbreak, with the Opera House Hotel as the most likely source of the outbreak," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the findings were preliminary. "This is not final or official until test results are received back from the lab," the official said.

In a chart highlighted by city health officials, the hotel's tower is the one surrounded by the densest concentration of identified cases. Glenn Isaacs, a representative for the Opera House Hotel, said that he was contacted on Monday night [10 Aug 2015] by an aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio and told that the hotel's cooling tower had been linked to the clusters. Mr Isaacs said that last month hotel workers emailed every guest who had stayed at the hotel since July 1 [2015] and provided an email address. None of the guests contacted reported having come down with legionnaires' disease, or having developed any symptoms of it, he said.

The other buildings in the group of towers with initial positive tests were Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, Concourse Plaza shopping mall, a Verizon office building and Streamline Plastics Company. Over the last few days, several more towers have tested positive for legionella, but city officials said they did not believe those sites were responsible for the outbreak.

On Monday [10 Aug 2015], city officials held a public briefing at which they announced the death toll had increased to 12 and detailed their continuing effort to address the outbreak. But Mr. de Blasio found himself once again at odds with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, who held his own briefing. The governor has faulted the city's handling of the outbreak and has directed his health agency to take a more active role.

In an interview, city health officials said the 2 clusters of 3 patients each, at the hotel and in a nearby building, were significant because a vast majority of those with the disease did not share a common address. The only other cluster that had been identified was farther north and consisted of 2 people.

City health officials have said they are awaiting test [genotyping ?] results that may be able to match the specific bacteria in each tower to individual patients who contracted the disease.

Last week, city officials ordered every building with a cooling tower to inspect and disinfect it within two weeks. Investigators with the State Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also stepped in to help test and collect water samples from Bronx cooling towers. Cooling towers are bulky structures that help control hot and cold air in buildings. Legionnaires' disease can be contracted when a person inhales contaminated mist from a cooling tower or another water source.

Even as the hotel became a focus of public attention, often serving as a backdrop for news reports on the outbreak, the hotel had repeatedly said that no guests or hotel workers contracted legionnaires' disease and that it immediately treated and disinfected its tower. But with confirmation that a cluster of cases has been directly linked to the hotel, it faces a fresh public-relations challenge.

In the block behind the Opera House Hotel, 3 residents of the Brook, an apartment building on East 148th Street, have contracted the disease, said Brenda Rosen, president and chief executive of Common Ground, a nonprofit organization that owns and operates the building, which houses low-income and formerly homeless people. Ms. Rosen added that none of the 3 residents had died. More than a week ago, city health officials held a meeting for the Brook's residents and staff, in which one person recalled that they described the hotel as a "hot spot" for the outbreak. Others said that health officials told them that a helicopter was used to survey cooling towers surrounded by a large number of cases, including the one at the Opera House Hotel.

The Opera House Hotel opened after a multimillion-dollar renovation of its building in a borough that has attracted a spate of development in recent years. It represented the first foray into the Bronx for the Empire Hotel Group, which has seven other hotels in Manhattan, including the Lucerne on the Upper West Side. The Opera House Hotel's website listed nightly rates from $149 to $209 through September.

The hotel hired the Metro Group to clean its cooling tower on 1 Aug [2015] after legionella bacteria were detected by city health officials. Rich Parker, the president of Metro Group, said that was the only time his company had been directed to clean the tower, though they had performed monthly checks of the chemicals used to help control biological growth in the tower since spring 2014. Those checks do not test for the presence of bacteria, he said.

Government and industry guidelines for preventing legionella bacteria recommend that cooling towers be cleaned regularly, typically twice a year. Mr Parker said his company, as a matter of policy, contacted its clients by phone and mail to recommend the cleaning. Mr Isaacs said the hotel's cooling tower had been cleaned by an in-house engineering department on a regular basis, based on industry practices and guidelines, since the hotel opened in 2013.

Even cooling towers that are cleaned can harbor legionella bacteria. The one at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center is cleaned and disinfected every six months, according to recommended guidelines, hospital officials said. Before its most recent cleaning on July 29 [2015], after testing positive for legionella bacteria, the tower had been cleaned in March [2015?].

The Opera House Hotel, which is on a busy commercial strip with housewares and furniture displayed on the sidewalk, has elicited mixed feelings from nearby residents since the outbreak.

An outbreak of legionnaires' disease in New York - largest in the city's history - has left at least 12 people dead and health officials scrambling to contain the deadly bacteria. More than 100 cases have been reported in the South Bronx, one of the city's poorest neighbourhoods. Officials have traced the legionella bacteria to cooling towers in more than a dozen buildings.

The elderly are especially at risk from this form of pneumonia. All but one of the 12 victims were older than 40 years old and all of them had underlying health problems.

Cleaning crews have been dispatched across the Bronx to kill the bacteria. The disease is not transmitted person to person. It is primarily spread via air conditioning and similar systems.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has been criticised over the city's response to the outbreak. "We are dealing with a new set of realities we have never experienced that we have never encountered before in this city,'' New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday [10 Aug 2015].

The disease has a 10-day incubation period, which has caused a lag in the reporting of cases. But Mr de Blasio and New York health officials believe that there has not been a new case since 3 August.

The response has been muddled by a lack of coordination between city and state health officials. On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mr de Blasio held duelling news conferences, at times offering conflicting information. The response to the outbreak is the latest in a series of incidents where the men - Democrats who claimed to be friends - have been at odds.

[The number of cases of legionnaires' disease and deaths continues to increase with now 113 cases and 12 deaths, even though the last of the 5 cooling towers suspected of being the source of this outbreak was remediated 9 days ago. However, even if all the sources have been eliminated, the number of legionnaires' disease cases could continue to rise over the next 5 days because the incubation period of legionnaires' disease is 2-14 days after exposure.

Legionellosis is commonly caused by inhalation of aerosols containing _Legionella pneumophila_. These aerosols are lightweight and remain suspended in air for prolonged periods of time to spread for considerable distances to involve people downwind from the contaminated source. The effect of wind direction and speed of contaminated plumes from cooling towers may influence the distribution of cases. A map of the South Bronx that shows the distribution of cases relative to the location of contaminated cooling towers can be found at [2] source URL http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/nyregion/death-toll-from-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-in-bronx-rises-to-12.html.

It is likely that the tests that city officials say they are awaiting to identify which of the cooling towers is responsible for the legionnaires' disease outbreak is genotyping strains isolated from patients and cooling towers. A match between the genotype of legionella strains isolated from a cooling tower and the genotype of strains isolated from any of the patients would identify that cooling tower as the source for those patients. - Mod.ML
