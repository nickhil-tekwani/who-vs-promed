Iowa reports 3 novel swine-origin H3N2 cases
--------------------------------------------
Health officials in Iowa announced today [Tue 22 Nov 2011] they have
identified novel swine influenza A/H3N2 infections in 3 children,
similar to cases that have been identified over the past months in a
handful of other states [see ProMED-mail archived postings below].

The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) said in a statement
[reproduced below] that routine surveillance turned up the novel virus
in Webster and Hamilton counties. The virus is a swine-origin
triple-recombinant H3N2 that includes the matrix gene from the 2009
H1N1 virus.

Though patients in other states had animal exposure or a contact who
had animal exposure, Iowa's recombinant H3N2 cases appear to have a
human-to-human spread component, according to the statement. The IDPH
said spread is so far limited, and no other cases have been identified
in the past week.

Symptoms are similar to seasonal flu and include fever, cough,
tiredness, body aches, and loss of appetite, according to the IDPH.
None of the patients were seriously ill, and all have recovered. Dr
Patricia Quinlisk, IDPH medical director, said in the statement that
the seasonal flu vaccine may offer some protection against the novel
strain, and she stressed the importance of personal protective
measures such as covering coughs and sneezes and staying home when
sick. Because the virus is unique, the IDPH said it is increasing
surveillance for it through clinics and emergency rooms.

The cases appear to push the nation's total to 10 triple-recombinant
H3N2 cases reported since September [2011]. On 4 Nov 2011 the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it confirmed the
6th and 7th cases, in patients in Maine and Indiana. Cases have also
been detected in Pennsylvania.

The CDC, however, has said that it doesn't expect the seasonal flu
vaccine to protect against the novel strain. However, according to the
CDC, swine-origin viruses have shown sensitivity to the antiviral
drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza), it said.

Flu activity in Iowa includes novel strain
------------------------------------------
Routine surveillance by the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH),
the State Hygienic Lab and other partners across the state indicate
that a novel strain of the influenza virus has been detected in 3
children in Webster and Hamilton Counties. This virus, an influenza
A/H3N2 recombinant [reassortant] virus, has also been detected in
other states in recent months. Symptoms are similar to the regular
seasonal flu and include fever, cough, tiredness, body aches, and loss
of appetite.

This influenza A/H3N2 virus contains components of human, avian, H1N1,
and swine influenza. All spread has been human to human, and spread
appears to be limited; no further cases have been identified in the
last week. None of the cases have had any animal exposure. Because the
virus is unique, IDPH has increased surveillance for this strain at
clinics and emergency rooms.

"It appears the seasonal influenza vaccine currently available may
offer some protection against this novel strain," said IDPH Medical
Director, Dr Patricia Quinlisk. "However, we continue to stress the
importance of personal protective actions. Remember the 3 Cs: Clean
you hands frequently; Cover your coughs and sneezes; and Contain germs
by staying home when ill."

No serious illness or death has been reported in connection with this
novel influenza A/H3N2 virus, and all cases have recovered.

[The cases in Iowa differ from the previous cases in other states in
that the infection has been transmitted from human to human. The
majority of cases of infection with this virus have been children. It
is unclear whether the 3 children, resident in the adjacent counties
of Webster and Hamilton, had direct personal contact. If these
children had been vaccinated with the current seasonal influenza
vaccine, it is unlikely that that this vaccine would be generally
protective against this viral infection, contrary to the IDPH
statement.
