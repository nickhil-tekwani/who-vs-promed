US moves to clear way for live Canadian cattle: proposed rules give
ranchers hope
-----------------------------------------------
Canadian ranchers let out a collective sigh of relief Friday as the United
States made a long-awaited move to open its border to live cattle imports
as early as January 2004. The US Department of Agriculture took its first
step toward restarting the livestock trade by publishing proposed
regulations to admit young Canadian cattle, which have been banned since a
case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) surfaced in Alberta on 20
May 2003.
Cattle producers welcomed the news, but cautioned that the industry is
still months, or even years, away from a full recovery. Resuming the live
animal trade is seen as critical to the health of the cattle industry,
since livestock exports to the US comprise nearly half of Canada's $4
billion international beef sales.
The US was the first of 34 countries to ban Canadian cattle imports after a
northern Alberta cow was diagnosed with BSE. The border closures cost
Canada about $1.5 billion in lost exports. An investigation into the case
found no other instances of BSE and US officials announced in August 2003
that they would resume imports of boneless meat cuts from animals younger
than 30 months, which are at low risk of developing BSE. On Friday, the US
released regulations to readmit young cattle, arguing Canada is a country
that "presents a minimal risk of introducing BSE into the United States."
The proposal, which would allow Canada to resume about 80 per cent of its
live cattle exports, must undergo a 60 day public comment period before it
can come into effect. The regulation also suggests allowing beef imports
previously banned, including young cattle carcasses, liver, and tongues.
"We are satisfied this was an isolated case ... and measures in place are
more than adequate to prevent the spread of this disease," said Bill Hawks,
USDA undersecretary, in Washington.
Canadian beef industry officials said that Friday's announcement means the
livestock trade will probably resume in February or March 2004, even though
it could technically begin as early as January. The decision should help
alleviate a serious backlog of live animals that has accumulated as a
result of the border ban, said Canadian cattle groups. They also speculated
cattle prices would rise at auctions around Canada.
"It will free up some of our packing capacity," said Neil Jahnke, president
of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association. "It's just going to make a
tremendous difference. It'll be day and night." But Jahnke and other
officials said the ongoing US ban on older animals will still make life
difficult for ranchers, whose herds have lost as much as 75 per cent of
value during the crisis, which has lasted over 5 months. Older cows, for
example, are selling for only $200 each, down from $800 before 20 May 2003.
The ban will also be difficult for the purebred cattle industry, which
won't be able to export older bulls and cows to the US for breeding. Ottawa
and the provinces are expected to announce an aid package next week, worth
about $200 million, to help ranchers feed older cattle. American cattle
associations and the US public will be able to comment on the USDA's
proposed regulations until 4 Jan.
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said Friday he didn't expect a lot of
opposition to the proposal, aside from a handful of hardline cattle groups.
Beef prices have soared in the US since the border closure. "Overall, the
beef producers in the US, the politicians in the US, are very supportive of
having Canadian (cattle) move once again to the US because they understand
the industries are fully integrated," said Klein.
The US is the first country to open its border to live animals from Canada.
Several other countries have also lifted their bans on Canadian beef
products, including Mexico, Canada's second-largest beef export market.
