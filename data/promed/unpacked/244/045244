The number of cases of Ross River virus has increased in Australia.
The highest number of cases of this mosquito borne [virus] disease has
been reported from the South West, the Peel region. More than 150
cases of the virus have been confirmed from Perth metropolitan area.

The health department says that high tides have resulted in an
increase in the number of salt marsh mosquitoes which carry Ross River
virus. It has warned the residents and holidaymakers to protect
themselves against the disease [by avoiding mosquito bites].

From every region of the country, an increase in the number of cases
has been seen. The number of cases has almost doubled in Western
Australia as compared to the cases reported last year [2010]. Nearly
408 cases have been reported from this state in the past 7 months.
More than 160 cases were confirmed from the South West, which shows
that the figure has increased by 82 as compared to last year [2010].

The symptoms of Ross River virus include painful or swollen joints,
sore muscles, rashes, fever, fatigue and headaches.

[The 4 prior ProMED-mail reports of Ross River virus circulation this
year (2011) have come from South Australia and Victoria states. The
above report is the 1st from Western Australia in 2011. It appears
that the unusually wet weather is having the effects predicted by
Australian health authorities and medical entomologists, with
increased vector mosquito populations and enhanced circulation of Ross
River virus.

It will be of interest to see what happens with Murray Valley
encephalitis (MVE) and Barmah Forest virus transmission. MVE virus
transmission has been reported in sentinel chickens in Victoria state
in February of this year (2011) (see ProMED-mail archive number
20110223.0595). The most recent human cases of Murray Valley
encephalitis (MVE) in humans in Australia have occurred in the Western
state and Northern Territories in 2009.
