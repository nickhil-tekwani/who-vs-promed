China has stopped importing cloven-hoofed animals from Brazil, where there
has been an outbreak of foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease since last January.
China suspended imports of pigs, cows, goats and related products from
Brazil as of February 23, according to Import and Export Commodity
Inspection Administration, which said all cloven-hoofed animals will be
confiscated and destroyed.
Those [animals brought by ship, aircraft, or train from Brazil that will
stay for a period of time in China will be quarantined.
Sheep, goats, and cattle with the disease often show symptoms in the mouth
and on hooves, where blisters and ulcers appear and their horns will split
after the disease develops.
Foot-and-mouth disease affects human beings only if they have an open sore
or wound and come in direct contact with the infected animal. The disease
can also contaminate milk and meat products.

[Vaccines are available, so this appears to be more of an economic trade
barrier than a true agricultural concern. Furthermore, if the animals are
going to be quarantined, why not vaccinate them? The article is a little
confusing since one paragraphs states the animals will be confiscated and
destroyed and the next states they will be quarantined. Although infections
in humans have been reported, I can find no record of laboratory
confirmation of the disease in humans. - Mod.TG
