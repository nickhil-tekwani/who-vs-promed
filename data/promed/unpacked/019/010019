Minister of Agriculture Ignaty Arakelyan assures that there is no FMD in the Lori region. Speaking to reporters after the government session, Arakelyan mentioned that at present the State Service for Food Safety [SFS] and the Ministry of Agriculture are analyzing the situation on the spot and conduct sampling. To the observation, if there is no sampling, on what basis the agency claims that there is no FMD, the minister replied: "Primary research has shown that it is not a heifer."

He also assured that there were no cattle degradation. "There are signs of illness, and it's not clear whether it is a heifer or not, and there is no issue of quarantine, because the situation is not epidemic," said the Minister of Agriculture.

Referring to the question of how control will be exercised for the sale of meat of infected animals, Arakelyan said that these animals were vaccinated, and now it is necessary to study what is the problem. According to the minister, when the answer becomes available, the SFS will make a statement.

[The situation remains hazy; previous vaccination does not exclude FMD, for example, by a heterologous serotype. The final statement of Armenia's SFS on the event is anticipated with interest.
