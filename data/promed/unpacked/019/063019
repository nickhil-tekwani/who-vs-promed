Meningococcal disease outbreak in China
--------------------------------------
The Deputy Bureau Chief of Anhui Province announced on 29 Jan 2005 a
serious outbreak of meningococcal meningitis affecting at least 5
counties/cities of the Province: Wuhu, Chuzhou, Anqing, Chaohu, and Hefei.
The disease appeared to be spreading to other parts of the Province. The
Provincial epidemiology figures include reports of 61 cases of
meningococcal disease from 30 Dec 2004 to 28 Jan 2005,. The majority (77
percent) of patients were primary or secondary school children, with ages
ranging from 13 to 18 years.
Anhui has seen the circulation of meningococcus type A in the past. In Sep
2003, type C meningococcal disease was first found in Qinyang County. This
reached epidemic proportions recently. 8 patients have died, and 49 have
recovered.
The National Ministry of Health issued an announcement on 31 Jan 2005 that
there had been 546 reported cases of type C meningococcal disease since Nov
2004 nationwide. The monthly figure for Dec 2004 was 215, twice the Nov
2004 number; in January 2005 258 cases were reported.
Because a period of massive movement of people returning home for Chinese
New Year holidays is approaching, the authorities warned that the disease
might spread with the crowded conditions of trains and other transport
services. 24 provinces out of 31 cities/provinces are affected by the
disease; the most serious are Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Xichuan
provinces. The provinces that reported zero figures are Tibet, Hainan, and
Fujian, The cities not affected are Zhongqin, Shanghai, Beijing and Tienjing.
