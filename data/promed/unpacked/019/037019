Singapore man dies in rare cholera outbreak
---------------------------------------
A rare outbreak of cholera in Singapore has killed an 89-year-old man,
among 9 people infected, and authorities are trying to trace the source of
the disease, the government said on Mon 18 Oct 2004. Singapore last saw an
outbreak of cholera, an acute disease caused by consuming contaminated food
or water, in 1999. No one died in that outbreak.
The elderly man was the 9th person hospitalized, after the cluster of
cholera cases was found in the eastern part of the wealthy island. 3 people
are still in the hospital.
Investigations have found that most of those infected visited food stalls
and restaurants in a single area, and food samples from the outlets have
been sent for laboratory tests. The Ministry of Health said 201 food
handlers, and 39 people connected to the patients, have been screened.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding this outbreak. There have
been imported cases of _V. cholerae_ infection in 2000 and 2002. The 1999
Singapore outbreak affected at least 8 individuals at a wedding reception
and was related to a banana flavored drink in which contaminated ice was
used. In 1993, 12 persons were infected with cholera after eating
inadequately cooked mussels harvested near a sewage discharge site. - Mod.LL]
