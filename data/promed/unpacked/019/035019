[All of these pathogens directly affect crop yield and quality. _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ is a major pathogen of potato. _Erwinia amylovora_ causes
fire blight in many fruit trees and woody ornamentals. _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ causes bacterial canker, primarily in
tomato. The 2 nematode pathogens cause serious crop losses in potato. - Mod.DH]
