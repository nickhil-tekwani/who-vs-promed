The remediation of the building where a Strafford County woman was
exposed to anthrax spores will be costly. The Waysmeet Center, which
serves as the United Campus Ministry for UNH [University of new
Hampshire], is on the verge of signing a USD 70 000 remediation
contract with CYN Environmental Services of Stoughton, Massachusetts,
said the Rev. Larry Brickner-Wood, the ministry's chaplain and
executive director.

The remediation will include soaking, with a bleach-like solution, 5
common-area rooms and a hallway that tested positive for low levels
of anthrax. In addition to the remediation cost, many items will be
lost in the process, including art, furniture, books, a piano, and
other musical instruments.

Brickner-Wood estimated the loss of those items at about USD 10
000-USD 15 000. "The art work will be the toughest to lose," he said.
"It's original art from students and artists, and many are dear
students to us and talented artists." He said the piano also would be
tough to lose. It was donated 5 years ago and before then, the
ministry had worked for more than 6 years to secure one.

The ministry also has a USD 20 000 bill hanging over its head for the
1st round of testing in the building in December [2009].

Despite the cost, Brickner-Wood said the ministry is upbeat as the
woman who contracted gastrointestinal anthrax there continues to
improve. He said the 8 students who live in the building and the many
students who use it also are looking forward to its reopening. "The
things we're losing are just things," he said. "People will donate
furniture, and they'll donate other things. The important thing is
being back inside the building."

Brickner-Wood said the remediation should take 2 weeks, and barring
any unforeseen circumstances, the ministry could be reopened by the
end of the month [March 2010]. The type of building cleaning planned
for the center also was done after similar anthrax cases in
Connecticut and New York.

State officials have said the woman likely contracted the
gastrointestinal anthrax by swallowing anthrax spores from an African
drum during a [4 Dec 2009] drum circle event at the center.

[As this young lady that was affected was just one of a significant
number exposed over a number of hours, and then orally and not
pneumonically, and the extent of the contamination is limited in
space and extent, one must wonder a bit at the cost. They are merely
swabbing down the 5 rooms and a hallway. The prior contamination
levels have been defined already so all that will be needed is a
post-swabbing confirmation sampling that it has been successful. I
would have thought that disinfection swabbing with a damp sponge
would be adequate for the artwork, furniture, books, piano, and other
musical instruments -- maybe toss the books. But what do I know? I am
just an epidemiologist. However there were problems when
decontaminating the Connecticut and New York sites, which were
heavily contaminated.

The Connecticut home and barn were severely contaminated and had to
be fumigated. There were cleansing problems (see ProMED-mail archive
no. 20070928.3216). In the New York incident laboratory tests
confirmed the presence of anthrax spores in the man's apartment in
Greenwich Village, his work studio in the Brooklyn warehouse, and in
a Dodge van he is thought to have used to transport the skins.
Officials struggled with how to decontaminate the 2 buildings, and
the local community complained at the delays (see ProMED-mail archive
no. 20060301.0660.
