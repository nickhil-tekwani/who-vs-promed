"ProMED-mail would appreciate information about the microbiological
characterization of the strain(s) responsible for this outbreak. - Mod.ES"
In addition to microbiological characterization, it would be useful to
better understand how it is that _S. sonnei_ remains while _S. dysenteriae_
and _S. flexneri_ have predominantly disappeared in the western world.
Investigation, epidemiologically and microbiologically together, may help
to reveal mode of spread in association with measurement of an infectious
dose and retention of infectiousness in the environment, and make clearer
how come _S. sonnei_ remains a problem while other _Shigella_ have dwindled.
