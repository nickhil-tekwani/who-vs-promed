[Bauchi state has been recognized this year (2018) as one of the 18 states in which Lassa fever has been occurring. The number of cases in Bauchi state is increasing. As noted previously, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Preventing Lassa virus transmission requires getting local people to understand that virus spread to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta; and this can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control and prevention of contact with rodent excreta has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed, and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients and is most effective if patients are treated early in the course of infection.

Images of the mastomys mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.
