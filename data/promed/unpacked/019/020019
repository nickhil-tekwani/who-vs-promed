Isolation and identification of the causal agent of brown stalk rot,
a new disease of maize in South Africa
--------------------------------------------------------------------
During 2004 to 2005, an unreported disease of maize (_Zea mays_) was
observed on commercial fields in the Northwest and Mpumalanga
Provinces of South Africa. Infected plants were stunted, with a
vertical crack at the 1st internode. Inside the stem, a dark-brown,
narrow lesion was present along the crack. Internal browning inside
the stem extended upward, reaching the top internode in some plants.
Seed cobs were underdeveloped. Diseased plants were scattered in the
fields and 10 to 70 percent of the crop was affected.
Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria were consistently
isolated from diseased tissues. Pathogenicity tests established that
representative strains induced disease symptoms similar to those
observed on maize plants in the field. Physiological and biochemical
characterization using the API 20E and API 50CHE systems and 16S rRNA
gene sequence analyses showed that the strains belonged to the genus
_Pantoea_.
The results of these tests also separated the strains into 2 groups.
The 1st group, giving a positive reaction in the indole test, was
similar to _P. ananatis_. The 2nd group of strains was indole
negative and resembled _P. agglomerans_. The fluorescent amplified
fragment length polymorphism (F-AFLP) genomic fingerprints generated
by the indole-positive strains and _P. ananatis_ reference strains
were similar and clustered together in the dendrogram, confirming
that the indole-positive bacteria causing brown stalk rot on maize
were _P. ananatis_. The F-AFLP fingerprints produced by the
indole-negative strains were distinctly different from those
generated by _P. ananatis_, _P. agglomerans_, _P. dispersa_, _P.
citrea_, _P. stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_, and _P. stewartii_ subsp.
_indologenes_. The results indicated that indole-negative bacteria
causing brown stalk rot on maize might belong to a previously
undescribed species of the genus _Pantoea_.
This is the 1st report of a new disease on maize, brown stalk rot,
caused by 2 bacterial species, _P. ananatis_ and an undescribed _Pantoea_ sp.

[In addition to the above, the authors also report (see link below):
"In spray inoculations, all strains caused chlorotic, slightly rotten
lesions on maize leaves. When bacterial suspension was injected into
the 2nd stem node, discoloration of the stalk at the node was
observed 3-4 weeks after inoculation. The rot spread upwards, causing
browning of vascular tissues and rot of the leaf sheaths. Inoculated
plants produced seed from which _P. ananatis_ was isolated. This is
the 1st report worldwide of bacterial stalk rot of maize caused by
_P. ananatis_, and transmission of this pathogen in maize seed." Thus
Koch's postulate has been satisfied which requires that to prove a
pathogen to be the cause of a disease it needs to be isolated,
cultured and the host re-inoculated resulting in the same symptoms.
Species of the genus _Pantoea_ cause a variety of diseases on a range
of crops. For example, _P. citrea_ is the causal agent of Pink
disease of pineapple; Center rot of onion is caused by _P. ananatis_;
_P. stewartii_ causes Stewart's bacterial wilt on maize, an important
insect-borne disease in parts of the USA and Europe. A bacterial
blight of _Eucalyptus_ and a leaf blotch disease of sudangrass have
also been associated with _Pantoea_ spp. The genus belongs to the
family of _Enterobacteriaceae_ which also comprises genera pathogenic
to humans or animals, but the majority of _Pantoea_ spp. are plant-associated.
There are 3 important findings in this work: 1st report of Brown
stalk rot, a new disease of maize; 1st report of a new as yet
unclassified species of _Pantoea_; 1st report of seed-transmission of
_P. ananatis_ in maize.
