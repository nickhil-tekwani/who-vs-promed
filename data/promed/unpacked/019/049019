[This is the 1st time that BTV is reported in Georgia. Although the serotype was not identified in the report, given the occurrence of BTV-4 in the area, there is a good likelihood that it could be that serotype. Hopefully any follow-up reports by Georgia will include the serotype.

A 1st outbreak of BTV in a country like Georgia, where temperatures in January are rather low (Tbilisi, max temp 6 deg C/42.8 deg F; see http://www.georgia.climatemps.com), is rather surprising. In such BTV-virgin country, adult sheep are expected to be highly susceptible; according to the report, the disease reported in Tbilisi is limited to juveniles.

The differential diagnosis of bluetongue in sheep includes several diseases, among which contagious ecthyma (orf), in most cases limited to juveniles, is ranked high.

Confirmation of the diagnosis from a reference laboratory, including serotyping, is desirable. - Mods.AS/CRD
