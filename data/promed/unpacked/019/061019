The Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases and the US Centers for
Disease Control will jointly investigate the new strain of influenza.
Also, Dr. Alan Hay, Director of the WHO influenza monitoring center at the
National Research Institute of Medical Research, UK, said, "There is now some
evidence that ducks and chickens were present at the boy's kindergarten. It
is looking as though there may have been a direct transmission from animals
to the boy."

[So, we have squirrel brains responsible for CJD in the US, antibiotic-
resistant bacteria causing otitis media, and chicks and ducks passing
influenza. Where is Koch when we need him? We post these messages because
they are sent to us and they seem reasonable (we do not post those that seem
unreasonable) but the fact that they are posted should not be taken to
indicate that they are correct or meaningful, although they may very well be
both. The reader must be wary. -- Mod CHC]
