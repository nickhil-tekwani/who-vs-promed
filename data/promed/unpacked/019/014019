[1] Negros Occidental: 8 fatal cases

The Provincial Veterinary Office (PVO) of Negros Occidental has declared a rabies outbreak in 2 towns and 3 cities in the province, including Bacolod. Dr. Renante Decena, provincial veterinarian, said the 2 other cities are Cadiz and San Carlos, while the 2 municipalities are Binalbagan and Pulupandan.

Records of the PVO showed there are 8 cases of deaths caused by bites of dogs in Negros Occidental. The cases include 4 in Bacolod, 2 in Binalbagan; and one each in Pulupundan, San Carlos City and Cadiz City [By my count that is 9 human cases. - Mod.MHJ]. Decena earlier said that a [single] positive case of rabies can already be considered an outbreak.

The PVO chief said he will meet with all the city and municipal veterinarians in the province to discuss an effective means of controlling the increase of rabies cases. He also appealed to dog owners to be responsible for their pets. "If an individual wants to own a dog, he should regularly feed it and put it in a cage so that it will not get away and bite someone or be bitten by a rabid dog," Decena said. He added that dog owners should also be registered with the village to avail themselves of free vaccinations.

Decena said the Provincial Government does not have enough vaccines for the dog population in the province. Of the 219 000 dogs in Negros Occidental, only 24 000 are vaccinated.

The Department of Health (DOH) said that rabies is one of the most acutely fatal infections and is responsible for the deaths of 200 to 300 Filipinos annually.

[Logically, given the shortage of canine vaccine, it would be wise to initially target the dogs in the 2 municipalities and 3 cities. As additional funds and vaccine become available, the campaign could be widened. - Mod.MHJ]

[2] Canine vaccination plans

The Philippines plans to vaccinate 7 million dogs within 2 years to end its status as one of the world's most rabies-prone nations, the health department said Mon 10 Mar 2014. By making at least 70 percent of the country's 10 million dogs resistant to the rabies virus, the department hopes to remove the disease as a cause of human death by 2016, 4 years earlier than originally targeted, health officials said. "The focus will be on vaccinating as many dogs as possible," Raffy Daray, manager of the department's rabies control program, told AFP.

The disease is transmitted largely by animal bites, and has claimed well over 200 lives annually in the Philippines in recent years, according to World Health Organization and Philippine health department data. This makes the Philippines among the top 10 countries in the world in terms of rabies prevalence, according to the WHO. The WHO says rabies remains a "high risk" to humans across most of Asia and Africa.

Health undersecretary Teodoro Herbosa told AFP immunizing a dog costs only about 20 pesos (45 US cents) if the medicine is purchased in bulk. By contrast, treatment for an infected person could cost 5000 pesos [about USD 113], he added. Herbosa said that it was impossible to eradicate rabies completely, since it still occurs among wild animals.
