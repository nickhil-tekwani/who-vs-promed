Sweet chestnut blight warning
-----------------------------
Plant health authorities are urging to be vigilant for sweet chestnut blight. The request follows laboratory confirmation of the disease on [19 Dec 2016] at 2 sites in Devon. One of the sites is in woodland. The disease was also found in September [2016] in Kent.

Andy Hall, Forestry Commission England, said: "The Chief Plant Health Officer moved quickly to implement our contingency plan. We have surveyed sweet chestnut trees within 1 km [0.6 mi] of the affected trees and found no further signs of it. We are now carrying out a targeted survey within 5 km [3.1 mi]. We are also tracing and inspecting sweet chestnuts at other sites supplied by the nursery which supplied plants to the affected woodland."

Plant health notices are being issued to prohibit the movement of sweet chestnut and oak material within the 5 km [3.1 mi] area until further notice. Although oak trees suffer only superficial damage by the fungus, they can spread it. Hall appealed to tree and woodland owners to report any suspicious symptoms.

[Chestnut blight is caused by the fungus _Cryphonectria parasitica_. It affects chestnut (_Castanea_ spp.) and some other tree genera (for example oaks, maples, and eucalypts), but not horse chestnut (_Aesculus_ spp.). Susceptibility varies between species. Most susceptible are the European chestnut (_C. sativa_), which is most often used for commercial chestnut crops, and the American chestnut (_C. dentata_). In the late 1800s, the disease spread from the Far East, where native species show very low susceptibility, to North America, where it caused massive extinctions. In the 1930s, it spread to Europe and more recently it was also detected in Australia (ProMED-mail post 20100915.3350).

Virulent and hypovirulent forms of the pathogen exist. Virulent strains induce variable symptoms, which may include necrosis and cracking of the bark (cankers), orange to beige fungal growth, distortion of bark due to the destruction of the underlying tissues, yellowing of leaves, wilting of shoots, and dieback of branches. Symptoms progress quickly and death of the tree occurs due to girdling by cankers. Hypovirulent strains cause mild and/or transient symptoms which do not normally kill the host. The fungus enters through wounds and survives as a non-lethal parasite on a number of tree species. It is spread mainly by infected plant and other materials, mechanical means (including insect activity, cutting tools and machinery, birds over long distances), wind, and splashing rain.

Hypovirulence is due to infection of the fungus by _Cryphonectria hypovirus 1-EP713_ (CHV1-EP713; type species of genus _Hypovirus_). The virus can be transmitted through hyphal anastomosis converting the recipient fungal strain to the hypovirulent phenotype. However, transmission is limited by a vegetative incompatibility system in the fungus. In continental Europe, the disease has lost its severity due to the natural spread of the hypovirus, which has enabled re-growth of chestnuts in many affected regions. Hypovirulence provides the basis for disease management, and research is in progress on virus diversity, dispersal and the establishment of hypovirulence.

In the UK, chestnut blight was detected for the 1st time in 2012, apparently introduced from France with legal plant imports (ProMED-mail post 20120322.1077286). National plant quarantine guidelines and procedures were reassessed, with the result that subsequent outbreaks, like the ones reported here, appear to have remained largely localised.
