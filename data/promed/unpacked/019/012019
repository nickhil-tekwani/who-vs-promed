Deadly Botulism Outbreak Confirmed in Florida
---------------------------------------------
The tragic thing about equine botulism is horses might die from it before it's ever diagnosed -- or, in areas where it's uncommon, even seriously suspected. That's the case with a Florida outbreak which began earlier this month [February 2022].

In this outbreak, veterinarians initially suspected horses found dead in their pastures had ingested a toxic plant or an incorrectly formulated feed. But when horses were admitted at the University of Florida (UF) with signs of weakness, poor tongue tone, and muscle tremors, botulism immediately became the top differential.

Botulism is caused by toxins produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism Type B, associated with hay having been allowed to reach the wrong pH or contains excessive moisture, is more commonly found in the Northeast and Kentucky. (Type A usually occurs in the West and is associated with feeding grass clippings, whereas Type C typically happens when horses eat hay contaminated with a dead animal.)

Although the vaccine used to prevent botulism is only effective against Type B, the antitoxin -- a plasma product veterinarians administer to treat botulism -- works on all 3 types. "We administer the antitoxin to horses with clinical signs of botulism or known exposure to a source and know they're covered for all 3 types of botulinum toxins regardless of whether we have confirmed the diagnosis yet," said Sally DeNotta, DVM, PhD, Dipl. ACVIM, an assistant professor of large internal medicine at UF's College of Veterinary Medicine, and the state's equine extension veterinarian. Botulism is diagnosed in most horses on clinical signs alone; _C. botulinum_ toxin identification tests, which will help the veterinarians know exactly what type (A, B, or C) each horse has, are pending at the national laboratory for some of the affected horses.

How does the antitoxin work?
----------------------------
Under certain conditions _C. botulinum_ bacteria produce the neurotoxins, which enter the horse's bloodstream and block neuromuscular junctions, preventing communication between neurons and muscles and eventually causing paralysis and death.

DeNotta said the antitoxin used to treat affected horses binds to and clears the _C. botulinum_ toxin from the bloodstream and prevents it from reaching the spinal cord and peripheral nerves: "One dose of antitoxin will circulate long enough to mitigate any free toxin but doesn't have any effect on toxin already bound to the neuromuscular junction. So, it's important to administer the antitoxin as early as possible, ideally before the horse becomes too weak to stand."

How can you protect your horses against botulism?
-------------------------------------------------
Inspect all hay before feeding. Never feed hay that looks moldy, and discard any bales found to contain rodents or other dead animals. Avoid feeding round bales, block or cubed hay, or silage to horses, because these types of forage are considered to put horses at high risk for botulism, DeNotta said.

Watch for signs. Horses might be lying down more than usual, which is particularly noticeable if more than one horse is involved; they might display muscle tremors, weakness resulting in inability to stand, loss of tongue control, inability to swallow leading to drooling and difficulty eating and drinking, a stiff, short stride or stumbling gait, and loss of tail tone.

When signs occur, act quickly. One boarding facility owner in Florida who feeds alfalfa blocks (compressed bales that are 500-1000 pounds [227-554 kg]) and experienced loss in this outbreak, said she talked with her veterinarian about possible causes after the 1st horse died, then 4 days later had the vet out after another horse died and a 3rd horse went down within hours. She pulled all the horses from a particular pasture, began feeding baled hay and trucked in city water for the horses. Within a week she had found an alternate facility, installed fencing, and moved the horses. Still, 6 horses were affected, 3 of which died, while others were treated at UF.

Ask your veterinarian if vaccination is right for your horse. If you live in a region where botulism is endemic, or if you feed hay types known to put horses at risk for botulism, preventive vaccination for Type B may be helpful. DeNotta warned, however, that vaccination is not likely to be helpful in an outbreak situation, and underscores it's not effective against Types A or C.

Should you have your hay tested for _C. botulinum_ toxin?
---------------------------------------------------------
In an outbreak situation it is natural to want to test hay for this deadly toxin to protect your horses from potential exposure. However, DeNotta said, "Unfortunately, because the toxin can be distributed very sporadically throughout only some bales within a batch of hay, or even in only certain areas within a single bale, there's really no way to take a single hay sample and accurately assess your horse's risk.

"We test feces, intestinal contents, and feed from horses we know are clinically affected to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of botulinum toxin involved, but there's no reasonable way to screen a batch of hay to know it's safe for your horses."

The safest feeding practice is to feed good-quality baled hay and avoid haylage, round bales, and other types of hay better off fed to livestock. "When you're feeding small bales, you can visually inspect each flake as you feed so if there's excessive moisture, weed contamination or mold, or if an animal was trapped in the baling process, you can discard the particular bale without feeding it," said DeNotta.

["Botulism is a rapidly fatal disease with motor paralysis. It is commonly caused by eating food contaminated with the toxin (a type of poison) produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. This organism grows rapidly in decomposing animal tissue and sometimes in plant material. It results in rapid death due to the paralysis of vital organs. Botulism is not usually an infection but a poisoning. The frequency of botulism in animals is not known with accuracy, but it is low in horses.

"There are 7 types of _C. botulinum_, differentiated by the antigenic specificity of the toxins: A, B, C1, D, E, F, and G. Types A, B, and E are most important in humans; C1 in most animal species, notably wild ducks, pheasants, chickens, mink, cattle, and horses; and D in cattle. In horses, the most common type in North America and Europe is type B (> 85% of US cases), and in the western US type A has been reported in only 2 outbreaks, both in humans, known to have been caused by type F. Type G, isolated from soil in Argentina, is not known to have been involved in any outbreak of botulism.

"There are 7 types of _Clostridium botulinum_ toxins; the C1 toxin is seen in most animal species, although type B is most common in North America and Europe. The usual source of the toxin is decaying carcasses or vegetable materials such as decaying grass, hay, grain, or spoiled silage. Toxins of all types have the same action.

"The signs of botulism are caused by muscle paralysis. They include paralysis becoming progressively more severe, disturbed vision, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, and overall weakness. Death is usually due to paralysis of the lungs or heart. Diagnosis of this condition is difficult, and it is often made by excluding any other possible causes of paralysis and by association with a likely source of the toxin.

"Botulism may also originate in 2 other ways. _Clostridium botulinum_ has occasionally been found to grow in the gastrointestinal tract and produce toxins there. When the toxins are released, they cause typical botulism. This occurs in foals usually less than 4 weeks old and results in the shaker foal syndrome. Foals may be found dead without previous signs, but most often, foals show signs of paralysis that slowly progresses. Stilted gait, muscle tremors, and the inability to stand for more than 4 to 5 minutes are key signs. Other signs include difficulty swallowing, constipation, dilated pupils, and frequent urination. As the disease progresses, labored breathing with extension of the head and neck, rapid heart rate, and respiratory arrest occur. Death occurs most often 1 to 3 days after signs are first noted. Botulinum antitoxin has been used for treatment, with varying success. Early administration to foals, before they can no longer stand, is reported to be successful. Full supportive care is also important. In endemic areas, such as Kentucky, vaccination with type B toxoid appears to be effective.

"A 3rd form of botulism occurs in humans -- and sometimes in adult horses -- when the bacterium grows and produces toxin in a wound. This is referred to as wound botulism.

"Botulinum antitoxin has been used for treatment with varying degrees of success, depending on the type of toxin involved and the species of host. Treatment involves hydration, correcting electrolyte disturbances, and general supportive measures. Treatment of ducks and mink with type C antitoxin is often successful; however, such treatment is rarely used in cattle. Early administration of antitoxin (type B) specific or polyvalent to foals before recumbency (30 000 IU, IV) is reported to be successful. Supportive care in valuable animals is essential; prognosis is poor in recumbent animals. In endemic areas (e.g., Kentucky), vaccination with type B toxoid appears to be effective."
