Having good graduate students with connections helps ... I spoke with Dr
Abdullahi Kalif, now in Minnesota, who then spoke with his close colleagues
in Somalia.
Dr Mohamed Yussuf, MD, in Hargeisa says that his British medical colleagues
have clinically diagnosed haemorrhagic RVF in patients in that northern
Somali city. Presumably samples have been taken for laboratory confirmation
but until then it is only a presumption. Similar cases are occurring
throughout the Ogaden.
Dr. Mohamoud Issa, MD, Kismayu, told Abdullahi that the haemorrhagic RVF is
widespread in the Lower and Middle Juba (valley) regions. At first they had
also thought it was anthrax because of the bleeding. The case fatality rate
has been high.
The rumours of RVF in Hargeisa appear to have substance but still await
confirmation.

According to reports gained by DPA in Mogadishu, there is an increase in
the number of deaths due to Rift Valley Fever, just as cholera deaths are
decreasing from 20 percent to 2 percent fatality.
During the past week: Lower Jubba region, including the towns of Dhobey,
Luq and Bulo Hawo: 105 deaths.
Local leaders are pleading for help from international aid agencies on the
RVF situation and credit outside agencies for the drop in the cholera deaths.
