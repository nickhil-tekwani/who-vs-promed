In an effort to prevent confusion, the Colorado Department of Agriculture is providing an update on 3 separate equine health concerns currently affecting horses in Colorado. There are confirmed cases of Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) [reported: 10 May 2017 Equine infectious anemia - USA (02): (CO) 20170510.5025267], Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalitis, and Strangles. [As no strangles case data is provided, this section has been edited out. To read it go to the link above. MHJ]

"The Colorado Department of Agriculture is working with the equine industry and veterinarians to contain the spread of these diseases. An important reminder is that owners should always practice proper disease prevention practices for their horses. Proper sanitation and biosecurity is often the 1st step in protecting your horse," said State Veterinarian, Dr Keith Roehr.

On [Thu 4 May 2017], the Colorado Department of Agriculture, State Veterinarian's Office, was notified by the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) that a Weld County horse tested positive for Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA). There are now 2 additional cases of EIA at the same location, these horses belong to the same owner. All 3 horses have been euthanized. The Weld County facility is currently under a quarantine order that restricts movement of horses until further testing is completed by CDA.

Equine Infectious Anemia is a viral disease spread by bloodsucking insects, inappropriate use of needles, or other equipment used between susceptible equine animals such as horses, mules and donkeys. Infected horses may not appear to have any clinical signs of the disease, although it can cause high fever, weakness, weight loss, an enlarged spleen, anemia, weak pulse and even death. There is no cure for the disease, so infected animals have to be quarantined for life or euthanized. EIA is not transmissible to people.

Equine Infectious Anemia is a disease for which horses must be tested annually before they can be transported across state lines. The test for EIA is commonly called a Coggins Test.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture is investigating a confirmed case of Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalitis, which is a form of Equine Herpes Virus (EHV-1), within the state; a Mesa County premise has been placed under quarantine. The horse is quarantined after showing neurological clinical signs associated with the disease and subsequently testing positive for EHV-1. Currently the horse is under private veterinary care and seems to be making a good recovery. The horse had been to events over the previous 2 weeks, and all of those events have been notified. Event organizers are communicating with participants to monitor their horses for signs of the disease, especially for fever (temperature over 101.5 degrees F).

EHV-1 is not transmissible to people; it can be a serious disease of horses that can cause respiratory, neurologic disease and death. The most common way for EHV-1 to spread is by direct horse-to-horse contact. The virus can also spread through the air, and indirectly through contaminated equipment, clothing and hands. Proper biosecurity practices are vital to preventing the spread of this virus.

Clinical signs include fever, decreased coordination, nasal discharge, urine dribbling, loss of tail tone, hind limb weakness, leaning against a wall or fence to maintain balance, lethargy, and the inability to rise. While there is no cure, the clinical signs of the disease may be treatable.
