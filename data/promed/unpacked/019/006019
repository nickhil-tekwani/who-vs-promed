UK, USA quarantine/travel restrictions for travellers
-----------------------------------------------------
England to quarantine all US arrivals: The USA will be placed on a "red list" of countries whose citizens will have to quarantine for 14 days. Britain will end coronavirus quarantines for people arriving in England from more than 50 countries, including Germany, France, Spain and Italy -- but not the USA.

USA: The USA issues guidelines but no new rules for air travel -- Federal agencies in the USA said airlines should consider limiting capacity on planes to promote social distancing but stopped short of requiring them to do so. In a new report, the Transportation, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services departments also recommended -- but did not move to require -- that travellers wear face coverings in airports and on planes. All leading US airlines now require passengers to wear masks, but regulators have refused a request by the airlines to make it a federal rule. The agencies said airlines and airports should take steps to increase social distancing, clean surfaces touched by passengers, give specialised training to airline crews, and provide more information to help with contact tracing if passengers test positive for the virus.

Latin America: Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Peru
-------------------------------------------------
Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina are the Latin American countries that earned the best grades for their response to the coronavirus, according to a poll conducted in the region, while Brazil was tagged as the worst performer.

The survey by the consulting firm Trespuntozero, to which Reuters had exclusive access, shows that in 8 of the 10 countries in which the study was conducted, the respondents considered Uruguay one of the best controllers of the pandemic. According to the poll, the performance of Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou against the pandemic had 77.8% approval in his own country; that of Paraguayan Mario Abdo, 76.7%; and that of Argentina's Alberto Fernandez, 68%.

Peru: Peru's COVID-19 death toll rose to 10 045 on Thursday [2 Jul 2020], the health ministry said, a day after the Latin American nation began easing a lockdown in a bid to revive the economy. The number of deaths rose by 185 in the past 24 hours, while the number of people infected rose to 292 004, the ministry said. Peru is Latin America's worst-hit country after Brazil.

Japan, Thailand: Impact of easing restrictions
----------------------------------------------
Japan: Japan will not reintroduce a state of emergency to tackle the novel coronavirus, a government spokesperson said, as cases in Tokyo rose to a 2-month high driven by the spread of the virus in the capital's night spots.

Tokyo reported 124 new cases on Friday [3 Jul 2020], up from 107 the day before, partly due to increased testing among nightlife workers in the Shinjuku and Ikebukuro districts.

Of all new infections confirmed in Tokyo in the week through Wednesday [1 Jul 2020], 44% were traced to establishments where "food and drinks are provided along with company," chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said -- an oblique reference to spots such as "host bars" where male hosts are paid to flirt with female patrons over drinks.

Thailand: Thai authorities are urging vigilance as the South East Asian nation celebrates its 1st long holiday weekend after lifting most restrictions imposed to fight the spread of the coronavirus. No new local infections have been reported in Thailand in more than a month.

The 4-day holiday starting Saturday [4 Jul 2020], incorporating 2 Buddhist holy days, is expected to see Thais return en masse from the cities where many work to their family homes in rural areas.

India, Israel: Countries with increasing case numbers
-----------------------------------------------------
India: India reported another single-day record for new virus cases on Friday [3 Jul 2020] -- 20 903. The figure took the national total to 625 544. The Ministry of Health also reported an additional 379 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking fatalities up to 18 213.

With the current rate of infections, India is expected to surpass Russia's 660 000 cases in coming days and become the third worst-hit country after the USA and Brazil.

Israel: The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel has breached the 1000 mark for the 1st time, according to figures published by the Health Ministry.

A record 1107 new cases were registered on Thursday [2 Jul 2020], the highest single-day caseload since the beginning of the pandemic. The previous record was registered Wednesday [1 Jul 2020] at 967. Overall, 27 542 individuals have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the country, with 9600 active cases and 325 deaths, according to the ministry.

Africa: Impact of coronavirus outbreak on Africa health workers
---------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) said more than 6000 health workers have been infected with the coronavirus in 38 countries across its Africa region since the pandemic began.

Hundreds of health workers have already been infected in the latest hotspot of South Africa's Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria. Across South Africa, more than 2000 health workers have been infected. In Nigeria, nearly 1000 have been sickened.

The WHO's 47-country Africa region has the most severe health workforce shortage in the world, and concerns about adequate personal protective gear against the coronavirus are widespread. Already a handful of countries have seen more than 10% of their health workers infected as of Tuesday [30 Jun 2020]: Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Niger, Mozambique and Burundi.

Drugs: Remdesivir 1st virus drug to receive EU approval
-------------------------------------------------------
The 1st drug to treat severe cases of COVID-19 in the European Union (EU) has been given the green light, with the European Commission approving remdesivir. "We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to secure efficient treatments or vaccine against the coronavirus," Stella Kyriakides, the EU's health commissioner, said in a statement.

It is the 1st time the EU's executive arm has granted the approval to a COVID-19 drug and was the last step for remdesivir to be given the full the go-ahead.

Dexamethasone: An initial purchase of the steroid dexamethasone, shown to be effective in treating severe or critical COVID-19 patients, will be made for up to 4.5 million people in low- and middle-income countries, agencies said.

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) is negotiating the advance purchase under the deal led by UNITAID and Wellcome, as part of the World Health Organization's plan to accelerate access to therapeutics, a joint statement said.

Researchers estimated that the drug would prevent one death for every 8 patients treated while on breathing machines and one for every 25 patients on extra oxygen alone.

Research: Short-term immunity postinfection
-------------------------------------------
Test monkeys infected with the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic were protected from reinfection for up to 28 days later, according to a Chinese study published in the journal Science.

Scientists from Peking Union Medical College infected 6 rhesus macaques in their trachea with a dose of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They developed mild to moderate symptoms and took about 2 weeks to recover.

Twenty-eight days after the 1st infection, 4 of the 6 monkeys received another dose of virus, but this time, despite a brief rise in temperature, they showed no sign of reinfection, the study authors wrote.

While the monkeys displayed initial immunity, it is not clear how long such immunity will last in humans -- it will be necessary to wait for months, or even years, to know if the millions of people infected at the start of the pandemic are protected from reinfection.

[Take away messages: Premature lifting of restrictions leads to resurgences of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Many of the population think that the lifting of restrictions means the virus is gone, so nonpharmaceutical measures such as face masks and social distancing are also unnecessary. However, the impending public pressure and economic crisis have led to many countries easing restrictions and opening air travel and land borders; some are testing monitored opening of schools; while others continue to impose restrictions in "hotspot" areas. Solution: Lift restrictions when criteria are met with regard to decreasing transmission in an area, and do so with increased risk communication to ensure the proper messages are consistently communicated. The new "normal" will take quite a bit of adjustments in the coming weeks to months. - Mod.UBA]

[The outbreak in Beijing continues with one newly confirmed case attributed to the outbreak. The 1st case in Beijing was reported on 11 Jun 2020; as of 3 Jul 2020, there have been 333 cases reported from Beijing, 21 in Hebei, and 3 in Liaoning, most likely associated with this outbreak.

There were 4 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and no new conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 33 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China.

Hong Kong reported 5 new cases. According to a press release, there are one male and 4 female cases aged between 3 and 49 years. They had travel history during the incubation period. The webpage mentions a total 1248 cases (1247 confirmed and one probable case; https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/03/P2020070300907.htm).

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing. Cases are still being confirmed in Beijing.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 63 cases with 1 new death, compared with 63 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (2 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 81 consecutive days. There were 36 locally transmitted cases: Gyeonggi (15), Gwangju (8), Seoul (6), Daejeon (3), Chungbuk (2), Gyeongbuk (1), and Daegu (1), and 27 imported cases: airport quarantine (18), Gyeonggi (4), Incheon (2), Busan (1), Seoul (1), and Gyeongnam (1). There were 7 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been steady at 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country. It would be nice to know the asymptomatic rate being detected, and the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected that go on to clinical disease.

Tabular and graphic analyses of the situation in South Korea with the addition of the 63 newly confirmed cases from 3 Jul 2020 are available at the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030), notices 412 and 413. There are analyses of the country-wide situation including the newly confirmed cases with listings of current ongoing clusters. Two of the clusters mentioned are related to religious gatherings, 1 related to an elementary school, 1 related to an office building, and 1 related to an apartment complex.

Importations (11) came from the Americas (6) and Asia excluding China (5 -- Pakistan 3, Kazakhstan 1, Russia 1).

Takeaway message: Importations continue to be a challenge, and gatherings whether social or religious are key foci for enlarging clusters (unchanged from the previous 3 day's message).

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +223 cases and +15 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (2 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +201 cases and +30 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in a slow decline. Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (115). Emilia-Romagna (27), Piedmont (16), Lazio (11) and Campania (10) are the 5 provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (3 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 59 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 43 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. There are subtle signs that cases are starting to increase, but time will tell. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

As many as 2566 people have been infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the past 24 hours in Iran, said Sima Sadat Lari, spokesperson for Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Trend reports citing the ministry. According to Sadat Lari, 154 people have died from the coronavirus over the past day. Sadat Lari added that the condition of 3123 people is critical.

So far, more than 1.74 million tests have been conducted in Iran for the diagnosis of coronavirus. Iran continues to monitor the coronavirus situation in the country. According to recent reports from the Iranian officials, more than 235 400 people have been infected and 11 260 people have already died. Meanwhile, over 196 400 have reportedly recovered from the disease.

The country continues to apply strict measures to contain the further spread. Reportedly, the disease was brought to Iran by a businessman from Iran's Qom city, who went on a business trip to China, despite official warnings. The man died later from the disease.

The Islamic Republic of Iran only announced its 1st infections and deaths from the coronavirus on 19 Feb 2020.

[As of 3 Jul 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 235 429, including 11 260 deaths, an increase of 2566 cases and 154 deaths since 2 Jul 2020. The numbers of daily reported cases and deaths are slowing increasing.

Takeaway message: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as is elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, many people think that lifting of restrictions means the virus has gone away and measures like mask wearing and social distancing are no longer necessary, leading to resurgences of increased transmission and the resultant increase in severe cases and deaths -- and the need to re-implement some forms of lockdown to flatten the curves again so the health systems aren't overwhelmed.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 890 588, including 132 101 deaths, an increase from 2 837 189 cases and 131 485 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 213 212 cases as of 13:30 EDT (GMT-4) on 3 Jul 2020 (+438 from 2 Jul 2020), including 18 535 confirmed deaths (+16 since 2 Jul 2020) and an additional 4605 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama and Louisiana. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1728 to 9488. Texas reported over 7000 cases while California reported over 4500 cases.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, Texas, Florida (Florida surpassed New Jersey in the past 24 hours), New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Arizona (Arizona surpassed Georgia in the past 24 hours), and Georgia. A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 2.0%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 38.0% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country picking up momentum.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay is 9% positive tests out of 36 255 888 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update (please note that there has been consistent weekend reporting artifact since the presentation of these data began):
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 76.7% of the global newly reported cases and 66.8% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 42.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 36.5%, Mexico 4.4%, Colombia 3.3%, Peru 2.5%, Ecuador 2.4%, Argentina 2.1%, and Chile 1.9%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2; while they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, this week the USA has dominated with the proportion represented by Brazil decreasing. Other countries are continuing to increase their proportional representation within the region such as Mexico and Colombia and periodically Peru and Chile.

The European region reported a readjustment of the case numbers by -5.9% while reporting 10.6% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. The readjustment is largely contributed by -29 726 cases adjusted for the UK. Russia reported the highest number of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan, Turkey, Israel, Sweden, Ukraine, Armenia, France, Romania and Germany (percentages not calculated due to negative adjustment). The proportion of cases represented by Russia continues to decrease. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine are prominent in countries noted to have resurgence in Europe.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 10.8% of the global newly reported cases and 10.1% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 21.5% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 17.8%, Iran 12.9%, Iraq 11.4%, Egypt 7.8%, Oman 7.2%, Kuwait 4.8% and Qatar 4.7%. Multiple countries are very active in the region -- same countries in the same order as yesterday (2 Jul 2020).

The African region reported 6.5% of the global newly reported cases and 2.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 76.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 5.5%, Algeria 3.4%, Kenya 2.4%, Cote d'Ivoire 1.7%, and Mauritania 1.2%. South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2, and other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day (Ghana and Cameroon reported 0 cases today). Of note is that South Africa is now reporting more than 8000 cases in a day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.47% of the global newly reported cases and 0.09% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 35.0% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 23.1%, Singapore 22.4%, Australia 9.6%, South Korea 7.5%, and China 1.7%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines is consistently reporting the highest number of cases while today (3 Jul 2020) Japan surpassed Singapore for the number 2 slot. Other countries, including South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South East Asia region reported 15.4% of the global newly reported cases and 9.3% of global deaths. India reported 77.3% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 14.8%, Indonesia 6.0%, and Nepal 1.7%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily case load of all of the regions. The Africa region is slowing increasing their representation in terms of increased case reporting.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 3 Jul 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above text. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]

[*On 2 Jul 2020, the Worldometer (and the Johns Hopkins CSSE data) showed a decrease in 29 726 cases for the UK. From https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/: "Pillar 2 data for England has had duplicate tests for the same person removed by PHE from 2 Jul 2020. This means that the cumulative total number of UK lab-confirmed cases is now around 30 000 lower than reported on 1 Jul 2020." - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ
**On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 11 190 678, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The total case numbers crossed the 11 million mark in the past 24 hours. The global case count rose by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.89 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.8% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil with more than 1.54 million cases represents 13.7% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, Russia, India, and Spain), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (53.9%). A global total of 529 113 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5077 deaths in the past 24 hours.

A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: Actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, Spain, Peru, the UK (with the negative adjustment, the UK was surpassed by Spain and Peru), Chile, Italy, and Mexico (Mexico surpassed Iran in the past 24 hours) at number 10. China remains at number 22. In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Russia, Mexico, Pakistan, Colombia, Bangladesh, and Peru. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases went from 223 to 54 904.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 7 from the Americas region, 3 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region -- unchanged for the past 3 days. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 8 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, 2 from the European region, 1 from the African region (an increase of 1 in the Americas region and a dropping off of the 1 in the Western Pacific region). This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.UBA]
