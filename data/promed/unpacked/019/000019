France Ex Burkina Faso. 15 Dec 2016. Identification of Dengue Type 2 Virus in febrile travellers returning from Burkina Faso To France, related to an ongoing outbreak, October To November 2016. Eldin et al. Eurosurveillance, Volume 21, Issue 50.
Abstract: Dengue fever is rarely reported in travellers returning from Africa. We report 2 cases of dengue fever in travellers returning from Burkina Faso to France. One of them presented a severe dengue fever with ALT more than 1000 IU/L and pericarditis. Serotype 2 was identified. The cases reflect a large ongoing outbreak with over 1000 reported cases between August and November [2016] in the capital city. Clinicians should consider dengue fever in malaria-negative febrile travellers returning from Africa.
