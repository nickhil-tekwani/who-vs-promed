CAT & DOG DISEASES ON RABIES-FREE ISLANDS: REQUEST FOR INFO
***********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Malcolm Bennett <m.bennett@liverpool.ac.uk>

We would be grateful for any help ProMED-mail subscribers could give us
with obtaining information on infectious/parasitic diseases of cats and
dogs on rabies-free islands.
As you will know from previous ProMED-mail postings, the UK Government
sponsored an inquiry into changing the quarantine regulations for dogs and
cats entering the UK. One recommendation of the resulting report is that
cats and dogs from 'rabies free islands' might be allowed into the UK with
vaccination only, but the group also said that the Minister and Ministry of
Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF) should undertake further research
into the risk of other 'exotic' diseases being introduced were this
recommendation to be implemented.
We have agreed to help MAFF to put together a list of of
infectious/parasitic diseases of cats and dogs exotic to Great Britain, but
found on a (draft) list of qualifying islands around the world, and a brief
discussion of the potential for their establishment in the UK were they to
be introduced - all by the end of January 1999(!). A list of qualifying
islands is included in this email, and more details of our agreed plan is
on the web through the CCID homepage given below.
We would be very grateful for either known lists of candidate agents and
diseases, or suggestions of who (especially if they are on email) to
contact to get such information. We would also be interested in any
comments you might have on the list of qualifying islands. Please reply
directly to me (Malcolm Bennett; e-mail: m.bennett@liverpool.ac.uk), and I
will put together a summary e-mail to ProMED-mail, along with regularly
updated documents, based on your replies, on the web for further discussion.
We have (of course!) asked MAFF to pay us for this, so we have included in
our costings a small donation to ProMED-mail. There may also be some
(very) small honoraria for people who come up with especially useful
information.
The draft list of qualifying islands supplied by MAFF is: Antigua and
Barbuda, Australia, Bahrain, Barbados, Cape Verde, Cook Islands, Falkland
Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Hawaii, Jamaica, Japan, Malta, Mauritius,
New Caledonia, New Zealand, Reunion, Seychelles, Singapore, St Kitts and
Nevis, St Lucia, Taipei (China), Vanuatu.
Thanks in advance for all your help!
PLEASE RESPOND DIRECTLY TO MALCOLM BENNETT <m.bennett@liverpool.ac.uk>
PLEASE DO NOT SEND INFORMATION TO PROMED-MAIL. THANK YOU. [DP]
