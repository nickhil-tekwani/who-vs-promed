A patient infected with the Lassa fever virus has been admitted to the special isolation unit of the Frankfurt University Hospital. The individual works at a funeral home in Alzey (Rheinland-Pfalz). He had contact with the body of an individual who died in the Cologne University Hospital at the end of February 2016. The deceased had been in contact with Lassa patients in Togo according to the county government Alzey-Worms.

After the Lassa virus was detected in the blood of the funeral employee, he was admitted to the Frankfurt University Hospital immediately: "It would be the 1st case of Lassa virus infection acquired in German," [see comment below] said virologist Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg.

Lassa fever is known as one of the hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola and dengue haemorrhagic fevers. The pathogen can cause fever, headache, muscle pain, ecchymosis, and later, diarrhea and vomiting. In severe cases, it can lead to a state of shock, which can lead to organ failure.

According to the Robert Koch Institute, the infection is often mild or without symptoms. According to estimates, 100 000 to 300 000 people are infected each year with the virus, of which one or 2 percent die from the illness. There are no vaccinations to prevent the disease.

In Germany, 6 imported cases have been reported since 1974. The most recent was a US citizen who died on [26 Feb 2016] in Cologne, who had worked in Togo as a nurse. Only several days after his death was the Lassa virus infection detected.

The body of the American was brought on [3 Mar 2016] in a special container to Alzey, where it was to be prepared for further transport to Togo, said the county government of Alzey. Six days later, on [9 Mar 2016], the diagnosis of Lassa fever was made at the Cologne University Hospital.

Then, the employees were taken and tested for life-threatening diseases by the Frankfurt competence center. The 1st so-called zero-sample of [10 Mar 2016] showed no evidence of the virus. A 2nd specimen on Tue [15 Mar 2016] was positive for the Lassa fever virus.

The employees of the funeral home had only one contact with the dead body, according to the county government. By his own account, the infected mortician said that he did not come into contact with body fluids.

Although the man's family members did not show any symptoms, they were also hospitalized.

The Frankfurt University Hospital aims to report on Thursday [17 Mar 2016] in a press conference about the case.

[Reviewing the literature I found one report of probable local transmission of Lassa fever virus resulting from an importation of a case from West Africa to Germany in 2000. There was a physician who cared for the patient on day 9 of his illness who was asymptomatic but showed seroconversion for Lassa fever virus. (see Haas WH1, Breuer T, Pfaff G, Schmitz H, Köhler P, Asper M, Emmerich P, Drosten C, Gölnitz U, Fleischer K, Günther S. Imported Lassa Fever in Germany: Surveillance and Management of Contact Persons. Clin Infect Dis. 2003 May 15;36(10):1254-8. Epub 2003 May 9. available at: http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/10/1254.full.pdf ). We look forward to the official statement to be released tomorrow with more details.
