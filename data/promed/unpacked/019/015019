16 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been recorded in the
Rostov region since the beginning of 2005 [an increase of 3 cases since 7 Jul
2005 - Mod.CP]. One resident of the Peschaniocopskiy district of the region
has died from CCHF. The situation with regard to CCHF in other regions of the
Southern Federal District is even more serious: 38 cases of CCHF have been
recorded in the Stavropol region, 37 in the Astrakhan region and about 30 in
the Volgograd region.

Since 1999, when 26 persons were diagnosed with CCHF in Oblivskaya village,
and 6 persons died from this disease, there have been only 6 to 9 cases
recorded annually in the [Rostov] region [see refs. below]. Predominantly,
these cases have occurred in the southeastern districts of the region.

More than RUB 2.5 million [USD 872 000] have been allocated from the
regional budget for diagnostic procedures and for preventive
measures. According to Vladimir Ryzhkov, head of the epidemiological
department of the Russian human welfare authority for the region,
measures taken to control the tick population of the area have been
relatively successful in containing the disease and identifying foci
of infection. However, despite extensive tick control measures, the
presence of [CCHF virus] antigen has been detected in almost all
southeastern districts of the region and also close to the regional
center [Rostov-on-Don] in the Mjasnikovskiy district, where earlier
it had not been recorded.

[The Rostov Region is in the south of Russia at the mouth of the
river Don, and has a common border with the Stavropol Region, where
other outbreaks have been reported this year [2005] (see below),
which possibly correspond to greater activity of the vector of CCHF
in this part of southern Russia this year. Only 9 cases of CCHF were
recorded in the Rostov Region in 2004, giving a morbidity index of
0.02 per 100 000 inhabitants. - Mod.NR]
