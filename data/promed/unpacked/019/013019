The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating
with public health officials in many states, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS), and the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate
outbreak of Salmonella serotype Chester infections. Investigators are
using DNA analysis of Salmonella bacteria obtained through diagnostic
testing to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.

As of 9:00 AM EDT on 25 Jun 2010, a total of 37 individuals infected
with a matching strain of Salmonella Chester have been reported from
18 states since 11 Apr 2010. The number of ill people identified in
each state with this strain is as follows: AK (1), CA (5), CO (2), GA
(7), IL (1), KY (1), MA (2), MN (2), MO (1), NC (1), OK (1), OR (2),
SC (2), TN (1), TX (1), UT (2), VA (4), and WA (1). Among those for
whom information is available about when symptoms started, illnesses
began between 5 Apr 2010 and 3 Jun 2010. Case-patients range in age
from <1 to 88 years old, and the median age is 36 years. Fifty-five
percent of patients are female. Among the 19 patients with available
hospitalization information, 7 (37 percent) were hospitalized. No
deaths have been reported.

During 14-18 Jun 2010, the CDC and public health officials in
multiple states conducted an epidemiologic study by comparing foods
eaten by 19 ill and 22 well persons. Analysis of this study suggests
eating a Marie Callender's frozen meal was a source of illness. Ill
persons (89 percent) were significantly more likely than well persons
(14 percent) to report eating a frozen meal. All ill persons (100
percent) who ate frozen meals reported eating a Marie Callender's
frozen meal. None (0 percent) of the well persons who ate a frozen
meal reported eating a Marie Callender's frozen meal. There are
insufficient data from this study to implicate a specific frozen meal
type. However, many of the ill persons have reported eating a Marie
Callender's Cheesy Chicken and & Rice frozen entree in the week
before becoming ill.

This investigation is ongoing. The CDC and state and local public
health partners are continuing surveillance to identify new cases and
identify the contaminated product or products that are causing
illness. We will update the public on the progress of this
investigation as information becomes available.

On 18 Jun 2010, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Laboratory
announced it had isolated Salmonella Chester from an unopened package
of Marie Callender's Cheesy Chicken & Rice single-serve frozen entree
collected from the home of one of the ill people. The DNA fingerprint
of the isolate matches the outbreak strain.

On June 17, 2010, ConAgra Foods announced a precautionary recall of
Marie Callender's Cheesy Chicken & Rice single-serve frozen entrees
after being informed by the CDC of a possible association between
this product and the outbreak of Salmonella Chester infections.

[The CDC cautions that _Salmonella_ may sometimes be present in raw
foods (e.g., chicken, produce, and spices) which can be used as
ingredients in not-ready-to-eat frozen dinners. Proper cooking can
destroy the contaminating _Salmonella_. However, since microwave
ovens vary in strength and tend to cook foods unevenly, consumers
should cook the food for the time specified by the instructions on
the package label of frozen dinners. Also, let the food "stand" for
the stated time, so cooking can continue. If given the option to cook
in a microwave or conventional oven, conventional ovens are better at
cooking foods thoroughly. - Mod.ML]
