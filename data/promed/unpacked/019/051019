Three people suspected to have contracted anthrax in Rubirizi district have died, triggering panic among residents on 4 landing sites on Lake Edward. The deceased [are] all residents of Kisenyi in Katuguru Sub County.

Dr Henry Mugaya, the Rubirizi district veterinary officer, says although they are yet to confirm that the 4 [sic] were killed by anthrax, [the disease] has claimed over 30 goats and 15 sheep since they often graze with buffaloes, hippos and water bucks in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Dr Mugaya says 4 people presented with symptoms of anthrax and were treated at Rugazi Health Center. Bashir Hangi, the Uganda Wildlife Authority spokesperson, confirmed the anthrax outbreak in the Queen Elizabeth National Park. He added that they are managing the situation and working with local leaders to sensitize communities about anthrax.

John Patrick Mayanja, the vice chairperson [for the] Kishenyi Landing site, says anthrax mostly breaks out during the dry season killing wild animals in the park and domestic animals like goats and sheep. "Hippos started dying in February [2020], it's when we started seeing Uganda wildlife authorities pick the carcass and bury them," he said. Jessica Kyomuhendo says her 3 goats died in the farm but didn't present any symptoms.

Harriet Nakamya, the Rubirizi district resident commissioner, said they have suspended the sell and slaughter of all animals to prevent further deaths. She says 2 of the deceased ate game meat while the other ate meat from a goat that was killed by game animals. Dr Mugaya said they have already ordered vaccines to immunize animals as they [are a risk to] people around Kishenyi, Kazinga, Katunguru and Kashaka landing sites.

Anthrax is an infection usually transmitted from wild animals to people who eat the flesh of infected animals. Anthrax causes skin, lung, and bowel disease and can be deadly and is asymptomatic with vomiting, blister and nausea.

[In many ways this is a classic African example of anthrax, starting in wildlife, spilling over into domestic livestock, and from a careless regard of the latter infecting humans feeding on the latter carcasses. This report is centered on human deaths. Usually human deaths, commonly from enteric anthrax, are a minority with the majority being cutaneous cases in the butcher crew and those handing the contaminated meat. So I expect we may well hear of some 19-16 suspect human cutaneous cases receiving antibiotics.

Anthrax is a national problem in Uganda. During 2017-2018, there were some 236 human cases and over 1000 dead livestock (see Anthrax - Uganda (10): livestock, human, 2017-2018 20181112.6140726). For a more complete report focused on just 2018, go to https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272668/OEW21-1925052018.pdf. A national vaccination programme is in hand, but like all others, it does not go smoothly (see Anthrax - Uganda: (QP) cattle, human 20190503.6454247).
