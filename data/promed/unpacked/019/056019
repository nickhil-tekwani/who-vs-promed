The Colorado Department of Agriculture is warning livestock and pet
owners after a horse in eastern Arapahoe County tested positive for
rabies.

"It's relatively rare in Colorado. We had one horse with rabies last
year [2009] in September and again this year [2010], so in a short
time period we've had 2 cases of rabies and we haven't seen any
[horse] cases of rabies in Colorado in over 25 years," Assistant
State Veterinarian Nick Striegal said.

The Department of Agriculture is asking livestock and pet owners to
discuss animal health with their local veterinarians.

"Animal owners need to be aware that rabies is transferring from one
species to another and they should monitor their animals for signs,"
State Veterinarian Dr Keith Roehr said.

According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment, there were 103 rabies cases in 20 Colorado counties in
2009.

Officials say one of the cases include a horse. As of 12 Apr 2010, a
total of 28 animals have tested positive for rabies in Colorado,
according to the Colorado Department of Agriculture -- most of those
cases are from skunks.

State health officials also say rabies can be passed from animals to
humans. "It is very important for people to be aware of rabies. Once
an animal gets rabies or a human gets rabies, it is a fatal disease,"
Striegal said.

Prompt medical treatment can prevent the virus from progressing.

Rabies is a viral disease infecting the brain and central nervous
system. It is primarily spread through the bite of rabid animals.

[Rabies vaccine is available for horses. Horses should be vaccinated
for rabies. Horses are in many ways large companion animals. Because
of that close human-animal bond and close association, it is wise to
vaccinate horses against rabies.

Rabies is a viral disease of the nervous system, which is fatal in
animals and with rare exceptions is fatal in humans.

Rabies can be transmitted by the bite of another infected animal. In
the case of the horse, it is most often through the bite of a rabid
skunk, raccoon, or even a bat. While there are other possible rabid
animals that could transmit the virus to a horse, these are probably
higher up on the possibilities than other animals.

Horses are by nature curious as to their surroundings. They will
investigate a new creature or an oddly moving creature within their
domain. They poke their noses down to see the skunk or raccoon or
other rabid creature and often get their noses bit, thus transmitting
the disease.

The horse can transmit rabies to a human by a bite or saliva that
should get the system through a cut or scrape. It is cheap insurance
to vaccinate the horse against rabies and protect yourself, your
family, and your friends. - Mod.TG]
