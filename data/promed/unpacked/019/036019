--------------------------------------------------------------------
A subscriber has informed ProMED that after Hurricane Hortense, which hit Puerto Rico in 1996, the number of leptospirosis cases in Puerto Rico was related to the amount of rainfall. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory criteria were reported to help distinguish leptospirosis from dengue after the hurricane and identify patients who would benefit from early antibiotic treatment (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16083836/).
