In the Akushinskiy district of Dagestan, 7 workers from the agricultural
co-operative "Akushinskiy" were infected with brucellosis. They were
thought to have been infected from cattle. The diagnoses were made in a
local hospital where physicians have confirmed the diagnosis.
Now actions for the localization of outbreak are being carried out in the
area, and export of meat and dairy products to other areas of republic is
suspended.

[Brucella is often transmitted to humans through unpasteurized dairy
products; cattle (_B. abortus_), swine (_B. suis_), and goats (_B.
melitensis_) are the major reservoirs. - Mod.LL]
