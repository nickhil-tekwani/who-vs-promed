From: Ann Kimball <akimball@u.washington.edu>
Perhaps even publishing the available data implicating the seeds in an
abstract version with pertinent tables on the NIH(Japan) website or
elsewhere would help ... I share the concern about lack of peer reviewed
information being published because this is important beyond this outbreak.
The international seed industry is one of the most rapidly growing, with a
soaring rate of trade with scientific limitations to regulation of
contamination which are acknowleged in industry publications ... the alfalfa
sprouts salmonella outbreaks are another example which speaks to more
in-depth investigation being needed. But these are in the literature.
