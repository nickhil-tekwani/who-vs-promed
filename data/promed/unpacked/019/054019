Plague has been confirmed in a squirrel on the city's west side, and health
officials launched a campaign to eradicate fleas that might transmit the
disease to humans.
El Paso County Health Department workers also distributed pamphlets on the
disease Tuesday to about 750 homes within a half-mile of the spot where the
infected squirrel was found.
Residents began reporting dead squirrels in the area about 2 weeks ago,
said Don Mydlowski, environmental quality manager for the health department.
After tests confirmed plague, workers set out tubes that coat squirrels'
fur with insecticide when they crawl through to get to a peanut butter bait.
Mydlowski suggested area residents keep cats indoors and check with
veterinarians about flea control for dogs and cats.
