Foot & mouth disease in wild deer
---------------------------------
[In a previous ProMED-mail posting dated 8 May 2001, Candida St John asked
whether there was any concern that wild deer populations might become
involved in spreading or maintaining foot and mouth infection. This does
figure in US preparedness plans. Wildlife experts, vets, and virologists in
the US have met recently to discuss what should be done regarding deer in
case of an outbreak in the US, as the population is indeed very dense in
some areas. The current position as I understand it is that there would be
no automatic culling, but that susceptible populations would be monitored
for signs of the occurrence or persistence of infection.
As a matter of interest, during a 1924 outbreak in California, more than 20
000 mule deer were killed as a precaution in Stanislas National Park. Some
10 percent showed signs of foot and mouth infection, though no lab tests
were done to confirm this diagnosis.
The US position contrasts with that of the British authorities, who presume
that any infection would burn itself out in the wild deer population,
despite a 10-fold population increase [in the UK and a large expansion of
their range since the last big outbreak of FMD. The last I heard, a few
deer had been tested (and found negative), and one farmed herd of 400 deer
of several species in the heavily-infected district of Cumbria has been
culled, after four Sika showed signs of foot and mouth (but again, tested
negative). There is official concern that the infection could reach wild
deer on moorland in the southwest. But, at last report, the Ministry was
doing no systematic surveillance for foot and mouth infection in wild deer.
The British deer industry (including various alliances of hunting,
countryside, and conservation groups) is up in arms and wants systematic
testing, as they are sure they have seen deer with signs of the disease.
The big question is whether any infection would in fact burn out, or
whether it might spread at such a rate as to be able to maintain itself for
some time within the population, possibly reinfecting livestock.
Epidemiologists I have asked say, of course, that we can't tell without
data. But it seems that systematic data on infection in deer will not be
forthcoming from the British outbreak.
Apparently the Dutch have done some tests, although their deer population
must be smaller.

US Military Wary of Foot-And-Mouth
----------------------------------
AUSTIN, Texas: Large military equipment from Great Britain and the
Netherlands might be barred from exercises at Fort Bliss next month because
of the threat of foot-and-mouth disease. Defense Department officials have
forbidden transport of the equipment by land from the port of Beaumont near
Houston to Fort Bliss, a state agriculture official said Saturday. The
equipment has yet to be loaded on cargo ships to come to the United States.
Officials fear the cargo might be contaminated with foot-and-mouth, and
overland transport could bring the equipment into contact with animal herds.
The equipment could still be delivered by air so long as "extreme
precautions" are taken to ensure that troops cannot transmit the disease,
said Beverly Boyd, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Agriculture.
The restrictions are part of the government's effort to protect the United
States from foot-and-mouth disease, which has affected livestock in Europe,
particularly Great Britain. Texas has the largest number of cattle, sheep,
and goats in the country, all of which are susceptible to foot-and-mouth
disease.
The military exercises, which include about 25 000 troops representing air
and ground forces from the United States, Great Britain, Netherlands, and
Germany, are scheduled June 15 through June 30 in west Texas and New
Mexico. Equipment from Germany arrived in Beaumont Monday. There's no
problem with that equipment, Boyd said, because there are no confirmed
cases of foot-and-mouth cases in Germany. Still, the equipment was cleaned
and disinfected twice as a precaution before it was loaded in Europe.

I think it is most interesting that when 2 cases of measles (a highly
contagious virus) are introduced into El Salvador, the immediate response
is to immunise and sanitise. I do realise that it is not possible to
"slaughter to control" the disease but presumably there is every
expectation that the immunisation and sanitisation controls will work,
despite the fact that the 2 students carrying measles virus will
undoubtedly have had contact with other humans before the disease was
recognised.
However, this method of controlling FMDV in the UK was not implemented, and
the disease spread widely throughout the country! As a virologist, I would
be surprised if measles is any less contagious than FMDV.
Moreover, measles, like FMDV, is also capable of producing persistent
infections!
Doesn't this argue in favour of immunisation and sanitisation to control FMDV?

[Obviously, in the aftermath of the experiences of the UK, France, and The
Netherlands with FMD, the standard veterinary approaches will be up for
reconsideration and 20/20 hindsight expert advice. It will be interesting.
It should be noted the Salvadoran authorities are only talking of
"ring-vaccination," i.e., family and contacts, not regional or national
vaccination, in spite of the country being highly susceptible through its
prior measles-free status. If nothing else, this would argue that FMDv has
a much greater spreading capacity than the human measles virus; this is
certainly the case with the other mammalian morbilliviruses for distemper
and rinderpest. Of course the aphthoviruses have some fundamental
differences from the morbilliviruses.
Secondly I would argue that veterinarians are philosophically different
from physicians, though we use the same tools. This difference can cause
confusion and misunderstanding. While a physician's first objective is to
do no harm, ours is to minimise the costs (of disease) either to the owner
or to the community. It is worded somewhat differently in the
veterinarian's oath ... "for the benefit of society"; but I am not off the
mark. The FMD procedures are aimed at minimising the economic costs, not
minimising the disease. Usually a slaughter policy efficiently achieves
this. Plus, until recently, our inability to differentiate between
naturally-FMDv-infected stock and the vaccinated stock constrained vaccine
use. I can foresee the UK experience being rerun many times as a
computerised war game to determine what should have been done with and
without the constraints of the time -- incomplete knowledge of the initial
wide national spread, bureaucratic constraints, limited organizational
skills and abilities, and facilities. I suspect that these games will need
better models than are currently available and a better knowledge of the
disease. For example, FMD in sheep performs very differently from the MAFF
presumptions used. Time will tell. - Mod.MHJ
