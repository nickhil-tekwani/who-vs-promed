Anthrax is blamed for recent deaths in a cattle herd in south eastern Pennington County. South Dakota state veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven says at least 9 adult cattle died suddenly last week [week of 14 Aug 2017] in the herd. The herd had not been vaccinated against anthrax. Anthrax spores survive indefinitely in contaminated alkaline soils. Nearly all parts of South Dakota have the potential for an anthrax outbreak under ideal climatic conditions. Drought, floods and wind can expose grazing livestock to anthrax spores.

Livestock producers are advised that anthrax should be suspected in cases of sudden death. Suspected cases should be reported immediately to a local veterinarian or to the state veterinarian at the South Dakota Animal Industry Board.

Anthrax can be transmitted to people and other animals.

[Pennington County is not in south eastern South Dakota, but on the western border of the state, a part of the state where anthrax is infrequent. It is commoner in eastern South Dakota. For a map of the state, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/southdakota_90.jpg.

This probably explains why these cattle were not vaccinated in spite of the very active extension program fostering anthrax vaccination. Also lack of experience with this disease will delay informing one's veterinarian on the 1st death. Delay results in further cases and deaths. And puts neighbouring herds at risk from snacking female haematophagic tabanid flies with contaminated mouthparts. - Mod.MHJ
