East African trypanosomiasis (EAT) has been confirmed in an expatriate working in conservation research in the Vwaza Marsh Game Reserve, Malawi. The patient had worked with the expatiate volunteer who died in December 2018 after having contracted EAT. The patient developed an acute febrile illness and a typical trypanosomal chancre, and sought medical care. She has been transferred to a Johannesburg hospital for treatment. Profound thrombocytopenia, jaundice, and hepatic and renal dysfunction were noted. Initial doses of suramin have been commenced.

[ProMED-mail thanks Lucille Blumberg, John Frean, and Evan Shoul for their submission. African trypanosomiasis is endemic in the game reserves of southern Africa. Cases are reported regularly, usually evacuated from the country of infection to South Africa. African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) should be suspected in persons visiting the game reserves in southern Africa if tested malaria negative. - Mod.EP
