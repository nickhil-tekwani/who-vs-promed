The outbreak of legionellosis in Paris illustrates a trend toward
increasing disease rates in France and adjacent countries. (See:

Reporting statistics for the USA have been added to this graph for purposes
of comparison.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Berger for his continued contributions. The
extracted rate in cases per 100 000 population for France and Spain,
countries in Europe with the highest incidence of legionellosis, as
compared with the USA has been extracted in a table below:
Year France / Spain / USA
1997 0.4 / 0.6 / 0.25
1998 0.6 / 0.8 / 0.25
1999 0.75 / 1.1 / 0.45
2000 1.0 / 1.9 / 0.45
2001 1.3 / 3.0 / 0.45
2002 1.75 / 3.6 / 0.45
2003 1.8 / 3.3 / 0.8
2004 2.0 / 2.7 / 0.75
2005 2.6 / 3.2 / 0.8
The reasons for the dramatic rise in cases in Spain and France but not in
the USA (or Belgium or Italy) are not clear but may relate in part with
aggressive surveillance. ï¿½ Mod.LL]
