The British pig industry is on red alert, in a bid to prevent an outstandingly virulent pig disease from entering the country. Until more is known about transmission routes of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus [PEDv], the industry is focusing in particular on a specialist feed ingredient for young pigs - spray-dried porcine plasma.

Positive polymerase chain reaction [PCR] tests in the United States and bioassay tests by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency have pointed to spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) as an ingredient being capable of containing porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDv), but not that it is necessarily capable of actually transmitting the disease. Further tests are ongoing in the hope of getting a clearer picture. But specialist pig vets say that if PEDv arrived in Britain it would spread quickly through the nation's naive pig population, causing incalculable damage, so industry organisations are urging producers to take every precaution, even though the case against SDPP is unproven.

BPEX, National Pig Association, Pig Veterinary Society, the Agricultural Industries Confederation, and British Pig Association have joined forces to keep PEDv out of the country. All pig producers are being urged to work with feed manufacturers, nutritionists and vets to identify and immediately isolate any feed products on farms that are labelled as containing SDPP. SDPP is banned by Red Tractor assurance, which regulates over 90 percent of the nation's domestic pig supply. However it may be present in a few milk replacer and milk blend products, without producers necessarily being aware of the fact.

PEDv is harmless to humans but is killing up to 100 percent of piglets on affected pig farms in the United States. Nobody knows how the highly infectious virus spread to the States from China, and how it has subsequently spread to Mexico and Canada.

To help producers make the safest choices, National Pig Association and BPEX will be publishing on their respective websites a list of manufacturers that guarantee all their products, particularly milk replacer and milk blend products, are entirely free of SDPP.

BPEX and NPA are also reminding producers that they should only use feed that is monitored by UFAS, the animal feed assurance scheme. "It is impossible to overstate the damage PEDv would cause if it arrived in Britain," said veterinarian Derek Armstrong, of BPEX. "The evidence from the States is that it is so outstandingly infectious that just one infected pig is all it would take to start an epidemic in this country which could kill as much as 10 percent of the national herd." NPA chairman Richard Longthorp said, "We are clear that we don't want to be looking back in a few months, and wish we had been more cautious. We are all agreed in the pig sector that we should close off every avenue of risk and potential risk for the time being."

Current estimates suggest that in the United States alone PEDv could kill as many as 5 million piglets before the national herd starts to develop antibodies against the virus, equivalent to 4.5 percent of all pigs sent to slaughter. In addition to the question mark over SDPP, the virus can spread rapidly through contact with sick animals, as well as through people's clothing, hands, equipment, boots, and tools contaminated with the faeces of infected animals.

[Porcine epidemic* diarrhoea (PED) was first described in Europe; the causative agent (a coronavirus) was isolated in 1978. During the 1970s and 1980s, PEDv frequently caused outbreaks of watery diarrhoea in European swine of all ages with high mortality in neonatal pigs. Later, its prevalence in Europe was, for unclarified reasons, markedly reduced. Since the 1990s, PED became an economically important enteric disease in Asian countries, including Korea, China, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand. Though the virus isolates were not different from those in Europe, the acute and severe clinical appearance may have reflected the entry of PEDv into a naive population, as was the case in Europe in the 1970s. The economic impacts of PED were substantial, due to significant morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets and to increased costs related to vaccination and disinfection. The severe losses caused by the recent introduction of PED into North America, may reflect a similar development there (according to recent information, the veterinary authorities in Manitoba State, Canada, are considering to declare the disease notifiable). PED affects porcines only; it is not zoonotic.

[*The term "epidemic" is generally applicable in the context of public health (human medicine); the animal-health-related term is "epizootic", which should have been applied when this pig disease was initially named during the 1970s-80s. Thanks to subscriber E Leiderman, MD, for drawing our attention to this deviant, applied in the scientific literature since the 1980s].

According to a notification of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) dated 18 Feb 2014, "Testing has determined that PED virus was present in samples of US-origin plasma obtained at the 3rd-party manufacturer for Grand Valley Fortifiers. This plasma was used as an ingredient in feed pellets produced by the company. Testing with a swine bioassay has determined that the plasma ingredient contains PED virus capable of causing disease in pigs". Said information, included in ProMED-mail post 20140220.2288707, was accompanied by the following comment by Mod.TG: "Porcine plasma contaminated with PEDv, then made into feed and fed to swine. Sounds amazing like the start of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease. Remember? Ground up cow parts were fed back to cattle to increase protein and to recycle the animal and reduce waste of an animal, It took years for the disease to manifest itself to a rate that caused alarm. While this incident may not be the same, the question of this being a common practice, and now having reached a level of alarm certainly crosses my mind." This moderator fully agrees. Information from the USA Food and Drug Administration on the scientific background allowing porcine plasma to be fed back to porcines will be helpful.

Later studies by CFIA confirmed "that the porcine blood plasma in question contained PED virus [PEDv] capable of causing disease in pigs". However, the study could not demonstrate that the feed pellets containing the blood plasma were capable of causing disease;" which apparently means that the pelleting process could have inactivated the virus (see ProMED-mail 20140307.2318706).

The concerns in the UK, as expressed in several farmer's media articles, seem understandable, indicating the need for a definitive conclusion, excluding a possible role of SDPP in the recent proliferation of PED (such as, USA, Canada, or Japan).
