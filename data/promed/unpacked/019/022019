According to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of Ba Ria-Vung Tau, cassava leaf mosaic is causing great damage to growers. The area currently infected with the disease in the province was more than 2200 out of a total 7500 hectares, with more than 1200 ha heavily infected at a rate of 70-80%. The crop varieties HL-S11, KM94, KM190, KM419 used by farmers are all infected.

In 2018, cassava mosaic disease appeared in the province with variety HL-S11 brought back from Tay Ninh province by farmers. Since then, each year the province has recorded an average of 2000-3000 ha of infection, more than 40% of the total cassava growing area. Farmers have been instructed not to buy seed tubers from infected areas; it is strictly forbidden to transport cassava cuttings from infected areas to other localities.

The department has established a pilot planting on one farm to screen some cassava varieties for resistance to mosaic. Six months after planting, the HN3 variety was not infected and had good growth; other diseases and pests did not cause significant damage. For control varieties, the infection rate was up to 100% for HL-S11 and 65% for KM94. On the basis of the trial, planting material of HN3 will be multiplied and HL-S11 gradually removed from the fields. It is estimated that for 2024 there will be enough cuttings available for cultivation of about 8000 hectares of cassava in the province.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has triggered food emergencies in the past by destroying cassava crops throughout whole regions. It is caused by a number of species and strains in the large genus _Begomovirus_, which seem to be associated with it in different areas (for example, see ProMED post 20160623.4304471). Co-infections as well as genetic recombination between strains have also been reported, and recombinant strains can be particularly virulent.

CMD symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion, and stunting of plants, leading to severe reduction of tuber yields. The CMD viruses are spread by whitefly vectors and with infected plant material. At least one of the viruses (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an unrelated alternative host (soybean), suggesting that these viruses may have a wider host reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Disease management for begomoviruses usually relies on use of resistant crop cultivars, control of their vectors, and control of pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants.

Because most traditional cassava cultivars are susceptible to CMD, varieties resistant to different viral strains are being developed for local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some areas, but in others, the new varieties are being wiped out by cassava brown streak (CBS) disease (caused by viruses in the genus _Ipomovirus_ which are transmitted like CMD). A new CBS viral strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD-resistant cultivars (ProMED posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742). Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in affected regions (ProMED post 20110829.2643).

In Southeast Asia, an alarm was raised when _Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus_ (SLCMV) was identified in Cambodia in 2015 (e.g., ProMED posts 20190304.6349348, 20180607.5844264). Since then, the disease is spreading and is considered a potential major threat to cassava production in the region.
