Low-path AI reported in Mexico
------------------------
Mexico's Agriculture Ministry has reported an outbreak of low-pathogenic
avian influenza in northern Mexico, in the state of Durango.
Early last week, bird flu fears prompted the slaughter of approximately 2
million chickens at a Tyson Foods processing plant. It is not known how the
disease entered the country, but Mexico recently resumed poultry imports
from Texas, which was affected by low-path AI last year [2004].
Since the bird flu was not a high-pathogen strain, the outbreak was not
reported to the World Health Organization.

[This article does not tell us what type of low pathogenic avian influenza
is present. For this reason, although Texas did have low-pathogenic avian
influenza, we cannot know if it was the same strain. If this came from
smuggled birds and not normal commercial traffic, it underscores the
necessity for following the rule to decrease diseases. - Mod.TG]
