Limited danger of new Foot-and-Mouth Disease outbreaks in North Korea
-----------------------------------------------
The recent outbreak of the highly contagious Foot-and-Mouth Disease
[FMD] in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was probably a
single case and appears to be under control, FAO and the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said today [4 Apr 2007] after
the return of a one-week mission to the country.
The outbreak started in January 2007 at a farm in Sangwon near the
capital of Pyongyang and was brought into the country through a
shipment of live animals. It was the 1st outbreak of FMD in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea since 1960.
"Based on the mission's visit to the infected area and discussions
with North Korean veterinary authorities, we concluded that there is
a limited risk that new outbreaks could occur. North Korea should,
however, remain on alert," said Joseph Domenech, FAO's Chief
Veterinary Officer.
"The veterinary authorities, who had requested our assistance, were
very transparent and cooperative," Domenech said.
Since the outbreak, quarantine officials have culled around 400
infected cattle and 2600 pigs and have applied standard disease
control measures.
In order to avoid future outbreaks of FMD, FAO is drafting a project
proposal to assist the country in importing high quality vaccines,
developing a contingency plan, and improving laboratory
infrastructure and training.
In particular, the identification and registration of animals,
quarantine procedures, passive and active surveillance along
transport routes and diagnostic capacity should be strengthened.
FMD is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cows,
sheep, goats and other cloven-hoofed animals, causing blisters on the
nose, mouth and hooves. The disease results in severe production
losses in livestock operations. The disease does not pose a threat to
human health.
The mission was organized by the FAO/OIE Crisis Management Center.

[According to North Korea's notification to the OIE, the affected
population consisted of calves imported from Tieling city, Liaoning
province, People's Republic of China, some of which were showing
clinical signs after their introduction onto the (affected) farm. In
our previous posting, archive 20070315.0916, we requested information
on the source of infection, namely whether the calves had been
infected on their farm of origin in Liaoning or rather after their
arrival (in January 2007?) at the farm in Ryongkok, near Pyongyang.
From the current press release, it appears that the infection was
introduced by the imported calves. Anecdotal information on a
suspected outbreak of FMD in the vicinity of the calves' location of
origin was published in February 2006 (archive 20060207.0405). -
