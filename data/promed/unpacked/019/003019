Outbreak of coconut disease confirmed
-------------------------------------
A team of scientists from Kerala Agricultural University (KAU), who visited Marayur [Idukki district] following large-scale spread of a disease among coconut and areca nut trees, confirmed that it was phytoplasmas, spread by insects.

It has been identified as a major disease that could pose a threat to [coconut] cultivation in the entire region. The expert team also suggested that the only remedy is to cut the affected trees and destroy them to prevent its fast spread. The symptom of the disease is yellowing of the outer leaves, resulting in decay of the tender leaves and complete drying up of the trunk. Once the disease is noticed in a few coconut trees, it spreads to nearby farms.

The Agriculture Department has also requested the help of the Central Plantation Crop Research Institute to contain the disease.

[The phytoplasma disease referred to above is most likely Kerala wilt (KW, also called root wilt), which is spreading in parts of Kerala and adjacent states. It is considered the most serious problem for coconut cultivation in the affected areas. KW has been included in the group of lethal yellowing (LY) diseases of coconut and other palms caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma palmae, LY or 16SrIV) group. LY diseases are spread by insect vectors, such as plant hoppers, but further research on epidemiology is needed.

A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. For example, subgroup 16SrIV-A phytoplasmas are associated with LY in the Americas, while the KW phytoplasma has been classified into subgroup 16SrIV-C. In addition, another phytoplasma of the 16SrXI group (_Ca._ Phytoplasma oryzae) has also been reported from KW affected palms. Further research is needed to clarify the role of the 2 phytoplasmas in KW.

Unlike other LY diseases which can kill the host within a few months, KW is not lethal, but significantly reduces production. Symptoms may include drooping leaflets, yellowing and marginal necrosis of older leaves, necrosis of inflorescences, and root rot. Fungal leaf rot is often found as a secondary infection. It has been suggested that weeds as pathogen reservoirs may play a role the epidemiology of KW (and other LY diseases). Disease management relies on eradication of diseased palms, improving the general conditions of coconut groves and replanting with resistant or tolerant varieties. Resistance breeding programmes based on disease escapees from heavily KW affected areas are in progress.

It appears that molecular diagnostic evidence is still needed to confirm conclusively KW as the cause of the problems reported above.
