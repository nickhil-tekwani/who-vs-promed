INFECTION CONTROL - NEW MEXICO, USA
===================================
Date: Thu, 6 Jun 1996 01:08:14 -0400
From: DWStryker@aol.com

Albuquerque, New Mexico
I am an ID trained, infection control chair at a tertiary care hospital
(Presbyterian, a system which includes SNF and outpatient facilities) and
also a transitional/rehab facility (THC).
Fortunately, at the acute facility, MRSA is only about 10% of clinical staph.
VRE has appeared in Albuquerque
with a vengeance, going from sporadic cases thru 1995 to a prevelance of 1-2
active cases in each of the city's acute care facilities all the time. The
transitional facility, by nature of the patients it cares for, seems to
attract a large number of those pre-colonized or infected with MRSA, VRE, or
both.
I concur with the concerns about the resources devoted to MRSA,
although it does tend to force attention and better handwashing around those
patients who are the greatest consumers of vancomycin.

(Note that I, like many of the ProMED-mail correspondents, do not have
institutional access. Neither do the IC nurses I work with, though I have
suggested it to administration. For me AOL works well)
