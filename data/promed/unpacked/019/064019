The state has recently seen its 1st cases of triple E (eastern equine encephalomyelitis) and West Nile virus (WNV). Both of these can be fatal in equines and both can be prevented with vaccinations. Confirming these 2 cases is a reminder for equine owners to vaccinate their animals.

The West Nile case was in an unvaccinated donkey in Guilford County and the triple E case was in an unvaccinated horse in Pender County [for more information on the EEE case, please see ProMED-mail eastern equine encephalitis postings. - Mod.TG]

Both of these mosquito-borne diseases can be fatal in equine, but both are also preventable through vaccinations. These positive cases serve as a great reminder horse and donkey owners should have their animals vaccinated.

It is not unusual to see these diseases in the state, but I am glad we are just seeing the 1st cases now. Overall, we did have 9 cases in 2020 with the 1st one coming in July [2021].

It is not "news" to anyone living in North Carolina, mosquitoes are prevalent until 1st frost, which can be as late as November. Rainfall from tropical storms in late summer can help set up a perfect breeding environment for mosquitoes, but it doesn't take a lot of water to create an environment for these pests.

Even puddles from brief summer storms can create a perfect breeding ground if they stick around for 4 days or longer. Any measures you can take around the barn or fields to reduce standing water is great for lessening the opportunity for mosquitoes to multiply.

Dump containers [old tires, the catch pot on potted plants, etc. - Mod.TG] and removing water from puddles are 2 simple steps to take. Other tips include keeping horses in stalls at night, using insect screens [and sprays especially approved for horses. - Mod.TG] and fans, and turning off lights after dusk. Watch your animals closely for signs your animals are sick.

Signs of West Nile Virus are fever, weakness or paralysis of hind limbs, impaired vision, head pressing, seizures, and aimless wandering. Contact your vet immediately if you notice your equine exhibiting any of these signs.

People, horses, and birds can become infected by a bite from a mosquito carrying these diseases, but there is no evidence horses can transmit the viruses to other horses, birds or people through direct contact. People invest a lot in their equine and vaccination is the best way to keep them safe from these mosquito-borne diseases.

The Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) Animal Health Laboratory has confirmed multiple cases of West Nile Virus (WNV) in horses. The affected horses are located in Lemhi, Twin Falls, Canyon, Ada, and Blaine counties. One horse was euthanized due to the severity of the disease, and the other horses are recovering under the supervision of a veterinarian.

The most common signs of WNV in horses are fever and weakness, usually in the hindquarters which sometimes is characterized by a widened stance, stumbling, leaning to one side, and toe dragging. Mental conditions such as fearfulness, lip-smacking, chewing movements, and fine muscle tremors may be noticed. Paralysis and inability to stand may follow in extreme cases of WNV infection.

Most commonly, WNV is spread to people and horses through the bite of an infected mosquito. The public should continue to take precautions in areas with WNV-carrying mosquitoes and precautions should extend to animals.

The ISDA recommends 2 essential protections for equines and small camelids: vaccination and physical precautions.

"The WNV vaccination continues to be an essential preventive measure and should be given annually to provide an adequate level of protection from the virus," said Dr Scott Leibsle, Idaho State Veterinarian. "Nearly 98 percent of horses that test positive for WNV are non-vaccinated or under-vaccinated. Horse owners should speak with their veterinarians about the WNV vaccination and other annual core vaccinations as well as how to follow an annual booster schedule. Horses that have been vaccinated for WNV in previous years must receive an annual booster; a one-time vaccination is not enough."

Physical WNV precautions include using fans and repellants to keep mosquitoes away from equines. Additionally, horse owners should remove standing water on or near their property whenever possible.

"There is no vaccine for people," said Dr Leslie Tengelsen, State Public Health Veterinarian with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. "Although most infections in people are mild, some people can become quite ill. Avoid mosquito bites by taking simple precautions." Precautions can include using insect repellant according to the label, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are most active, and making sure house screens are in working order.

Additional information about the virus and a map of known affected counties are available from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare's website at https://www.westnile.idaho.gov.

Four more horses in Weld County have tested positive for equine West Nile virus, raising the statewide total to 14 since late July [2021], according to the Colorado Department of Agriculture.

In addition to the horses in Weld, 3 horses in Adams County, 2 in Boulder County, and one each in Elbert, Otero, Morgan, and Fremont have tested positive for West Nile virus. The 1st case of equine West Nile was identified in Colorado on [30 Jul 2021].

"With more than a dozen horses testing positive for West Nile Virus this year [2021], it's important to remember that vaccinations are critical to protect the health of Colorado horses," state veterinarian Dr Maggie Baldwin said in the news release. "In addition to vaccines, horse owners should work to reduce mosquito populations on their premises. West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes and mitigating that vector helps to reduce the risk of disease to both horses and people."

West Nile virus is a disease that cycles between wild birds and mosquitoes, and can sometimes affect other species, like people and horses. Clinical cases in horses are typically characterized by anorexia, depression and neurological signs that might include ataxia, weakness, or paralysis of one or more limbs, teeth grinding, aimless wandering, convulsions, and circling.

Mosquito pools from Weld, Larimer, Boulder, Adams, Arapahoe, Delta, Denver, and Pueblo counties have tested positive for the virus this summer [2021], and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE] has recorded 29 human cases of the virus this year. Weld County reported at least one woman was hospitalized last month [August 2021] with the virus, and another was diagnosed.

CDPHE publishes data on human West Nile cases and positive mosquito pools on the health department website.

Vaccination for West Nile virus is one of the core vaccines recommended for livestock by the American Association of Equine Practitioners [AAEP]. If a horse has not been vaccinated in previous years, it will need the 2-shot vaccination series. Horses need an annual booster to protect against the virus. The state agriculture department suggests visiting the AAEP website for a comprehensive list of vaccination recommendations.

Horse owners should work with their veterinarians to determine the best vaccine schedule for their horses.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners should also work diligently to reduce mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas where horses are located. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, using mosquito repellents and keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, typically early in the morning and evening.

If a horse displays clinical signs consistent with neurologic disease, a complete veterinary examination is warranted. All infectious or contagious equine neurologic diseases are reportable to the Colorado State Veterinarian's Office.

The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food announced 9 cases of West Nile virus have been confirmed in Utah horses this year [2021] -- and the Utah Department of Health has reported the highest number of West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools ever seen in the state.

According to a news release, there were 7 cases in Weber County and 1 case in Salt Lake and Box Elder counties. 6 people and 7 birds have also tested positive for the disease.

The virus is carried by mosquitoes and can cause disease in humans, birds, horses, and some other mammals. Horses become infected with West Nile through mosquito bites and do not spread the infection to other horses or people, the release states.

Most people who become infected with West Nile virus do not develop any symptoms, according to UDOH, but symptoms include headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Less than 1% of people infected will develop a serious neurological illness, such as meningitis, the department's website states [https://epi.health.utah.gov/west-nile-virus/].

Signs of the virus in horses include loss of appetite, depression, fever, and neurological signs, like stumbling, circling, and weakness. In horses, the disease can cause long term neurological problems or even death, according to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food.

Owners can protect their horses by using insect repellents [specifically for horses. - Mod.TG], fans, and screens and by eliminating stagnant water sources where mosquitoes breed. Horse owners who suspect West Nile virus should contact their veterinarian immediately.

"Vaccines against West Nile virus and other neurologic diseases are readily available from your veterinarian," wrote Dr Dean Taylor, Utah State Veterinarian, in the release. "Every owner should discuss vaccinations with their veterinarian in the spring before mosquito season."

West Nile virus (WNV) is carried by mosquitos and can infect horses and humans and birds.

A vaccine is available for horses. The WNV vaccine is often combined with eastern and western equine encephalitis, and tetanus. One vaccine to help prevent potentially deadly consequences for your horses is something every horse owner should be vaccinating with. Please consult your veterinarian regarding getting your horse vaccinated. Please remember to use mosquito/fly spray approved for use on horses. Some components of sprays not specifically approved for horses can cause serious problems.

Please pay attention when a health department has a news release regarding mosquito trapping or birds with WNV or EEE. These are early warning signs to vaccinate your horses.

Remember to empty any standing water from old tires, potted plants, catch basins, or other locations which can hold even a small amount of water. These are perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes. - Mod.TG]
