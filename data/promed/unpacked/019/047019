[The following factsheet written by the discoverers of the Hendra-like virus
provides background that is essential to the understanding of the
current viral encephalitis outbreak in Malaysia. The article, which includes
an electron micrograph of the virus, has been shortened and edited; my
apologies to the authors. Those interested in the entire article can check
the website above. - Mod.CYC]
Factsheets about a new paramyxovirus isolated during the viral encephalitis
outbreak in Negri Sembilan
--------------------------------------
During the current outbreak of viral encephalitis in Negri Sembilan, there
was evidence that another agent [was] involved. Unlike known JE [Japanese
encephalitis] outbreaks which affect mainly children, this outbreak involved
mainly adults working in pig farms. Many well-spaced acute and
convalescent [serum] samples were negative for JE serologically and there
were cases even in those who had received full immunization with mouse
brain-derived inactivated JE vaccine. In addition, there were anecdotal
accounts of pigs dying, another piece of useful information to alert us of
the possibility of another agent, not JE [virus].
A virus which gives rise to severe syncytial formation in Vero cells was
isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of 12 patients with viral
encephalitis. This virus, isolated in the Department of Medical
Microbiology, University of Malaysia, was taken to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA. Preliminary evidence showed
that it is possibly a new paramyxovirus related to [the] Hendra virus [of
Australia].
This new Malaysian paramyxovirus was first tested in CDC, Fort Collins, and
found not to be related to any known arboviruses. In addition,
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using consensus primers
directed against alphaviruses, flaviviruses and bunyaviruses were negative.
Also at CDC, Fort Collins, electron microscopy on a grid of infected cells
prepared in the University of Malaysia showed foci of thickening plasma
membrane with hairy-like projections suggestive of virus morphogenesis at
the cell membrane. The virus appears as pleomorphic, enveloped particles
(spherical and elongated) of 200 to 300+ nanometers, and helical
nucleocapsids were noted within the envelope. Multinucleated cells were
prominent and the nuclei appear normal. The virus particles are compatible
with paramyxoviruses and cross-react with Hendra virus antibody by
immunofluorescence. CDC Atlanta has developed a serological test for IgM
[antibody] to Hendra virus and a number of serum samples from the current
outbreak have been shown to be positive.
Preliminary results showed that this new Hendra-like virus is the major
cause of the viral encephalitis outbreak in Negri Sembilan. [Given that it
is] a new virus, we can ony [assume] that it shares certain properties
with the Australian Hendra virus. Further characterization of this virus is
on-going in CDC and in the University of Malaysia.
It is hoped that the various preventive measures undertaken by the
government will be effective to curb the spread of this outbreak which has,
to date, claimed over 60 lives and ruined the pig industry.

[Obviously this is a definitive report. We are all grateful to Dr. Ken Lam
and Dr. Chua Kaw Bing for having taken the time from their exceedingly busy
work-load to provide this background and preliminary information. We are
continuously grateful to Dr. Muruga Vadivale for maintaining his web page.
Now that the entire team is in place and the etiologic agent is being
investigated, we can await updates on numbers of cases and watch with
fascination as this emerging disease is controlled and documented.
Congratulations to all involved. Those of us who have worked under
conditions in which the public, government, and fellow scientists want
results "yesterday" can understand the immense personal and scientific
pressures that are brought to bear. - Mod.CHC]
