No anthrax in Krishnagiri, assures Collector
-----------------------------------------------
Krishnagiri Collector Dr. Santhosh Babu said that some confusion has
been created following a news report misquoting him in connection
with a report on anthrax. In a press note issued on Friday [8 Dec
2006], the Collector said that it was falsely reported that as many
as 17 cows died of anthrax in Uthangarai in October 2006. But per the
information from the Animal Husbandry Department, only 4 cows and one
calf died in Chinna Anandur village in Uthangarai taluk in October 2006.
The Animal Husbandry Department could not collect any specimen
samples of the dead animals since the villagers had already buried
them. However, according to the villagers' explanations, it was
understood that the symptoms almost confirmed the occurrence of
anthrax. The Animal Husbandry Department immediately conducted a
ring-vaccination program in the surrounding villages, and the disease
was completely brought under control.

[In the original 24 Oct 2006 posting on this outbreak, Dr. Babu had
reported that the diagnosis was based on necropsies. Some 1200 cattle
were vaccinated, or so it was claimed. But were carcasses buried
without instructions from the Animal Husbandry Department? Either
way, it is pleasing to note that the original outbreak was less
severe than 1st reported and that the vaccine response has been
successful. Let us hope that Dr. Babu will now institute annual
vaccination in these villages. This will reduce the probability of
new cases and encourage the prompt and early reporting of any new
cases. - Mod.MHJ]
