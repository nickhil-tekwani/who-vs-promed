Tomato crop in Batinah region destroyed by _Phytophthora_
---------------------------------------------------------
A fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_, causing the disease 'late blight', has devastated a significant portion of the country's tomato crop. The pathogen has infested crops in Batinah, where 85 per cent of the sultanate's tomato is cultivated.

Saed Abdullah Rashid al Kharusi, Al Batinah Farmers' Association, said the damage was large scale. "From seedlings to fruit and plant, everything has been damaged. We can't estimate the exact damage, but have invited the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MoAF) to survey farms in Barka, Musannah and Suwaiq [Al Batinah South Governorate], the areas bearing the brunt of the devastation. Many hectares are under the attack." Tomato is the leading vegetable crop grown in the sultanate, and the losses could run into millions of rials.

Kharusi said that the infection started mid-January [2013] in Barka before spreading to other areas. MoAF supplied 2 kinds of pesticides but couldn't stem the spread of the disease.

[A] wholesaler said, "We are importing tomatoes from Jordan [but] there has been pressure [because of] transportation costs."

[Late blight of tomato and potato is caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can affect leaves, stems, and fruit of tomato causing spots, lesions, and rotting, and in potato it affects leaves as well as tubers. The disease can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. It is spread by contaminated plant and other material, wind, and water. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include phytosanitary measures, removal of pathogen reservoirs (solanaceous weeds, volunteer crop plants), limiting free moisture in the crop, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material (tomato transplants, potato seed tubers), fungicide sprays of crops, and crop rotation. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight.

Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. Clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks in the future. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.
