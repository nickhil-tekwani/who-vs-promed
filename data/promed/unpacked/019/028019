Forward:
I was happy to hear that my work has generated discussion and would be
delighted to collaborate with anyone interested on this, or other,
remarkable organisms. Feedback is always welcome. In addition to ongoing
disinfection studies, we are actively involved in concentration of
environmental _H. pylori_ using immunomagnetic separation for novel
inductive culture methods. [JPH
On Fragility & Persistence:
_Helicobacter pylori's_ gastric niche is likely tissue specific, as aside
from the stomach, it has been found in intestinal Meckel's diverticulum
lined by gastric body type mucosa showing evidence of active chronic
gastritis with the presence of H. pylori (Hill P. et al. 1998). While the
intestinal tract is not typically colonized by this species, recent work
indicates that _H. pylori_ is far from being a fragile organism. It harbors
numerous virulence factors including urease, cytotoxins, proteases,
flagella, adhesins, e iron acquisition systems, heat shock proteins,
catalase, SOD, AHP, shedding of surface proteins and a poorly reactive LPS.
Recent chlorination studies by the EPA reported a three-fold greater
resistance to chlorine disinfection of water-borne _H. pylori_ than
_Escherichia coli_, the standard water quality indicator organism (Johnson
et al. 1997).
My current work based on a natural water system has found this to be a
considerable underestimation (in preparation). It is has been shown that
_H. pylori_ can persist for months in a low nutrient environment similar to
that of surface water (Shahamat, M. et al 1993) and H. pylori specific
sequences have been amplified using PCR and RT-PCR from municipal water in
Peru (Hulten, K. et al. 1996).
Working Limitations:
Enumeration of _H. pylori_ in environmental samples is confounded by the
lack of a standard procedure for the detection. Attempts to culture the
organism directly from water samples (Hulten, K. et al. 1996) have been
unsuccessful due to the overgrowth of interfering organisms on the rich
media used for this organism. In addition, _H. pylori_ has been shown to
enter a viable but nonculturable (VNC) state in water (West, A. P. et al.,
1992). Under these circumstances, the organism would not be recovered by
traditional culture techniques. _H. pylori_ PCR data has been limited to
the detection of specific sequences of nucleic acid without reference to
the presence of intact, respiring bacteria.
Methodology Summary:
Actively respiring _H. pylori_ were enumerated using combined fluorescent
antibody - cyanoditoyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) staining. Water samples
were incubated with 2 mM CTC for 30 minutes. After filtration (10 to 100 mL
depending the amount of particulate matter in the water) onto a 0.2um pore
polycarbonate black filter, the cells were stained using an indirect
fluorescent antibody staining procedure. Monoclonal mouse
anti-_Helicobacter pylori_ was the primary antibody. This antibody
demonstrated no cross-reactivity with a panel of _Enterobacteriaceae_,
surface water coliform isolates, or other known _Helicobacter_ species.
Secondary antibody was FITC goat-anti-mouse IgG gamma fragment specific
FITC conjugate. Stained samples were examined using a Leitz Laborlux D
microscope with epifluorescent illumination. It is important to note that
absolute specificity of antibody preparations used in the examination of
environmental samples cannot ever be unequivocally demonstrated. The
possibility of cross-reactivity of the antibody with an organism other than
_H. pylori_ must therefore be considered. To control for possible
cross-reactivity, enumeration of _H. pylori_ was done in an extremely
conservative manner. _H. pylori_ were identified on the basis of the three
criteria: intensity of the fluorescence, size, and shape. Actively
respiring _H. pylori_ contained a red fluorescent formazan crystal within
the cell.
Results Summary:
Actively respiring microorganisms binding monoclonal anti-_Helicobacter
pylori_ antibody were found in the majority of surface and shallow
groundwater (with surface water infiltration) samples tested (n=46) from
Pennsylvania and Ohio. There was a statistically significant, but low
correlation, between the number of total coliforms in water samples and the
number of actively-respiring _H. pylori_. No significant correlation
between the presence of _E. coli_ and _H. pylori_ was observed. The lack of
a correlation between the presence of _E. coli_ and _H. pylori_ in the
samples examined indicates that the use of _E. coli_ for the determination
of the potability of water may fail to protect individuals from infection
with _H. pylori_. In addition, the lack of association may indicate that
_H. pylori_ is able to survive longer in freshwater environments than _E.
coli_, or even that _H. pylori_ is part of the normal microbiota of many
freshwater environments. Our results indicate that _H. pylori_ may commonly
occur in aquatic environments, providing evidence for a water-borne route
of transmission.
