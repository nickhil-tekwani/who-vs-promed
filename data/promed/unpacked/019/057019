The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is closely following an
announcement by the FDA about certain jars of Earth's Best Organic 2
Apple Peach Barley Wholesome Breakfast baby food. There is a risk
that this product is contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_.
Toxins produced by this bacteria may cause botulism, a
life-threatening illness.
The FDA has confirmed that there were no direct retail sales to
Canadian consumers of the recalled product. However, this product has
been available through internet sales. The CFIA is warning the public
not to consume the product.
There have been no known illnesses reported in Canada or the USA
linked to this product.
