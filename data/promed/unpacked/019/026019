Russia: 30 Cases of Hepatitis A Registered in Nizhniy Novgorod Yesterday
-----------------------------------------------
In total, 2039 cases of hepatitis A have been recorded in Nizhniy
Novgorod since the commencement of the outbreak on 5 Sep 2005,
including 319 children under 14 years of age. At present, 591
patients are in hospitals in the city of Nizhniy Novgorod. Yesterday
[18 Oct 2005], 30 more persons, including 7 children, were admitted
to the hospital on suspicion of hepatitis A virus infection. The
territorial office of the Russian (Health) Protection Agency
(Rospotrebnadzor) also announced today [19 Oct 2005] that 69 people
had been discharged from the hospital. "Transmission of infection is
now occurring by contact in the community; i.e. secondary
contamination. But it is too early to speak about a 2nd wave of
disease," Ravil Tamashin, the press-secretary of Rospotrebnadzor, stated.
Preventive and anti-epidemic measures are continuing. According to
Rospotrebnadzor, 67 889 persons have been vaccinated against
hepatitis A in Nizhniy Novgorod.

[This remains a very serious outbreak of disease. Since the previous
report of 11 Oct 2005, there have been an additional 310 cases of
hepatitis A in the Nizhniy Novgorod region, compared with 291 in the
preceding 10 days. Thus, the improvement in containment of the
outbreak noted in "Hepatitis A - Russia (Nizhniy Novgorod) (05)" has
not been maintained. These figures suggest that the source of the
outbreak may not have been identified and dealt with appropriately.
However, the extensive program of vaccination should bring about some
relief, gradually. - Mod.CP]
