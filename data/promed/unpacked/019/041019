Re: WHO's advisory on epidemic potential in Kosovo
(see ref. above)
We have enough understanding and foresight now to predict this
[sort of thing] is going to happen. Why not have health agencies --
from local (whatever is left of them) to national to international to
world -- poised for when the conflict ends to intervene and attempt
to "cut 'em off at the pass"?
True, I am unaware of the logistics necessary to accomplish such
a thing. But we are able to muster the resources to intervene
AFTER the fact.... Why not put it together BEFORE it happens,
when you know it's going to happen?
When, and where, in the world is someone going to "bite" at my
suggestion that we need to/can develop predictive capability for
emerging infectious diseases?

[A lot of people are working on predictive models based on GIS
(geographic information systems) aimed at correlating disease
endemicity with weather patterns & disaster scenarios (would SAIC
care to comment about CATS?). Hopefully, these will soon be good
enough to be able to forecast the probable need for preventive &
therapeutic measures post-conflict - Mod.JW]
