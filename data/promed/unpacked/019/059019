GL Food Wholesale, Golden Dharma International Corp., Waylong Marketing, and Mandalay Trading Corporation are recalling Tausi Brand Salted Black Beans because they may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ or other spoilage organisms. The recalls were announced in the weekly FDA enforcement report. There are 3 separate recalls because the product codes and "best by" dates are different and because the distribution of the product is different for each firm.

The beans are in a 180 gram (6.34 ounce) package, 100 cans to the carton. The product is in a 2-piece can with a single seam. The can is wrapped with a label containing red, yellow, and black text.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

It should be noted that the FDA has just approved the 1st heptavalent equine derived botulinum antiserum for the treatment of botulism disease http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm345128.htm. - Mod.LL
