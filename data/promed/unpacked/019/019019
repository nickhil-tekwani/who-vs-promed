Key Indicators and numbers:
- Total suspected cases 172
- Total deaths 1
- Confirmed cases 61
- Total samples received for diagnosis 160
- States that have reported at least one suspected case (including FCT) 23
- Health worker infection 1

Highlights
- The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) continued to coordinate the response through its activated Emergency Operations Centre (EOC)
- However, the monkeypox EOC has been deactivated this week and the response will henceforth be coordinated by a technical working group comprising of all existing response partners
- 61 confirmed cases and 2 probable cases recorded since the onset of the outbreak
- One new suspected case reported from Adamawa State in the reporting week
- NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja continued laboratory diagnosis of monkeypox with improved turn-around time
- There has been a decline in the number of new suspected cases reported over the last 5 weeks
- Since the onset of the outbreak, a total of 172 cases (suspected, confirmed and probable) have been recorded from 22 States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)
- One death has been recorded in a confirmed case with background immune-compromised condition
- To enhance data management and realtime mapping of cases and contacts, the Surveillance and Outbreak Response Management System (SORMAS) app was deployed on [Sat 4 Nov 2017] to the outbreak.

Epidemiological summary
- 2 new confirmed cases were recorded in the reporting week from Bayelsa.
- Out of a total of 167 suspected cases reported from 22 States and the FCT 61 cases have been confirmed in 14 States
- Clustering of cases was demonstrated in some instances. However, no known evidence yet of epidemiological linkages across States
- Preliminary genetic sequencing suggests multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into human population
- The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 3:1
- The most affected age group is 21-40 years (Median Age = 30)
- One death has been recorded from a confirmed case with background immunosuppressive illness 11 (7 percent) out of 149 contact listed became cases demonstrating human to human infection. One infection in a health care worker managing cases has been confirmed

[The widespread nature of this monkeypox outbreak is unusual with 61 confirmed cases in 14 states. Human to human transmission is also unusual, with there being one published report of that occurring in the Republic of the Congo. The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak is not mentioned. With just one reported fatality, and that one in an immunosuppressed individual, the West Africa clade may be the one involved in this outbreak. The question remains about the source of these infections. With no cross-state relationships of cases and preliminary genetic sequencing suggesting multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into human population, one wonders is there is a MPX epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area. Studies of prevalence of MPX in rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
