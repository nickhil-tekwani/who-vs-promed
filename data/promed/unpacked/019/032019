[This is but the formal report to Paris of what we reported last week (see 15 Aug 2018 Anthrax - Kyrgyzstan (03): (OH) human, livestock 20180815.5968018). It is interesting to see that the Kyrgyz veterinary services regarded this outbreak as affecting the whole village and not just the singular herd. Very correct action to take. The absence of any references to any human cases would suggest that the dozen people taken to the hospital for prophylactic antibiotic treatment never developed any symptoms. - Mod.MHJ
