A New York food processor has recalled broiled chicken liver products
that have been linked to at least 169 _Salmonella_ Heidelberg
infections in 5 states, according to the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) and state health departments. The recall applies to an
undetermined amount of broiled chicken livers produced by Schreiber
Processing Corp., based in Maspeth, NY, the USDA Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS) said yesterday, 8 Nov 2011, in a statement.
It said the products appear to be ready to eat but are partially
cooked and need to be fully cooked before eaten. It said illnesses
have also been linked to chopped liver made from the product and sold
at retail stores.

The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDHMH)
said today that it has identified 56 _S._ Heidelberg infections in the
city linked to the company's MealMart brand kosher broiled chicken
livers. It said illnesses have also been identified in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Minnesota.

In addition, 33 more cases have been identified in the state outside
New York City, Peter Constantakes, a spokesman with the New York State
Department of Health, told CIDRAP News. He added that the patients are
from 9 different upstate counties and that 5 were hospitalized.

Meanwhile, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services
(NJDHSS) said today, 9 Nov 2011, that it has identified 64 cases with
links to the recalled products. It said most of the sick patients are
from Ocean County. Donna Leusner, the department's spokeswoman, told
CIDRAP News that about 11 percent of the patients were hospitalized
and 48 percent are female.

Maryland health officials have received reports of 9 cases linked to
the outbreak, including 7 adults and 2 children, according to an
e-mail response from Karen Black, a spokeswoman for the Maryland
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. She said the cases occurred
from late March 2011 to early September 2011 and that no deaths or
hospitalizations have been reported.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDH) has confirmed 7
outbreak-related cases that occurred from April through August 2011,
according to Tom Hostetter, a press aide at the PDH.

New York City's health department said it identified a pattern of
people reporting that they ate kosher broiled chicken livers or
chopped liver before they got sick, and investigators recently
confirmed that _S._ Heidelberg infections identified from February
through November 2011 had the same genetic fingerprint. The NYCDHMH
[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene] said 12 people
were hospitalized.

The FSIS said testing by the New York State Department of Agriculture
and Markets identified the outbreak strain in samples of the company's
broiled chicken livers and in samples of chopped liver made from the
same products.

The products were sold in 10-pound boxes that contained 2 5-pound bags
of chicken livers made for further processing or loose-packed broiled
chicken livers. The NYCDHMH warned that the broiled chicken livers are
often repackaged and sold in smaller quantities or are used to prepare
chopped liver sold at deli-style establishments.

According to an NYCDHMH list of facilities that received the recalled
products, most are in New York or New Jersey. However, the broiled
chicken livers were also shipped to 2 cities in Pennsylvania, 1 in
Maryland, and 1 in Minnesota.

The FSIS said the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern for the
outbreak strain of _S._ Heidelberg does not match the one linked to a
recall earlier this year [2011] involving ground turkey. It's not
known yet if the outbreak strain has any drug resistance

[The number of cases reported has risen substantially since yesterday
(9 Nov 2011) but most, if not all, are not current cases. It is
unclear if any of the "smoking" chicken livers (livers found to harbor
the outbreak strain) are still in circulation since much appears to
have been repackaged. - Mod.LL]
