A "mystery" disease that has caused more than 150 deaths in several remote
Afghan villages has been initially identified as a respiratory ailment, the
World Health Organization said Friday.
A team which reached JamarjeBala in northeast Afghanistan to investigate
said there was no evidence of plague, malaria, cholera and typhus, the WHO
said in Geneva.
There have been between 50 and 60 deaths in the village since January 10.
The suspicion is that that deaths were caused by secondary infections. The
symptoms are those of influenza, the WHO said.
Local health authorities had told the WHO that around 2,000 people in
almost 20 villages had suffered from fever, aches, vomiting and diarrhea,
with at least 150 deaths.
Health specialists plan to stay in the field until Sunday, the WHO said.
