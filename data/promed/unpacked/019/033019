3 people who had traveled to Myanmar tested positive for typhoid in Feb 2013, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said. 2 students and a businessman who visited Myanmar in December 2012, and in January 2013 began to develop symptoms, including fever, headache, diarrhea and loss of appetite in February 2013.

Laboratory tests confirmed that all had typhoid fever, the CDC said. All were hospitalized, and 2 have since been discharged, it added. The center has traced and examined the 73 people who have had contact with the patients. None have developed typhoid-related symptoms. That brings the total of typhoid cases in 2013 to 5; the other 2 patients had traveled to Indonesia.

There were 29 confirmed cases of imported typhoid fever, mainly from Indonesia, Myanmar, India, and the Philippines, over the past 3 years: 11 in 2010, 7 in 2011 and 11 in 2012.

Luo I-chun, a physician specializing in disease prevention at the center, advised people traveling to Southeast Asia to pay attention to personal hygiene and food sanitation and to avoid uncooked food such as salads.

"Salads may be contaminated by unwashed hands or bacteria-carrying flies. Travelers are also advised to drink bottled water," Luo said. Luo also suggested getting vaccinated before traveling to these areas. "There are 12 travel medical clinics where people can get vaccinated," Luo said, adding that travelers have to be at least 2 years old to receive the vaccine.

[2] Zimbabwe (Harare)

Zimbabwe's capital city Harare has encountered a catastrophic outbreak of the typhoid disease that has spread across the city killing people in the way.

7 people have already died in barely 6 months as the waterborne disease largely attributed to the city's dirty waters rose to become a national disaster. This comes as it was reported that for several years people have been drinking faeces from the council supplied waters. Since the end of 2012, the city of Harare and surrounding areas are yet again faced with a spike of typhoid and diarrhea. The official cumulative figures for typhoid since October 2011 are 6843 suspected and 142 confirmed patients with typhoid and 7 deaths, reports by the Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) reveal.

In this latest period of an outbreak that 1st started in October 2011, health authorities recorded over 3525 patients with suspected typhoid fever and 5 deaths since November 2012 -- in the city of Harare alone.

Typhoid is a bacterial, water-borne disease transmitted by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with feces of an infected person. This happens in conditions of poor sanitation, and poor supply of clean water. In areas where sanitary facilities are well developed and maintained, there has been virtual elimination of typhoid. In many parts of Harare, water supplies are still irregular as taps remained dry most of the time leaving people with no option but to rely on wells. Especially in suburbs like Mbare, water and sanitation conditions are favourable to water-borne diseases like cholera and typhoid.

"Our biggest fear is a cholera outbreak in the city," says Harare City Council Director of Health Services Dr Prosper Chonzi. "But we hope with support from partners such as the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization, MSF and other actors involved in water and sanitation issues we can avert this."

Health education and hygiene promotion activities were ongoing around Harare, he adds, especially in areas which have not been affected by the outbreak. Fortunately, the number of people affected seems to be decreasing as of late.
