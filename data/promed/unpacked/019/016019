With this year's [2013] 1st death suspected to be caused by acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) reported in Bihar, the fear of an outbreak of the deadly mosquito borne disease has returned to haunt the state, an official said Tuesday [30 Apr 2013].

[A] one year old child died Monday [29 Apr 2013] of suspected AES at the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, about 70 km [45 mi] from [Patna].

The child's father, a resident of Sirsia Kalyanpur village in East Champaran district, said she was admitted to the hospital after her condition deteriorated.

A district health official in Muzaffarpur said that 10 children with suspected AES were admitted to various hospitals in the district in the last 2 days. While 3 children have been admitted to the Kejriwal Hospital, 7 are undergoing treatment in SKMCH, the official said.

"Every year, encephalitis hits Muzaffarpur, Gaya and other neighbouring districts in May or June. But this year [2013] it seems to have hit a little early," a health department official [in Patna] said.

Last year [2012], the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) killed nearly 240 children in Muzaffarpur and Gaya districts.

AES is a severe case of encephalitis characterised by inflammation of the brain.

Last week [week of 22 Apr 2013], the state government had launched a special vaccination drive to cover 1.8 million children against Japanese encephalitis [JE virus infection]

[Encephalitis cases normally increase during the monsoon season. So fat this year (2013) acute encephalitis (AES) has claimed 38 lives and affected 118 persons even before the onset of the usual disease season.

Interestingly, cases of encephalitis have occurred this year (2013) in several locations in eastern India. A 1 Apr 2013 ProMED-mail post (archive no 20130402.1615081) stated, "Encephalitis cases have already been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal in India this year, totalling 228 cases and 49 fatalities up to 19 Mar 2013. Of those cases, 7, all from West Bengal, were classified as Japanese encephalitis [virus infections]." There have also been cases in neighboring Bangladesh this year (2013).

AES has been attributed in part or entirely to Japanese encephalitis virus infections in northeastern India. However, in some instances, JE virus infections are reported to be responsible for a minority of the cases. Without knowing the specific etiology of the encephalitis cases above, targeted control measures will not be possible. Fortunately, the effective Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine provides an opportunity for prevention of some of these cases if applied before the main transmission season arrives.
