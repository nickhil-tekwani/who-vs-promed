Dr. Michelle Barron, medical director of infection prevention and control at UC Health University of Colorado Hospital, received an unusual call in June 2020 from the microbiology lab: Confirmation of the 3rd case in 2020 of trench fever, a rare condition transmitted by body lice that plagued soldiers during World War I.

Barron's epidemiological training kicked in. "Two is always an outbreak, and then when we found a 3rd, OK, we clearly have something going on," Barron recalled thinking. Barron, who said she'd never before seen a case in her 20 years here, contacted state public health officials, who issued an advisory and said a 4th person with a suspected case had been identified. They asked physicians to be on the lookout for other cases.

Trench fever is characterized by relapsing fever, bone pain (particularly in the shins), headache, nausea, vomiting and malaise. Some of those infected can develop skin lesions or a life-threatening infection of their heart valves. The condition is caused by the bacterium _Bartonella quintana_, a close relative of the microbe that causes cat scratch fever. Colonies of it live in the digestive systems of body lice and are excreted in their feces. The bugs can enter the body through a scratch in the skin or through the eyes or nose. Dried lice feces can be infectious for up to 12 months. Trench fever is most commonly diagnosed among people experiencing homelessness or living in conditions where good hygiene is difficult. Those with compromised immune systems are particularly at risk.

Public health officials are trying to find a common thread among the 4 cases identified so far in Colorado. They occurred months apart, and the patients appear to have no connection other than having been homeless in the Denver area. Other cases of the disease may have been overlooked. This outbreak comes, after all, at a time when much attention is being diverted to the coronavirus pandemic. But the economic fallout of that crisis could be fueling the outbreak of an illness that thrives on hardship.

Trench fever can be an easy diagnosis to miss, Barron said. Patients often have other health problems that could explain their symptoms, and doctors will try to rule out the more common causes before considering a rare one. Moreover, the bacteria grow very slowly in lab cultures; it can take up to 21 days, and labs usually discard cultures after 7 days. Barron said the bacteria in 2 of the confirmed cases grew just before the cell cultures were due to be thrown out.

Doctors will often treat the symptoms of a disease like trench fever with antimicrobials. If the patient heals, it's possible no tests will be pursued to determine the organism causing the illness, said Dr. Kristy Murray, an infectious disease specialist with Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. Nonetheless, in recent years, outbreaks have occurred in San Francisco and Seattle homeless camps.

A spike in body lice occurred during the 2008 recession, he said, and before that, during the Great Depression and the 2 world wars. The current economic and health disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to another increase.

Murray said an outbreak often can be interrupted with outreach to homeless shelters and other groups that provide services to those living on the street. Mobile showers or offering to launder or replace their clothes can help. Body lice can be killed by washing and drying clothes at high temperatures -- at least 130 F [54 C].

The pesticide permethrin can also be used to treat clothing, bedding, and backpacks to prevent lice infestation. Most people don't need to worry though: According to the CDC, infestation is unlikely to persist on anyone who bathes regularly and switches to clean clothes and bedding every week.

The history of this illness is presented below, extracted from Foucault C, Brouqui P, Raoult D: _Bartonella quintana_ characteristics and clinical management. Emerg Infect Dis 2006; 12: 217-23 (the references and entire paper can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3373112/:

Trench fever, the 1st clinical manifestation attributed to _Bartonella quintana_, affected over an estimated million people during World War I (1,2). The name "trench fever" was mentioned for the 1st time in 1915 (3,4). In 1916, McNee et al. described 2 types of the disease (5). The 1st was characterized by a sudden onset of headache, dizziness, pain in the shins, and elevated temperature (39-40 C [102-104 F]). Between days 3 and 7, temperature would suddenly drop to normal or subnormal. Thereafter, temperature rose sharply before falling again. The 2nd manifestation of the disease was characterized by a shorter initial period and frequent relapses. In 1919, 200 consecutive cases were recorded by Byam et al., and transmission by human body lice was demonstrated, but the nature of the trench fever agent was still unknown (4).

Trench fever was precisely described based on experimental infections in volunteer soldiers (4). The 1st experiments consisted of transmitting whole blood from typical cases to volunteers, which reproduced natural infection. Byam confirmed in 1919 the others' work, showing that "rickettsia bodies" were present in lice, their excreta, and their guts when they were collected from trench fever patients. In 1949, Kostrzewski precisely described trench fever after an accidental epidemic spread among louse-feeders in laboratories that produced typhus vaccine (6). Of 104 persons who worked with lice, 90 contracted symptomatic trench fever, and 5 were asymptomatic carriers. Three different courses of trench fever were described by Kostrzewski: the classic relapsing form associated with shin pain, headaches, and dizziness; the typhoidal form characterized by a prolonged fever, splenomegaly, and rash; and the abortive form, characterized by a brief, less intense course.

After World War I, the incidence of trench fever decreased dramatically, but during World War II, epidemics were again reported (6). More recently, reports have indicated the reemergence of _B. quintana_ infections among the homeless population in cities in both Europe and the United States (7,8). Major predisposing factors for new _B. quintana_ infections include poor living conditions and chronic alcoholism (8). Epidemics of trench fever were also recently reported in particular conditions, such as in refugee camps in Burundi in 1997, where pediculosis was prevalent (1). - Mod.LL
