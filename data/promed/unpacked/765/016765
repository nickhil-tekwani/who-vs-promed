Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (infection with) (non-poultry including wild birds), Iran
----------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 5 Feb 2018 from Dr Alireza Rafiepoor, Head of Iran Veterinary Organization (IVO), Iran Veterinary Organization (IVO), Ministry of Jihad-e-Agriculture, Tehran, Iran

Date of confirmation of the event: 4 Feb 2018
Reason for notification: New strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza [AI] virus
Serotype: H5N6
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Boujagh, Kiashahr, Gilan
Date of start of the outbreak: 31 Jan 2018
Outbreak status: resolved on 4 Feb 2018
Epidemiological unit: Natural park
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Gadwall: _Anas strepera_(Anatidae) / 50 000 / 1300 / 1200 / 100 / 0
Affected population: Wild ducks in Boujagh Natural Park

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Gadwall: _Anas strepera_(Anatidae) / 2.60 / 2.40 / 92.31 / 2.60
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species

Epidemiological comments: [On 31 Jan 2018], unexpected mortality was reported in Bojagh, Kiashar area, in the north of Iran, where migratory birds spend their wintering season. [On 4 Feb 2018], the Iran veterinary national reference laboratory confirmed HPAI virus H5N6 in the samples collected from the sick and dead birds. The Iran Veterinary Organization (IVO) will continue to monitor the situation in the area closely and to advise poultry flock owners, including owners of backyard poultry, to remain vigilant to the threat of avian influenza and implement strategic, ongoing biosecurity measures, in particular feeding birds indoors or under cover, and discouraging wild birds from the poultry premises.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, quarantine, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, control of wildlife reservoirs, selective killing and disposal, zoning, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Gilan Veterinary Laboratory (Local laboratory) / Gadwall / real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 1 Feb 2018 / Positive
Central Veterinary Laboratory of Iran Veterinary Organization (CVL) (national laboratory) / Gadwall / real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 4 Feb 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Of interest for this event is the high case fatality rate (92.31 percent), which is unusual in wild birds. It would appear that this HPAI H5N6 strain this season is more virulent than the H5N6 reported during the 2016-17 winter.

"Wild birds can normally carry AI viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts, but they do not usually get sick. They have historically been known as reservoirs and vectors of AI viruses. Around the world, surveillance measures have been put in place to monitor the occurrence and characteristics of AI viruses in wild birds. It is common to find influenza viruses in wild birds during routine testing. The majority of these viruses do not cause disease in wild birds" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/PortailAI/EN_QA%20Jan2017.pdf.

"Wild birds, as natural hosts and reservoirs for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seem to pass easily between different bird species.

The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year. Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.

Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds and, consequently, is key to decreasing the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans" http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/web-portal-on-avian-influenza/about-ai/. - Mod.CRD
