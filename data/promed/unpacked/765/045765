Chhattisgarh: Over 50 people in village of 800 die of mystery illness in Sukma
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 50 people have died from a mysterious ailment in a remote village in Sukma district of Bastar in a short span of time, triggering alarm in nearby areas.

While local media reports put the death toll in Regdagatta village at 61 over a 6-month period, the administration says there were 50-52 deaths, spread over 2 years. Even then, it's alarming 50 people in a village of 800 have died without their families getting to know what killed them.

The disease causes swelling in the feet and limbs and nausea, but a cause hasn't been identified yet. Health authorities are scrambling to diagnose the disease. Samples of those ailing have been taken for tests. Soil and water from the village are also being tested.

Regadgatta is around 100 km [62 mi] from the Sukma district headquarters and close to the Odisha and Telangana borders. Organising health camps in this inaccessible region in the peak of monsoon is a massive challenge. This is why the deaths had gone unnoticed for months until there were so many that news trickled out to local mediapersons and the district headquarters was alerted 2 days ago.

Sukma collector Harish S confirmed the deaths and the symptoms -- swelling of extremities, vomiting and uneasiness. Preliminary lab reports of water and soil samples show higher-than-permissible fluoride content in 2 hand pumps and high iron content as well in one of them.

People of Regadgatta have been advised not to use the water from these hand pumps. Haris said 41 people, including some asymptomatic, have been brought to the Sukma district hospital. Fourteen of them have been detected with a kidney ailment and they are being treated. Health officials are carrying out regular follow-ups, he said, adding that a medical team has already reached the village to collect blood samples which are being sent to a lab in Nagpur.

Health department spokesman Dr Subhash Mishra said they suspect the illness is caused by consumption of water with high fluoride and iron content. "We are carrying out extensive tests to identify the exact cause of the disease," he said. Reaching the village is an ordeal for health workers. The nearest block is Konta, a Maoist hotspot, around 25 km away.

The only way to get anywhere close to Regadgatta is on motorcycles after fording several rivulets. Sometimes, the rivulets are so fast-flowing that it's impossible to get to the other side. There is no road for the last few kilometres and you have to walk. The deaths in Regadgatta village are chillingly similar to the unrelenting nightmare in Supebeda village of Gariaband district, 360 km [224 mi] away, where more than 130 deaths have been reported due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nearly 80% families in the village of 1800 people have kidney patients. The state government has introduced a water treatment facility in the village.

'Unknown' illness kills 61 in 3 years at Chhattisgarh's Sukma village
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The residents of Regadgatta village in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh have claimed that nearly 61 villagers have died in the last 3 years due to an "unknown" illness. The village, located in Konta development block, raised the issue with district authorities who swung into action to know what exactly caused these deaths.

The authorities said that according to preliminary investigations 47 deaths were registered due to reasons like ailments and natural causes.

The officials will send a team of specialists on 8 Aug 2022 for an in-depth study of the village and its environment. They are currently waiting for a detailed report to identify heavy metal content like arsenic in water or soil. Around 130 families are residing in the village which has a population of more than 1000 people.

The villagers also handed over a letter to Sukma District Collector on 27 Jul 2022, claiming 61 people including young men, and women have died since 2020. The people who passed away had symptoms of swelling on their hands and legs.

After the issue was raised by locals, a team of healthcare personnel and other experts were sent there last week, Sukma collector Harish S told the news agency PTI.

"Preliminary investigation suggests that 47 people died in that village in the last 3 years but all of them did not die due to the same reason as claimed by the locals," he told PTI.

"Some of the deceased had swelling on their bodies and it could be due to different reasons. Preliminary reports of samples of water sources concluded that fluoride level was more than the limit in 2 water sources while in some sources, iron content was in excess," he said.

"But as of now, we cannot say that the deaths were caused due to heavy metal content in water as consumption of water carrying high fluoride causes bone weakness and there are no such symptoms in the local population," he said.

"Even high iron content causes complications but sudden deaths cannot happen due to it. There could be other environmental causes. Chronic alcoholic behavior among the population could also be also a possibility (for kidney related ailments), he added. A detailed report to identify heavy metal content like arsenic in water and soil there is awaited," he said.

The team which visited the village conducted medical examinations, in which 41 people were found with swelling on their bodies. They were also suffering from kidney-related problems.

The examination of the villagers revealed high uric acid and creatinine levels. They are being provided treatment and their condition was stable.

"Of them, 2 highly anaemic patients were admitted to Sukma district hospital," he added.

"Preliminary investigation shows 15 deaths took place in the village this year [2022] due to multiple reasons, including renal diseases, old-age related problems and malaria. How many of them died due to renal diseases cannot be confirmed as of now" District Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) Yashwant Dhruv told news agency PTI.

"Out of 20 water sources examined, fluoride content was found to be high in 2 hand pumps following which they were shut for use while villagers have been advised to not use 8 water sources for drinking purpose as iron content in them was excess the limit," he told PTI.

Some of the villagers have mild symptoms of chronic renal disease and further tests are underway. An ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife) was recently appointed at a sub health centre there.

[There are numerous articles on the internet about this malady. It also appears to be occurring in other countries, and information about it can be found in the archives of ProMED (see alsos below).

According to http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/uddanam-nephropathy-what-andhras-mysterious-kidney-disease-55228: "Symptoms included hypertension and diabetes, followed by a long asymptomatic period, and later diagnosed with excess proteins in the urine, decreased red blood cell count, and high levels of uric acid in the blood."

The phenomenon was discussed and termed Uddanam nephropathy at the 2013 International Congress of Nephrology held in Hong Kong.

"Although the association of specific occupations with endemic nephropathy has highlighted the issue of environmental toxins and heat stress, the exact cause of Uddanam nephropathy is still an enigma," writes Anirban Ganguli of Georgetown University in the May 2016 issue of the American Journal of Kidney Disease.

"While chemical analyses of cultivated rice or drinking water from the endemic region have been negative, the concern of environmental pollution with organo-chemical pesticides and heavy metals remains, because this was not assessed in these studies," he adds.

In 2011, a group of researchers studied the drinking water sources of these villages, and "the presence of phenols and mercury in drinking water was found to be very high. ... Phenols and mercury, being very toxic in their characteristic nature, are bio-accumulative. Hence, these waters are found not suitable for potable purposes."

Researchers initially pinpointed "excessive levels of silica in water" as the cause after a preliminary round of examination.

"According to the World Health Organization, this is one of the 3 regions in the world with the highest concentration of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) after Sri Lanka and Nicaragua."

This disease has also been theorized to involve massive dehydration in these individuals. In several regions, there has been heavy metal testing, pesticide testing, and general toxicology screening, but thus far, there are a variety of concentrations of a variety of toxins. However, even taken in total, there does not seem to be enough to be called the actual cause of this disease. I think there have been some examinations of looking at the multiple things found in drinking waters of these various locations, as well as dehydration, but a consensus of the cause has not yet been determined.

In the meantime, this is a scary and sad situation for the families involved. Men are more prone to it, as well as those who are more likely to be agricultural workers, and they are the primary providers for their families. Fathers and sons in the same family have worked in the same conditions and been equally affected.

If this disease were not spread over such a large region and multiple countries one might wonder whether there is a genetic link. The vast regions of this condition may negate that theory, or their genetic link is thousands of years old and has not been discovered.

We hope the researchers will find the cause, treatment, and cure for this horrible situation. It has now been occurring for approximately 10 years. There seems to be little improvement. - Mod.TG
