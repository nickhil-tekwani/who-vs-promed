TRICHINELLOSIS, LYNX - SWITZERLAND

The lynx was re-introduced in Switzerland approximately decade ago, and the
lynx population has constantly increased and the populated area spread
since then. Dead lynx carcasses are investigated pathologically and
microbiologically on a regular basis, with special attention to potential
zoonotic parameters. One of the prey rather frequently consumed by lynxes
is the red fox. In Switzerland, the red fox has been shown to be the only
Trichinella-affected host, so far, as _Trichinella_ spp. does not occur in
pigs for multiple decades anymore. The Trichinella species present in the
Swiss fox was identified as _Trichinella britovi_ a few years ago. Since
1998, we have investigated 19 lynxes at necropsy for parasites. Five of
them (26%) were diagnosed to harbour Trichinella muscle stage larvae. Using
PCR (Polymerase chain reaction), all 5 isolates could be identified as
_Trichinella britovi_. The mode of transmission is believed to be direct,
by consumption of dead foxes by the lynx. The same mode may also have been
responsible for the transmission of sarcoptic mange, which has spread among
foxes for the past years and has now been found for the first time in a
Swiss lynx a few weeks ago.
