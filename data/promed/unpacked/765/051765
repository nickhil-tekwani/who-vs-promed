Kenya: Rift Valley fever Claims More Lives
-----------------------------------------------
Six people have died of the killer Rift Valley fever in Tana River
district, as the disease continues to takes its toll in parts of North
Eastern Kenya. Coast Provincial Veterinary Services Director Dr. George
Makalo on Fri 29 Dec 2006 said the deaths were revealed at a district
disaster management meeting at Hola in Tana River today [Mon 1 Jan 2007].
Makalo also said 125 goats, 28 camels and 14 sheep died from the fever in
Bangale and Madogo divisions, which neighbor Garissa, where the disease has
killed more than 10 people. Makalo said that, owing to the deaths of some
villagers, the whole district has been put under quarantine, while all the
slaughterhouses have been closed down.
A team of experts from Nairobi is in Tana River to survey and work out ways
of containing the disease.

Kenya: Rift Valley Fever kills 52 in Kenya
-----------------------------------------------
The Rift Valley Fever [outbreak] has claimed 2 more lives at the Sangailu
dispensary and Garissa Provincial General Hospital in Kenya's North Eastern
Province, raising the death toll to 52, Kenya News Agency reported Mon 1
Jan 2007. Four new cases of the fever have been recorded in Ijara and
Garissa Districts in the province, to bring the total number of cumulative
cases in the region to 105.
Addressing the press on Monday [1 Jan 2007], North Eastern Provincial
Medical Officer of Health Ahmed Omar said that one death has occurred at
Sangailu dispensary, while patients from Bilbil in Tana River District in
Coast Province succumbed to the disease at the Garissa Provincial General
Hospital last night [31 Dec 2006].
He said teams of 10 doctors were dispatched Monday [1 Jan 2007] morning to
support other doctors on the ground to prevent the killer disease from
spreading further. Three of the 4 new cases are recorded in Ijara, while
the other is from Garissa District. Omar said that due to the vastness of
the province, it was difficult to tell whether the disease was under
control, adding that he was waiting for reports from doctors on the ground
tomorrow [2 Jan 2007]. He decried the impassability of roads in the region
and the nomadic lifestyle of the local community, adding that the twin
problems have hampered government efforts to control disease once and for all.
Rift Valley Fever is endemic in Africa, naturally occurring in livestock
but occasionally affecting humans. Animals are infected with the virus by
the _Aedes_ mosquito. The disease, characterized by bleeding from all
orifices, is spread to humans in a number of ways: from infected
mosquitoes; through contact with blood or other body fluids; or from the
organs of infected animals. Symptoms of the disease include fever, general
weakness and malaise, cough and diarrhea, with severe cases progressing to
show facial swelling and bleeding from the orifices. The incubation period
(interval from infection to onset of symptoms) of Rift Valley Fever varies
from 2 to 6 days.
The fever mainly occurs following periods of heavy rainfall. In 1998, an
outbreak claimed at least 200 lives in the North Eastern Province following
the El Nino rains. Kenya's North Eastern and Coast provinces also
experienced heavy rainfall in November and December this year [2006], which
led to massive flooding affecting hundreds of thousands of people.
