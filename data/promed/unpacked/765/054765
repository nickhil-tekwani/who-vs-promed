A possible case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was admitted to the
Higueras Hospital in Talcahuano. According to the history, the case is
a man in serious condition, presenting with symptoms of the disease.
The Institute of Public Health is testing the samples.

The case is a 34-year-old man who works collecting rose hips in the
Copiulemu area where, presumably, he would have contracted this fatal
disease. Information was provided by the Health SEREMI [Regional
Ministerial Secretariat], Oscar Aliaga, who added that an
epidemiological investigation has now been initiated. The SEREMI added
that the Public Health Institute is carrying out all the tests to
corroborate the real health status of the man.

One recalls that last year [2010], 10 people in the region were
affected by [a] hantavirus [infection], of whom 9 were unable to
resist the powerful attack of the disease [and died]. So far this year
[2011], 2 cases have been registered, the 1st in the Pinto community
and the other in Los Angeles. The total is not at all positive: of
these 2 infected individuals, the 2 died due to the virus
[infection].

[As is usual for these types of reports from Chile, the specific
hantavirus involved with these cases of hantavirus infection is not
indicated. The virus most likely to be responsible for this case is
Andes virus, with the long-tailed pygmy rice rat as its rodent host.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
be seen at <http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg>.
