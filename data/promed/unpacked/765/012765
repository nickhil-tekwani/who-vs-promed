Two people have died, and several others are receiving treatment for suspected anthrax at Tharimu village in Maara, Tharaka-Nithi County, after feasting on a sick cow during the festive season. They reportedly fell ill after slaughtering and eating the animal on 20 Dec 2022. They are said to have eaten the meat after a local man who claimed to be a veterinary officer gave them the green light to do so.

Confirming the incident, Nkangani assistant chief Ms Mercy Mwenda said [NN], 64, and [DN], 60, died after eating the meat.

The owner of the cow said he intended to bury the carcass but that the "veterinary officer" had assured him the meat was safe for consumption. He said being the festive season, the meat was eaten by many people in the village. Some soon developed swelling and wounds on their bodies. "The cow was about to die when my son and 2 other people slaughtered it. They called on the man to test the meat, and he declared it safe for human consumption," the owner said.

A local resident said some people who consumed the meat are still healthy but that they are anxious about developing complications.

[It has been a while since the last confirmed outbreak of livestock anthrax in this county, but the article is indicative that "veterinary" advice was sought before butchering this cow. Clearly, the advice of the "officer", whether professional or opportunist, was wrong. An experienced veterinarian would have recognised the possibility of anthrax and initiated a laboratory check. Those also being treated at the hospital would have included some with cutaneous lesions. But it is Christmas and New Year and people party.

This incident is indicative of the probability that there have been other livestock deaths in the county and that the situation needs to be investigated and a vaccination programme initiated in and around villages with suspected outbreaks.

The risk from consuming anthrax-contaminated meat is an inverse function of the quality of the cooking. Chefs undercook beef leaving many spores alive; village cooks will overcook beef thereby killing the pathogen. Repeated culinary exposure to small doses can generate a level of immunity and protection, which unfortunately encourages eating such contaminated meat.

Tharaka-Nithi County is in central Kenya and part of what was once Eastern Province; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharaka-Nithi_County. With thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
