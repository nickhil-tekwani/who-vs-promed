Croatia's agriculture ministry says that country was to slaughter 3600
pigs Monday [23 Oct 2006] to prevent the spread of classic swine
fever. A story from Today Online says a new outbreak of the disease
was confirmed over the weekend with the initial deaths of 100 pigs on
a farm in the eastern part of that Balkans country.
Another outbreak of swine fever in Croatia was brought under control
in July [2006]. That outbreak led to the slaughter of 2500 pigs.
Swine fever is contagious in pigs, but doesn't affect other animal
species or humans.

Sep 2006, the source of the outbreaks or origin of infection in the
affected family-run pig farms was identified as contact with wild
boar. - Mod.AS]
