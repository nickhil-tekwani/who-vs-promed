A suspected case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been reported on a small cattle farm in Cheongdo, North Gyeongsang Province, government and industry officials said Tuesday [4 Dec 2012].

Lee Kyu-hwa, a senior official of Cheongdo County, said that preliminary quarantine measures had been taken since the case was reported to the local government at 9 a.m.

"The suspected cow shows symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease, such as an excessive drooling of saliva and a refusal to eat," he said, noting that a team of specialists were dispatched to the scene to collect samples from the cow.

Noh Dong-kwang, a senior manager of the Livestock Health Control Association (LHCA), said his agency dispatched 2 officials to the suspected site to prevent the possible spread of the acute, highly contagious viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals.

He said that only one of 8 cows that the farm raises was found to have symptoms. "It is the 1st suspected case of FMD this year [2012]," Noh said.

Another LHCA official said it was possible that the deadly virus could have been taken to the rural area by tourists from China, where thousands of pigs were culled following an outbreak of FMD late last month [November 2012].

"There is also the chance the cow contracted the fatal viral disease from a primitive burial site for pigs and cows after millions of livestock were culled and buried nationwide following the last outbreak of FMD in late November 2010, including in Cheongdo," he said.

"However, it is very unlikely that the same strain of the virus would have affected the cow as all cows here have been vaccinated against it."

The government estimates that the 2010-2011 massive outbreak of the disease led to a financial loss of some 7 trillion won (USD 6.46 billion) to livestock farmers and the culling of 3.4 million cows and pigs.

[Interestingly, 2 months after the seemingly accomplished eradication, in February 2011, of the major, country-wide FMD-O outbreak in South Korea, which had started in 2010, a new case of FMD emerged in a pig farm in North Gyeongsang province -- the same province where the current case is being suspected (see ProMED-mail posting 20110504.1376). North Gyeongsang Province, called in Korean Gyeongsangbuk-do (abbreviated Gyeongbuk), is located in eastern South Korea and can be seen on the map at http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/korea-south-admin-map.jpg.

The 2010/2011 epizootic (155 reported outbreaks) was eventually declared resolved on 22 Apr 2011. Since then, the South Korean Ministry of Agriculture has undertaken extensive efforts in the revision of its surveillance, prevention, and control plans, with considerable investments contemplated.

The recent outbreak in China, referred to in the newswire above, is located in China's north-western province Liaoning, bordering North Korea. Information on the current FMD situation in N. Korea is of interest.

Confirmation (or otherwise) of the described S. Korean case is anticipated. - Mod.AS
