There are fears that a deadly disease killing off brown bat
populations in the eastern United States is now spreading in Nova
Scotia.

White nose syndrome (WNS) has been confirmed in one dead bat in Nova
Scotia, but 6 others are being studied at the Atlantic Veterinary
College because scientists believe they have the fungus.

The disease was 1st confirmed in bats in New Brunswick and in Nova
Scotia in March 2011.

"Most of them have been retrieved in Hants County, which is the
epicentre of hibernating areas," Mark Elderkin, a Species-At-Risk
Biologist with Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources (DNR),
said Wednesday [11 May 2011]. "But we've found them in outlying areas
in Annapolis County and just today outside Wolfville."

Conservationists and scientists in Nova Scotia are watching the
situation develop with dread, fearing they are witnessing the outbreak
of a mass die-off.

"There is no disease that I am aware of that has had such
mass-continental range-wide collapse causally from a single factor.
There's a range collapse going with this. There's a numerical collapse
of bats that's unprecedented," Elderkin said.

"At best, perhaps we are going to be documentarians of a horrific
event. In the United States, it is estimated that white nose syndrome
has killed off one million bats. It's causing population collapse in
hibernacula, and local extinction is predicted for some species,"
Scott McBurney, a wildlife pathologist at the Canadian Cooperative
Wildlife Health Centre in Charlottetown, said.

McBurney performed necropsies on 2 bats this week from Nova Scotia.
He found lesions that indicate white nose syndrome. Results from
molecular testing are expected within a week to 10 days.

The fungus poses no health risk to humans, but the economic
consequences of a large bat mortality could be costly.

"Bats are major insect eaters. Our forestry industry depends on bats
eating some of those insects. Our agricultural industry relies on bats
eating insects to protect it," McBurney said. "Bats eat a lot
mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are nasty because they bite us, but they also
carry certain viral diseases."

In Nova Scotia, the public is being asked to stay out of caves and
mines to prevent the risk of spreading the disease, and to report bats
flying in daylight or any other abnormal behavior. Metal grates are
being installed to keep people out of bat caves. The hope is to keep
the fungus from being spread about via clothing and gear.

Since March 2011, scientists have surveyed 14 sites in Nova Scotia
where bats are known to spend the winter. None of the hibernating bats
showed signs of the fungus. The fact that 6 bats have been found dead
with suspected infection leads Mark Elderkin to predict a crisis next
year [2012]. He fears the fungus will make its way into hibernating
sites with disastrous consequences.

If the progression of this disease in the US is any indicator, then
the article's prediction of a crisis is, sadly, likely correct. The
fungal organism (_Geomyces destructans_) has been identified, but a
definitive treatment remains elusive. - Mod.TG]
