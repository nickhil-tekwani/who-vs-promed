State health officials say green whole head cabbage was the likely source of _Escherichia coli_ [O111] that sickened 15 people in Minnesota in July 2014. The Minnesota Department of Health said on Fri 29 Jul 2014 that the cabbage likely was contaminated before it was distributed to restaurants. Investigators were able to interview 14 of the cases. 13 of them ate at 9 different Applebee's restaurants in Minnesota, and one ate at a Yard House restaurant.

Many of those interviewed reported eating the Oriental chicken salad at Applebee's. That led Applebee's to temporarily pull the menu item from its Minnesota restaurants. The salad returned to the menu after Applebee's got different sources for the ingredients.

Minnesota officials traced the cabbage to a supplier outside of Minnesota and are working with federal investigators to identify the source.

[As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6).

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
