Farmers engaged in maize growing in Tororo District [Eastern Region] are counting losses over reported outbreaks of a maize disease. The district agricultural officer said that the bacterial leaf blight and stalk rot (_Pseudomonas avenae_) disease has affected farmers mainly in areas along River Malaba and in the eastern parts of the district.

The development could expose the entire district to food shortages since the area is one of the major food baskets. "Most maize is drying up just when the grains start to develop. It is unfortunate that farmers took long to report to their extension workers, who would have sought a solution," he said.

He said the team is yet to go to the fields to assess the situation and come up with a report to accompany the samples that will be sent to the Ministry of Agriculture for research. The study would identify the disease and advise the authorities on the intervention. However, he urged farmers to suspend growing maize where the disease had been reported for at least 3 years.

[The bacterial pathogen _Acidovorax (previously _Pseudomonas_) avenae_ subsp. _avenae_ (Aaa) can affect a number of mainly grassy hosts, including crops such as maize, millets, sorghum, oats, sugarcane and rice, while pathogenicity on wheat varies with strains. On maize, it causes bacterial leaf blight (or stripe) with symptoms that may include lesions expanding into stripes on leaves, which can lead to necrosis and shredding of leaf blades. Severe damage of the top leaves results in tassel rot if dead leaves enclose the tassel.

The bacteria can be spread by water, mechanical means (including animal and human activities), and infected plant materials (including crop debris). Seed transmission is suspected in some hosts including maize. Disease management may include crop rotation and phytosanitation to prevent spread (for example, disinfection of farming tools). Chemical control (copper compounds) may be effective but is hardly feasible for large areas. Some maize cultivars with levels of resistance to Aaa are available, but it is not clear whether any of them would be suitable for planting in Uganda.
