At the request of the Russian authorities the World
Organisation for Animal Health sent a team of world-renowned
experts in avian influenza and ornithology to Siberia in
order to assess the avian influenza situation in the region
(see OIE press release of the 4 Oct 2005). The complete
Mission Report of this scientific mission is now available
on line at
<http://www.oie.int/downld/Missions/2005/ReportRussia2005Final2.pdf>.
One of the main conclusions of the report is that in certain
conditions migratory birds could carry the Asian H5N1
influenza virus to other parts of the world. The migratory
routes of these potentially infected wild birds are mainly
directed to the Caspian Sea, the Middle East, and Africa. A
few of these birds could rest during the migration or
migrate to western Europe.
Facing the current and potential evolution of the Avian
influenza spread, the OIE confirms its position about the
priority of eliminating the virus at the animal source,
emphasizing the importance of the early detection and rapid
response mechanisms carried out by Veterinary Services in
countries at risk.

[We will provide a few details of the aims and conclusions
extracted from various sections of the report. The
conclusions address 2 main issues: surveillance, risk
assessment and epidemiology needs(#1-8) and laboratory
capabilities and procedures (#9-14). Please consult the
report in its entirety for a complete picture. - Mod.PC
1. To assess the situation with regard to the possible
relation between infection of wildlife with highly
pathogenic avian influenza of the H5N1 subtype and the avian
influenza outbreaks in domestic poultry;
2. To assess the current capabilities of the Russian
reference laboratory and if possible other diagnostic
laboratories in the diagnosis of avian influenza
3. To submit an independent Mission Report to the OIE on
completion of the mission.
The risk of introduction of HPAI by wild birds to Europe
--------------------------------------------------------
The existence of known migration flyways of several bird
species connecting South East Asia, Siberia and Europe shows
a possibility of the introduction of H5N1 virus to both
Eastern and Western Europe.
The possible continental spread of HPAI H5N1 by migratory
birds should be under continual review particularly with
reference to the results of investigations in wild birds in
the republic of Kalmykia since the region (Caspian Sea) is
recognised as a significant wintering area for water birds
of various origins (Europe and western Asia) and can be
considered a so-called biological hub.
In the light of recent developments with the detection of
H5N1 HPAI virus that is very similar to a virus isolated
from a wild birds in Novosibirsk district in August 2005, in
Turkey with further characterisation results from the H5
virus in Romania, considering migratory bird movement, the
spread and introduction of this virus into Europe via wild
birds may be recognized as probable.
Conclusions
-----------
1. Full and complete analyses according to international
standards for H5 and other influenza viruses already
isolated from both poultry and wild birds should be given
the utmost priority. Information on all H5 viruses from wild
birds sampled before, during and after poultry outbreaks
will be critical for national and international authorities
in both veterinary and human health sectors.
2. Active surveillance and monitoring in wild birds should
realized on an international basis and should be focused on
specific risk factors and target species:
- where there is a high density of wintering water birds
species and meeting points of several flyways, so called
biological hubs
- high-density poultry areas
- previously AI-infected areas
- places of wintering of bird species that spend summer
within the affected regions of Siberia.
Experts from the mission are available to provide direct
support to developing and establishing such programmes.
There may be opportunities to harmonise with such programmes
being put in place in Europe.
3. Passive surveillance in wild birds should consist of
early reporting of unusual mortality in any species. Local
hunters and ornithologists should be informed and involved
in this process and advised of the importance of such early
warning.
4. Current attempts at risk assessment suffer from a lack of
quantified information on bird migration and on the
interaction between wild birds either infected or not
infected with HPAI-H5N1. To assess the risk posed by
migratory birds in transporting HPAI it is necessary to:
- assess and monitor occurrence of AI in key species at
strategic migratory sites and at different times during the
migration and breeding cycles of the respective species
- analyse the cumulative bird ringing recovery data to
estimate the importance of the connection between the West
Siberian and European bird populations
5. Virus strains isolated from domestic and wild birds
should be submitted to the OIE/FAO Laboratory Network on AI
(OFFLU) and in particular this should involve early sharing
of current H5N1 viruses isolated in Russia to support
international efforts to combat the threats posed.
6. A program of active surveillance should be set up in
domestic poultry both in backyard and commercial sectors for
early detection of infection including in Western Russia.
7. The developing and realization of vaccination programs
for poultry of backyard farms within the affected regions is
strongly recommended.
8. Data collection, assimilation and analyses should be
streamlined and performed in a timely manner by
epidemiologists.
9. To improve the diagnostic capabilities of the veterinary
laboratories in the Russian Federation the team strongly
recommends that:
- the CVA of the Russian Federation should identify one
National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza (NRL),
which should have all the necessary equipment, reagents and
expertise at least to perform standard procedures for
screening and characterisation of AI viruses
- quality assurance programs should be conducted in the
laboratory network of Russia under the supervision of the
NRL
10. OFFLU should provide the NRL of the Russian Federation
with reference materials and advice as required to guarantee
the reliability of AI tests.
11. The roles and responsibilities of laboratories involved
surveillance and diagnosis of AI would benefit from being
clearly defined to ensure resources are not duplicated or
wasted.
12. Permanent links must be created between OFFLU and the
Russian NRL for avian influenza as soon as possible in order
to improve 2-way collaboration, provide training and to
exchange technical and scientific information.
13. A clear laboratory testing strategy in accordance with
OIE guidelines should be developed and applied to ensure
that laboratory test results critical for advising control
and surveillance are available at the earliest opportunity.
This should involve the following minimum standards for all
H5 or H7 viruses in order of priority:
- haemagglutinin subtype identification
- pathogenicity determination
- neuraminidase subtype identification
- selected viruses should be analysed more fully at the
genetic level to provide information on molecular
epidemiology
14. It is strongly recommended that consideration be given
to an international audit of laboratory processes to include
the management of samples, testing processes, reliability of
results, use of facilities, use of data and measures for
delivery of results.]

18[34]: 274, 6 Aug), 29 Jul 2005
Translation of information received on 7 Oct 2005 (and up to
5 Oct 2005) from Dr Evgueny A Nepoklonov, head of the Main
Veterinary Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Food,
Moscow:
End of previous report period: 20 Aug 2005 .
The following is preliminary information.
In the Kurgan region, in an industrial poultry farm
containing about 500 000 hens, clinical signs characteristic
of highly pathogenic avian influenza appeared among the
poultry. Samples were collected from affected poultry for
laboratory testing. Quarantine was imposed on the poultry
farm.
Without waiting for the results of the laboratory tests, the
destruction of poultry has begun at the plant using a
bloodless method.
