Aseptic meningitis is not reportable in Washington State, so the actual
incidence is not known. At the local health department level, the
"barometer" is the number of phone calls from the public requesting
information about viral meningitis because someone they know has been
diagnosed with it and they want to know about the risks to themselves. Many
of these calls turn out to involve a person who has received a clinical
diagnosis of viral meningitis and no CSF was collected. I would say that
in King County, this type of call is up somewhat (but not markedly) at the
current time. (1-3 unrelated calls per day). This is probably just above
average for the summer-fall season.
We did have an interesting presentation in early July of two elementary
school-aged siblings within 36 hours of one another. Lumbar puncture was
done on both. The first child was treated with an antibiotic prior to the
collection of CSF. WBC's in the CSF were ~1,400 and 97% polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (polys). The health department became involved because
meningococcal disease was suspected. The following day, the younger
sibling presented to the emergency room with "fulminant meningitis" (per
attending MD). WBC's in this child's CSF were only 10 (but 90+% polys).
There were no organisms seen on gram stain and no growth on either
specimen. The specimens were sent for viral culture and both grew
enterovirus. The viral isolates were identified as echovirus 30 by PCR.
Both children were admitted but recovered rapidly.
We have since been notified of a similar situation, again with two
elementary school-aged siblings. CSF was obtained on one, and the etiology
was determined to be viral. Neither child was admitted. We retrieved the
CSF for viral culture, but the specimen was in poor condition by the time
we were informed and there has been no growth in 2 weeks. On August 3, a
fifth child from our county (5 year old) was seen in an emergency room and
CSF collected. The child was not admitted, but a viral culture was
requested. The specimen was received today for enterovirus testing at the
state public health lab.
In a state where aseptic meningitis is not reportable, it is very difficult
to get CSF for viral culture, and more difficult yet to reach a point where
the enterovirus, if isolated, is tested further to determine what type it
is. In this day of "bottom line" health care, once the meningitis symptoms
are determined to be due to viral etiology, who is going to pay for the
testing when it makes no difference to the treatment decisions? We depend
on good working relationships with clinical laboratories and providers to
call us even when they are not required to report just because they know we
are interested.

[This "survey" is beginning to be very interesting. Why so much echovirus
30? Seems to me that virus isolation and bacterial culturing should be
done in order to at least determine the class of etiologic agent. Even
though knowing the specific virus type may not be necessary, archiving such
isolates would provide fertile grounds for future research projects; there
would be a large number of potential dissertations in the freezers! - Mod.CHC
