As of Saturday evening [June 24], we have investigated what seem to be
anthrax deaths in several more herds. Dr Steve Just is a federal vet tasked
with scrapie work, but like all of the field staff, has been assigned to the
Roseau County area to work on TB testing for one week periods at intervals.
Because TB testing has hit a spot of low activity, I more or less drafted
him and his assistants to help with the anthrax investigations, as they were
staying much closer to this incident than I am (50 miles vs 150 miles from
my home), so some of this report is relaying work done by Dr Just, who has
my gratitude for helping out. [And ours. - Mod.MHJ]
On 22 Jun I was up there as well and investigated a death at DL's farm. The
[US Navy] field test kit showed a positive after just a few minutes, and
while we were there, one of DL's neighbors stopped in to inform him that
there was another dead in a pasture on the opposite side of the farm
building site. That one was sampled but not tested with the Navy kit, as we
already had a positive from his herd and kits were in scarce supply at that
location and time.
>From there, we went about 6 miles up the road and investigated a Hereford
cow and again, the test was positive in the field at JA's pasture. I left Dr
Just and crew to see to the burning and disposal.
JA's daughter is the wife of AJ, who had the first cases; while there, we
discussed the draft horse mare that had died at their home place (2 miles
from where the cattle died.). This draft horse mare was found dead last week
but had been in less than ideal health for months and was over 20 years old.
Al called and we decided that she may have died from a chronic condition; I
said he may as well bury her because he had already buried his anthrax
losses and had the equipment to do so.
Mrs J did say that when they lifted this old mare, bloody exudate leaked out
of her, so now I'm not so sure it wasn't anthrax.
The nearest neighbor to AJ that had livestock is SCC. They reported to me
that they had lost a horse that had swelling in the pectoral areas that they
attributed to fly bites. This animal was ridden one day and dead the next
but again was over 20 years old. They had given this horse dexamethasone,
which may have made the situation worse rather than better. No samples were
available because they buried it before they considered anthrax as a
possibility and before reporting it to me. Their cattle have been vaccinated
yearly and they were done this year, but just recently, I think. [Horse had
not been vaccinated presumably. - Mod.MHJ]
By Friday, RC reported a dead cow to me after they had just vaccinated a day
or so earlier. Dr Just investigated and gathered samples and supervised
burning etc.
RC's uncle JC lost 3 horses, and Dr Just went there on 23 or 24 Jun to
gather samples, etc. We ran a field test at my office on 24 Jun from pooled
samples (is that OK?) and it was positive for anthrax.
At least one more horse was lost at DJ's farm.
DK and her family lost 3 calves suddenly, and this was investigated by Dr
Just on 23 Jun. Pooled samples of exudate from the nose were tested at my
office on 24 Jun as well, but the test was negative at 15 minutes. This herd
was farther up the road, being on the Canadian border. They had vaccinated
the cows but not the calves, and their losses were (so far) 3 calves from
this spring, one of which was just one month old.
The LBSP manager called on Thursday afternoon 22 Jun to report that they had
found 3 dead adult whitetail deer. They suspected anthrax, as they border
the farms where cattle have died. I instructed them how to load the
carcasses (one dropped right on a park hiking path) onto some polyethylene
sheeting and shovel dirt from under the carcass on to the poly as well and
transport to a site for burning. I instructed them to place the carcasses on
top of the burnable material (I did suggest charcoal but they had plenty of
tree branches etc) and wait for Dr Just to arrive to collect samples. They
chose instead to pile branches on top as well, effectively burying the
carcass in the firewood, so that Dr Just was unable to collect samples.
They had another dead on Saturday, night but it was bloating up and I told
them to go ahead and burn it, and we'll hope to collect samples early this
week if they have another -- which I think is a safe bet. I would really
like to have something with which to prove that this is actually anthrax.
On [the advice of Mod.MHJ], I have changed the advice protocol from
antibiotic plus vaccination to: make up your mind which you want to do
first. I advise vaccinating the herd (adults anyway) first and treating
anything that gives the slightest hint of being ill. Many of the affected
herds have some vaccination history, though mostly it is pretty recent. In
speaking with Linda Glaser, she tells me your advice is more along the lines
of treat with LA 200 and wait and vaccinate later. I can do that if it's
more appropriate.
I have also emphasized the need for beefing up the insect control protocols
on the affected farms. I tell them to dig those cattle oilers and back
rubbers out of the grove and get them filled and placed out with the cattle.
I did advise DK to treat all the calves with LA 200 rather than vaccinating
them at this point, on the assumption that the calves might have more
difficulty generating a protective immune response. Pulling the cattle from
the pasture has been advised, and the advice has largely been followed but
is not always possible. But, depending on how large a factor the fly
transmission is, it may not make much difference.
I am convinced that this isn't all just coming up out of the ground this
week. For evidence: consider the deer, which are browsers more than grazers,
and consider that one-month-old calf who, I'm sure, wasn't doing much
grazing at his age. For that reason I have emphasized the fly control
improvement and will continue to do so. At JA's place, in an effort to leave
as much biohazard material as possible there to be incinerated, I blew the
last few drops of blood out of a syringe needle and onto the dead cow's
neck. There were large flies present and within minutes that blood had
totally disappeared. I think they can carry this disease and spread it.
I am arranging to send quite a few samples (we have blood, exudate, and ears
from horses and cattle) to the D-Lab in Minnesota.
That's what I have for now. I hope this is enlightening. Did I hear that a
case or more has turned up in North Dakota? [Yes]

[Many thanks to Randy. Accounts such as his are one of the true pleasures of
ProMED-mail and inform folk better of the realities than cold clinical
accounts.
For those confused by the initials: AJ = #1 affected; AJ mare = ?; RL = #2
affected; DJ = ? ;DK = ? ; DL = +ve ; JC = +ve ; LBSP = ?; RC = awaiting
results; SCC = ?.
Anthrax is unusual in calves, but any maternal antibody level from their
vaccinated mothers would be minimal, as vaccine coverage lasts only around
9-10 months.
With this number of horses affected and the widespread non-contiguous nature
of the spread, it is very persuasive of tabanid ("horse flies") spread. In
our experience such outbreaks usually last about 3 weeks, but as this
started slowly (that is, not with a massive number affected in the first
days) it could well last a week or so longer before stopping. This is no
excuse to not vaccinate, believe me! One death costs more than vaccinating.
I am not to about to second-guess Randy on the use of antibiotics, though we
have found that treating a herd first and vaccinating second does stop an
outbreak in its tracks. If the owner is experienced and astute enough to be
able to pick out sick animals during the first 8 days after vaccinating when
full protection has yet to occur, good luck to him/her. Also if vaccination
has been an annual herd event, the animals should respond quickly.
Burning: Always burn carcasses, unless there is a prohibition order.
Burying, even if a carcass has not been opened, carries the risk of
producing a spore-positive grave. Also quick lime -- rather than lime
fertilizer -- should be added to the buried carcasses. Always get the
carcass(es) up off the ground so that the air can get in underneath and feed
the fire; coal, if you can get it, makes a good hot fire underneath. Just
piling fuel on top ensures the need for a reburn, plus the nicely roasted
beef is really attractive to foxes and coyotes, which drag bits away. Plus,
when you go back to check you will find healthy maggots noshing away at the
raw under-surfaces of the carcass with a charred top.
Again, thanks to Randy and Steve. - Mod.MHJ]

Re: the dead calves, obviously, I had an interruption and my thought never
got completed. What I had in mind to write was that these [dead] calves had
been scavenged. Dr Just said that, when he was there, they did their work
under the watchful eye of several timber wolves standing at the tree line.
That, of course, adds another dimension to this scenario, though I don't
know what it means.
SCC's horse was not vaccinated to the best of my knowledge.
Upon clarification, I will now advise mass treatment first (I like LA 200,
but that is a long held personal bias), and then we'll plan on vaccinating
later.
Yesterday's news: GG called from Roosevelt, MN saying he had lost a 4 year
old and a 6 year old bull. It seems these 2 escaped and went for an
excellent adventure and stopped at a neighbor's pasture, where they found
the company (of females) agreeable. GG had been going over there daily with
feed trying to entice them out of the pasture so they could be returned
home. The neighbor called late last week to report that one of the bulls had
died. GG checked on the remaining one on Sunday [25 Jun 2006?] only to find
him dead as well. The neighbor did report bloody exudate from the mouth of
the 1st dead bull. Dr Lenny Brehmer is posted in Roseeau for TB testing
this week, and he agreed to go out there and take samples, etc. The
significant thing here is that this is 60-70 miles from the Lake Bronson
incident. GG reports that a county drainage ditch runs through the
neighbor's property and probably overran it's banks within the past year or
so.
I've heard reports of rainfall in the affected areas, and I understand that
this may quell the advancement or continuation of the outbreak.
It's quiet so far this morning but things usually start to roll in after mid
morning.

[I asked Randy for clarification on how long ago this pair of bulls had
wandered off. His reply: "I think GG's bulls have been at the neighbor's
pasture for less than a week, but Dr Brehmer was investigating that today.
Remember, this incident is 60-70 miles from everything else we've talked
about before." So they could have become infected at either place. And
either way, this looks like a new outbreak unrelated to the previous events.
