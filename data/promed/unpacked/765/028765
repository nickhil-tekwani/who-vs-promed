The 1st case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Sweden has been detected in a moose (_Alces alces_) in Norrbotten county. The 16-year-old moose was euthanised after being observed emaciated, staggering, walking in circles, and apparently blind.

Samples from the moose were analysed at the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) within the ongoing CWD surveillance programme. Brainstem and retropharyngeal lymph nodes were screened with a TSE rapid test (Biorad ELISA). Samples from brainstem were positive in the screening test and confirmed positive for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy with Western Blot (BioRad TeSeE). Samples from lymph nodes were negative in the screening test.

The case shows similar features with cases of atypical CWD previously detected in Norwegian moose and described by Prisinu et al 2018 (Novel Type of Chronic Wasting Disease Detected in Moose (_Alces alces_), Norway., Emerg Infect Dis. 2018 Dec;24(12):2210-2218), such as that it was an older moose, and only brainstem was positive. But further analyses (e.g. Western Blot with different antibodies and immunohistochemistry) are needed to determine the type of CWD and will be done in collaboration with international reference laboratories for CWD.

[I am saddened to learn this has been found in Norway, Finland, and now in Sweden. It seems we are either better at detection or the disease is spreading, or perhaps a bit of both. - Mod.TG
