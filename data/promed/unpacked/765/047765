Parrots and pheasants have died of bird flu at a zoo in southern Ukraine,
prompting officials to slap a quarantine on the facility's bird enclosures,
officials said on Monday. But Ukrainian media quoted veterinary officials
as saying the strain of flu detected was the H5 type -- and not the
particularly dangerous H5N1 strain. Cases of H5N1 have already been
detected in Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula.
"We have recorded deaths of birds -- 3 or 4 pheasants and several parrots
in 2 of the enclosures at Odessa zoo," a spokesman for the zoo in the Black
Sea port said by telephone. "A quarantine has been set up in all
enclosures. The zoo has been declared a zone of heightened risk." The
official said the deaths were recorded on Saturday, but there had been no
contact with humans, as the zoo had been closed for the past week due to
cold weather.
"The main thing is that there is no confirmation from laboratories in Kiev
that this is the pathogenic form dangerous to humans," he said. "It is
standard bird flu." He said a plastic screen had been drawn around the
aviaries to guard against any spread of the virus. Experts said the zoo
birds may have been infected by coming into proximity with sparrows and
other wild birds. The H5N1 virus has been detected in about 24 villages in
Crimea since the outbreak was discovered late in 2005.
Sanitary workers dispatched to the region immediately after the outbreak
have already destroyed well over 200 000 birds in Ukraine -- both privately
held and at industrial plants.
The country's top veterinarian last week said Ukraine had begun testing
several types of vaccine for H5N1, but would take no decision on mass
vaccination of poultry pending the results. Officials predict more
outbreaks once migratory birds return to Ukraine in spring on their
northward flight paths.

[There have been several previous outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in zoos, including
zoos in Thailand and Egypt. This is not surprising, in view of the exposure
of such establishments to wild birds (in Thailand, feeding of carnivores
with poultry carcasses was implicated). Culling is a control measure which
might have to be excluded in certain cases, considering the need to
preserve rare species. - Mod.AS]

Azerbaijan said on Monday it had found bird flu at a chicken farm outside
capital Baku, but did not specify whether it was the deadly H5N1 strain of
virus. Kilyazin farm has been put under quarantine after avian flu virus
was found in samples taken on 22 Feb 2006, a state commission tasked to
prevent the spread of the disease said in a statement. The statement gave
no details on what strain of the disease was found. Officials were not
immediately available for comment.
The most dangerous strain, H5N1, mostly affects birds. But it has killed at
least 93 people since it re-emerged in late 2003, with most victims in East
Asia.
Azerbaijan, which lies at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, first
discovered H5N1 among wild birds earlier this month. But farm poultry has
been unaffected so far.

The Russian president has ordered to establish special headquarters to
prevent the spread of the bird flu, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported on
Monday [27 Feb 2006]. Speaking at a meeting with the Russian government,
Vladimir Putin said, "I consider it worthwhile to establish a special
structure, [with] headquarters in the government, to solve those issues."
Prime minister Mikhail Fradkov has proposed his 1st deputy, Dmitry
Medvedev, as the head of the organization. He added that Medvedev had
control over "those ministries that should have the main role here, and his
position would allow to consider those problems in the whole and make
decisions."
On Sunday, an official of the Russian Agricultural Ministry said bird flu
virus had been detected in wild fowl, including migratory birds, in 6
Russian regions in southern Russia -- the Republics of Kabardino-Balkaria,
Dagestan, Chechnya, and Kalmykia, and the Krasnodar and Stavropol
Territories. In 4 of those regions, the virus affected domestic poultry.

Outbreaks of bird flu have been registered in Russia's Stavropol
territory, Dagestan, Krasnodar territory, and the republics of Kalmykia and
Adygeya, the Federal Consumer Rights Oversight Service (Rospotrebnadzor)
said in a press release.
The disease has killed more than 2000 hens at a private farm in the village
of Nadezhda in Stavropol territory. All infected birds were destroyed. 42
Nadezhda residents have been inoculated against bird flu and another 43
have undergone medical examinations. No bird flu cases among humans have
been reported in the village.
"Bird deaths have been registered at farms and in villages in 14
districts in the republic of Dagestan. [Map
<http://www.russiatrek.com/regions/dagestan.gif>]. Dead domestic birds have
been found on the Derbent, Tarumovka and Kizlyar districts," the release reads.
A total of 561 987 domestic birds have died of avian flu in Dagestan.
Officials of the local Rospotrebnadzor branch and the Interior Ministry are
inspecting shops and markets where poultry products are sold.
In addition, bird flu has killed over 102 000 birds at the Tbilisskaya
poultry farm in Krasnodar territory and 96 at private farms in Bolshoi Gok,
Kalmykia. A quarantine has been imposed at the Komsomolets poultry farm in
Kalmykia, which has 900 birds.
Tests of blood samples taken from dead birds in Krasnodar territory
confirmed the A/H5 bird flu strain.

[According to additional information of 27 Feb 2006, translated from
Russian, a commercial poultry farm in the village Lavlinskaya, Krasnodar
region, where 39 000 hens died, was found to be infected with Newcastle
disease by the regional laboratory. Samples have been sent for confirmation
(and to exclude avian influenza) to the Russian reference laboratory at
Vladimir. <http://www.nr2.ru/kavkaz/57597.html>
In another region -- Adigeya -- H5 was identified in an affected village;
final identification of the virus is pending. Samples were sent to the
reference laboratory. All chickens at this village were destroyed.
A previous (26 Feb 2006) Russian newswire disclosed the detailed locations
of HPAI outbreaks in Dagestan, included in a press release of the South
regional center of the Ministry of Emergency Situations: Kaspiysk,
Buynaksk, Kizlyar, Hasavyurt and Machachkala, Karabudahkent, Babayurt,
Derbent, Tabasaransk, Charodin, Tarum, Magaramkent and Laks. (Russian
original at
<http://www.pravda.ru/news/health/26-02-2006/77544-ptichiy%20gripp-0>).
Official confirmation, preferably in an updated follow-up report to the
OIE, will help in clarifying the situation on the ground. - Mod.AS]
