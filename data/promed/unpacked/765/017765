USDA Confirms Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Texas
-----------------------------------------------
The U.S. Department of Agriculture today confirmed that the H5N2 strain of
avian influenza in a flock of chickens in Texas is highly pathogenic avian
influenza, the 1st such case in the United States in 20 years. USDA is
working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
forestall any human health impact from this outbreak. There is no evidence
to date of any human health implications of this HPAI virus in Texas.

"The H5 strain can be high- or low-pathogenic, and the clinical signs
observed at the outset of this outbreak suggested that the disease was
low-path avian influenza," said Dr. Ron DeHaven, USDA's chief veterinary
officer. "However, further testing by our National Veterinary Services
laboratory in Ames, Iowa, determined that this strain is highly pathogenic
avian influenza."

The premises in Gonzales County, Texas, remains under quarantine, and the
flock of approximately 6608 broiler chickens were depopulated over the
weekend. USDA and the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) have started an
epidemiological investigation that includes determining the source of the
infection and surveillance testing within a 10-mile radius of the infected
property.

"We urge everyone who has poultry to practice good biosecurity measures and
report any sick birds or death losses to either TAHC or USDA," said
DeHaven. "Proper biosecurity, including wearing protective clothing and
disinfecting any equipment before leaving a facility, will ensure this
disease does not spread."

HPAI spreads through bird-to-bird contact. HPAI viruses can also be spread
by manure, equipment, vehicles, egg flats, crates, and people whose
clothing or shoes that may have come in contact with the virus.

A Threat to U.S. Poultry
------------------
Worldwide, there are many strains of avian influenza (AI) virus that can
cause varying amounts of clinical illness in poultry. AI viruses can infect
chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl, as well
as a wide variety of other birds. Migratory waterfowl have proved to be the
natural reservoir for this disease.

AI viruses can be classified into low pathogenic (LPAI) and highly
pathogenic (HPAI) forms based on the severity of the illness they cause.
Most AI virus strains are LPAI and typically cause little or no clinical
signs in infected birds. However, some LPAI virus strains are capable of
mutating under field conditions into HPAI viruses.

HPAI is an extremely infectious and fatal form of the disease for chickens.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) works to keep HPAI from becoming established in
the U.S. poultry population. HPAI can strike poultry quickly without any
infection warning signs. Once established, the disease can spread rapidly
from flock to flock. It is essential for the U.S. poultry industry to be
alert to this disease threat.

Clinical Signs - Birds affected with HPAI may show one or more of the
following signs:

- Sudden death without clinical signs
- Lack of energy and appetite
- Decreased egg production
- Soft-shelled or misshapen eggs
- Swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocks
- Purple discoloration of the wattles, combs, and legs
- Nasal discharge
- Coughing, sneezing
- Incoordination
- Diarrhea

Economic Impact of an HPAI Outbreak

A major outbreak of HPAI would be costly to the poultry industry,
consumers, and taxpayers. Eradication of an HPAI outbreak that occurred
during 1983 and 1984 in the northeastern United States resulted in the
destruction of more than 17 million birds at a cost of nearly USD 65
million. This outbreak also caused retail egg prices to increase by more
than 30 percent.

Introduction and Spread of HPAI Virus

Exposure of poultry to migratory waterfowl and the international movement
of poultry, poultry equipment, and people pose risks for introducing HPAI
into U.S. poultry. Once introduced, the disease can be spread from bird to
bird by direct contact. HPAI viruses can also be spread by manure,
equipment, vehicles, egg flats, crates, and people whose clothing or shoes
have come in contact with the virus. HPAI viruses can remain viable at
moderate temperatures for long periods in the environment and can survive
indefinitely in frozen material. One gram of contaminated manure can
contain enough virus to infect 1 million birds.

Potential Threat to Human Health

In some instances, strains of HPAI viruses can be infectious to people.
Human infections with the avian influenza viruses under natural conditions
have been documented in recent years. The H5N1 strain, isolated in Hong
Kong in 1997, was highly pathogenic for chickens and caused a limited
outbreak in 18 people. 6 of these individuals died. Since mid-December
2003, a growing number of Asian countries have reported outbreaks of HPAI
in chickens and ducks. The rapid spread of HPAI, with outbreaks occurring
at the same time, is historically unprecedented and of growing concern for
human health as well as for animal health.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), particularly alarming is
the HPAI strain of most of these outbreaks -- H5N1 -- which has jumped the
species barrier causing severe disease, with high mortality in humans. For
this reason, poultry personnel and avian health care specialists should
wear adequate personal protective equipment, such as boots, coveralls,
gloves, face masks, and headgear, and follow appropriate sanitary and
disinfectant procedures when on premises known or suspected to be infected
with HPAI.

Of greater concern to WHO is the possibility that the present situation, if
the virus acquires human influenza genes, can give rise to human-to-human
transmission and possibly another influenza pandemic in people.

Trade Restrictions

Because many Asian countries are not considered free of another contagious
poultry disease, exotic Newcastle disease (END), the United States
restricts imports of poultry and poultry products from all Asian countries.
Therefore live birds, poultry and hatching eggs would be quarantined for 30
days, and would be tested for END and AI while in quarantine.

Regulations require that poultry meat be cooked or processed in a manner
that would ensure that the virus be inactivated if it were present.
Additionally, poultry meat is not imported from Asia because USDA's Food
Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has not approved Asia's poultry meat
processing plants. However, poultry meat extract (i.e., instant soup and
chicken noodle soup) can be imported, as these contain less than 2 percent
meat and are not subject to FSIS regulations. The National Center for
Import/Export (NCIE) issues import permits for these extracts requiring
government certification of cooking at boiling temperature or at least
cooked to 72 C internal temperature. When a product reaches this internal
temperature the END and HPAI viruses are considered inactivated.

Other poultry products may be imported for research or commercial purposes
depending upon the pre-importation processing protocols. These poultry
products require an import permit issued by NCIE.

Biosecurity Measures on the Farm

Poultry producers should strengthen biosecurity practices to prevent the
introduction of HPAI into their flocks. The following are some sound
biosecurity practices:

- Keep an "all-in, all-out" philosophy of flock management.
- Protect poultry flocks from coming into contact with wild or migratory
birds. Keep poultry away from any source of water that may have been
contaminated by wild birds.
- Permit only essential workers and vehicles to enter the farm.
- Provide clean clothing and disinfection facilities for employees.
- Thoroughly clean and disinfect equipment and vehicles (including tires
and undercarriage) entering and leaving the farm.
- Do not loan to, or borrow equipment or vehicles from, other farms.
- Avoid visiting other poultry farms. If you do visit another farm or
live-bird market, change footwear and clothing before working with your own
flock.
- Do not bring birds from slaughter channels, especially live-bird markets,
back to the farm.

Biosecurity Measures at Live-bird Markets

To prevent a possible outbreak of HPAI, poultry producers and dealers must
also use biosecurity precautions at live-bird markets. Live-bird markets
operate in many major cities.

Avian influenza viruses can be introduced into these markets if they
receive infected birds or contaminated crates and trucks. Once the virus is
established in the market, the movement of birds, crates, or trucks from a
contaminated market can spread the virus to other farms and markets.
Therefore, the following protective measures should be taken at live-bird
markets to prevent the possible spread of disease:

- Use plastic instead of wooden crates for easier cleaning.
- Keep scales and floors clean of manure, feathers, and other debris.
- Clean and disinfect all equipment, crates, and vehicles before returning
them to the farm.
- Keep incoming poultry separate from unsold birds, especially if birds are
from different lots.
- Clean and disinfect the marketplace after every day of sale.
- Do not return unsold birds to the farm.

For more specific information about biosecurity and cleaning and
disinfection practices, contact your local APHIS' Veterinary Services (VS)
office.

Disease Prevention Activities

To prevent HPAI from being introduced into the United States, USDA requires
that all imported birds (poultry, pet birds, birds exhibited at zoos, and
ratites) be quarantined and tested for this virus before entering the country.

In addition to international import restrictions, APHIS and State
veterinarians specially trained to diagnose foreign animal diseases
regularly conduct field investigations of suspicious disease conditions.
This surveillance is assisted by university personnel, State animal health
officials, USDA-accredited veterinarians, and members of industry who
report suspicious cases.

Furthermore, APHIS and State animal health officials work cooperatively
with the poultry industry to conduct surveillance at breeding flocks,
slaughter plants, live-bird markets, livestock auctions, and poultry dealers.

If HPAI were detected in U.S. poultry, APHIS veterinarians would work
quickly with their State counterparts and the industry to implement
measures such as quarantine, control, and cleanup to prevent opportunities
for the virus to spread.

Report Suspicious Signs

If birds exhibit clinical signs of HPAI or may have been exposed to birds
with the disease, immediately notify Federal or State animal health officials.

[The avian veterinarian with the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic
Laboratory (TVMDL) was reported as being suspicious this would be highly
pathogenic avian influenza. Veterinarians in the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC) said clinical signs indicate that it is low-pathogenicity
avian influenza. National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) is calling
it highly pathogenic based entirely on sequencing, not on a combination of
sequencing and clinical signs.

NVSL notified TAHC on the evening of 20 Feb, and notified TVMDL on the
morning of 21 Feb 2004. So why is NVSL changing the diagnosis now? Did they
report it prior to having the sequencing complete, or did they report
incomplete results? Authoritative information regarding the sequencing
would be appreciated.

The flock was depopulated over the weekend. The difference in sequencing in
the highly pathogenic strain means it can spread more rapidly and is more
dangerous to poultry, but it is not the same strain as the flu in Asia that
is affecting poultry and humans. - Mod.TG]
