Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, United States of America
----------------------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 26 April 2012 from Dr John Clifford, deputy administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, United States of America

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 19 April 2012
Date of first confirmation of the event: 23 April 2012
Date submitted to OIE: 26 April 2012
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2006
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: prion (atypical BSE)
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to: the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: Tulare County, California
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 April 2012
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species: cattle
Susceptible
Cases: 1
Deaths
Destroyed: 1
Slaughtered: 0

Affected population: As part of a targeted BSE surveillance at rendering facilities, a deceased dairy cow (10 years and 7 months old) was tested for BSE.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics
Apparent morbidity rate, apparent mortality rate, and apparent case fatality rate cannot be calculated because of missing information.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection
- unknown or inconclusive;
- random mutation

Epidemiological comments
As part of the United States targeted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance system a case of BSE classified as atypical was identified in a dead dairy cow that was to be rendered. The dead animalâ€™s carcass will be destroyed.
- the cow was culled due to lameness.
- the identified animal was never presented for slaughter for human consumption, did not enter food supply channels, and at no time presented any risk to human health.
- an epidemiological investigation into the incident has been initiated.
- movement controls have been placed on the index premises.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; screening; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: University of California (local laboratory)
Species: cattle
Test: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Test date 19 April 2012
Result: doubtful (uncertain)

Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (ntional laboratory)
Species: cattle
Test: ELISA
Test date: 21 April 2012
Result: doubtful (uncertain)

Species: cattle
Test: immunohistochemical test
Test date: 23 April 2012
Result: positive

Species: cattle
Test: western blotting ELISA (uncertain)
Test date: 23 April 2012
Result Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This event is not surprising as we know the BSE is the "gift that keeps on giving" because of its long incubation time and the sporadic nature of some atypical variants that may be spontaneously occurring. So, as indicated before in: BSE - Netherlands: (FR), OIE 20110122.0272, it is entirely possible that we will see truly sporadic cases from time to time. There is nothing in this event, so far, that would indicate that the preventive and surveillance measures put in place are not adequate or have failed to control disease given the elements of BSE epidemiology which predict sporadic cases from time to time.

It is important to have perspective regarding this case of BSE -- there was a time in the early 1990s when we didn't know as much there were high levels of uncertainty about the epidemiology of the disease and no one was sure that a feed ban would significantly alter the number of new cases or how many cases had already been exposed but hadn't covered the long incubation period yet. This was a disease whose epidemiology was uncovered over time and it is only the lack of cases in the last decade which gives us confidence we understand the epidemiology of the disease better now.

In this regard, we should recall there were over 37 000 cases of BSE in UK in 1992 and over 1000 cases of BSE outside of the UK in 2001. In 2011, there were only 29 cases of BSE worldwide with 3 new ones reported this year from USA, UK, and Poland. Since the beginning of 2010, there have been 79 cases to date including this new one: 19 from Spain, 18 from the UK, 11 from Portugal, 8 from France, 5 from Ireland, 4 from Poland, 3 from the Netherlands and Switzerland, 2 from Canada and Austria, and 1 each from Canada, France, Slovakia, and now the USA. Most of these recent cases outside of Europe have been the atypical variety which is not known to be spread through feed and appear to truly have a sporadic epidemiology.

We also appear to be learning not to overreact to news of a BSE event. Even though cattle future prices dropped precipitously when the California case was first discovered, they appear to have bounced back. More importantly, international trade doesn't appear to be completely disrupted by an entirely anticipatable event -- the occasional sporadic case of atypical BSE somewhere in the world. It is good that most of the US trading partners, with the possible exception of South Korea, don't seem inclined to ban US beef products as of now.

One last thing to consider is the location of the outbreak in Tulare County, California. I know this area well, having done my PhD work on the dairies in that county in the early 1980s. These farmers are an extremely well organized, resourceful, cohesive group that will work collectively to fight disease and therefore we can anticipate good traceback unless things have changed drastically -- which I highly doubt.
