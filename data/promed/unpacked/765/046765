The 5 cases of vesicular disease in pigs identified on farms in England last year [2022] were Seneca Valley virus (SVV), Defra has confirmed.

Cases of the disease were discovered in Norfolk between June and September 2022, initially raising fears of a foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] outbreak.

The government's confirmation that they were SVV comes following an extensive investigation by the Animal Plant Health Agency (APHA).

Defra said pig producers and vets must continue to promptly report any clinical signs of vesicular disease in pigs so that APHA can carry out an official investigation. High biosecurity standards should always be maintained, the department added.

SVV affects pigs for only a short period with infected pigs making a full recovery, and there is no risk to human health. It is also not a notifiable or reportable disease in the UK nor a listed disease by the World Organisation of Animal Health (WOAH). However, the clinical signs do resemble notifiable vesicular diseases, in particular FMD.

What's the advice?
For pig keepers, the government's advice follows:
- Regular reviews of their biosecurity measures and address any weaknesses, minimising movements of vehicles, people, or equipment onto pig units
- Controlling rodents, flies, and, as far as possible, wild birds
- Isolating incoming pigs away from the resident herd for at least one month
- Sourcing pig food or ingredients from reputable pig feed companies and never feeding kitchen or catering waste or meat to pigs
- Following the National Pig Association import protocol if importing live pigs
- To minimise the risk of disease introduction, keepers should inspect their pigs at least once a day, staying vigilant for lameness and vesicular (blister) foot or snout/mouth lesions. The advice applies to all pig keepers, no matter how many pigs they own.

[The mentioned cases of vesicular disease in pigs were reported from farms in England near Feltwell, Kings Lynn, and West Norfolk, Norfolk, initially on the evening of 23 Jun 2022, leading to an immediate declaration of a "temporary control zone." Following the rapid response and investigation, including laboratory involvement, FMD and swine vesicular disease were negated, and the 10 km [6.2 mi] temporary control zone was revoked on 25 Jun 2022.

Notably, the WOAH disease card for FMD, available at https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2021/09/foot-and-mouth-disease-1.pdf, presents the following DD [differential diagnosis] list of diseases that are clinically indistinguishable from FMD in pigs:

1. vesicular stomatitis (VS)
2. swine vesicular disease (SVD)
3. vesicular exanthema of swine (VES)
4. infection due to senecavirus A (Seneca Valley virus)

The infection of swine with SVV was first confirmed in Canada in 2007 and in the US in 2012. Since 2015, the virus was confirmed outside North America, namely in Brazil, China, Colombia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. It remains to be clarified how the virus was introduced to pig farms in Norfolk.

US researchers indicated the possibility of SVV's ability to survive the trip from Brazil to the US in soybean meal and other feed components. This, and a comprehensive commentary by Mod.TG on senecavirus, are available in ProMED post 20190115.6260619. - Mod.AS
