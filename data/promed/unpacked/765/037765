According to news reports, more than 130 persons who attended a large party
in a cow pasture in Petersburg, Illinois have developed toxigenic _E. coli_
infections that appear to represent the second major outbreak of _E. coli_
O157 disease in the USA within two weeks. There were approximately 1800
attendees at the party which was organized for family and friends of 8
bands as the fourth annual gathering called "Cornstock" by its organizer.
To date, 18 persons have been hospitalized in the Illinois outbreak.
Health officials are busy trying to contact all of the parties attendees,
but they came from many states including Ohio, Hawaii, Kentucky, Florida,
Michigan, Missouri, and of course, Illinois. So, this outbreak is likely
to manifest itself in many parts of the USA.
Health officials are investigating the potential sources of the infection
including food (a steer donated for the event). [Water sources and
residual manure in the pasture are other obvious candidates. - Mod.ES
