UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, TURTLE - EL SALVADOR: TOXIC ALGAE SUSPECTED

Hundreds of dead sea turtles have been found floating off El Salvador's Pacific coast, leaving officials scratching their heads as to what caused the massacre. Between 300 and 400 dead sea turtles were found floating around 7 nautical miles [8 mi] offshore from Jiquilisco Bay.

Most of the animals were decomposing when they were found, the ministry said, without giving their species. "We don't know what caused the sea turtles' death," the ministry said, adding that laboratory tests would be carried out.

The discovery recalled a similar find in 2013, between September and October, when hundreds of sea turtles were found dead off El Salvador's coast. At the time, authorities said the most likely cause of death was a potent neurotoxin that can be produced by algae during so called 'red tides'. A 'red tide' is when large accumulations of algae turn sea water red or brown.

It was thought that the turtles had eaten the algae containing saxitoxin, which affects the nervous system.

In 2006, saxitoxin killed about 500 sea turtles in El Salvador, and 4 years later, another 100 died of the same cause.

[Toxic algal blooms are events in which single-celled protists, dinoflagellates, proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities, because under certain circumstances these organisms can produce potent toxins. A systematic increase in sea water temperature may contribute to the occurrence of algal blooms.

One of the toxins associated with health impact to humans and other animals is Saxitoxin (STX). STX is a neurotoxin naturally produced by certain species of marine dinoflagellates (_Alexandrium_ sp., _Gymnodinium_ sp., _Pyrodinium_ sp.) and freshwater cyanobacteria (_Anabaena_ sp., some _Aphanizomenon_ spp., _Cylindrospermopsis_ sp., _Lyngbya_ sp., _Planktothrix_ sp. STX accumulates particularly in bivalve filter feeders.
