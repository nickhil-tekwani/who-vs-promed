Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: illegal movement of animals

Epidemiological comments: diagnostic tests were performed on serum
collected in November 2007. The frequent imports of live cattle to
Comoros from Madagascar and Tanzania (since 2002) led to consider the
risk of introduction of the disease in Mayotte by illegal imports of
live cattle from Anjouan (antibodies against Rift Valley fever virus
were also detected on goats).

The detection of IgM in 3 zebus suggests a viral circulation in
October 2007. A wider seroepidemiological investigation conducted in
collaboration with the CIRAD (French Agricultural Research Centre for
International Development) is underway to determine the geographic
distribution of the infection throughout the whole territory of Mayotte.

Diagnostic test results

Centre for International Development), Montpellier (national laboratory)
Species: cattle

[Mayotte is an island above Madagascar in the Indian Ocean (see maps
at <http://www.infoplease.com/atlas/country/mayotte.html> and
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayotte>), so introduction of this
disease is likely caused by imports from Southern Africa. - Mod.PC]
