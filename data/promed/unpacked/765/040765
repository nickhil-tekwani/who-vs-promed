[Clarification of some numbers might be helpful. In the Lebanon
report, there are 2 cases reported but no number of susceptible
animals is given, despite the fact that the outbreak occurs on a
single, isolated dairy farm.

In reports from both Lebanon and Israel, vaccination to a specific
number of cattle (1500 in Israel, 2000 in Lebanon) or sheep and goats
(7000 in Lebanon) is indicated. However, under control measures "no
vaccination" in indicated for both countries. Clarification of which
population of animals got vaccinated would aid in understanding the
outbreak and its control.

Another point of note is that neither report has a serotype result,
although previous reports indicated serotype O for the Israeli outbreak.
