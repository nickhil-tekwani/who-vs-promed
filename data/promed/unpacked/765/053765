Take-all disease outbreak in Victoria, Australia
------------------------------------------------
Grain growers in the Victorian Mallee have lost nearly 20 percent of their
wheat crop in the worst outbreak of Take-all disease in over a decade.
In some cases, entire crops have been wiped out by the disease
which is being blamed on short crop rotations, late grass control and not
enough rain to break down disease in the soil, earlier in the season.
Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment
Agronomist, Rob Sonoghan, says the disease has hit in a year when crop
yields were predicted to be well above average.
According to Sonoghan, some paddocks have up to 80 percent loss and many
have 10 to 20 percent. Crops [with yield potentials of 12 to 15
[bags/acre fell to almost nothing overnight. He indicated that 10 to 20
percent of the Mallee's wheat crop could be affected.

[Take-all disease of wheat, caused by _Gaeumannomyces graminis_ var.
_tritici_was first recognized in Australia in 1852 and is considered the
most serious root disease of cereals worldwide. Its major hosts are wheat
and barley. The disease is favored by cool temperatures, wet soil
conditions, and continuous cropping to wheat. The pathogen is
maintained in soil on diseased plant tissues from wheat, barley and grassy
weeds. Apparently no wheat cultivars with specific resistance to the
pathogen are currently available but there are tolerant cultivars. Crop
rotation is also used in disease management. USDA scientists at Beltsville
and collaborators at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,
using fatty acid profiles to screen about 400 rhizosphere bacteria, have
identified 4 that appear to be potential biocontrol agents. For a useful
source of information about this disease, see the following web sites:

<http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2000/001018.htm>
For those unfamiliar with the Australian method of reporting wheat yields, a
bag of wheat weighs about 83 kg; there are 12 bags/metric tonne (barley, 16
bags/metric tonne). An average wheat yield in the Victorian Mallee is about
15 bags/acre, a bumper crop is 30 bags/acre. The incidence of take-all at
Birchip is not that serious; crown rot is also present. However, other
fields within the Mallee/Wimmera have considerably greater incidence of the
disease. Many thanks to Brian Deverall and Elizabeth Dann at the University
of Sydney for providing the information. - Mod.DH
