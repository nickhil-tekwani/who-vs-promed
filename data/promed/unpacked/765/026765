Health officials in South Africa say an outbreak of cholera, which has
already claimed 85 lives, could continue until at least the end of next
year. The cholera epidemic, which began in mid-August, is spreading across
3 provinces. More than 30 000 people have already become infected with the
disease. Provincial Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says the epidemic could
persist until the end of 2002. Mr Mkhize says health officials never
dreamed the outbreak would be so serious. Doctors in the worst affected
areas are now diagnosing 600 to 800 new cases of cholera everyday. The
World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the South African Government
that the epidemic is a wake-up call. The WHO says improved sanitation is
desperately needed in poor rural districts.
