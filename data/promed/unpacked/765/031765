A Brookfield, Wisconsin, man says he and 10 of his friends became violently ill after sharing a meal of home-cooked wild venison, but what made them sick remains a mystery. The man said the symptoms didn't appear for 5 days after his church retreat to Black River Falls [1 OCT 2017]. "I could feel the life leaving my body. I knew something was something really serious," he said. "I was violently shaking, had a 104 (deg F) [40 deg C] fever when my wife took me in to urgent care. If I wouldn't have been treated, I'm not sure I would've came through that."

While the symptoms included night sweats and high fevers, the lack of gastro-intestinal issues convinced the man that he didn't have food poisoning. And he later learned that he wasn't alone in feeling ill. "I found out one of the other guys was sick, and then I found another one was sick, and so we started calling and checking and we were all having the exact same symptoms, and we realized we didn't have the flu," he said.

He also said their doctors still don't know what ailed the men, but antimicrobials seem to help.

An official with the Jackson County Health Department told WISN 12 NEWS that experts are looking into it. "We're aware of this case but there's really no concern for the public at this point," Public Health Manager Ellen Moldenhauer said.

The affected man said he and the others can only hope further testing reveals what they're dealing with. "We're all so fatigued and so tired, and now we want answers," he said. With deer hunting season right around the corner, he said others could benefit from knowing why they got sick.

[Not enough information is given to readily assess the etiology of the illnesses here. 11 men developed fever and sweats with residual fatigue and no gastrointestinal symptoms, which began about 5 days after eating home-cooked venison at a church retreat. The post states that antibacterial therapy "seemed to help". Information that would be useful in developing a differential diagnosis would include: was the venison "fresh-killed," or frozen and then thawed before cooking, what other foods were eaten, what other activities were done on the retreat, how many people were at the retreat, how long did the fever/sweats last with and without antimicrobials, and were lab tests such as a blood count and cultures obtained?
