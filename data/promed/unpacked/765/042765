A Hilton Head Island man was bitten by a rabid raccoon earlier this
month [June 2010], and state officials are warning Beaufort County
residents to be aware of the danger of rabies and reminding them to
vaccinate their pets.

The incident occurred 16 Jun 2010 when the man tried to break up a
fight between the raccoon and a dog, according to Sue Ferguson of the
S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).

The raccoon later tested positive for rabies. It was the 3rd rabid
animal discovered in Beaufort County in 2010, according to a DHEC news
release. A rabid raccoon was discovered in March 2010 near the town of
Port Royal and city of Beaufort border, and another was found in April
2010 within Port Royal's town limits.

In 2009, there were 152 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in South
Carolina.
So far this year [2010], there have been 44 confirmed cases in animals
in the state.

[3] MA: Bat rabies in Brookline

Health officials in Brookline issued a rabies advisory Monday [28 Jun
2010] after a bat captured in the town tested positive for the viral
disease.

The advisory was issued after the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health notified the town Monday [28 Jun 2010] that a bat captured in
Brookline tested positive for rabies, which is fatal if left untreated.

In a press release announcing the advisory, Brookline Chief of
Environmental Health, Pat Maloney, said that if a bat is found
indoors, it should not be released until it can be ruled out that a
pet or person has not been exposed. Bat bites can often go undetected
because there is no visible bite mark or scratch left on the skin by
the bat's small tooth. Health officials said 95 percent of people
infected with rabies during the past 10 years were unaware they had
been bitten or scratched.

If the bat cannot be captured and tested, people who could have been
exposed to a bite or direct contact should be vaccinated, according to
health officials.

Anyone and any pets exposed to bats should be reported to the
Brookline Health Department at 617-730-2300.

[4] LA: Rabies confirmed in Jeff Davis Parish horse

Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain, D.V.M., said a Jeff
Davis Parish horse was confirmed with rabies on 28 Jun 2010.

The horse, a 6-year-old thoroughbred mare domiciled in the Jennings
area, was brought to the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine in Baton
Rouge on 27 Jun 2010 after exhibiting abnormal facial twitching
symptoms. The neurologic signs worsened, and the horse was
euthanized. A subsequent necropsy verified rabies.

"Rabies signs are often neurological and very similar to other disease
signs like eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile virus
(WNV)," Strain said. "All of those diseases affect the brain." Strain
added that relatively few people vaccinate their horses for rabies.
"Horses are mammals, and all mammals can contract rabies. If you're
going to vaccinate your livestock for EEE and West Nile, the cost of
adding a rabies vaccination is minimal. It's a disease that can easily
be prevented."

The Prince George's County Health Department is looking for
individuals and animals who may have been in contact with a rabid fox
that bit a visitor at Six Flags America in Bowie last Saturday [26 Jun
2010].

"Because rabies is a highly transmittable and treatable disease, the
Health Department is taking all measures to locate any individuals
that may have come in contact with this infected fox or any other
infected animal," said health officer Dr. Donald Shell.

The health department could not provide information about the visitor
who was bitten. But the agency said that person, as well as 2 others
who were trying to scare the fox away, have to undergo post-rabies
vaccination treatment. The fox was caught Tuesday [29 Jun 2010] and
tested positive for rabies at a state laboratory.

Anyone who may have had contact with or was bitten by a fox should
contact the Prince George's County Health Department immediately at
(301) 583-3750. After business hours, or on the weekend or holiday,
the number to contact is (240) 508-5774.

A "physical encounter" between a Barre City resident and a gray fox
Thursday [3 Jul 2010] and the location Friday of a dead gray fox in
the same area have led authorities to renew rabies warnings, according
to a Barre City Police Department report.

The dead fox, which might have been the animal that exhibited
aggressive behavior Thursday [3 Jul 2010] is being sent to a
laboratory to be tested for rabies, the report states. No injuries
came from the human-fox encounter, police added.

Visitors to the Barre City Pool and playground area and residents of
adjacent neighborhoods are urged to call Vermont State Police at
229-9191 to report any foxes behaving strangely.

[Rabies can affect any mammal. Any domestic mammal having contact with
humans, including horses, should be vaccinated against rabies.

If an animal is out of its usual habitat, such as a bat in your house
or a fox in your yard in the city, you should be especially wary of
touching these animals.

Rabies is a deadly viral disease in almost all cases. There are
vaccinations for pets, and for people at risk, such as veterinarians,
there are rabies vaccines for humans as well. There is also a post
exposure prophylaxis vaccine for exposed humans. Sadly, if our pets
are not vaccinated, they are usually put to death by a humane method,
but it is still an emotional trauma that can be avoided. - Mod.TG]
