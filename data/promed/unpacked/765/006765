A sample extracted from a hatchery of the fishing company Acuinova,
near King channel, has provoked a new sanitary alert for the presence
of Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) virus in Aysén. According to
Chile’s Fishing Regulator, SERNAPESCA, implicated are 18 cages in
that hatchery, where during the surveillance the virus was detected.

"ISA virus was detected in a center of Acuinova and right now we are
conducting the tests to confirm the diagnosis", said Héctor Póntigo,
Director of SERNAPESCA.
The scientific information we are after is establishing which strain
of the virus --of the 20 that exist -- is the one found in this
hatchery. In the meantime, a contingency plan is being carried out,
establishing this center as suspicious, said Póntigo. After the
strain is determined and confirmed, a new contingency plan will be in
effect.

A few months ago a hatchery from Cupquelan detected a virus of the
strain HPR 2. This studies are trying to rule out the possibility of
infection with strain HPR 7B, which is highly pathogenic and caused a
colapse in the industry in the year 2008.

by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of
great economic impact for the salmon industry - Mod.PMB]
