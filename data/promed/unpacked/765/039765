Influenza update - number 174
--------------------------
Summary:
- Many countries of the northern hemisphere temperate region, especially in North America, reported increasing influenza virus detections. Canada and the USA crossed their seasonal thresholds, but activity was highest in the southern part of the USA. Influenza activity remained low in Europe but has continued to increase slightly.
- Low levels of influenza activity were reported in countries in southern and southeast Asia, except Cambodia.
- In Sub-Saharan Africa, influenza activity remains at low levels.
- Influenza activity in the temperate countries of the southern hemisphere continued at inter-seasonal levels

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
---------------------------
Countries of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere reported continued increases in the detection of influenza viruses, with an increase in the rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and in the percentages of influenza-positive specimens tested. Both the USA and Canada have announced the beginning of their influenza seasons.

North America:
Several of the southern states of the USA and southern provinces in Canada have reported an increase in influenza activity. The USA has now reached the national seasonal threshold for the rate of influenza-like illness (ILI) activity. There have been differences noted between countries and the main influenza virus strains circulating. In Canada, there has been little influenza B activity, with much more reported in the USA, whilst in Mexico, influenza B is the predominant virus circulating.

In Canada, increases in all influenza indicators were reported since the last update. Nationally, the proportion of outpatient visits that were due to ILI increased since the previous week from 2.1-2.9 percent and the percentage of clinical specimens that tested positive for influenza virus from 5.9-9.6 percent. Seven regions have reported localized activity, and 21 regions have reported sporadic activity. Eight influenza outbreaks have been reported, one in a hospital, 5 in long term care facilities, and 2 in other settings. In the current reporting week, 7 paediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations and 27 cases in adults 20 years of age or older were reported from the limited hospital surveillance system.

In Canada, 98 percent (271/278) of viruses detected were influenza A, and 2 percent were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses subtyped, 95 percent were A(H3N2), and 5 percent were A(H1N1)pdm09. Since the start of the season [2012-13], the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has antigenically characterized 35 influenza viruses: all 22 influenza A(H3N2) influenza viruses were similar to the vaccine virus A/Victoria/361/2011, and all 4 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were similar to the vaccine virus A/California/7/2009. Of the influenza B viruses, 7 were similar to the vaccine virus B/Wisconsin/1/2010 (Yamagata lineage), and 2 were similar to B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage; a component of the 2011-2012 seasonal influenza vaccines). None of the 19 A(H3N2), 4 A(H1N1)pdm09, or 8 influenza B viruses tested so far this year [2012] were resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors.

Nationally, the USA has now marked the start of its influenza season, 6-7 weeks earlier than in recent previous years. ILI consultation rates have reached the seasonal threshold of 2.2 percent, and 15.2 percent of the 5342 clinical specimens tested were positive for influenza virus, an increase from 7.5 percent in the last reporting week. The geographic extent of influenza activity was not uniform across the country, with 5 states in the south (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee) experiencing high ILI activity, and 39 states reporting minimal ILI activity.

In the USA, 70 percent of influenza viruses detected were influenza A and 30 percent influenza type B. Of the influenza A viruses with subtype information, 99.5 percent were influenza A(H3N2). Since October 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA has antigenically characterized 140 influenza viruses. All 90 A(H3N2) influenza viruses were A/Victoria/361/2011-like, the virus contained in the current trivalent seasonal vaccines. Both of the 2 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested were characterized as A/California/7/2009-like, the influenza A(H1N1) component of the current vaccines. Of the 48 influenza B viruses characterized, 34 were B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like (B/Yamagata lineage), and 14 were from the B/Victoria lineage. None of the 122 influenza A(H3N2), 2 A(H1N1)pdm09, or 81 influenza B viruses tested so far this year [2012] were resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors.

One infection with an influenza A(H3N2) variant virus (A(H3N2)v) was reported to CDC during week 47 from Iowa. No further cases have been identified in contacts of the case patient. This is the 1st A(H3N2)v infection reported since 28 Sep 2012. More information about H3N2v infections can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-outbreak.htm.

Europe:
Levels of influenza activity throughout Europe remain low, but some countries have reported increasing detections of influenza virus. In the last week of November 2012, all 28 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) reported low-intensity activity of influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection. For the whole of Europe, 3 percent of clinical specimens were positive for influenza virus in the 3rd week of November 2012. In the 4th week of November 2012, the percentage of positives had increased to nearly 9 percent (EU/EEA data only). In addition, an observation of increasing ILI/ARI activity has been reported by some countries, including Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Uzbekistan, and central Russia.

Of the influenza virus detections in sentinel specimens since week 40/2012, 46 percent were type A, and 54 percent were type B viruses. Of the A viruses subtyped, 2/3rds were A(H3N2), and 1/3rd were A(H1N1). Since week 40, 2 countries (United Kingdom and Germany) have antigenically characterized 13 influenza viruses: 6 influenza A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like, 2 A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like, 3 B/Florida/4/2006-like, and 2 B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like.

None of the 15 specimens tested, including A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and B viruses, were resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamavir.

Northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean Region:
Influenza activity has been noted in the eastern Mediterranean region at low levels. Algeria has reported some transmission of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses. Bahrain has continued to report influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections in recent weeks. After previous influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections, Israel is now reporting mainly influenza A (H3N2) at low levels.

Temperate Asia:
ILI activity remained at low levels throughout the temperate Asian region. In northern China, there were 44 samples positive for influenza (5.5 percent): 34 influenza A (30 A(H3N2)), and 10 influenza B (lineage undetermined). This represents an increase from the previous week, when 3.3 percent of samples were influenza positive. In Mongolia, influenza activity is low, with 3 out of 82 samples (2.5 percent) positive for influenza (all A(H3N2)). Activity of influenza remained low also in both the Republic of Korea and Japan.

Countries in the tropical zone
---------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas:
In Central America, declining influenza B and influenza A(H3N2) activity has been noted in Nicaragua. Influenza A(H3N2) is being reported in Honduras, but activity has yet to peak. RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] activity continues to be noted in the area, with Costa Rica, Panama and Honduras reporting cases.

In the Caribbean, Jamaica is reporting influenza B activity at low levels, and in Cuba, following previous influenza B detections, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has now been reported. In Guadalupe and Martinique, the epidemic of respiratory syncytial virus has now declined.

In the tropical zone of South America, influenza activity continued to decline, with low numbers of virus detections being reported. In Brazil and Paraguay, the overall trend of influenza was decreasing, with sporadic detection of influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses reported. Peru has noted both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B transmission in the past few months, but it is generally at low levels.

Sub-Saharan Africa:
Influenza continues to circulate in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, although most countries have reported a decrease, including Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ghana. Ethiopia and Ghana reported influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 exclusively, while A(H3N2) and influenza B was circulating in Cameroon and Kenya. Madagascar reported continued circulation of influenza B.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
-----------------------------------
Influenza activity has continued to decline in all temperate countries of the southern hemisphere and is now at inter-seasonal levels.

It is now clear that the winter influenza season has commenced in the North American region of the Northern Hemisphere but not yet to any significant extent elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere.

The predominant type of influenza varies between localities, but so far, in all cases, the strains in circulation are well matched by the components of the current vaccine. However, the early appearance of influenza cases in North America suggests that vaccine coverage of the population is relatively low.

Strains of influenza virus resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamavir have not been detected so far. - Mod.CP]
