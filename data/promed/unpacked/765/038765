Indonesia: Farm Worker is First Confirmed Human Case of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
JAKARTA: A farm worker in eastern Indonesia has tested positive for avian
influenza virus, marking him the country's first human case of the virus
infection that has already killed at least 54 people elsewhere in Southeast
Asia, health officials in Indonesia said on Wed 15 Jun 2005.
The worker from southern Sulawesi island is healthy and currently shows no
symptoms of illness but two tests at a Hong Kong laboratory confirmed that
he had been infected by avian influenza virus, health officials said. The
laboratory results make Indonesia the fourth country to register a human
case of avian influenza, which international health experts warn could
easily undergo genetic change, sparking a global pandemic.
Since 2003, the highly lethal disease has struck chickens, quail and other
birds in 18 Indonesian provinces on seven islands, prompting the government
to order a massive campaign to vaccinate poultry against the virus.
Indonesian health experts, however, have sought to ease public anxiety
about the outbreak over the last year by saying the local virus was
slightly different from the strain in other Asian countries and had
demonstrated no capability to infect people. Muhammad Nadhirin, chief of
epidemiological surveillance at the Indonesian health ministry, confirmed
that the Sulawesi laborer had tested positive for avian influenza, adding
that officials were now hoping to conduct further tests on his sample.
The farm worker was initially tested in late March after the epidemic
spread to Sulawesi, killing at least 25 000 chickens. That outbreak
prompted officials to limit the transfer of poultry off the island and take
blood samples from laborers, veterinarians and others exposed to sick
chickens. In total, 81 people were tested and all but one of the samples
came back negative, officials said.
Efforts to complete a second round of testing in Hong Kong were prolonged
in part because the farm worker had left his job and health investigators
had to track him back to his home village elsewhere on the island. The
second test, finally completed earlier this month, confirmed that the
laborer had been infected by bird flu but the concentration of antibodies
was relatively low, officials said. That finding meant the worker was no
longer carrying the virus but it was impossible to determine how long ago
he had been infected, according to Hariadi Wibisono, a director of disease
eradication at the health ministry.
Since late 2003, more than 100 people have been infected by avian influenza
flu in Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambodia. In Viet Nam, where the outbreak is
most serious, government health officials have previously reported at least
five cases in which people had the disease but showed no symptoms. Klaus
Stohr, head of the World Health Organization's influenza program, said last
month it is not unprecedented for otherwise healthy poultry workers to test
positive for avian influenza. During a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, about 10
percent of workers in live poultry markets tested positive for the virus,
health officials said.
Even if a person shows no symptoms, the infection still poses a serious
health risk. Health experts worry that a person could catch both avian
influenza and an ordinary human strain of influenza virus at the same time,
presenting a chance for the viruses to swap genetic material and produce an
entirely new lethal strain that can easily be passed among people. If this
happens, WHO officials warn that tens of millions of people could die
worldwide.
Researchers have also determined that avian influenza virus has infected
Indonesian pigs, another ominous development because a similar genetic
change could occur in swine, which like people, can catch both avian and
[mammalian] influenza viruses. Chairul Anwar Nidom, an influenza expert at
Airlangga University in Surabaya, said in a February interview that he had
discovered avian influenza virus in blood samples taken from pigs on the
outskirts of Jakarta. These pigs were from farms near a poultry outbreak in
West Java province. Indonesia notified the World Animal Health Organization
(OIE) late last month that the virus had spread to pigs.

[This case was reported some time ago but has remained unconfirmed until
the present because the farm worker who tested H5N1-positive initially
could not be located until recently to provide a second blood sample for
verification of the result obtained with the first sample. Perhaps the most
significant feature of this report is the claim by the Indonesian
authorities that the H5N1 virus circulating in Indonesia is (genetically)
distinct from other East Asian isolates and as a consequence may be less
pathogenic in humans. - Mod.CP]
