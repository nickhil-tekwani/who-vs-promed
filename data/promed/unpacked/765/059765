With 2 more persons succumbing to encephalitis, the death toll in the
viral disease spread in eastern Uttar Pradesh has crossed the 100 mark
this year [2011]. This year, 101 patients succumbed to the deadly
brain fever out of which 75 were from Gorakhpur Mandal, doctors at the
BRD Medical College said [in Gorakhpur] today [19 Jul 2011].

Since 1 Jan [2011], a total of 626 encephalitis patients were
admitted to the BRD Medical College and other government hospitals in
the region. Out of these, 101 succumbed to the disease, they said. At
present, there are 74 patients undergoing treatment in Nehru Hospital
of BRD Medical College.

Gorakhpur and Kushinagar are the worst affected districts. There were
141 patients from Gorakhpur out of which 24 died. 25 deaths were
reported from Kushinagar out of 127 reported cases. The fever is
caused by a virus found in pigs and is transferred to humans by
mosquito bite.

[The report doubtless refers to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus,
which is maintained in wild birds and _Culex_ mosquitoes with domestic
pigs as amplifying hosts. The number of reported cases has increased
over the past 2 weeks. The 7 Jul 2011 ProMED-mail report (archive no 20110707.2055) indicated that there were 450 acute encephalitis
syndrome cases and 77 deaths, with 111 cases and 21 deaths in
Gorakhpur. In the current report, that number in the Gorakhpur
district has increased to 141 cases with 24 deaths. In previous
reports from this region, the disease is referred to as "acute
encephalitis syndrome", with less than half confirmed as JE virus
infections. There is no mention about the number of confirmed JE virus
infections among the cases mentioned above. In previous reports, the
etiology of the majority of the encephalitis cases has not been
determined, but there are implications that water-associated viruses,
perhaps enteroviruses, are responsible.
