TUNGRO DISEASE, RICE - PHILIPPINES (02)

The tungro virus has been found in ricefields in Ajuy, Barotac Viejo,
Concepcion, Dingle, Pototan, San Enrique, Sara and Sta. Barbara towns
in Iloilo; Cuartero, Dao, Jamindan and Mambusao in Capiz; and Malinao
in Aklan.

Pests being monitored by the Department of Agriculture regional
office include the rice tungro virus and the rice black bug, which
could also emerge at this time. As of last week, about 25 hectares of
rice plantations had been affected in Iloilo. Some 17 hectares in
Capiz are also infested.

Continuous rains have created an environment conducive to the
proliferation of pests, said DA Regional Executive Director Larry
Nacionales, who formed the Rice Crop Protection Task Force to monitor
pests and diseases affecting the region's rice production during the
critical planting months of June and July [in 2009].

[Tungro is one of the most damaging rice diseases in South East Asia.
Yield losses of up to 100 percent have been reported, and the disease
is spreading in the region. It is a co-infection involving _Rice
tungro bacilliform virus_ (RTBV; genus _Tungrovirus_, family
_Caulimoviridae_) and _Rice tungro spherical virus_ (RTSV; genus
_Waikavirus_, family _Sequiviridae_). More than one genotype of each
virus may exist in the same plant.

Symptoms include leaf discolouration, stunting, reduced tillering,
and reduced grain production. All growth stages of rice are
susceptible. Tungro is transmitted by leafhoppers, the most efficient
vector being the green leafhopper _Nephotettix virescens_. RTBV
cannot be transmitted unless RTSV is present. Infectious vector
insects can spread the viruses over long distances. The disease is
not seed transmitted.

Disease management includes vector control, cultural practices, and
use of rice varieties resistant to the vectors and/or the viruses.
However, vector adaptation on leafhopper resistant varieties has been
a problem, and the presence of multiple viral genotypes in a single
location (suggesting an unstable virus population) poses a challenge
to achieving durable crop resistance. Research on tungro management
is being carried out at the International Rice Research Institute
(IRRI) in the Philippines.
