---------------------------------------------------------
A recent cluster of cases on Coffs Coast [New South Wales] reminds us
that Q fever continues to be common in Australia. The following
background data are abstracted from the Gideon e-book series (1,2).
Primary references are available on request.

Time and place
--------------
- Q fever was first characterized in Australia, in 1939.
- Queensland and New South Wales account for over 90 percent of
cases.
- Over 50 percent of cases are directly, or indirectly related to
meat processing.
- The male/female ratio for reported cases is approximately 5-to-1.

Disease rates have gradually increased over the past 6 decades (see
graph at
http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Qfever-Australia.jpg).

Travel and Q fever
------------------
2002 (publication year): 3 Japanese workers acquired Q fever while in
Australia and New Zealand.
2005: an American tourist acquired Q fever in Australia.

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 18.5 percent of non-vaccinated meat workers in central Queensland
(2001 publication)
- 6.5 percent of persons below age 25 years in South West Queensland
(2010 publication)
- 66 percent of persons in Kimberly have evidence for prior exposure
(2002)
- 7 percent of persons in the Hunter New England region of New South
Wales (2006 to 2009)

The average rate among abattoir workers in Victoria is 6600 per 100
000 during the 1st 10 years of exposure.
- As of 1996, vaccination programs were identified in one-third of
abattoirs.
- Routine immunization of abattoir workers in endemic areas was
introduced in 2002.
- As of 2009, vaccine update is 100 percent among abattoir workers
and 43 percent among farmers.

The standard vaccine is prepared from inactivated phase I whole
_Coxiella burnetii_. A dose of 0.5 ml subcutaneous (deltoid region) is
indicated for high-risk populations (such as, occupational exposure),
and confers immunity for 5 years. Few side effects are reported, and
are limited to fever and headache.

A variety of local mammals serve as reservoirs, including the
bandicoot (_Isoodon torosus_).
_Amblyomma triguttatum_ ticks are implicated in the epidemiology of Q
fever in Queensland.

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
1959 (publication year): an outbreak of Q fever in Queensland was
associated with sheep contact.
1962 (publication year): an outbreak was reported in a meat-works in
South Australia.
1969: an outbreak in a Brisbane meat works affected 7.9 percent of
workers.
1979: an outbreak (110 cases) was reported at an abattoir in
Victoria.
1998: an outbreak (29 confirmed and 8 suspect cases) was reported at
an abattoir in New South Wales.
2004: an outbreak (9 confirmed and 6 suspect cases) was reported
among farmers in South Australia.
2005: an outbreak (5 cases) was reported among persons involved in
calving activities, in New South Wales.
2006 (publication year): an outbreak (4 cases) was reported among
workers at a cosmetics factory.
2006 (publication year): an outbreak (27 cases) was reported in rural
South Australia.
2007: an outbreak (5 cases confirmed, 1 possible fatal case) was
associated with an abattoir in South Australia.
