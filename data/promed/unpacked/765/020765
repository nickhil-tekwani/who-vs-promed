Fernando Dias de Avila Pires and Adriana Mohr suggest reading George Gaylord
Simpson's book "This view of life" (1964), which they describe as "still very
up to date." However, Simpson did not have the advantage of later work on the
origin of self-replicating macromolecular systems, the precursors of life. A
later essay by Harvard evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr, "The probability of
extraterrestrial life" (1985), is more optimistic. Prof. Mayr says, in part:
"It has been known for some time that smaller organic molecules, like amino-
acids, purines, and pyrimidines, can arise spontaneously in the universe, and
that such processes can be duplicated in the laboratory. Nevertheless, for a
long time it seemed impossible to explain how the amino-acids (and peptides)
could get together with nucleic acids to form truly replicating, i.e., living,
macromolecules. Through the researches of Eigen and his school there seems to
be no longer a difficulty of principle. What is particularly interesting is
the important role played by natural selection, even during the pre-biotic
phase. The probability of the repeated origin of macromolecular systems with
an ability for information storage and replication can no longer be doubted."

Well, Carl Sagan was my advisor for a while when I was an astrophysics
student at Cornell, and he was highly concerned about returning organisms
from elsewhere to here.
The specific point he made that seems most relevant here is that the
PROBABILITY of something returning that could, say, destroy all DNA-based
life is low, even very low, but non-zero -- and humans simply do not know
how to treat very low probability events
of very high catastrophes, so they tend to treat them as zero-probability
events, and have, say, the astronauts land in the South Pacific, leap from
the capsule into the warm life-sustaining waters, fly to the carrier, and
THEN go into "isolation".
I don't know, no one knows, what the odds are of life. However,
experiments in "Artificial Life" by Thomas Ray and the Santa Fe Institute
group, Los Alamos labs and elsewhere, indicate that the "life" phenomenon
is VERY robust and powerful and "will find a way", just as "genetic
algorithms" can solve problems that calculus cannot
touch. Our imaginations and prior experience do not support a "probability
of zero" conclusion.

I remember that story of silicon based life. The problem is that if, in
some other planet, under very distinct conditions, replicating
macromolecules were formed having silicon chains instead of carbon, would
we taxonomists recognize it as "life"? And the latter productions as
"organisms"?
[Why not, if it fulfills our criteria of being self-replicating? - Mod.JW
And the saying that given enough time, the chemical reactions, coupled with
environmental conditions, chance mutations, and natural selection could
have replicated our world somewhere else in the universe sounds to me like
the question we pose to our students when we talk about chance and
determinism: given enough time, a monkey tapping randomly on a typewriter
(nowadays a PC) could produce eventually a facsimile of Shakespeare's King
Lear?
[I think someone has calculated that for a monkey to do that would take
longer than the presently accepted age of the Universe -- but that age
seems to keep
changing - Mod.JW

On the contrary, the ease by which we find organic molecules in outer space
gets us at least one or two steps toward life. Carl Sagan estimated that
the number of planets in the Milky Way galaxy suitable for life to be 3 x
10E11. This number is not infinitesimal.
