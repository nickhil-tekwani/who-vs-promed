Melioidosis in Finnish tourists injured by the December 2004 tsunami in
Thailand
-----------------------------------------------
_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ was isolated from 3 Finnish patients in January
2005. All 3 cases were in tourists who were visiting Khao Lak on the
southwest coast of Thailand when the tsunami struck in December 2004. 2
strains were isolated from wound swabs and one from a blood culture.
_B. pseudomallei_ is an environmental Gram negative bacterium, endemic in
tropical climates, that can cause melioidosis, a potentially
life-threatening disease, even in previously healthy individuals. Humans
can be infected by soil contamination of skin abrasions. Most human cases
are reported from South East Asia, where _B. pseudomallei_ is endemic. The
infection is very rare in Europe, and the only case to have been previously
reported in Finland was in a man who traveled to Thailand in 2000 [1]. The
spectrum of infections caused by _B. pseudomallei_ ranges from mild wound
infections to septic disease or pneumonia. In the severe forms of the
disease, the mortality is variable, ranging from about 20 to 40 percent [2,3].
There has been increased awareness of melioidosis as a potential
complication of the December 2004 tsunami in South East Asia, and a number
of _B. pseudomallei_ isolates from people who were injured in the natural
disaster have been reported [4-6]. Most of the isolates have been from
wound swabs, and only a few cases of systemic disease have been reported.
The 3 Finnish cases described here are a reminder for clinicians to
consider melioidosis in patients who have returned from South East Asia
after the tsunami with unexplained fevers, or unusual Gram negative
isolates from wounds, blood, or respiratory samples.
The 1st case was in a 17-year-old woman with a deep wound in her lower leg.
_B. pseudomallei_ was isolated from a wound swab. She had been treated in a
hospital in Bangkok for 3 days before returning to Finland. On arrival in
Finland, her left foot was red and swollen, and a swab taken before
revision of the wound grew _B. pseudomallei_. Consecutive swabs remained
negative, and further plastic surgery procedures were carried out a week
later. The patient was treated with clindamycin and ciprofloxacin. She did
not develop any clinical symptoms of melioidosis and has fully recovered.
The 2nd case was a 47-year-old male. He had several superficial wounds,
some of which had been surgically treated in Khao Lak. On arrival in
Finland, he had a fever, but his general health was good, and vital signs
were normal. He had a deeper wound in his right elbow and a small abscess
in the corner of his left eye. Aspiration pneumonia was suspected, because
he had breathed in muddy water, and his chest x-ray showed bilateral
changes. _B. pseudomallei_ was isolated from 2 blood cultures taken during
his 1st day in the hospital. This patient is considered to have had a
confirmed case of meliodosis. He was treated with broad spectrum
intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone, clindamycin and levofloxacin,
followed by meropenem and ciprofloxacin after the results of the
sensitivity testing were obtained). His fever continued for 10 consecutive
days, but he has now recovered. He is still on doxycycline and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy, which is to be continued for 20 weeks.
The 3rd case was a 54-year-old man who had a wound infection and was sent
to the hospital by a general practitioner one day after returning to
Finland. 2 of his wounds had been sutured in Thailand. After admission to
the hospital in Finland, he developed septic shock and was treated in an
intensive care unit (ICU) for 3 days. He did not have pneumonia and was
treated with meropenem and ciprofloxacin. All blood cultures remained
negative. A wound swab taken during wound revision 3 days after the patient
was released from the ICU grew _B. pseudomallei_. A diagnosis of meliodosis
is presumed. The patient was treated in the hospital for 29 days and
recovered fully. His antibiotic treatment has been discontinued.
Clinicians or microbiologists currently dealing with cases of melioidosis
in patients returning from South East Asia after the tsunami are invited to
contact David Dance at the Health Protection Agency South West Regional
Microbiologist Office in England, who is collating information on cases
worldwide: <david.dance@phnt.swest.nhs.uk>.
