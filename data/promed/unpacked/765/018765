The 7 Foot-and-mouth Disease Viruses
---------------------------------------------------------
Just as there is no such entity as "hepatitis virus", "hantavirus", or
"influenzavirus" (many other examples could be given), there is no such
thing as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus (note the hyphens properly
placed between the words).
Firstly, the FMD viruses, together with Equine rhinitis A virus, have been
placed in the family _Picornaviridae_ (same family in which we find the
human polioviruses, human rhinoviruses, hepatitis A virus, cricket
paralysis virus and many, many other viruses), genus _Aphthovirus_ .
Secondly, there are seven recognized FMD viruses:
O = Oise
A = Allemagne
C = (because someone figured O and A would be replaced with A and B after a
while, but they weren't)
SAT1, SAT2, SAT3 = three viruses named for the "South African Territories"
ASIA 1 = (name apparent)
Their proper names are --
Foot-and-mouth disease virus type A
Foot-and-mouth disease virus type ASIA 1
Foot-and-mouth disease virus type C
Foot-and-mouth disease virus type O
Foot-and-mouth disease virus type SAT 1
Foot-and-mouth disease virus type SAT 2
Foot-and-mouth disease virus type SAT 3
[The seven immunologically distinct Foot-and-mouth disease viruses are
currently ranked as serotypes of the single virus species designated
Foot-and-mouth disease virus (vide; "Virus Taxonomy, Seventh Report of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, edited by Van Regenmortel
et al., pages 669-671, Academic Press, San Diego and London, 2000). - Mod.CP]
According to Fenner, Bachmann, Gibbs, Murphy, Studdert and White
(Veterinary Virology, Academic Press, 1987), FMD viruses "may persist in
the pharynx of some animals for a prolonged period after recovery. In
cattle, the virus [N.B. I am simply quoting the book] may be detectable for
periods up to 2 years after exposure to infection, in sheep for about 6
months. Viral persistence does not occur in swine."
Genetic studies have shown that O, A, C, and Asia 1 belong to one complex
and SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 to another. There appears to be only 60-70%
homology within complexes and 24-40% homology between complexes. In sum, 7
viruses can cause FMD. They are neither subtypes, varieties, variants,
discrepant forms, nor bizarros, they are distinct viruses. To give them the
generic name "FMD virus" merely serves to confuse. Given that these viruses
do not cross-protect (by neutralization, the sine qua non, or by ELISA or
complement-fixation) one against another, it is correct to use the
abbreviation "FMD" for the disease, but not for the virus, any more than
one would be correct in saying "dengue virus".

[These comments should perhaps be read in conjunction with the most recent
analysis of the phylogeny of Foot-and mouth disease viruses; i.e., Samuel,
A.R. and Knowles, N.J. Foot-and-mouth disease type 0 viruses exhibit
genetically and geographically distinct evolutionary lineages (topotypes).
Journal of General Virology 82, 609-621, 2001.
Antigenic variation occurs within a seroptype and vaccines have to be
matched with current outbreak strains to ensure efficacy. By nucleotide
sequence analysis of the VP1 region of approximately 200 isolates Samuel
and Knowles were able to discriminate 8 distinct genetic lineages within
the type 0 serotype of Foot-and-mouth disease virus which corresponded with
distinct geographical locations, suggestive of independently evolving
lineages. However, on occasion viruses of more than one topotype may be
present in the same geographical region. It is important to state, however,
that this correlation between serotype and genotype is limited to the
capsid-coding regions, and analysis of other regions of the genome may not
show this same correlation. Consequently as the clinical features of the
disease do not vary significantly, it may be operationally admissible to
consider Foot-and-mouth disease virus as a single entity.
A further complication is that recombination between strains has been
demonstrated under laboratory conditions and in natural isolates in regions
of the genome encoding non-structural proteins. Consequently, recombination
is another factor that may play a significant role in the evolution of the
virus. - Mod.CP]
