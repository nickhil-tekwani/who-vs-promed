Kauai shrimp farm quarantined after disease found
-----------------------------------------------
A Kauai shrimp farm has been placed under state quarantine after some
shrimp tested positive for a disease known as White Spot Syndrome.
State officials say that it is a highly contagious and fatal disease for
shrimp and other crustaceans. It poses no threat to humans even if they eat
infected seafood.
The disease has been previously reported in Japan, China, Thailand, Korea,
the Philippines, as well as in Central and South America. This is, however,
the 1st time that it has appeared in Hawaii.
The state veterinarian, Doctor James Foppoli, says that the isolation of
the Kauai farm means that there is a good chance of containing the outbreak
and eradicating the disease.

[White spot disease (WSD) of penaeid shrimp is characterized by high and
rapid mortality accompanied by gross signs in moribund shrimp of white,
and, initially, circular inclusions or spots in the cuticle. These symptoms
are sometimes also accompanied by overall red body coloration. The
causative agent is white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), or white spot virus
(WSV), a double-stranded DNA virus of presently unknown relationship that
is potentially lethal to most of the commercially cultivated penaeid shrimp
species. WSD outbreaks were first reported in farmed _Penaeus japonicus_ in
Japan in 1993, followed by outbreaks in other Asian countries. WSD is one
of the 3 crustacean diseases that are reportable to the OIE. For further
details on WSD, its diagnostic procedures, and a reference list, the reader
is referred to chapter 4.1.2. of the OIE Diagnostic Manual for Aquatic
Animal Diseases - 2000.
