A disease that killed millions of bats in eastern North America has been found in 3 central Kentucky caves. Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Resources say 3 common bat species tested positive for the fungus responsible for white-nose syndrome. Those species include the northern long-eared, tri-colored, and little brown bat.

The department says the caves are northeast of Hardinsburg in Breckenridge County. The caves are within a 20-mile radius of each other. The caves are privately owned and not open to the public.

Biologists are still assessing caves within the area to determine the extent of the infection. "Caves are very abundant in this particular area of the state, and we are working diligently to canvas all known sites," said Sunni Carr, Wildlife Diversity Coordinator for the department.

Last winter [2010-2011], biologists surveyed about 100 caves throughout the state and confirmed the syndrome in southwestern Kentucky. It is estimated to have already killed nearly 6 million bats in North America.

Although white-nose syndrome is not a threat to humans, pets, or livestock, officials are still working to educate anyone who may enter a cave on the proper decontamination protocol. Decontamination helps to prevent human movement of the disease throughout the landscape. Ways that people can help reduce the risk of accidental spread of the disease can be found online at the website of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at http://www.fws.gov/whitenosesyndrome/cavers.html.

[An interesting update: These caves are privately owned and not open to the public. This may indicate the disease was brought in by the bats themselves and not the public. Of course, perhaps the people who own these caves may be spelunkers and brought the disease to their own caves. The epidemiology here may be interesting. - Mod.TG]
