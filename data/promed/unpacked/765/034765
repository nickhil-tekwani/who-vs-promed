China has reported 2 avian influenza deaths among 5 new confirmed cases of H5N6. The World Health Organzation has called for "urgent" action. A rise in the number of people infected with avian influenza in China last year [2021] has raised concern among experts, who have warned that the strain could be more infectious to humans. Two people in China have now died of bird flu; the other 3 remain in hospital.

Hong Kong's health department said 5 people in Sichuan province, Zhejiang province and Guangxi autonomous region were infected with the bird flu strain in December last year [2021].

One of the two who died was a 75 year old man from Luzhou in Sichuan Province. He fell ill on [1 Dec 2021] after being exposed to live domestic poultry. He was rushed to hospital 4 days later and died on [12 Dec 2021]. The other was a 54 year old man from Leshan in the same province. He became ill on [8 Dec 2021] and died 3 weeks later on [24 Dec 2021]. He too was reportedly exposed to live domestic fowl.

A 51 year old woman from Hangzhou in Zhejiang province fell ill on [15 Dec 2021] after being exposed to live domestic poultry. She was taken to hospital on [18 Dec 2021] and authorities said she was in a critical condition. The other 2 cases were recorded in Liuzhou, a city in Guangxi Autonomous Region, the Hong Kong health department said. A 53 year old man with a history of exposure to dead poultry fell ill on [19 Dec 2021] and remains hospitalized in a serious condition. A 28 year old man from the same city became ill on [23 Dec 2021] and is believed to be in a critical condition. It was not immediately clear how he had become infected. Since 2014, 65 people have been infected with the H5N6 bird flu - over half of them in the past 6 months.

WHO says most of the cases had been in contact with poultry and no cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed. But WHO says further investigation is "urgent" to understand the risk and understand the growing number of human cases.

Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, previously warned: "The increase in human cases in China this year [2021] is concerning. It is a virus that causes high mortality. "It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (for people)... or there could be more of this virus in poultry right now and that is why more people are infected."

Warning to travellers
---------------------
China is the world's largest producer of poultry and the top producer of ducks, which act as a reservoir for flu viruses. Backyard farms in China are still common and many people still prefer to buy live chickens from markets. Although avian influenza viruses constantly circulate among domestic and wild birds, they rarely infect humans. But the evolution of the viruses, which have increased as poultry populations increase, is a major concern because they could turn into a virus that spreads easily between people and cause a pandemic. In November last year [2021], British health authorities issued a travel warning to China about the risk of bird flu. Dr Gavin Dabrera, consultant in acute respiratory infections at UKHSA, said: "Anyone visiting China should avoid exposure to birds or live birds in 'wet markets' as a precautionary measure. "We continue to encourage people to avoid touching dead or dying birds and to maintain good hand hygiene when traveling. Bird flu remains a risk in China and if travelers experience flu-like symptoms within 10 days of returning from China they should call their GP or NHS 111 and report their recent travel."

[Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk of sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing.

According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. There has been an increase in the number of human H5N6 cases in 2021 and at least 5 cases were confirmed in December 2021. The identified exposures in nearly all cases are related to handling live poultry, and there appears to be an increase in transmission events... Is there more H5N6 avian influenza virus circulating in poultry and/or more importantly, is the virus now more easily transmissible? Important questions Indeed! - Mod.UBA
