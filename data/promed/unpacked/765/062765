Health authorities will consider introducing routine testing for a
previously unknown virus that caused the deaths of 3 organ transplant
recipients in Victoria earlier this year [2007]. The virus was
discovered after the deaths of 3 women, aged 63, 64 and 44. They had
received the liver and kidneys of a 57-year-old organ donor who died
of a brain hemorrhage in December last year [2006] shortly after
returning to Australia from an extended stay in Europe. The women
died within a week of each other in early January [2007], about a
month after receiving the organs.
The Director of the Victoria Infectious Diseases Reference
Laboratory, Mike Catton, said it quickly became clear they were
dealing with a discovery of international significance. The
laboratory enlisted the help of the Greene Infectious Disease
Laboratory at New York's Columbia University, where new gene
sequencing techniques uncovered a link to the lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Further testing on tissue samples from
the 3 patients confirmed a new type of arenavirus, a family of mainly
rodent viruses that occasionally affect humans. LCMV, which the virus
most closely resembles and which caused similar transplant deaths in
the US in 2003 and 2005, usually causes only minor symptoms in
humans. Organ transplant recipients, however, do not have the
immunity to fight it off.
Victoria's acting chief health officer John Carnie said the virus was
not transmissible between humans in normal circumstances and that
transplant patients should retain confidence in the system. "We must
not do anything to suggest that the transplant program should somehow
stop or be changed because of this discovery," he said. "The
transplant program saves many hundreds of lives every year. This is a
one-off event."
Health authorities are urging patients on the waiting list for organ
transplants not to overreact to what they believe is a rare event.
The introduction of tests for the new virus would be discussed with
the Transplantation Society of Australia and New Zealand. But Dr
Carnie urged caution. "The more tests that are done, the longer the
delay (in) transplanting the organ. If someone is terminally ill
waiting for an organ, you don't want to delay that procedure to
undertake tests that may not be properly validated yet or tests that
are to look for an extremely rare event," he said. "Clearly, these
findings have to be taken further, but people need to understand that
transplantation is a life-saving matter, and if you're waiting for a
kidney or a liver, the last thing you want is for this finding to
jeopardize that."
Further studies on the as yet unnamed virus are being conducted in
Victoria and the US.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P. Dudley
[The virus detected in the 3 Australian transplant patients,
receiving different organs from the same donor, was identified using
genome sequence analysis techniques as a lymphocytic
choriomeningitis-like "old world" arenavirus. Lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LMCV) is genotypically diverse and has been
associated with organ donation in the past. It is unclear at the
moment whether the virus detected in the Australian organ recipients
is a new arenavirus, a novel strain of LCMV or a reassortant virus
with one of its 2 genome components derived from LCMV. A description
of the agent has yet to be published.
In rodents, the natural host of LCMV, and in transplant recipients
infected with LCMV, cell-mediated immunity is suppressed. Clearance
of the virus allows reconstitution of the normal cellular immune
response. - Mod.CP]
