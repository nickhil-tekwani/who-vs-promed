[The etiology of these encephalitis cases is not stated. In previous reports, some have been diagnosed as due to Japanese encephalitis infections and other associated with contaminated water, suggesting enterovirus infections. The massive JEV [Japanese encephalitis virus] vaccination campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Behar states has resulted in a significant reduction in cases due to infection with that virus. Detection of enteroviruses in CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] has provided convincing evidence of their involvement in previously reported cases.

The cause of the majority of the AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] cases remains undiagnosed, and one hopes that the scientists involved in attempting to determine the etiologies of these undiagnosed cases will continue to find out what is going on so that scientifically sound preventive measures may be devised and implemented. Although JEV outbreaks may continue to be prevented through vaccination, preventing enterovirus infections, in the absence of vaccines, requires improvement of sanitation infrastructure to assure adequate human waste disposal and uncontaminated potable water supplies, a very costly effort.
