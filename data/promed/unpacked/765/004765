Diphtheria adds 2 new victims. On Thu [29 Sep 2016] afternoon, 2 indigenous [pemones] children of Sifontes municipality died with typical symptoms of the disease.

The information was confirmed by the deputy of the National Assembly Américo De Grazia on his Twitter account and informed by telephone that the bodies were buried the same day in the community. In another tweet, he stressed that the settlement does not have the medicine, although located in the municipality in which the disease rebounded in mid-April [2016]. According to counts by Correo del Caroní, 22 children have died since [diphtheria] reappeared: 14 in Sifontes (including the 2 indigenous [pemones] children [who died most recently]), 6 in Caroni and 2 in Heres.

The vaccination campaigns continued on Fri [30 Sep 2016], but at the same time allegations of irregularities abounded: the doses did not reach everyone.

Also, the Pediatric Emergency Service Leoni Menca annexed to Guaiparo hospital, remains closed due to pollution and collapse by the number of patients with diphtheria.

The Institute of Public Health, through its director, Doris Hair, reported "that the entity is strengthening the Accelerated Growth Plan Coverage and Monitoring Vaccine Preventable Diseases." However, it nowhere mentions diphtheria.
