In material conveyed by the National Journal of 28 Nov [2011], the
strategies were presented for the municipality of Foz do Iguacu to
confront dengue.

The Minisgtry of Health reiterates that the principal and most
effective measures for control and prevention of dengue that should
be
adopted by the populace are those measures of physically eliminating
breeding sites of the disease [dengue virus] vector mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_.

The strategy of the city of Foz do Iguacu, distributing insecticides
to the population, is devoid of any scientific evidence that
it works to prevent outbreaks of dengue, and therefore not
recommended
by the Ministry Health

The inadequate or indiscriminate use of insecticides could have
serious consequences for the environment and interfere with the
efficacy of control programs. The main factor is in respect to the
process of resistance of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito to
[insecticidal] products in use. This phenomenon, which has occurred
in
various regions in Brazil, including Foz do Inguacu, corroborate the
inadequacy of this practice.

[ProMED-PORT Mod. RNA provided this report from the Ministry of
Health,
indicating that the popular press report of massive area insecticide
spraying in the Foz do Iguacu area (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111128.3473) was not correct. The Ministry of Health approach of
focusing on elimination of vector mosquito breeding sites and avoiding
indiscriminate area insecticide application is both more effective for
vector control and more environmentally responsible.
