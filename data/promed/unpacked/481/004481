A total of 3 school children have died and 46 others have fallen ill in 2
separate food poisoning cases in Central China recently, according to local
police.
In Hunan Province, a farmer yesterday deliberately poisoned food, leaving 2
pupils dead and 25 others hospitalized. The incident followed another on
Tuesday night, in which 1 primary school student died and 21 others fell
ill in Hubei Province.
In the 1st case, a farmer from Nanjiang town in Pingjiang county of Hunan
allegedly went to Daxing and Simei primary schools in the county and gave
poisoned popcorn and citrus to a fifth-grade student of Daxing School, and
to a second-grade student of Simei School. He allegedly told them to share
the treats with fellow pupils.
After they ate the poisonous food, 27 schoolchildren immediately fell sick
and were sent to the hospital. However, the 5th grade student from Daxing
School and another student from Simei School, died on the way to hospital.
The suspect allegedly tried to escape by bus but was stopped by the police.
They said the suspect attempted to commit suicide by drinking poison. He
collapsed when caught and was rushed to a local hospital. The police said
the motives for the poisoning were not yet known.
In the other food poisoning case in Hubei, a total of 22 students fell ill
on Tuesday night after they had their supper in the dining hall of the
Nigou Central Elementary School in Jingyang town.
The school immediately sent the poisoned students to a local hospital. A
5th-grade student [different than the one mentioned above], died on
Wednesday morning of respiratory failure. According to the school
authorities, the girl was very weak due to diarrhea and stomach trouble
before the poisoning.
The local government said the cause of the poisoning was likely moldy corn
in the food, and authorities were still investigating the case.
By yesterday, 19 students had recovered, and 2 in a critical condition had
been transferred to the Yunxi County Hospital, said the officials.

[This article does not tell us much about the clinical signs in either of
these incidents. Illness with short incubations (less than 18 hours) and
without fever are likely to be related to pre-formed toxins, such as _S.
aureus_, which produces mostly vomiting with less than 6-hour incubation
period; or _C. perfringens_, which produces more diarrhea, and has a
slightly longer incubation time, approximately 12-18 hours. Generally these
are intoxications or illnesses lasting less than 24 hours.
Tainting the food with organophosphates may have produced some
gastrointestinal signs that could be acute and would require rapid
treatment. An excellent review of Organophosphates in food can be found in
ProMED-mail posting 19990307.0329.
Alternatively, the toxic agent in the 1st case may have appeared as a
flavoring on the popcorn, but the article does not tell us whether the
citrus was fresh fruit or some type of candy. Perhaps the flavor was more
easily disguised here.
Without knowing the clinical signs involved, determining the possible toxin
from this article is somewhat difficult. The article implies -- but does
not state -- that the toxin was quick-acting, so something on the order of
cyanide could be suspected and could be distributed in a citrus-flavored
drink. Some rodenticides may have been used in a citrus-flavored drink or
candy or even sprinkled on the popcorn.
In the second incidence, the possibility of aflatoxicosis exists. However,
there are other toxins that can be produced by molds on corn.
Ingestion of aflatoxin by humans is often associated with cancers later in
life and does not often present as acute illness. However, extremely high
doses of aflatoxin have produced severe gastrointestinal bleeding, which
can result in death. As this article does not tell us much about the
clinical signs, it is difficult to know exactly. This article indicates the
illnesses were more acute in nature than chronic cases.
That being said, suspected cases of aflatoxicosis have been reported in
India. The illness was characterized by jaundice, rapidly developing
ascites, portal hypertension, and a high mortality rate. Normally
development of jaundice and ascites are not as acute as this article tends
to indicate, and death is usually from massive gastrointestinal bleeding.
The disease was confined to extremely poor people who ate badly molded corn
with aflatoxin concentrations of 6.25 to 15.6 ppm. The average daily intake
was 1-6 mg of aflatoxin.
Reye's syndrome is characterized by symptoms of encephalopathy and fatty
degeneration of the viscera, which takes some time to develop. It occurs in
children under 16 and is believed to follow nonspecific viral illness,
influenza B, and varicella. Aflatoxins have been reported to be associated
with a Reye's-like syndrome in Thailand, New Zealand, Czechoslovakia, the
United States, Malaysia, Venezuela, and Europe. An incident of 106 fatal
cases of hepatic disease among 397 individuals who became ill after eating
maize contaminated with aflatoxin also suggests that sub-chronically acute
aflatoxicosis can occur in human beings.
The Reye's-like syndrome reported in various places around the world was
characterized by multiple symptoms; clinical findings include disturbed
consciousness, fever, convulsions, vomiting, disturbed respiratory rhythm,
altered muscle tone, and altered reflexes. The onset of the illness
included coughing, rhinorrhea, sore throat, earache, slightly enlarged firm
yellow liver, and a pale slightly widened renal cortex. The mortality rate
was as high as 81 percent of diagnosed cases. Since Reye's Syndrome is
characterized by abnormal mitochondrial structure and function, it is of
interest to note that aflatoxin B1 causes abnormal mitochondrial structure
and function. - Mod.TG]
