BMA on rabies alert after rabbit bites family
---------------------------------------------
Health officials are fanning out to contain a rabies threat in Chom Thong
district after members of a family were bitten by a pet rabbit infected with
the virus.

Deputy Bangkok governor Malinee Sukvejvorakij said the family's members were
given rabies injections after their pet rabbit died and posthumously tested
positive for the virus.

Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) health authorities will meet
tomorrow to identify the source of the rabbit's rabies infection so they can
prevent a possible epidemic. Their search will probably include a trip to Chatuchak Weekend Market, where the infected rabbit was bought.

The deputy governor said 120 health officials are checking the areas around the family's neighbourhood for signs of the disease. Pets such as dogs and cats within a 5-km radius of the family's home have been vaccinated against rabies.

"This is a rare case. There is only a 5 percent chance that a pet rabbit will be
infected with rabies; more than 90 percent of cases are dogs and cats," Dr Malinee
said. [see comment].

Phinai Luanprasert, director of the BMA-run 29th Public Health Centre, said
Samruay Phumarin, 42, visited the centre on Friday and said his family had
been bitten by their pet rabbit, which was infected with rabies.
Mr Samruay said the dead rabbit, named Poko, was one of 2 rabbits he
bought from Chatuchak Weekend Market late last year.

Mr Samruay said Poko began biting the feet of family members starting around
10 Jun 2012. The family eventually had to put the rabbit in a kennel.

Mr Samruay's son bled after being bitten by Poko while feeding the rabbit; he has since received anti-rabies shots. The animal died on 28 Jul 2012. The next day, the female rabbit also died.

Mr Samruay's family suspected Poko carried rabies and sent its carcass to
the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute for examination. The rabies test came
back positive. Mr Samruay and his family received shots from the hospital, but he worried he may have received the injection too late as he was bitten several days
before.

Dr Malinee said he knew of no rabies infections to have been reported among
rabbits in Thailand before this case.

[A rather exceptional, strange history, including the described timeline: the rabbit, eventually to be found 'rabies positive', started biting 10 Jun and died 28 Jul -- namely after about 50 days. Reportedly, the aggressive pet was put in a kennel where -- allegedly, it died. A lot of epidemiological investigation still to be carried out.

Rabies is extremely rare in small rodents, (rats, mice) squirrels, opossums, and in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares).

As commented by Mod. CP in posting 20070521.1623, a paper in the Journal of the American Veterinary Association in 2005 (15; 227(6): 932-5, 918), reported that raccoon-variant rabies had been confirmed in 7 pet rabbits and one pet guinea pig in New York State, and post-exposure treatment was required in several adults and children.

For the report on an earlier (1997) laboratory confirmed case, involving a rabbit kept in a petting zoo in northern Israel with history of exposure to an unidentified animal intruder (the size of a fox or mongoose), see posting 20041129.3190.

It is recommended that bites and scratches to humans from rodents and lagomorphs should be evaluated for potential rabies exposure on an individual basis, with consideration of whether the animal was caged outside or permitted outdoors unsupervised, or if any exposure to a potentially rabid animal had been convincingly reported. - Mod.AS]
