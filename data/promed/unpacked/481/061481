This work-in-progress paper establishes that preclinical scrapie can be
found in a live animal test of nictitating membrane lymphoid tissues. These
particular sheep were slaughtered for confirmatory tests, so it cannot be
determined how many of them would have gone on to develop clinical disease,
though that clearly does not matter for eradication purposes. It is of
interest that 60/60 of the Vermont sheep tested negative on third eyelids.

clinically
normal sheep in Pennsylvania. Vet Diagn Invest 2001 Jan;13(1):89-91. Kim H,

Following diagnosis of scrapie in a clinically suspect Suffolk sheep, 7
clinically normal flockmates were purchased by the Pennsylvania Department
of Agriculture to determine their scrapie status using an
immunohistochemical procedure. Of the 7 euthanized healthy sheep, 2 had
positive immunohistochemical staining of the prion protein of scrapie
(PrP-Sc) in their brains, nictitating membranes, and tonsils.
The PrP-Sc was localized in the areas of the brain where,
histopathologically, there was neurodegeneration and astrocytosis. The
PrP-Sc occurred within germinal centers of the affected nictitating
membranes and tonsils and was located in the cytoplasm of the dendrite-like
cells, lymphoid cells, and macrophages.
These results confirm that immunohistochemical examination of the
nictitating membrane can be used as a screen for the presence of scrapie
infection in clinically normal sheep at a capable veterinary diagnostic
laboratory. In sheep with a PrP-Sc-positive nictitating membrane, the
diagnosis of scrapie should be confirmed by histopathology and
immunohistochemical examination of the brain following necropsy. Following
full validation, immunohistochemistry assays for detection of PrP-Sc in
nictitating membrane lymphoid tissues can improve the effectiveness of the
scrapie control and eradication program by allowing diagnosis of the
disease in sheep before the appearance of clinical signs.
