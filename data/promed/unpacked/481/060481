Measles Outbreak in Northern Greece
-------------------------------------------
A measles outbreak that has been reported over the last 3 months in
northern Greece has prompted the Greek Pediatric Society to sound the
alarm. Some 150 measles cases have been recorded in the cities of
Thessaloniki, Alexandroupoli and Xanthi, with 100 of them being
admitted to Thessalonikiis hospital. The Greek Pediatric Society
described the cases as isolated and recommended that pediatricians
administer both doses of the vaccine. Scientists explained that the
lack of a 2nd dose, which should be administered by the age of 5,
sparked the outbreak and suggested the 2nd dose be administered by
the age of 3 due to the outbreak.
Measles symptoms are mild, and parents tend not to pay attention,
since they mistake them for an allergy. Measles is a contagious
respiratory infection caused by an RNA virus [_Measles virus_ is
classified as the type species of the genus _Morbillivirus_ of the
sub-family _Paramyxovirinae_ of the Family _Paramyxoviridae_. Other
species in this genus include _Canine distemper virus_ and
_Rinderpest virus_. - Mod.CP]. When someone with measles sneezes or
coughs, he or she can spread virus droplets through the air and
infect others. It usually takes the virus 9 to 12 days to run its
course. The symptoms of the infection are high fever lasting for
about 4 to 5 days, runny nose and full-body rash, which 1st appears
on the head and then spreads down to the feet.
The 1st vaccine dose should be administered at 15 months, while a 2nd
one should be given at the age of 2 or 3, due to this year's [2006]
outbreak. Normally, the 2nd dose is recommended at the age of 4 or 5
[but in the case of the current outbreak in Greece, it is being
recommended that the 2nd dose should be administered at the age of 2
or 3]. Apart from the vaccination, parents should make sure their
children avoid crowded places.

[The sporadic nature of the cases suggests that the outbreak is due
to a decline in vaccine coverage rather than a change in virulence of
the virus or a deficiency in the vaccine. - Mod.CP]
[Background information was not available on the English language
website of the Greek Ministry of Health, nor on checking through
Eurosurveillance. Checking the WHO immunization monitoring website
for data on measles in Greece
<http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/en/globalsummary/timeseries/TSincidenceByCountry.cfm?country=Greece>
reveals that in 2004 there was one case reported, no cases were
reported in 2003, 5 cases in 2002, 12 cases in 2001, 56 cases in
2000, 69 cases in 1999, 66 cases in 1998, 136 cases in 1997 and 6082
cases in 1996 (information on numbers of cases of measles per year
are available for 1980 through 2004). Given this background
information, the occurrence of an outbreak of approximately 150 cases
occurring in 3 different cities, described as "sporadic cases"
suggests a reintroduction of measles virus into the country. The
mention that "a lack of 2nd dose of vaccine" triggering the outbreak,
suggests that while vaccination coverages of 88 percent (as reported
to WHO) probably reflect 1st does coverages, and similar problems as
seen elsewhere are arising, with significant numbers of susceptibles
not fully vaccinated/immunized. More information on the epidemiology
of this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
