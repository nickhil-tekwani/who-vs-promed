Latest information on avian influenza
-------------------------------------
Outbreaks of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in poultry
were reported in Thailand, Viet Nam and Cambodia, and the 1st human
case was reported in Cambodia during the preceding month [January
2005]. Before Lunar New Year day on 9 Feb 2005, movement of poultry
and poultry products increased in the region. As a result, H5N1 virus
might have spread in domestic poultry. The need for vigilance to find
new cases, and the rapid isolation of infected or suspected flocks
from susceptible poultry and humans, are high priorities. Biosecurity
of domestic poultry to prevent the introduction of H5N1 virus is even
more important during this period to avoid spread.
Country situation
1. Cambodia [as of 11 Feb 2005]:
-----------
An outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was discovered at a small family chicken
farm in Takmao district, Kandal province, about 12 km south of Phnom
Penh City. The H5N1 virus was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute in
Phnom Penh City. 2 chickens tested positive. Cambodia has introduced
a temporary ban on the transportation of poultry into and out of
3-km-diameter quarantine zones around infected farms. The rearing of
all poultry within quarantine zones is banned. Surveillance of
poultry movement within a 10 km diameter around the outbreak is being
carried out. H5N1 infection of a 25-year-old woman from Kampot
Province was also confirmed on 31 Jan 2005. There have been no HPAI
outbreaks reported in the area where the woman lived, about 3 miles
from the Vietnamese border. Her 14-year-old brother had died in
mid-January [2005] with similar symptoms. The woman did not raise
chickens at home, but relatives in her village had reported dead
poultry. Cambodia and Viet Nam have agreed to set up a specialized
team to fight HPAI in the border region linking the 2 provinces.
2. Thailand [as of 15 Feb 2005]:
-----------
During 27 Jan-10 Feb 2005, HPAI outbreaks were reported in 9
districts of 5 provinces (Nakhonpathom, Nongkai, Suphanburi,
Phitsanulok and Phichit Provinces), and a total of 6911 birds have
died or have been culled. As of 15 Feb 2005, 6 provinces were still
the subject of the 21-day surveillance period imposed by the
Department of Livestock Development (DLD), Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives.
Outbreaks were also reported in Kalasin and Nakhon Sawan Provinces on
8 Feb 2005. A total of 496 wild birds died between 18 Jan and 3 Feb
2005 at the Boraphet reservoir, Thailand's largest freshwater swamp
in Nakhon Sawan Province. Samples from more than 6800 wild birds of
80 species in 7 provinces have been tested. More than 500 pigeons
nesting around Uthai Thani provincial hall had been culled by the end
of January [2005], after some tested positive for AI. Thailand plans
to cull about 2.7 million young free-range ducks to prevent HPAI
outbreaks, because ducks are believed to carry the virus without
showing clinical signs, and the nomadic nature of free-range farmed
ducks can help to spread disease. Thailand has found a high rate of
infection in ducks.
3. Viet Nam [as of 15 Feb 2005]:
-----------
From 1 Jan to 15 Feb 2005, HPAI has been confirmed in 34 provinces
and cities, and nearly 1.5 million birds, including doves, have died
or have been culled. On 7 Feb 2005, the Prime Minister announced a
new measure to stop farmers from allowing their ducks to roam freely
in canals and rice fields. Viet Nam also suspended the breeding of
ducks on 3 Feb 2005. In Viet Nam, ducks traditionally roam for
several kilometers, swimming in flooded rice paddies and eating
leftover grains in harvested fields (especially in the Mekong Delta).
As infected ducks may not show clinical signs, there is a greater
risk that they will spread the virus. Ho Chi Minh City decided to
cull its ducks on 2 Feb 2005. Viet Nam made an appeal to the United
Nations to help it fight HPAI on 3 Feb 2005. Since 30 Dec 2004, the
confirmed cases in Viet Nam reported by WHO are 10, of which 9 were
fatal.
