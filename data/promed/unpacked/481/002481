A recent outbreak highlights the fact that New Caledonia has one of
the highest rates of leptospirosis in the Pacific region (see graph
at <http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Leptospira-NC.jpg>). In fact, in
these islands, leptospirosis is more common than salmonellosis,
hepatitis A, hepatitis B, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis (see graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Leptospira-NC2.jpg>).

The following background information regarding leptospirosis in New
Caledonia is abstracted from Gideon (<http://www.GideonOnline.com>):

Leptospirosis is most common in west coast cattle-farming areas and
rural Melanesian settings
- disease rates are highest in the Bourail area.
- disease rates peak during March to May.

Notes
-----
- an average of 4 fatal cases are reported yearly.
- 57 cases were diagnosed during 1983 to 1985.
- 239 cases were reported during 2001 to 2005. The principal
serogroups were _icterohaemorrhagiae_ (69 percent), _australis_ (8
percent), and _pyogenes_ (6 percent)

58 percent of cattle are seropositive.

The principal reservoirs in this country are rodents, pigs, horses, and cattle.

Notable outbreaks:
1989 -- An outbreak (144 cases, 6 fatal) was reported, with 41
percent of the cases caused by serovar _icterohaemorrhagiae_.
