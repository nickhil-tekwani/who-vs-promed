Early Germinative Ideas on the Origins of Infectious Disease
--------------------------------
In his Pathways of Discovery essay "Infectious History" (SCIENCE 14 April
2000, p. 287), Joshua Lederberg presented a perceptive and insightful
overview of the historical background and progress in our understanding of
infectious diseases that affect humans and animals. In view of the
importance of infectious diseases that affect the major food and fiber
crops worldwide, however, it would have been instructive if Lederberg had
mentioned the important contributions to the germ theory of disease made by
plant scientists long before the classic contributions of Robert Koch and
Louis Pasteur.
For example, in 1807 Isaac Benedict Prevost, a Swiss scientist working in
Montauban, France, was the first to provide definitive evidence that the
bunt disease of wheat is caused by a microorganism, smut fungus (1). He
completed detailed experiments on the germination of bunt spores and
demonstrated by direct inoculation that they could infect wheat.
In 1853 Heinrich deBary, a German physician with an [interest] in plant
diseases, published a comprehensive paper [clearly implicating] smut and
rust fungi as causal organisms of diseases affecting cereal crops (2). In
subsequent research, he determined that a fungus [caused] the late blight
disease of potatoes (1,2). This disease caused starvation and mass
migration of [people] from Ireland after the devastating epidemics of 1845
and 1846. It is significant that deBary published much of his work 2
decades before Koch published his classical studies on anthrax [in] cattle.
These and other examples of the early pioneering work on plant disease that
supported the germ theory of disease paved the way for acceptance of the
landmark discoveries of Koch and Pasteur. The late blight epidemics
undoubtedly also served as a major incentive for research on microbial
diseases of humans. It is perhaps ironic that [the] evidence that bacteria
could cause disease in plants was hotly contested in Germany, and this led
to a bitter controversy between Alfred Fischer, a distinguished German
scientist, and Erwin F Smith, an American microbiologist (3). Smith
completed seminal studies on bacterial plant diseases including crown gall,
which causes [cancer-like] tumors in many plant [species] (3). Basic
studies on the tumor-inducing factor [produced] by the crown gall bacterium
led to the discovery of methods for genetic transformation of crop plants (4).
The discovery that tobacco mosaic disease is caused by a virus (TMV)
[probably] had a greater impact on subsequent research on human diseases
and the development of molecular biology than any other finding in the
field of microbiology. Lederberg noted the early work on TMV, but [did] not
emphasize the full significance of this discovery, omitting mention of the
description by Myron Brakke (5) of density-gradient centrifugation, a now
widely-used method for the isolation and purification of viruses. This
innovative procedure is generally recognized as "one of the most influential
developments in virology and molecular biology" (6, p. 5).
In view of the growing body of evidence that many animal and plant
pathogens use similar mechanisms for pathogenesis, medical scientists [who
specialize] in infectious diseases [should become] aware of the important
contributions that [have been made in the past, and are continuing to be
made], in research on infectious diseases of plants.

NB: There were actually 2 contributions concerning infectious disease in
the Science Compass section of SCIENCE 289 (No. 5485): 1689-90. The first
considered contributions by early plant scientists to our understanding of
the germ theory of pathogenesis and the second was a letter by Arthur J
Silvergleid on infection of humans by hepatitis C. Lederberg responded to
both papers but only his response to the paper on contributions of
scientists studying plant disease is [summarised] here. The text is as
follows: "I am more than happy to accept the amendation by Kelman,
Sequeira, and Nester. My own institution, the Rockefeller Institute,
resounds with names like Wendell Stanley, L. H. Kunkel, and Armin Braun,
who made important contributions to our understanding of pathogenesis
through their study of plant disease. I could add that the first
discoveries of host gene polymorphisms affecting disease outcome ensued
from the earliest applications of Mendelian analysis to wheat [reference by
R. H. Biffen. J. Agric. Sci. 1,4 (1905)]. In a brief essay, it was
impossible to do justice to every worthy milestone."
