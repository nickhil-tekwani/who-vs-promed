In July 1997, tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (TYLCV) was identified in
Florida, USA in tomato plants which were being sold to homeowners at
several national retail outlets. These infected plants were produced in
two nurseries located in Homestead, Florida [south of Miami - Mod.PKA.
Identification and inspection of the nurseries revealed that infected
plants were present in both nurseries. The manager of one of the nurseries
reported seeing plants with TYLCV symptoms as early as March, 1997. After
information on the presence of TYLCV was publicized in a press release and
was reported via television and newspaper, infected plants purchased by
members of the public were turned in to extension agents in several
counties in Florida (Alachua, Charlotte, St. Lucie, Sarasota) [basically
southern Florida, with the exception of Alachua county which is in
north-central Florida - Mod.PKA.
The first report of TYLCV in commercial plantings came from Virginia. The
tomato plants had been produced in a screenhouse in Manatee Co.
Commercial plantings of tomato in the field began in mid-August.
TYLCV-infected plants were found at low incidence in the following
counties: Collier, St. Lucie, Palm Beach, Manatee, Hillsborough, and Dade
[central and southern Florida - Mod PKA.
Incidence of TYLCV has remained low in all commercial plantings except
those in Dade and Palm Beach Co. Transplant production used imidacloprid,
a systemic insecticide, with effectiveness against all stages of _Bemisia
tabaci_, the whitefly vector. Growers used imidacloprid at transplantation
into the field in almost all fields in the state. This insecticide is
known to reduce spread of geminiviruses. In addition, growers were
diligent in roguing any plants which displayed TYLCV-like symptoms. As a
result, few TYLCV-infected plants could be found at the end of the season
in most counties.
TYLCV incidences of near 100% were found in some fields in Dade Co. in
April 1998. Incidences in other counties in commercial tomato fields for
the spring production season was near 0%.
