The government is considering regular vaccinations for all livestock
every 6 months for the next 3 to 5 years to prevent another outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]. "Until recently, Korea tried to stay
vaccine-free like Japan, but we tentatively decided to go for FMD free
status instead through regular vaccination over a long period of time,
regardless of the prevalence of the disease," a government official
said on Wednesday [2 Mar 2011].

To be recognized as FMD free through vaccination by the world
organisation for animal health [OIE], a country needs to have been
free of the epidemic for at least 2 years, so it is likely to take 2
or 3 years for Korea to get the status restored. On the other hand,
for vaccine-free status, an application can be lodged 3 months after
the culling of the last infected animal.

"Because we gave up culling livestock that would spread FMD virus and
have already vaccinated livestock nationwide, we run a much greater
risk of a chronic latent FMD virus than before," the official said.
"If we reduce or stop vaccination, the risk of recurrence or spread of
the virus increases, so introduction of constant vaccination is
inevitable."
