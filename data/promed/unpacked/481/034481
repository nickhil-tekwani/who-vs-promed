Regarding Henry Wilde's (Nov. 22) post about the fact that there are
thousands of people walking around with pig valves: A recent article in New
Scientist (I believe August 8, 1998) confirmed that pig valves (which are
indeed taken from slaughterhouses, MHJ [Thank you!) are treated with
glutaraldehyde (to kill their antigenicity), making pig heart valves as
"dead as toenails" according to the New Scientist article. So pig heart
valves cannot be compared to whole, live pig organs which carry a much
larger reservoir of viruses. It should also be noted that homograft valves
(derived from human cadavers) function comparably to pig valves. And new
synthetic valves preclude the use of the pig valves. They also last longer.
With regards to Richard Kennerly's question about TSE of swine: this was
raised as a concern for xenografted organs in a report by Peter Laing of
Salomon Brothers, London for Sandoz entitled, "The Unrecognized Potential
of Xenotransplantation" (January 1996).
With respect to whether pigs can be bred to be pathogen-free: In a 1996
report, the U.S. Institute of Medicine acknowledged that it is impossible
to rear completely pathogen-free animals, because endogenous retroviruses
can be passed transplacentally from mother to offspring. In addition, the
genes for porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), of which there are
several different types, are scattered throughout the pig genome, and are
shed by pigs' kidneys, lungs, hearts, livers, aortas, and skin - all organs
being considered for transplants. Numerous scientists, including the
discoverers of these PERVs, have warned that placing live pig organs in
humans is akin to injecting patients with live viruses.
Who will take responsibility for the outbreak of a new epidemic?

Pig valves are extensively treated before they are implanted usually with
glutaraldehydes and/or other stabilising substances. They are therefore not
expected to have live cells (and presumably any live viruses) when they are
implanted into a person. The only infective agents that could presumably
survive the processing of the valves might be prions. I have however seen
no data on whether dementia was more common in pig valve recipients. Even
if dementia was more common it would be very difficult to interpret this
data because pig valves (rather than artificial valves) are often used in
older patients and those with an expected shorter life expectancy because
they are thought to wear out faster.
There relevance to the xenograft debate is however likely to not be of much
benefit. As they are effectively sterilised chemically before they are put
into a person this is obviously a very different situation to placing
billions of live cells and their associated viruses (e.g. in a liver) into
a heavily immunosuppressed person.

>>... should a recipient, who is 'carrying' a foreign organ be afraid of
microorganisms, which are pathogenic to the donating animal?<<
An example which may contribute food for thought to this thread is the
recent outbreak of Influenza A (H5N1) which occurred in Hong Kong. You may
recall that several people fell ill and some died after seemingly
contracting a virus from chickens. Earlier this month more details came to
light. Dr Mak Kwok-hang, Consultant (Community Medicine) to the Hong Kong
Department of Health reported that the primary mode of transmission of H5N1
infection is believed to be from poultry to man; most likely through
contact with the faeces of poultry. There is no evidence that H5N1
infection is transmitted to man from raw, chilled or frozen poultry foods.
Furthermore, evidences indicated that transmission of the virus from
person-to-person had occurred but was uncommon.
(Reference: ProMED Digest, Monday, 16 November 1998, Volume 98 : Number 290)
If memory serves correctly however, one theory indicated that the original
pool of the virus may have been in swine. In China, it is common to find
both swine and poultry in close quarters. It is possible that a swine virus
made its way to poultry which was exported to Hong Kong resulting in the
subsequent H5N1 outbreak.
In this particular case, one must consider the possibility that the "middle
layer" (poultry) might not be necessary to promote the spread of virus if
the human host already had suitable receptors. Furthermore, would a direct
link to a human host promote faster mutation of the virus to allow more
efficient person-to-person transmission?

The risk of infection from xenotransplantation is not limited to
transplants from pigs. Below is a rather interesting reference, with the
abstract:
AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 1998 Jul 1;14(10):821-4 Amplification of simian
retroviral sequences from human recipients of baboon liver transplants.
Allan JS, Broussard SR, Michaels MG, Starzl TE, Leighton KL, Whitehead EM,
Comuzzie AG, Lanford RE, Leland MM, Switzer WM, Heneine W
Investigations into the use of baboons as organ donors for human transplant
recipients, a procedure called xenotransplantation, have raised the specter
of transmitting baboon viruses to humans and possibly establishing new
human infectious diseases. Retrospective analysis of tissues from two human
transplant recipients with end-stage hepatic disease who died 70 and 27
days after the transplantation of baboon livers revealed the presence of
two simian retroviruses of baboon origin, simian foamy virus (SFV) and
baboon endogenous virus (BaEV), in multiple tissue compartments. The
presence of baboon mitochondrial DNA was also detected in these same
tissues, suggesting that xenogeneic "passenger leukocytes" harboring latent
or active viral infections had migrated from the xenografts to distant
sites within the human recipients. The persistence of SFV and BaEV in human
recipients throughout the post transplant period underscores the potential
infectious risks associated with xenotransplantation.
This will be a fascinating area to follow. Does anyone know of other
publications with evidence of infection by an exotic pathogen following
xenotransplantation?
