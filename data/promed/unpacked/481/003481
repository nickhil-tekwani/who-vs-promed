Mysterious illness sickens Gulf Greyhound dogs
----------------------------------------------
Scores of racing dogs have become ill and 6 have died as a yet-undiagnosed illness, possibly canine influenza, swept through kennels at La Marque's Gulf Greyhound Park.

Race track general manager Sally Briggs told the Houston Chronicle last weekend's [7-8 Apr 2012] scheduled races were canceled as veterinarians treated the sick animals and tried to keep the disease, which began the last week in March 2012, from spreading.

On Monday [9 Apr 2012], Briggs said, about 80 dogs still were coughing, though none suffered fever. Gulf Greyhound Park generally has up to 700 dogs on site at any given time, she said. The track plans to stage Wednesday and Thursday [11-12 Apr 2012] races; the scheduling of weekend races is in question.

Texas Racing Commission spokeswoman Jean Cook a necropsy at Texas A&M University's College of Veterinary Medicine did not provide a diagnosis. Cook and Briggs could not estimate the total number of animals that became ill.

Briggs said a quarantine site has been established at the race track. "People can still bring dogs in if they want to, but these aren't going out to other tracks," she said. "This is very contagious." She was unable to estimate the number of animals in quarantine.

Briggs said the disease's symptoms include a "lingering cough" and fever. The sick dogs are under the care of veterinarians and receiving medication, she said.

The CDC reports that canine flu is caused by a virus that originally afflicted horses, and then jumped species. It first was detected in dogs 8 years ago. While potentially fatal, 80 percent of the cases are mild. The virus does not affect people.

[Canine influenza is easily transmitted in canine social circles or in community style housing, such as a kennel situation. It seems a little odd that with this undiagnosed outbreaks that the track officials are letting dogs continue to arrive. Perhaps that is an indication that this illness does not present itself as either serious or contagious. Yet the very fact that they have cancelled races would seem to indicate there is some worry for the canine athletes. - Mod.TG
