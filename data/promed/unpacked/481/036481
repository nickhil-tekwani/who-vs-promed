4 people have been infected by a pig-borne disease in China's south and 1
has died, the government said Monday, a day after an epidemic in another
part of the country was declared under control.
The infections were reported in 4 different areas in Guangdong province,
the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing information released by the
provincial government. No pigs were reported sickened by _S. suis_, the
bacteria blamed for the human cases, Xinhua said. It wasn't immediately
clear how the people were infected, but the disease is usually passed on
through contact with raw pork or sick swine. The report did not say if
person-to-person transmissions were involved. 2 of the cases were still
hospitalized, Xinhua said, without giving more details.
On Sun, 21 Aug 2005, China's ministries of health and agriculture said that
an outbreak of the disease in Sichuan province, hundreds of kilometers
northwest of Guangdong, had been brought under control.
At least 38 people died in the epidemic, which was first detected in Jun
2005, mostly farmers who butchered or handled infected pigs. More than 200
people were sickened.
Pockets of infection have been discovered in recent days. Last week, 2
deaths were reported in Jiangsu province in the east, and Hong Kong has
found a handful of cases in the past month. In Jun 2005, 2 human cases
were reported in Guangdong.
Yangjiang, along with Chao'an County and the cities of Nanxiong and
Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, were the latest areas which had human
infections, Xinhua said Mon, 22 Aug 2005. Medical teams have been sent to
investigate and help locals take protective measures, it said.

Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection said a _Streptococcus suis_
infection report involving a 79-year-old woman was confirmed Mon, 22 Aug
2005, which brings the year's total to 10.
The Kowloon City resident developed fever, right knee pain, redness and
swelling on 16 Aug 2005 and was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital 6 days
later. She has no recent travel history and is now in critical condition.
Her home contact has been put under medical surveillance.
Hong Kong health officials advised local residents to observe personal and
environmental hygiene and avoid contact with pigs. If contact with pigs or
raw pork is necessary, residents should use protective gloves, wash hands
after handling and clean and cover all wounds.

[3] Overview discussion

Marcello Gottschalk, a world leader in _Streptococcus suis_ research, said
that he fears the latest cases of the pig-borne disease on the mainland and
Hong Kong may be more complicated than the authorities
suspect. Gottschalk, a professor at the University of Montreal, leads the
International Reference Laboratory for identifying _S. suis_. The symptoms
exhibited by patients are different from anything else he has witnessed, he
says.
"What is happening in China is that you don't see meningitis, which is the
typical symptom, [instead] you see toxic shock, bleeding under the skin and
the incubation time is shorter," he said.
In addition to the different symptoms, Gottschalk also noted the mortality
rate is significantly higher. "Typically, the mortality rate is less than
5 per cent in humans, but this time it's different. People are dying very
fast, sometimes within hours, and there is a mortality rate of more than 20
percent," he said.
On Sun, 21 Aug 2005, mainland health officials revised the number of
infections in Sichuan province to 204 from 215, while the death toll was
revised down to 38 instead of 39 since 5 Aug 2005.
Gottschalk said he suspects _S. suis_ has obtained genetic material [from]
other strains. This outbreak shares symptoms with [those caused by]
bacteria such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus pyogenes_. _S.
suis can easily recombine with these strains because they are in the same
category, Gottschalk said.
Some farmers in Hong Kong and the mainland "vaccinate" by feeding the
tissue of sick pigs to healthy pigs, according to the chairman of the Hong
Kong Pig Farm Association, Wong Kwong-wing. On Wed, 17 Aug 2005, he said
these practices could lead to mutations of bacteria. Gottschalk warned that
homemade vaccination is "extremely dangerous" because, instead of
preventing the disease, healthy pigs may get infected by the live bacteria
which could lead to a serious outbreak.
While Wong said the overuse of antibiotics on pig farms is common and could
be a factor in the outbreak, Gottschalk said this isn't likely. Overusing
antibiotics could increase the resistance of bacteria, he said, but he
doesn't think this carries a greater threat since antibiotics still kill
bacteria like _Streptococcus suis_ easily.
