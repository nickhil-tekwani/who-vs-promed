An 11th child suffering partial paralysis after a bout of respiratory illness is being treated at Children's Hospital Colorado, officials said Friday [3 Oct 2014].

Dr. Sam Dominguez, a microbial epidemiologist at Children's, said the cases are concentrated in the metro Denver area, but a 10th was from elsewhere in Colorado. The 11th patient lives outside Colorado but within the hospital's referral area, which includes Wyoming, Montana, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico and South Dakota.

Children's Hospital and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating the cluster in connection with a nationwide outbreak of enterovirus [D68]. The virus is suspected of sickening thousands of Colorado children with common cold symptoms. More than 400 have been treated at the hospital for severe respiratory illness.

Enterovirus 68, also called EV-D68, has been found in only 4 of the 1st 10 patients, but it can be missed. Test results are not in on the 11th patient, Dominguez said.

A mother of one of the children with paralysis told reporters her story over the telephone on Friday [3 Oct 2014]. No names were given, and the grade-schooler's age and hometown were not disclosed. Nine weeks ago, her daughter developed a cough for a few days that was followed by high fever and lethargy. The days of lethargy were punctuated by "screaming fits that would come out of nowhere."

Tests at the doctor's office came back OK, so the family wasn't too alarmed, even when her daughter complained that it was hard to lift her left arm. "I'm a pretty calm, laid-back mom as a rule," the woman said. "My daughter can be pretty dramatic." But after a family outing over Labor Day weekend [5-7 Sep 2014], the family decided something was seriously wrong. The little girl couldn't raise her arm while she was dancing with abandon. Her left hand kept dropping her ears of corn at mealtime.

"She's stable now," the mother said. "She's back at school. She's started physical therapy.... My husband and I choose to believe she will recover completely. We tell her she's going to be able to do everything she wants to do."

Doctors at St. Louis Children's Hospital [Missouri] are seeing children with muscle weakness or even paralysis, which is possibly related to the rare enterovirus-68. Two children are being treated in St. Louis for a severe symptom -- muscle weakness or paralysis that could be linked to EV-68.

"This is a small part of the overall enterovirus-68 outbreak, but that outbreak has been very large and it's caused us to have very increased number of patients coming to the Emergency Room, increased number of patients in the Intensive Care Unit," said Dr. Greg Storch, who works at St. Louis Children's Hospital.

Paralysis that occurs when a virus attacks the spinal cord can be temporary or long-lasting.

Over the last few months, hundreds of children from the St. Louis area have been treated for severe respiratory illnesses. Some of those cases were linked to EV-68.

If a child starts to lose feelings in their limbs, medical help should be sought immediately.

[3] Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), 3 cases

http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20141004_Three_cases_of_muscle_weakness_reported_by_Children_s_Hospital_of_Philadelphia.html


Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] on Friday [3 Oct 2014] reported that it was treating 3 patients with a combination of muscle weakness and spinal abnormality, joining a growing number of institutions across the country that are seeking to understand clusters of cases with the same symptoms.

While the symptoms have been seen before, the combination is uncommon and similar cases would normally be seen over a much longer time period. This type of neurological disorder is often caused by an infection, and investigators hope to determine whether these symptoms are linked to an enterovirus, D68, that suddenly showed up in increasing numbers less than a month ago and has been causing respiratory illness in at least 40 states.

Late Friday [3 Oct 2014] night, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the New Jersey Department of Health that a 4-year-old boy from Mercer County who died last week had been tested positive for EV-D68, although it was not known if the virus caused the death.

For the neurological cases, among the distinguishing symptoms is a weakness, not paralysis, typically in one limb. Maybe the patient is "not able to lift an arm fully over the head but can move the shoulder," said Brenda Banwell, chief of neurology at Children's Hospital, or perhaps the child can "move fingers but is not able to hold or grip."

The other key finding is a lesion on a part of the spinal cord that controls motor strength that can be seen on an MRI largely restricted to what is known as gray matter.

The CDC on [26 Sep 2014] asked clinicians to review their records and report cases with those 2 findings since [1 Aug 2014] in patients up to age 21. The 3 patients at Children's Hospital, which normally would see between 3 and 8 cases a year with some similarities, were the only ones that met the CDC criteria.

In the 2 weeks before the children were admitted, Banwell said, 2 of them had experienced a mild fever and rash, while one had cough- or cold-like symptoms but no fever and no rash. "They are not getting worse," she said, declining to give details. "This is a type of illness where the recovery can take some time."

About 20 similar cases have been reported around the country, although that number is expected to grow rapidly in response to the CDC's request for a review.

At the same time, hundreds of cases of the enterovirus D68 have been reported, including 6 in Pennsylvania and 9 in New Jersey. Some have caused severe respiratory illness around the country. Specimens from several children who died, including the Mercer County child, were positive for EV-D68, although tests to determine the cause of death are continuing; hundreds of viruses circulate in the fall, and it would not be unusual to find some in a patient who died from any number of causes.

Similarly, a link between EV-D68 and the muscle weakness is possible but not confirmed. At least 4 Colorado children with the neurological symptoms also tested positive for the enterovirus, the CDC said Friday [4 Oct 2014], but the meaning of that finding was not yet known.

Banwell said tests for EV-D68 in the 3 patients here were not expected back until next week [week of 6 Oct 2014].

The treatment -- mainly to manage swelling and enhance immune response -- would not necessarily change; there are no antiviral drugs to treat EV-D68.

Should parents worry? "Any abnormality of the spinal cord is a serious neurological illness," Banwell said. She had the usual advice: practice good hand hygiene, don't visit people who are visibly ill. If a child has borderline weakness of a limb, ask a pediatrician. If it is severe or builds quickly, go to the emergency room. (Ditto for breathing problems that could be caused by an enterovirus.) "If a child has any weakness of arms or legs, or facial weakness, bring them in for a consultation" at Children's Hospital, she said, which has a formal program to deal with this type of neurological illness.

[4] Ontario (Hamilton), 4 cases

Four Hamilton-area [Ontario] children have polio-like symptoms, and this has prompted McMaster Children's Hospital to investigate a possible link between enterovirus D68 and paralysis.

All 4 kids have unexplained muscle weakness in either an arm or a leg, which came on suddenly. One has tested positive for the respiratory virus, which is on an upsurge, with more cases of severe illness in children than normal this fall.

"We don't know the cause of the muscle weakness," said Dr. Lennox Huang, chief of pediatrics at the hospital. "And it's not clear that it is EV-D68 related. However ... we are pursuing the possibility of a connection."

Similar neurological symptoms in children have been reported in other parts of Canada and the United States. "It's very uncommon to see this type of neurological presentation happening in children," said Dr. Brandon Meaney, division head of pediatric neurology at the hospital. "Essentially, every region across Canada and the United States is reporting a small but significant cluster."

The US Centers for Disease Control put out a health advisory [26 Sep 2014] and it's probing whether there is a link between the neurological symptoms and the respiratory virus. "What we know is that there is a spike of children who are presenting with a very unusual loss of strength ... in a fashion that used to be seen with polio," said Meaney. "This is quite rare," said Meaney. "Coincidentally, we're in the midst, continent-wide, of an upsurge of enterovirus D68."

However, only about half of the North American children with muscle weakness have also tested positive for the enterovirus. "That is a bit of a hole in the theory," said Meaney. "There is lots of testing and investigation being done about it." In the past 5 weeks, Hamilton has had 139 confirmed cases of EV-D68, with many of the patients being children. The vast majority had mild cold symptoms and recovered at home.

Meaney called those with muscle weakness "a very small, unlucky, statistically rare group of individuals." "Of the many thousands of kids who must have been exposed to enterovirus D68, only 4 have manifested this apparent neurologic complication," said Meaney. "It's not something that should be cause for panic or alarm. But from our viewpoint medically, it's very significant. It's something we need to look into." Meaney says it's not yet known if the muscle weakness is permanent. "We wish we knew that," he said. "We are very early on here." Historically, children who get similar neurological symptoms possibly linked to similar viruses don't fully recover. "There is some recovery of function over time," said Meaney. "Most seem to be left with permanent deficits to some degree."

There is no vaccine against EV-D68 like there is with polio, a type of enterovirus that can cause paralysis, difficulty breathing and death. "Nobody paid attention to this virus until a month ago," said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infection, prevention and control at Toronto's University Health Network. "It's been around since 1962. You wouldn't develop a vaccine ... for a virus that is one of 200 causes of the common cold. If they actually are able to draw a link with paralysis, then it becomes a different story." However, Gardam cautions science is "a long way away" from proving the 2 are connected.

"The fact they are seeing clusters at the same time this virus has emerged over the last month or so makes people wonder," he said. "I don't think anyone knows what to make of it yet except they're investigating it." He says "it's hard to know" how concerned the public should be. McMaster is alerting parents to get immediate medical attention for children who develop muscle weakness suddenly over 24 to 48 hours. "Sudden onset of muscle weakness or partial paralysis is very rare in children and, whenever those symptoms appear, it's important to seek immediate medical care," said Meaney. "This is not common fatigue or body ache that we're referring to. "It's much more serious than that. If your child is not able to walk, has trouble moving his or her limbs or has problems breathing, take them to a doctor right away."

There have been no deaths from EV-D68 in Hamilton. A small number of children in North America who have tested positive for the virus have died from other illnesses.

The Hamilton Regional Laboratory Medicine Program is continuing to monitor the local prevalence of EV-D68. Symptoms of the virus include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough and body or muscle aches. "What's encouraging is that we continue to see a decrease," said Dr. Marek Smieja, head of virology at the lab, referring to cases in the city. "That shows that EV-D68 is now past its peak and on the decline."

[5] Ontario (Toronto), 3 cases

http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/health-headlines/three-kids-in-toronto-with-partial-paralysis-tested-for-enterovirus-d68-1.2037740


Three young patients who suddenly developed muscle weakness after experiencing a respiratory illness are being tested for enterovirus D68 at Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto [Ontario], the hospital confirmed Friday [3 Oct 2014].

Dr. Upton Allen, chief of Infectious Diseases at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, says the 3 patients are under the age of 18 and are exhibiting weakness that ranges from mild to full paralysis. He says officials are still waiting for test results to see if the cases are linked to EV D68. "Things are at an extremely early stage and so we are not able to fully describe how things are at the moment," he told reporters. "We need to await results of testing to be sure we make the right connections," he said, adding the results are expected early next week.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control, about half of the 10 Colorado children hospitalized with muscle weakness tested positive for EV D68 in their nose secretions. With some children apparently free of the virus, officials can't make any conclusions about the link between the 2 symptoms.

"We do not yet know whether this respiratory infection is linked to their muscle weakness," reads a CDC statement Friday [3 Oct 2014].

While D68 is not a new virus, the number of children being diagnosed with it is unusually high this year. Several reports have emerged recently in both Canada and the U.S. of children developing paralysis or weakness after coming down with an enterovirus infection.

Public Health Ontario confirmed Friday [3 Oct 2014] there were 9 paralysis cases in the province. Alberta doctors are also investigating whether 4 children with respiratory illness and symptoms of paralysis, or "neurological syndrome," are infected with enterovirus D68, a spokesman for Alberta Health Services confirmed earlier this week.

In British Columbia, health officials are investigating 2 other cases of polio-like symptoms in patients with respiratory illness. Four children in Hamilton, Ontario, who have also developed polio-like symptoms are being tested to see if they have also been infected with enterovirus D68. Dr. Allen said it's important to remember that while it is rare, every year there are children who develop muscle weakness sporadically after contracting a respiratory illness.

Enterovirus D68 is a virus in the _Picornaviridae_ family, which also includes the polio virus, rhinoviruses and other enteroviruses.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says while acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) -- the term used for sudden muscle weakness -- is not a reportable condition, they are now asking all state and local health departments to report such cases as it investigates possible causes.

Upton noted that most enterovirus infections cause mild cold symptoms that get better on their own. But he advised parents to monitor their children and take them to see a doctor if a lingering cold seems to suddenly get worse or if the child suddenly develops a fever. Public health officials are also advising parents to keep tabs on their kids' colds if they have asthma or difficulty breathing. As well, any child who suddenly develops muscle weakness or is unable to move their limbs should seek immediate medical care.

[The number of states in the USA and provinces in Canada that have reported cases that meet the CDC case definition continues to grow, so that as of today (4 Oct 2014), we have found reports on 29 cases under investigation in the USA and 13 cases under investigation in Canada. To date, cases have been reported in Alabama (1), California (2 since 1 Aug 2014, 23 from December 2012 to February 2014), Colorado (11, 1 from outside state; location not available), Massachusetts (4), Michigan (1), Missouri (5; 3 in Kansas City, 2 in St. Louis), Pennsylvania (3), Texas (1) and Virginia (1) in the USA, and Alberta (4), British Columbia (2) and Ontario (7) in Canada.

In an article by Robert Roos of CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), there is mention that case(s) have been identified in New York as well, but this moderator been unable to find further information on a case or cases in either New York City or New York State (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/10/role-ev-d68-polio-illnesses-still-unclear).

Circumstantial evidence continues to point at enterovirus D68 as the etiologic agent, but that has not been proven as yet -- nor has poliovirus been completely ruled out (although less likely given the seemingly preponderance of upper extremity weakness and partial paralysis described).

Of interest is a report of an upper extremity weakness in a child in Uttar Pradesh, India, who is being investigated as a case of acute flaccid paralysis. Upper extremity paralysis has not been a predominant finding with poliovirus infection. As wild poliovirus transmission has been interrupted in India (the last reported case had onset in January 2011), it is likely that poliovirus infection will be ruled out in this child. One wonders if testing for other non-polio enteroviruses will be conducted (see http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Polio-scare-as-child-shows-symptoms/articleshow/44357444.cms).

ProMED-mail welcomes more information on investigations into the above mentioned cases as well as other identified cases not previously mentioned.
