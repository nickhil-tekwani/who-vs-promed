Abstract
---------
Background
We examined relationships between schistosome infection, HIV transmission or acquisition, and all-cause death.

Methods
We retrospectively tested baseline sera from a heterosexual HIV-discordant couple cohort in Lusaka, Zambia with follow-up from 1994-2012 in a nested case-control design. Schistosome-specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA. Associations between baseline antibody response to schistosome antigens and incident HIV transmission, acquisition, and all-cause death stratified by gender and HIV status were assessed. In a subset of HIV-negative women and HIV-positive men, we performed immunoblots to evaluate associations between _Schistosoma haematobium_ or _Schistosoma mansoni_ infection history and HIV incidence.

Results
Of 2145 individuals, 59% had positive baseline schistosome-specific antibody responses. In HIV-positive women and men, baseline schistosome-specific antibodies were associated with HIV transmission to partners (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.8, P less than 0.005 and aHR = 1.4, P less than 0.05, respectively) and death in HIV-positive women (aHR = 2.2, P less than 0.001). In 250 HIV-negative women, presence of _S. haematobium_-specific antibodies was associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition (aHR = 1.4, P less than 0.05).

Conclusion
Schistosome infections were associated with increased transmission of HIV from both sexes, acquisition of HIV in women, and increased progression to death in HIV-positive women. Establishing effective prevention and treatment strategies for schistosomiasis, including in urban adults, may reduce HIV incidence and death in HIV-positive persons living in endemic areas.

[The study underlines the importance of lesions from schistosomiasis in the male and female reproductive organs, which may lead to macro and micro haemorrhage into, for instance, semen and mucosal lesions. Schistosomiasis is a chronic infection with slowly evolving pathology. For a recent review of schistosomiasis, see McManus DP, et al. Schistosomiasis.
