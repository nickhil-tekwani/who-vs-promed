A total of 9 people are admitted to Chikwawa district [Southern region] hospital following a cholera outbreak. This comes barely 4 months after another outbreak hit the district's 2 villages in the area of Paramount Chief Lundu, affecting 38 people. The Environmental Health Office for Chikwawa district has confirmed the development, citing poor access to safe water and poor quality of sanitary facilities in villages. There are fears that the cholera outbreak may spread to other areas where communities do not have access to portable water supply as well as toilets.

South Darfur
------------
In 2 months, 42 people have died of cholera in Kalma camp for displaced people in South Darfur. 539 others have been infected. The deaths occurred between [26 Jun and 20 Aug 2017], the coordinator of the camp in Nyala, Yagoub Abdallah Furi, informed Radio Dabanga yesterday [21 Aug 2017]. "There are 3 medical isolation centres belonging to 2 organizations from the USA that have been established in the camp since the cholera broke out [in Nyala] in June [2017]."

Currently there are 37 hospitalized cases at the camp's isolation wards. "There is a large shortage of intravenous solutions. We hope organisations working in the medical field and the Ministry of Health to provide us with medicines." The epidemic reached Manawashi, north of Nyala city, at the beginning of August 2017.

Central Darfur
--------------
At least 36 people have been infected with cholera in Central Darfur's Nierteti in the past 11 days. 4 of them died, sources reported to Radio Dabanga. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its latest biweekly bulletin that "humanitarian access and insecurity remain major challenges for the implementation of key health and protection interventions" in Central Darfur.

"Nierteti's hospital faces gaps in medicines, including oral and intravenous re-hydration solutions [..]," OCHA stated. "In Zalingei hospital, there are several sanitation issues, including lack of latrines and evidence of improper solid waste management..."

National epidemic
-----------------
The National Epidemiological Corporation reported in early July 2017 that nearly 24 000 Sudanese have been infected and 940 cholera patients have died since the outbreak of the infectious disease in Blue Nile state in [August 2016]. The Sudanese authorities refuse to call the disease by its name, however, and instead refer to it as "acute watery diarrhea". The National Intelligence and Security Service has repeatedly warned medics and the press in the country not to make mention of cholera.

West Darfur
-----------
15 people have died of cholera while 18 others have been infected in Murnei, West Darfur, in the past 3 days. A sheikh in Murnei camp for displaced people told this station, "18 people are now in the isolation ward in the camp." The 18 infected people came from Um Tajok village near Murnei on [9 Aug 2017]. 6 people died of cholera at the village that day, a sheikh reported from the camp last week [week of 7 Aug 2017].

Blue Nile
---------
In Blue Nile state, 3 brothers died in the hospital of Ed Damazin on [Tue 15 Aug 2017]. A relative of the deceased told Radio Dabanga that the 3 family members died of the same disease in the hospital, in El Hijra district.

Sennar
------
Meanwhile in Sennar, 18 people contracted cholera in El Dindir locality this week [week of 14 Aug 2017]. A medical source told this station that on [Thu 17 Aug 2017], El Dindir's hospital received 13 new cases of cholera, 8 of which were received earlier this week. 5 others arrived on [Thu 17 Aug 2017]. The medical isolation centre at Bardana village, south of the city, also recorded 5 new cases of cholera.

The hospital in Singa received 3 new cases of cholera on [Thu 17 Aug 2017]. A medical source informed Radio Dabanga that the 3 patients had come from Um Benin village, south east of Singa. "16 people suffering from cholera are still in the isolation ward."

Northern state
--------------
The 1st cases of cholera have been reported in the southern part of El Mahas in Northern state, at Arduan health centre. The patients arrived from Maljab area on [Thu 17 Aug 2017], while El Tura health centre of El Mahas received another case.

Nubian activist Adham Nasr told Radio Dabanga that the woman has been isolated in a room at Arduan health centre to receive treatment. There are concerns that the disease might break out in the area during the rainy season, which makes it difficult to move from and to Arduan.

Red Sea
-------
A health centre in Arayab area in Ganab, Red Sea state, received 5 children suffering from cholera on Wed 16 Aug 2017. Journalist Osman Hashim told Radio Dabanga that the one of them has been transferred to Port Sudan Hospital. The doctors were unable to give information about the cases. The hospital's administration has not allocated a ward to isolate the cholera patients.

Earlier in August 2017 a volunteer of one of the cholera awareness raising campaigns in Sudan told Radio Dabanga that the reality in the hospitals is very poor.

[4] Cholera - Congo DR (Kwilu, South Kivu)

A total of 16 people died of cholera in one week in a region in the south west of the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC], where about 100 cases have been recorded, it was learned [Fri 18 Aug 2017] from the provincial authorities.

"We have recorded 16 cases of deaths and about 100 people are infected with cholera" in 3 zones of the province of Kwilu, governor Nicholas Bulukungu told reporters. "The province does not have a center specializing in the treatment of cholera. The isolation of the patients is a serious problem," he said. The town of Bandundu and the 2 affected localities are inhabited by nearly a million people, invited to "strict observance of the basic rules of hygiene."

Another Congolese province (South Kivu in the east) is facing an outbreak of cholera with 2 deaths and several tens of cases reported for nearly 3 weeks.

According to the UN, cholera has become a major public health problem in the DRC with thousands of cases recorded every year in many provinces in this vast country without infrastructure and where most of the population lives in poverty.

More than 700 deaths of cholera were recorded in 2016 in the DRC.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/cholera-outbreak-18-fresh-cases-reported-on-day-5/articleshow/60126504.cms


18 fresh cholera cases were reported at Guru Har Rai Nagar [Ludhiana, Punjab] on on day 5 of the outbreak. District epidemiologist Ramesh Kumar said more than 500 people contracted the disease over the past few days. Health officials are taking all possible measures to stem the outbreak, including organizing medical camps to engender public awareness about the disease.

Meanwhile, sources said the health department is still trying to hide the exact number of cases reported in the camp. "No water samples have been collected on the 5th day of the outbreak. All the 18 patients have been admitted to private hospitals. Health officials are not paying attention to affected areas as a number of cases are being still being reported."

A child has reportedly succumbed to diarrhea in Sattbhara, of Maharajgunj Municipality-7 in Kapilvastu district [Province Five] on Sun 20 Aug 2017. According to Jayasawal, more than 50 persons have been affected in the outbreak of diarrhoea in the municipality since [Thu 17 Aug 2017]. He said the consumption of water and fish obtained from contaminated water sources could be the cause of the outbreak.

The health workers deputed from the District Health Office (DHO) have been treating locals with preventive medicines while the critical ones have been undergoing treatment in the Bahadurgunj Hospital in the district. Meanwhile, the DHO has urged the general public to take precautions and preventive measures as there is high risk of diarrhoea spreading in the flood-hit areas.

Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).
