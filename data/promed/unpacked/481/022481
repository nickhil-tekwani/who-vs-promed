A one-and-a-half-year-old boy from Tibba Road [Ludhiana] has been found infected with Japanese encephalitis. A _Culex_ mosquito, through which the disease spreads, has also been found nearby.

The boy was suffering from a fever for some days. When his tests were conducted he was found infected with Japanese encephalitis [virus].

"The boy's test was conducted at the CMCH [Christian Medical College & Hospital] and it came out positive for Japanese encephalitis. We have sent one more sample to the PGI [Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research], for testing and the report is awaited," said district epidemiologist, Dr Ramesh.

"Nobody in the boy's family is unwell. An entomological survey has been conducted in the area and _Culex_ mosquitoes, through which the virus is transmitted to humans, has been found in the nearby sewerage," he added. "Fogging was done and larvae destroyed. We are now waiting for the report sent to PGI, Chandigarh," he said.

There is a pig farm nearby Tibba Road. Samples of pigs have also been collected to rule out if the virus has spread from pigs to humans.

Japanese encephalitis [virus] is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Culex_ species of mosquitoes. Pigs and wading birds are the main carriers of the Japanese encephalitis virus.

[Although the majority of Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases, often reported with cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), occur in the northeastern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam, JE cases are also reported from other states including Punjab. The single confirmed JE case reported above indicates that the JE virus transmission season has begun. No mention is made in the report above of plans to vaccinate people residing in the locality where the case occurred. Increased surveillance is prudent. - Mod.TY
