[1] Wild boar, inter-Korean border, spread

A wild boar found dead near the border with North Korea has tested positive for African swine fever (ASF), authorities said on Saturday [2 Nov 2019], bringing the total number of such cases to 20 in South Korea. The confirmation came a day after the wild boar carcass was found by soldiers in the central border town of Cheorwon, about 90 km north of Seoul, according to the National Institute of Environmental Research. South Korea has begun to mobilize hundreds of soldiers and civilians to hunt down wild boars near the border to try to contain spread of ASF.

Separately, South Korea has confirmed 14 ASF cases at pig farms since mid-September [2019], when the country's 1st case of the deadly hog disease was confirmed at a farm near the border with North Korea.

In May 2019, North Korea reported its 1st outbreak of the disease at a farm near its border with China to the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE].

It is still unclear how the virus traveled into South Korea, but so far, all reported cases here have occurred in areas bordering the North. The animal disease does not affect humans but is deadly to pigs. There is currently no vaccine nor cure for the disease.

[On Fri 1 Nov 2019, South Korea reported the confirmation of the 19th ASF-infected wild boar. Its carcass was found by a resident in Yeoncheon, north west of Seoul (Gangwon-do province), the previous day (media report at https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191101012500325 (thanks to rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka).

More than a year after African swine fever [ASF] began ravaging hogs in China, the virus may be escaping along the same route it's believed to have entered, via Russia. While the swine contagion has been present in Russia for 12 years, it has only been spreading actively in the country's Far East for the past few months. Authorities have reported almost 60 outbreaks in wild and domestic pigs, most within a few miles of the border with China.

Infected wild boar may be playing a role in cross-border spread, said Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine and life sciences at City University of Hong Kong. "Wild boar are very likely to now also be infected in northern China," Pfeiffer said.

While the Far East accounts for less than 2% of Russia's swine herd, the virus's persistence in wayward, wild animals may frustrate attempts to control the disease on both sides of the border. In China, ASF has reduced the nation's pig herd by almost half, causing record-high pork prices and a shakeup of its USD 118 billion industry.

Experience in Europe with ASF has shown that once the disease becomes established in wild pigs, it's "extremely difficult to control it in both wild and domestic pigs, especially when the wild population is dense and swine production is characterized as extensive, semi-intensive or 'backyard'," said Andriy Rozstalnyy, an animal health officer with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome. "Smuggling of infected pork products, backyard pig-farming, and semi-subsistence hunting could play an important role" in the spread of the virus, Rozstalnyy said in an email.

Rosselkhoznadzor, Russia's biosecurity watchdog, called for stronger measures to protect the region's backyard pigs in August, about a month before the virus was found in sausage meat that a Chinese citizen had tried to smuggle across the checkpoint at Zabaykalsk, opposite the Chinese border town of Manzhouli. The illegal transport of goods, the movement of tourists, and the migration of wild boar all pose disease risks, Rosselkhoznadzor said in a 5 Aug 2019 statement. In addition, the virus could spread in live pigs, contaminated meat products and crops, it said. "The current unfavorable ASF situation in the People's Republic of China leads to a high risk of infection in the border regions of the Russian Federation and neighboring countries," Rosselkhoznadzor said.

The warning followed the deaths a week earlier of a sow and 2 boars on a farm in Primorsky, the province of which Vladivostok is the administrative center. Since then, 275 pigs have died, and 2473 have been killed and disposed of in 59 outbreaks in the Primorsky, Amur, and Jewish Autonomous regions, according to data Russian authorities submitted to the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] in Paris.

Still, outbreak incidence data in Asia are incomplete and don't fully explain the burden of disease, the Food and Agriculture Organization's [FAO] Rozstalnyy said, adding that it's "a challenge to organize reliable surveillance and accurate diagnostics in these remote areas."

It's also difficult to determine the source of the outbreaks, said Denis Kolbasov, the director of the Federal Research Center of Virology and Microbiology, near Pokrov, Russia. Some genetic studies of ASF viruses circulating in China have found similarities with strains in Eastern Europe and Russia, pointing to a likely source. "If we are talking about the possibility of virus invasion from China to Russia, then we should talk about a mutual exchange" of the virus, Kolbasov said. A pan-Russian strain was responsible for an outbreak in Siberia near the border with China in 2017, Kolbasov and colleagues showed last year. At the time, the outbreak was the furthest east the virus had been reported.

While both countries have made food security a priority, the flare up of outbreaks aren't likely to hurt ties. The worsening of the epidemic on the border between Russia and China is "a standard operational issue that is unlikely to impact international relations," said Ilya Strokin, director of KPMG's Agribusiness Center of Excellence in Russia.

[Russia's most recent ASF report from its Asian territories (follow-up report No 10 of 23 Oct 2019) addressed 2 new ASF cases in wild boar in the Primorskiy Kray, one killed on 13 Oct 2019, lab-confirmed 17 Oct 2019, the other one found dead on 17 Oct 2019, lab-confirmed 21 Oct 2019; see, with an interactive map, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=32188.

The ASF event, which had started 30 Jul 2019 in Russia's far east, bordering China's north eastern province Heilongjiang, has included a total of 59 (submitted) outbreaks as of 23 Oct 2019; OIE's summary, as of 23 Oct 2019, follows:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 2732 / 398 / 258 / 2473 / 0
Wild boar / - / 19 / 17 / 3 / 0

All (11) OIE reports from the 3 oblasts (Primorsky, Amur, and Jewish Autonomous) involved, are linked at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31280, which includes an interactive map. The outbreaks' locations are indicated as circles for domestic swine and as triangles for wild boar; please click on the cluster to center it, and zoom in for the required resolution.

Information from China on the ASF situation in wild boar is rather scarce. The species is widely distributed throughout China, except for some dry and unsuitable regions in the west (Xinjiang province) and the region bordering Mongolia. A relatively high density, estimated at a mean of 2.24 head/sq.km [5.8 head/sq.mi] is reported from some forests in northeastern China, and even higher in the southeastern coastal areas. In Guangdong Province Nature Reserve, wild boar density was estimated at between 4.87 and 5.15 head/sq.km. [12.6-13.4 head/sq.mi] (ref 1, page 8). However, little precise information is available about the ecology, population structure and dynamics, as well as the actual distribution and density, of wild boar in China.
