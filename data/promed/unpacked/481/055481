The province of Los Santos closed the year 2022 with 39 cases of hantavirus without deaths, according to the regional epidemiology report.

Of the total, 22 cases correspond to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) and 17 to hantavirus fever (H)F, distributed in the districts of Tonosí (11 HF and 13 HCPS), Los Santos (4 HF and 4 HCPS), Las Tablas (1 FH and 3 HCPS), Macaracas (1 HF and 1 HPCS), and Guararé (1 HCPS).

The report reveals that the district of Tonosí has the highest proportion of cases, with 61.5% in 2022; the province has not registered deaths from hantavirus since 2019. Another relevant aspect is that the district of Los Santos had 8 more cases than in previous years.

The Minsa [Ministry of Health] urges the population to keep the residential premises clean, avoid storing grain in the homes, and seal holes that can become burrows for rodents. In the same way, people are recommended when returning to homes that have remained closed, to ventilate the house, and spray water before sweeping.

[Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo hantavirus and cases occur there every year. Fortunately, there were no deaths due to hantavirus infections in 2022. Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms ProMED's conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
