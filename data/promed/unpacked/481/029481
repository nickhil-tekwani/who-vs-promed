CDC collaborated with public health, veterinary, agriculture, and wildlife officials in many states and with the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine to investigate 2 multistate outbreaks of human salmonellosis. Results from these investigations indicated that contact with small turtles or their environment were the likely source of these outbreaks.

Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) can be a source of human salmonellosis. Reptiles can carry Salmonella germs and still appear healthy and clean. Salmonella germs are shed in reptile feces and can easily contaminate their bodies and anything in areas where these animals live. Reptiles that live in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread to people. Turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches are a well-known source of human salmonellosis, especially among young children. Because of this risk, the FDA banned the sale and distribution of these turtles in 1975.

Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of these outbreaks. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA "fingerprinting" is performed on Salmonella bacteria isolated from ill people by using a technique called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE. PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. A total of 2 DNA fingerprints (outbreak strains) were included in these outbreak investigations.

Investigation of the Outbreaks
--------
A total of 51 people infected with the outbreak strains of were reported from 16 states between 22 Jan 2015 and 8 Sep 2015. In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals during the week before becoming ill; 20 (59 percent) of the 34 people interviewed who were ill with 1 of the outbreak strains reported contact with small turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat, before becoming ill. 16 (80 percent) of the 20 ill people who had contact with small turtles reported purchasing the turtle from a street vendor or receiving the turtle as a gift.

The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a U.S. public health surveillance system that tracks antibiotic resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is a partnership among the CDC, the FDA, the USDA, and state and local health departments.

The NARMS human surveillance program at CDC monitors antibiotic resistance in Salmonella and other bacteria isolated from clinical specimens submitted to NARMS by public health laboratories. CDC's NARMS laboratory conducted antimicrobial resistance testing on clinical isolates collected from 7 ill people infected with 1 of the outbreak strains; all 7 isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested on the NARMS panel.

Summaries of the 2 outbreak investigations are provided below.
---------------
Outbreak 1: _S._ Sandiego Investigation:

11 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Sandiego were reported from 6 states. The number of ill people identified in each state was as follows: California (4), Illinois (3), Mississippi (1), South Carolina (1), Texas (1), and Vermont (1).

Among people who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 22 Jan 2015 and 18 Aug 2015. Ill people ranged in age from younger than 1 year to 77 years, with a median age of 12. 73 percent of ill people were female. Among the 9 ill people with available information, 4 (44 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.

Outbreak 2: _S._ Poona Investigation:

40 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Poona were reported from 13 states. The number of ill people identified in each state was as follows: Arizona (1), California (15), Illinois (2), Kansas (1), Missouri (1), Nevada (1), New Jersey (2), New York (5), North Carolina (1), Ohio (1), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (3), and Texas (6).

Among the people who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 16 Apr 2015 and 8 Sep 2015. Ill people ranged in age from younger than 1 year to 82 years, with a median age of 4. 53 percent of ill people were male. Among the 25 ill people with available information, 11 (44 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.

[Both these serotypes have occurred in human outbreaks of salmonellosis associated with pet turtles. This epidemiological link continues to be a significant problem despite current laws. The size (less than 4 inches) relates to the fact that larger turtles are less likely to be handled by small children, not that larger ones do not harbor the bacterium.
