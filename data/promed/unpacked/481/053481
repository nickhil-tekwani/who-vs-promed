An epizootic in howler monkeys of the species _Alouatta caraya_ and
_Alouatta guariba_ in the provincial Pinalito Park is being
investigated. There have been 17 deaths, and the organs of one monkey
have tested positive for YF by immunofluorescence with monoclonal
antibodies [a very specific test. - Mod.JW] at the national reference
laboratory INEVH in Pergamino.

National and provincial authorities have organized a house-to-house
vaccination campaign in the risk area.

Another 8 monkeys have been found dead in a private reserve in Iguazu
[near the Iguassu Falls], and are being tested for YF.

Ministry of Health recommends vaccination against yellow fever in Misiones
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the appearance of monkeys killed by yellow fever (YF) in
Misiones, and the declaration by the Ministry of Health of Misiones
of a risk area in the north of the province, the National Ministry of
Health recommends, as an interim measure, preventive vaccination
against yellow fever for:

- People who live in the northern province of Misiones bordering
Paraguay and Brazil.
- Travelers, whether for vacation or work, entering the area, taking
into account that they must do so 10 days in advance, the time needed
to produce immunity.

In both circumstances, vaccination is needed from one year of age up
to 60, and optional for the group of 9-12 months and older than 60
years according to the risk of exposure. For those younger than 12
months an evaluation should be done by a doctor. Vaccination is free,
and valid for 10 years.

The Departments where vaccinations are recommended are: Guarani,
Monte Carlo, El Dorado, San Pedro, General Manuel Belgrano and Puerto
Iguazu [the Iguassu Falls].

A search continues for people with fever, but none have been found so
far. People who have flu-like symptoms (fever, muscle aches, fatigue)
should consult a doctor.

[A reliable source informs ProMED that the organs of the monkey from
Misiones tested positive for YF by PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
and virus isolation in C6/36 mosquito cells.

A critical situation is developing in South America with a shortage
of YF vaccine. Brazil routinely supplied stocks of the vaccine to
PAHO for distribution to other South American countries, but has now
stopped doing so, doubling production this year [2008] to a projected
30 million doses and reserving it all for domestic use. Paraguay has
asked PAHO for vaccine to cover its needs. Argentina apparently has
enough for its current risk area. Let us hope the risk areas do not
increase in size.

[The main concern with these sylvan (jungle) yellow fever outbreaks
is potential for spread to urban areas where competent mosquito
vectors (_Aedes aegypti_) are abundant. Tropical South America has
experienced severe dengue outbreaks last year (2007) and transmission
continues into 2008. This is convincing evidence that _Aedes
aegypti_, a competent vector for dengue as well as YF viruses, is
abundant in many urban areas. Introduction of YF virus into these
areas could be very serious if these urban populations have not been
immunized against YF. This report also again underscores the need for
people, including tourists, to be vaccinated against YF at least 10
days before entering these areas. As Mod.JW indicated in a previous
comment, so far we have dodged the bullet of urban YF. But how many
more bullets are headed our way? - Mod.TY]
