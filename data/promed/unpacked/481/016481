[Although the laboratory results from animals were inconclusive, human cases in that same area have been reported and confirmed. Based on the epidemiological comments, "the area has experienced rainfall above normal and increased mosquito population. Human cases have been reported in the region."

Simultaneously with the reporting of RVF in animals in Wajir (located in Kenya's former North Eastern Province, inhabited mainly by Somalis), the zoonotic virus has, according to the media, caused clinical disease in humans with 4 reported mortalities so far (20180609.5847216). Those should not surprise: an alert was issued by the Kenyan Government on 21 May 2018, "for a possible outbreak of the deadly Rift Valley fever in the wake of prolonged rainfall." The joint statement from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture identified 17 flood prone counties, among them Mombasa, Baringo, and Nairobi, to be at higher risk. According to the published alert, at that point in time no case of the zoonotic disease was yet identified in livestock or humans (see 20180531.5830703 and https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2001281213/state-issues-alert-on-rift-valley-fever-outbreak).

According to OIE's Terrestrial Manual, "Camels have been regularly involved in the RVF epidemics in East Africa, Egypt, and more recently Mauritania. Clinical disease is usually not seen in adult camels, but sudden deaths, abortion and some early post-natal deaths have been observed."

After the initial identification of RVF virus as the cause of a significant disease in humans and sheep, in Kenya (1931), the disease was considered, during more than 30 following years, to affect, among domestic animals, 3 species: sheep (most susceptible), cattle and (least susceptible) goats.

In 1963, camels were added to the list, when infection was reported in them for the 1st time, during an RVF event in north eastern Kenya in 1962 (ref 1). The report said: "Early in 1962 abortions in camels were reported. The camels were 6-8 months pregnant and there were no other signs of illness." Serological investigations in 60 sera samples from 2 affected locations, Wajir (the site of the current event) and Marsabit (30 camels sampled in each), revealed that 27 camels (45 per cent) had neutralising antibodies for RVF. The incidence in camels from Wajir was 43 per cent. and in those from Marsabit 47 per cent. The authors stated: "Virtually the whole of the 1962 crop of camel foals was lost, but whether the abortions were caused by RVF virus can never be known. Nevertheless, the similarities in the incidences in the various age groups suggest that a recent widespread epidemic had occurred in the Northern Frontier Province of Kenya and that the disease was not endemic."

Later, several events of RVF involving dromedary camels (East Africa, Mauritania) and alpacas (South Africa) confirmed clinical RVF in camelidae.

For a paper describing morbidity and mortality due to RVF in dromedary camels in Mauritania, with pictures presenting the observed clinical signs, see ref 2.

Outbreaks of RVF are closely associated with periods of heavy rains and prolonged flooding, as those driven by the warm phase of the El Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, increasing habitat suitability for vector populations. In East Africa, RVF epidemics take place periodically every 10-15 years; the last major outbreak occurred in 2006-2007. RVF is more likely to affect small ruminants and cattle.
