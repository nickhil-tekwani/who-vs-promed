Scientists are investigating an outbreak of over 100 cases of an unusual
type of salmonella. The cases -- a quarter of the number for the whole of
2001 -- have been seen across England over the last 10 days, but experts
believe there could be just one source. The type of Salmonella being
investigated is the relatively uncommon enteritidis phage type 14b (PT 14b)
[now formally referred to as_Salmonella enterica_ serotype enteritidis PT
14b - Mod.LL].
The Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) said 102 cases had been seen in
various parts of England and involved people of different ages. Two thirds
of the reported cases have been in London or the south, with 19 in the
north, 12 in the midlands and eastern region, and 1 in Wales. The remaining
11 cases were acquired overseas. In 2001, there were 10 755 cases of
Salmonella enteritidis, [just] 393 of which were PT 14b.
Linda Ward of the PHLS central public health laboratory, said: "We have been
doing detailed laboratory tests on these organisms, rather like
finger-printing a burglar. So far, the tests that we have done show that
the organisms infecting these different patients share the same properties.
Again, this further supports the idea that there may be a common source. We
are now carrying out more detailed genetic fingerprinting, which may help in
pinpointing the outbreak strain more precisely."
Dr Sarah O'Brien, of the PHLS communicable disease surveillance center,
said: "The fact that we have seen an increase in this one particular strain
of salmonellosis suggests that there may be a common source for some or all
of the cases. The PHLS is working with local health professionals to
investigate these recent cases to establish a cause or causes for infection
and to see whether there is any common source. In the meantime, people
should continue to take sensible food hygiene measures."

Outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis PT 14b in the United Kingdom
----------------------------------------------------------------
Since 26 Sep 2002, 68 confirmed cases of _Salmonella enteritidis_ PT 14b
(not known to be linked with foreign travel) have been reported to the
Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Center in
England (PHLS CDSC) by the PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP).
Of these the majority (45/68; 62 percent) were males. The age range of the
cases is less than 1 year to 93 years (median 32 yrs; mean 34 yrs). Where
dates of onset are available (n=18) the earliest onset was on 6 Sep 2002 and
the latest so far reported is 24 Sep 2002 (figure is available at the web
address). The majority of cases are from London and southeast England. There
is an outbreak in north Hampshire (south of England), which is being
investigated locally, in which. 4 of 9 cases have eaten food from a local
cafe and, in addition, 2 people from outside the local area who were on
holiday there have a link to the cafe. Trawling interviews are also being
conducted of cases not linked with north Hampshire in order to generate
hypotheses for the outbreak food vehicle.
The LEP reported on 393 human isolates of _S. enteritidis_ PT 14b in 2001.
Of these 40 percent were linked to foreign travel, particularly to Greece
(19 percent) and Mediterranean countries. The isolates of _S. enteritidis_
PT 14b associated with Greece and the Greek Islands are predominantly
anaerogenic whereas the remainder and the current outbreak strain in
England are aerogenic (1). The outbreak strain is fully sensitive to the
range of antimicrobials used by the LEP for epidemiological typing.
Molecular typing is currently being carried out.
In the first 6 months of 2002, Enter-net (the international surveillance
network for the enteric infections, Salmonella, and VTEC O157), recorded 122
cases of Salmonella Enteritidis phage type 14b, of which 56 were related to
travel. The Enter-net database covers the 15 EU Member States.

An urgent enquiry was sent out by Enter-net on 2 Oct 2002, and has already
received several responses. CDSC would be grateful to hear of any other
outbreaks of _Salmonella enteritidis_ phage type 14b.

[Additionally, Molbak, et al. (1) note that PT 14b is one of the phage types
of enterica serotype enteritidis that, at least in Denmark, is often
associated with, imported poultry products including broiler chickens. Of
note, they reported that 2/12 strains were fluoroquinolone resistant.
It is important to note that identical phage typing analysis does not
necessarily suggest identity. Fadl et al. (2) found that arbitrarily primed
PCR analysis found distinct amplified DNA patterns with isolates of
identical phage type, including 14b.
