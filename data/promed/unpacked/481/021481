Carrot crops may need closer monitoring, following the results of an
Horticultural Development Council (HDC) project.

The study concluded that internal browning did not appear to be
associated with _Parsnip yellow fleck virus_ (PYFV), a semi-persistent
virus carried by aphids and against which most current aphid control
measures in carrots are aimed. Instead, it found that internal
browning appeared to be associated with viruses from the carrot motley
dwarf complex (CMD), most commonly in combinations including _Carrot
mottle virus_ (CMoV).

Growers began to experience significant crop losses from the
condition. Crop advisers found that it was evident in regional virus
"hot spots" and appeared in addition to the textbook foliar symptoms
and root stunting. The project, therefore, aimed to determine the
extent of the problem and which viruses were associated with it.

Root crops consultant Howard Hinds said the finding was significant
because of the persistent nature of the CMD viruses. "Aphids carrying
them remain infectious throughout their lives. Aphid control
programmes will have to be modified to control both CMD and PYFV. The
period of vigilance will need to be extended, with more monitoring of
aphid activity. Aphid activity can pick up again in a warm September
and continue to the end of October, creating a late season CMD risk
period."

[Carrot motley dwarf disease (CMDD) is due to a mixed infection of
_Carrot red leaf virus_ (CtRLV, family _Luteoviridae_, not assigned to
a genus) with _Carrot mottle mimic virus_ (CMoMV, genus _Umbravirus_)
or Carrot mottle virus (CMoV; genus _Umbravirus_), and a satellite RNA
associated with CtRLV (CtRLVaRNA) may also be present. The disease can
affect carrot, parsley, dill and other species in the family
_Apiaceae_. It has been reported from Europe, Australia, New Zealand,
and a number of locations in the Americas and Asia. Until the findings
of the study above, CMDD symptoms were said to include leaf
discolouration (red or yellow) as well as stunting of shoots and
roots. Symptoms can vary with environmental factors; for example, in
warmer conditions, carrots may be symptomless. CMDD leads to loss of
plant vigour, which can cause substantial yield reductions.

The viruses are transmitted by the carrot-willow aphid (_Cavariella
aegopodii_) in a persistent manner (insects remain infectious for
life). CtRLV is transmitted independently, but vector transmission of
CMoMV, CMoV and the satellite are dependent on the presence of CtRLV
as a helper virus. Volunteer crop plants and apiaceous weeds may serve
as virus and/or vector reservoirs, and carrots left behind from the
previous crop often serve as a primary pathogen source. Disease
management may include cultural methods and phytosanitation to
minimise inoculum, as well as vector control. It is thought that due
to the tendency towards reduced use of insecticides in agriculture,
CMDD may become more frequent and important in the future.

_Parsnip yellow fleck virus_ (PYFV; genus _Sequivirus_) also causes
yellowing of leaves as well as internal necrosis and browning in
carrot roots. It is also transmitted by aphid vectors, but the virus
is lost during moulting.
