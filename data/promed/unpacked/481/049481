HUMAN ISOLATES OF SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM DT104 IN ONTARIO
Multidrug-resistant isolates of Salmonella typhimurium known as definitive
type 104 (DT104) have emerged as an important cause of salmonellosis in the
United Kingdom and the United States. The most common resistance phenotype
(R-type) among DT104 isolates is ACSSuT (resistance to ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline);
isolates with this R-type have been found not only among humans, but among
a wide range of mammals, poultry, cats, and dogs in the United Kingdom.
In Ontario, Canada, isolates of S. typhimurium represent 16% to 31% of all
human Salmonella isolates received at the Central Public Health Laboratory,
Toronto, for confirmation and identification of serotypes over a 4-year
period between 1993 and 1996. In response to concerns regarding the
epidemic spread of S. typhimurium DT104 R-type ACSSuT in the United Kingdom
and United States, a selected number of Ontario isolates of S. typhimurium
over a 3-month period, between 20 November 1996 and 21 January 1997, were
investigated for antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of phage
type DT104
One hundred and fifteen isolates were investigated for antimicrobial
susceptibility. Of these, 49 isolates (42.6%) were resistant to one or more
antimicrobial agents, and only one DT104 isolate was susceptible to all
antimicrobial agents tested
The vehicles of infection in the present study were not identified. Several
studies in the United Kingdom have indicated that multiple food vehicles
are involved in the transmission of this organism to humans: sources such
as raw milk, pork sausages, chicken, and meat paste. Although cattle are
the main reservoir of S. typhimurium infection, only a few reports have
shown direct transmission from cattle to humans. Further epidemiologic
studies are needed to determine the source of infection for humans in
Ontario, in order that control measures be implemented to reduce the risk
of contamination.
The present study also shows that the most common R-type is ACSSuT, as
reported by other investigations. Only one isolate showed resistance to
trimethoprim and cotrimoxazole; it is noteworthy that this isolate was from
the urine of a 2-year-old male child. None of the isolates examined in this
study was resistant to the newer fluoroquinolones, although one isolate
showed high level resistance (more than 100 mg/L) to the first generation
quinolone, nalidixic acid. This isolate was from a 71-year-old individual
who may have had previous exposure to the drug. Speculation is that the
emergence of trimethoprim and fluoroquinolone resistance among S.
typhimurium DT104 is the result of the use of these agents in the treatment
of infections in cattle.
It is interesting that, in this limited study, the majority of isolates
were from young children, in non-outbreak (sporadic) situations. One could
speculate that the reservoirs for DT104 among this group are probably
food-related, or perhaps related to direct association with infected pets.
The suspected animal source of an outbreak in the United States among
elementary school children was difficult to confirm, since neither the ill
kitten or turtle which the children had handled was available for testing
for S. typhimurium.
>From January to November 1997, 22.9% of all Salmonella isolates submitted
to the Central Public Health Laboratory were S. typhimurium, with a peak of
28.4% in September (A Borczyk, Laboratory Services Branch, Toronto:
personal communication, 1997). A more comprehensive study is being
conducted at the Central Public Health Laboratory in order to determine the
prevalence of S. typhimurium DT104 in Ontario.
