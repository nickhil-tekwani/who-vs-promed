The 2021-2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic season is the largest observed in Europe so far. The latest data from the joint EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), ECDC (European Centre for Disease. Prevention and Control), and EU reference laboratory report show a total of 2467 outbreaks in poultry, 48 million birds culled in the affected establishments, 187 detections in captive birds, and 3573 HPAI events in wild birds. Additionally, the geographical extent of the outbreak is unprecedented, ranging from Svalbard islands to South Portugal and east to Ukraine, affecting 37 European countries.
(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/avian-influenza-overview-september-2022

So far, avian influenza outbreaks in wild birds and poultry continue across Europe. New cases of HPAI have been reported in "wild birds and poultry in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, The Netherlands, Norway, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium. Due to Brexit implementation, The United Kingdom is not included in this update. See https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#latest-situation for further information."

A series of maps of the outbreaks of HPAI in Europe, from 19 Sep to 7 Nov 2022 are available at https://izsvenezie.com/documents/reference-laboratories/avian-influenza/europe-updates/HPAI/2022-1/maps.pdf. - Mod.CRD]
