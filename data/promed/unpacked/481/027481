Chronic wasting disease has been confirmed in wild deer from Woodbury, Winneshiek, Fayette, and Decatur counties this year [2020], bringing the total number of counties in Iowa where wild deer have tested positive to 8.

"We will schedule meetings in these areas in the next few months to discuss chronic wasting disease, our response, and the role hunters play in helping us to manage for this disease," said Tyler Harms, wildlife biologist with the Iowa DNR.

In the past, the DNR has set up a surveillance zone around where the positive deer was taken, then works with hunters to increase the number of samples collected within the zone to get a better idea of the extent to which the disease is on the ground.

"Early detection is key," Harms said. "We want to increase the surveillance in close proximity to the positive deer to hopefully catch any other positives in the area. In these surveillance zones, we want to manage our deer herd toward the lower end of our population goal to help slow disease transmission."

The Iowa DNR submitted nearly 7000 deer tissue samples for testing from hunter-harvested or road-killed deer collected statewide in the 2019-2020 season that resulted in 43 positive wild deer.

"While the number of positives this year [2020] jumps out, it's not out of the realm of what we would expect," Harms said.

The Iowa DNR contacted all hunters with a positive deer and offered the opportunity to come collect the deer meat, hide, and other animal parts or were provided other options for carcass disposal. The Centers for Disease Control advises against consuming animals that have tested positive for disease.

Hunters play an important role in preventing the spread of this disease by not using feed or salt-mineral licks that increase the concentration of deer, which can spread disease.

Hunters who harvest a deer in a county known to have chronic wasting disease but who live in a county where the disease has not been found should bone out their deer and either leave the carcass on the land where it was harvested or disposed of within that county. Contact the local landfill for requirements. Make absolutely sure not to transport and dump carcasses outside of the area where the deer were shot, as this will spread the disease to new areas.

The Iowa DNR samples deer from every county with increased sample quotas set in areas where the disease has been confirmed or where it has been confirmed across the border in neighboring states.

The Iowa DNR has been testing deer for chronic wasting disease since 2002. The 1st positive was in 2013 near Harpers Ferry in Allamakee County. To date, there have been 89 positive wild deer. More information is available online at <www.iowadnr.gov/cwd>.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate. The debilitating neurological disease that leads to death in deer and other cervid animals was found on a domestic deer farm in Avoca in the fall of 2018. The Quebec government recently reported that efforts to prevent the disease from spreading to the wild whitetail deer population have been successful. The measures taken by wildlife management authorities included the creation of an enhanced management area in the Laurentide and Outaouais regions where hunting regulations were relaxed in order to reduce the deer population.

However, it is impossible to completely remove CWD from the wild, if it is there.

The microscopic prions that contain [or cause] CWD can remain infectious for several years in the natural environment, according to the Quebec Ministere des Forets, de la Faune, et des Parcs (MFFP-Ministry of Forests, Wildlife, and Parks). A statement from press relations representative Catherine Ippersiel explained that the longevity of the CWD prion is unknown, but the prion for Scrapie, a similar disease that affects sheep, has been found to keep living for more than 16 years. Plants can absorb the CWD prion from soil contaminated from contact with infected deer or their feces, urine, or blood. The plants absorb the prion and can transfer the disease to other deer who eat the plants.

The MFFP does not consider any contamination of soil or plants in the natural environment outside the Avoca farm to be "significant." No positive samples from wild deer or other cervids in the region have been found, which in turn means that the possibility of the natural environment becoming present in the natural environment due to contact with wild deer is limited.

The incubation period for CWD is long. According to the MFFP, it usually takes 16-36 months [for] infected animals to show signs of having the disease, and testing has generally been ineffective at detecting CWD in animals infected for less than 12 months. In the region surrounding the Avoca farm, the MFFP will be continuing to maintain a low-density deer population, continuing enhanced surveillance to detect any emergence of CWD in the natural environment, and maintaining or improving measures to prevent new cases of the disease. For example, there are already regulations on moving or possessing certain parts of deer slaughtered near the affected farm.

Wildlife biologist Dr. Keith Munro confirmed assertions made by the MFFP and supported the measures it has taken. Munro works for the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH), which represents recreational hunters and fishers across the province.

"We don't actually know how long it lasts," Munro said in reference to the longevity of the CWD prions in the environment. There is no effective way of removing CWD from the wild landscape, he added.

Munro said the response by authorities in Quebec was important in order to prevent the cases of CWD in domestic deer from spreading to wild whitetail deer.

"If you have any cases, you have to respond really quickly," he said.

CWD was first detected in 1967, and there has never been a case in wild deer in Ontario. However, mule deer at the Metro Toronto Zoo died from an unspecified disease in the 1970s. Samples of tissue from those deer were re-tested many years later and found to be CWD.

Domestic deer farmers in Quebec are subject to all of the same animal welfare and accreditation regulations as other farmers are under provincial law. Municipalities can, however, regulate domestic deer farming using local zoning laws. In 2019, Grenville-Sur-La-Rouge effectively made deer farming impossible by limiting it to a very small portion of the municipality and requiring deer to be always inside a barn.

The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry created a new CWD program in December 2019, using input it received from the OFAH. It restricts the movement of live, domestic cervids in Ontario.

[Four new infected counties for Iowa certainly indicate a spread of this disease. And according to the 2nd article, it seems like those new counties will be infected for a long time. The prion apparently survives very well. Most of us knew that, but the paper from Canada confirms it. - Mod.TG
