There is an outbreak of a mysterious disease similar to malaria in
Rwampara [Mbarara district], particularly in Bushwere parish. On
Sunday [11 Apr 2010], my uncle rang me up and told me that most of
his family members were down with a mysterious disease. He also told
me that almost every home in Kisirira village was suffering from the
disease.

[It should not be a problem to diagnose malaria in Uganda. The fact
that an entire village was infected simultaneously suggests that it
is not malaria, but more likely an infection transmitted through food
or water. In a malaria endemic area adults would have clinical
immunity and clinical malaria cases would dominate in young infants
and children. ProMED-mail will be interested in further information.
