A big increase in syphilis cases in 2021 has prompted the Thunder Bay District Health Unit [TBDHU] to enhance its outreach to vulnerable populations. Referring to a more than 100% increase in infection rates since 2019, Kandace Belanger -- TBDHU Manager of Street Outreach, Harm Reduction and Sexual Health Programs -- calls the situation concerning.

Syphilis is an infection that can be spread through direct exposure to a syphilis sore during any sexual contact where protection is not used. It can be treated with antibiotics, but if left untreated can harm the brain, heart and other organs, or even lead to death. Women can also pass it on to their unborn children.

In the Thunder Bay district, the infection rate in 2021 rose to 42.7 per 100 000 population, compared with only 19.3 [per 100 000] in 2019. The rate was 14.7 per 100 000 in 2020, but Belanger said that's not considered reliable because of [COVID-19] pandemic restrictions that year and the challenges people encountered to access testing.

The Kenora-based Northwestern Health Unit recently reported an even higher syphilis infection rate -- 145.5 per 100 000. Both health units have rates far higher than the most recently reported Ontario average.

Belanger said TBDHU is trying to increase awareness in the community about the risks the infection poses, and the need for testing. "We've had some campaigns and education. We have outreach services that provide testing and education at the moment to some of our more vulnerable folks, and also through our clinical services," she said.

Injection drug use, being under-housed or homeless, and having multiple sexual partners may exacerbate the risk of getting syphilis.

Belanger cautioned that early diagnosis and treatment is a key for a disease that once carried the nickname "The Great Imitator." "One of the only ways to know if you have it is to test. I think maybe there's a misconception that 'I would know if I had an STI.' Often that's the case...there are different stages...[but] it's important for people to know they might be at risk if they've had unprotected sex." She added that syphilis cases are often picked up through testing of people who have no symptoms.

[The Canadian province of Ontario is divided into 2 geographic regions, Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario; Northwestern Ontario is a secondary region of Northern Ontario, which lies north and west of Lake Superior and west of Hudson Bay and James Bay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Ontario). Northwestern Ontario consists of 3 districts: Kenora, Rainy River and Thunder Bay.

Kenora District is the largest and western-most of the 3 districts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenora_District); the City of Kenora (pop., almost 15 000 residents in 2021), the Kenora District seat, is located in the southwest corner of Kenora District, close to the Manitoba border, about 210 km (130 miles) east of Winnipeg.

Thunder Bay District is located east of Kenora District; the city of Thunder Bay (pop., 108 843 in 2021), the Thunder Bay District seat, is located on Lake Superior and is the largest city in Northwestern Ontario (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_Bay). The city of Thunder Bay is 492 km (306 miles) east of the city of Kenora. A map showing the location of Kenora and Thunder Bay can be found at https://ontheworldmap.com/canada/province/ontario/large-detailed-map-of-northern-ontario.jpg.

The news report above notes recent increases in syphilis in the Kenora and Thunder Bay districts, but fails to characterize the patient population affected or factors contributing to this increase. In recent ProMED posts, illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, has been cited as a contributing factor to recent increases in syphilis cases in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. Recent reports from Canada also note an increase in syphilis in women and an increase in congenital syphilis. More information on this outbreak in the Kenora and Thunder Bay districts in Northwestern Ontario would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
