Almost 715 000 birds have died from bird flu in Russia since July
2005 or been culled in an effort to stem the spread of the virus,
Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry said Thursday [12 Jan 2006].
The 1st wave of avian flu swept through 6 Russian regions of the
Volga and Urals federal districts from 21 Jul to 29 Sep 2005. The 2nd
outbreak was registered on 14 Oct 2005 in 5 regions of the Central,
Volga, Urals and Siberian federal districts.
The ministry said it was currently controlling the situation in the
south of Russia to prevent the virus, also potentially deadly to
people, from spreading. Controls in other Russian regions have been
lifted following the end of the standard 21-day quarantine period,
the ministry added.
Russia's chief doctor said it would be incorrect to call human cases
of bird flu in Turkey an epidemic.
Gennady Onishchenko said at a business lunch hosted by popular
Russian daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta that it was impossible to calculate
the disease's epidemic threshold because the disease was not
transmitted from human to human. He said an epidemic was when the
infection rate exceeded the norm by 4 times, but questioned whether
15 cases of a previously unrecorded disease in Turkey could be called
an epidemic.
A senior official from the Russian Flu Research Center said Thursday
that Russia could begin large-scale production of a vaccine to
prevent bird flu by April 2006. Center director Oleg Kiselyov told a
news conference: "We need to complete our tests [on the vaccine] ...
I hope it will be in production in April [2006]." Kiselyov said that
he believed the world could potentially see a major, wide-scale
outbreak of bird flu within the next couple of years. Developing a
vaccine against such a pandemic strain of the virus would take about
9 months, he said.
The Russian Ministry of Agriculture has been coordinating the
production of 100 million doses of the vaccine for domestic fowl in
Siberia, and regions of the Urals Federal District, which are close
to stopover sites used by migrating birds, according to Federal
Consumer Rights and Welfare Service chief Gennady Onishchenko.
Vaccinations will begin in spring, when young birds appear, he added.
The speaker of the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament,
said the Russian government would allocate more than 1 billion rubles
(USD 35 million) in 2006 to vaccinations against bird flu.
Parliament's budget and tax committee would also discuss using
reserve funds to help control the spread of the virus, using measures
such as border controls, speaker Boris Gryzlov said.
Meanwhile, a dead pigeon discovered in western Georgia on Thursday
[12 Jan 2006] caused panic among local residents, according to local
television. Reports said the bird was found near the central market
in the town of Zugdidi, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of the
capital, Tbilisi. Witnesses said the pigeon was sitting on an
electricity transmission line and then suddenly plummeted to the
ground. "It must have been ill with bird flu," people who gathered
around the dead bird are reported to have said. Local veterinaries
examined the pigeon, and said it had not been infected with bird flu,
a television channel, Imedi, said.
