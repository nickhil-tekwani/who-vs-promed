ANTHRAX, BOVINE - ISRAEL: (HAZAFON)

On 30 Jun 2009 a cow, from a (beef) herd of some 50 animals grazing in
the Megiddo (also known as Armageddon) area, in the north of Israel,
was found dead with blood oozing from its natural orifices. The cow's
spleen was removed (contrary to recommendations) and taken to the
Kimron Veterinary Institute. The carcass was incinerated in a hole dug
for that purpose (about 2 meters deep) and which was then filled in.

Anthrax was diagnosed based on microscopy, culture and PCR
examinations of the spleen.

The area the herd grazed on was not known to be contaminated. It has
been used for several decades and the affected herd has been grazing
on it for the last 2 months.

The day after the diagnosis the herd was removed from the pasture and
vaccinated. One cow, showing mild symptoms of general malaise, with a
temperature of 39.9 C [103.8 F], was treated with antibiotics and
vaccinated thereafter. No additional cases of anthrax occurred.

The origin of the contamination is unknown. A small stream of water
flows through the area. However, since it originates a few kilometers
from the relevant area and no cases of anthrax have been known to
occur in the region, it is unlikely to be the source of the
microorganism. It is likely that a limited number of old 'hot spots'
exist and the affected cow had the misfortune to feed on one. The fact
that Israel is in a period of drought might have acted as a risk factor.

Anthrax in Israel, while very common till the middle of the last
century, has become a very rare occurrence there, sometimes with
intervals of several years during which no cases are diagnosed. In
fact, except for the present case, currently only one endemic area
exists, in the south of the country (see previous reports to ProMED)
[below].

[Our thanks to Daniel for this report.

In their formal 2nd July 2009 report to OIE:
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8240>
it was stated that this cow was the 2nd to die. The cause of death for
the cow "about a week before" was not determined. It happens. All too
often sporadic anthrax deaths are missed unless there are further
deaths triggering an investigation, and then the owner and his
veterinarian say, "We haven't seen anthrax in decades!" Well, no. You
missed it, or as Sherlock Holmes would say to Dr Watson, "You saw but
you did not observe."

Daniel is correct in remarking that drought can be a risk factor. It
stresses cattle so that the LD50 [50 per cent lethal dose] is much
reduced and pushes animals to graze in sunken areas with any residual
grazing and moisture. If these happen to be old [cattle] grave sites
and there has been a brief shower about a week to 10 days earlier,
they collect the rainwater, grass growth occurs, and the spores are
acquired when it is grazed. These sites are not common -- in fact they
can be increasingly rare -- but cows will find some and indicate their
presence by their deaths. It is a case where we have some numerators
but no denominators for this risk. The best (?) indicator of risk is
then the interval since the last outbreak in the area.

The ongoing risk is slight, though present, so one cannot recommend
annual vaccinatiuon in such areas. But what is needed is awareness of
the risk of anthrax in regard to sudden unexpected livestock deaths.
These can be quickly, readily, and cheaply checked by taking blood
swabs from the carcass and sending them to the nearest diagnostic
laboratory. Some countries subsidise positive anthrax diagnoses (e.g.,
Canada), which increases the probability of finding them. Don't
extract bovine spleens unless you are willing to risk cutaneous
anthrax and to undertake a very extensive site cleanup. A cotton swab
dipped in the blood and allow to dry (to kill off contaminants and to
encourage sporulation) is more than adequate.

Anthrax was once common in northern Israel. To find out where the
Yizreel valley in Megiddo is, go to the OIE site, or:

[This outbreak was duly reported to the OIE by the Israeli Veterinary
Services on 2 Jul 2009 (Immediate notification; reason for
notification - "Reoccurrence of a listed disease"; previous occurrence
- Nov 2007). The notification, with map, can be seen at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8240>.
