Owing to widespread destruction of passionfruit plants by a serious unknown disease in the Mao area [northern Manipur], Exotic Juice Ltd has stopped production of passion fruit juice for the past 2 seasons.

Commercial production of passionfruit juice started in 2004, and the product was sold locally but also exported to South Africa and Middle Eastern countries. Raw material was supplied also by farmers from other districts. Profits from the international market were huge.

Although scientists from ICAR [Indian Council of Agricultural Research] are trying to identify the cause of the disease, nothing has been ascertained up to now.

Exotic Juice is looking for investments for the introduction of scientific farming to the worried farmers.

[Commercial passionfruit (_Passiflora edulis_, _P. edulis_ var. _flavicarpa_ and hybrids) is a valuable crop in many tropical areas. A number of viral and fungal diseases are major constraints to productivity and quality of the crop, and resistance breeding programmes have been established by some countries. Some of the viruses are suspected to be seed borne, and, therefore, certified clean planting material is essential. It is not apparent from the report above which disease(s) may have caused the recent yield decline.
