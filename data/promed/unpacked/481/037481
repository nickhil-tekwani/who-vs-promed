On 4 Oct 2005, the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory
(FADDL) in Plum Island, NY, confirmed the 1st cases of vesicular
stomatitis, New Jersey (VS-NJ) in 3 cattle on premises in Scotts
Bluff County, Nebraska. VS-NJ virus was isolated out of samples from
3 affected adult beef cattle.
This is a cow/calf operation and approximately 50 percent of the cattle are
exhibiting clinical signs. This meets the requirement for identification of
the index case of vesicular stomatitis for a newly affected State. These are
the 1st confirmed cases of vesicular stomatitis in the State of Nebraska in
2005. Nebraska had no cases of vesicular stomatitis in 2004. A quarantine has
been placed on the affected premises by State regulatory officials.
Additionally, on 5 Oct 2005, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories
(NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the finding of vesicular stomatitis by virus
isolation from a horse at [different] premises in Scotts Bluff County,
Nebraska. A quarantine has been placed on the affected premises by State
regulatory officials. 5 other horses on the premises were not showing clinical
signs at the time of the foreign animal disease investigation.
Although the 2 premises are in the same county, Scotts Bluff, they are
approximately 24 miles apart.
Please forward this information to your Federal, State, and industry
counterparts as necessary. For additional information on vesicular
stomatitis please refer to the following APHIS Web page:

[There was VSV-NJ in the neighboring states of Wyoming & Colorado in August
2005 -- see refs. below. Here's a hypothesis: the Nebraska farmer recently
purchased an infected but asymptomatic horse in one of those states, took it
back home, then rode it to his neighbor's ranch where it shared a water trough
with the cattle. This seems more likely than that an infected horsefly flew
between the states! Information on the source would be welcome. - Mod.JW]
