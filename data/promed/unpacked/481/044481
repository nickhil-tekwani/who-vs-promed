Since the 1st case of yellow fever was reported in Ifelodun LGA in Kwara State, Nigeria in mid-September [2017], the outbreak has expanded to a number of states, according to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC).

A yellow fever (YF) outbreak is currently active in Nigeria with 3 states recording confirmed cases (Kwara, Kogi, and Zamfara). However, total of 7 states have reported suspected cases (Abia Borno, Kogi, Kwara, Kebbi, Plateau and Zamfara).

As at 7 Nov 2017, a total of 179 suspected YF cases have been reported. Of these, 98 (54.7 percent) suspected cases had their blood samples collected and sent to the laboratory for confirmation of YF.

Of the 98 samples collected, 38 (38.7 percent) had tested positive for yellow fever, with 1 (1.02 percent) inconclusive result in Nigerian laboratories.

As at 7 Nov 2017, 15 (38.6 percent) samples out of the 39 (positive and inconclusive) samples in Nigeria were confirmed positive by the Dakar Laboratory; 12 (30.7 percent) were negative, and 9 (30.7 percent) results are being awaited.

The total number of deaths (suspected, probable and confirmed) is 24, and 2 among them are confirmed.

Yellow fever is prevented by an extremely effective vaccine, which is safe and affordable. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease, and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. The vaccine provides effective immunity within 30 days for 99 percent of persons vaccinated.

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The "yellow" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients. Symptoms of yellow fever include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.
