Peruvian authorities are reporting that some 400 dolphin carcasses have washed ashore on Peruvian beaches during the month of January 2014. Many of the mammals have washed up dead onto the shores.

"You have to put the dolphin (dolphin carcass) in a better suited place because it may be contaminating. We are at the beach where women and children have access and we are exposed to the contamination," said one unidentified beachgoer as the carcass of one of the unlucky animals was being taken away earlier in the month [January 2014].

Scientists are conducting studies but have yet to say what is causing the alarming number of dolphin deaths off the Peruvian coast.
