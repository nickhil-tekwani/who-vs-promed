Center for Imported Diseases [NCID, Paris, France.

A) Incidence rate: During '96, NCID collected data from 83 civil health
structures oriented towards the diagnosis or the treatment of malaria, and
from 8 units of the Army Health Community Department, respectively. 2,244
cases of imported malaria were [reported, [of which 2,117 were taken into
account. 51.8 % of these cases were from the Region Ile-de-France (Paris
and surrounding [regions). In fact, the true [number of imported cases
has been estimated [to be about 5,000, a 40 % increase in comparison with
the previous year.
B) Case origins: 94 % of the [infections have been contracted in Africa,
56 % [in Western Africa, 29% in Central Africa, 13 % in Eastern Africa or
in the Indian Ocean area (Comores Archipelago, Madagascar), 3 % in India,
Asia or Western Pacific area, and 3 % in Latin America or the Caribbean.
Some tourist destinations that are in vogue from the 80s, namely Indonesia,
Thailand and Vietnam, yielded only 5, 2 and 1 cases, respectively.
C) _Plasmodium_ species: _Plasmodium falciparum_ was found in 85 % of the
cases, _P. vivax_ in 6.6 %, _P. ovale_ in 7.1 % and _P. malariae_ in 1.4 %.
Mixed infections occurred in 3.9 % of the patients. 75 % of the cases from
Asia or Middle East were due to _P. vivax_, [compared with 56% of those
from Americas or Caribbean areas endemic for malaria.
D) Risk evaluation: Every year, a large number of travelers (about 2,2
million) have left France for malaria endemic areas. The risk of acquiring
malaria during a travel across Western or Central Africa has been 600 per
100,000 travelers, and has been found lower for the other destinations
(from 100 to 310 per 100,000). Since [infection often has been the result
of a lacking, inappropriate or unsuccessful prophylaxis, the following
comments might be made: out of 864 replies, 75 % of the patients admitted
never they used physical or chemical anti-mosquito devices. Only 5.5 %
used both a physical barrier and an insecticide. Out of 1,912 persons who
gave an information on this point, about a half never used any
chemoprophylaxis. For about 66 % of the remaining, the prophylaxis had
been inappropriate or insufficient. Careful investigation of case records
from patients who had correctly taken their prophylaxis allowed [us to
ascertain true failures. Chloroquine was involved 9 times out of 10, and
possibly mefloquine for 5 cases.
E) Clinical data: the median elapsed time between the day of return from a
malaria-endemic area and the onset of clinical symptoms was 8 days, amongst
1,551 cases for whom this data was available. The median for _P.
falciparum_ cases was 6 days, 75 days for _P. vivax_, 115 days for _P.
ovale_, and 12 days for _P. malariae_. Death occurred in 3.39 _P.
falciparum_ cases per 1,000, and in 6.3 % of _P. falciparum_ malaria
patients showing major symptoms. A serious illness was encountered
amongst about 95 % of _P.falciparum_ malaria cases. As a result, about 20
patients died of imported malaria in France during 1996.
