On 22 Jun 2007, Germany reported the suspicion of avian influenza in swans
in Nurnberg [also called Nuremberg], Bayern [Bavaria] region (Mittelfranken
province) [1]. This was confirmed as HPAI (H5N1) on 25 Jun 2007 [2]. As of
early afternoon on 25 Jun 2007, 7 notifications of HPAI in wild birds
(swans and a goose) were reported by Germany in ADNS [EU's Animal Disease
Notification System; their weekly reports were last updated on 21 Jun 2007,
before the detection of the new German cases. See
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_wildbirds2007.pdf>. -
Mod.AS]
Situation assessment: in 2006, Germany reported a number of cases of H5N1
HPAI in wild birds in various locations in the country. The last case was
reported in April 2006. As a response to these new findings, Germany has
applied disease control measures following EU rules with established
protection and surveillance zones.
Intra Community trade in live poultry and poultry meat is subject to EU
animal health rules. TRACES* electronic database records the movement of
live poultry and poultry hatching eggs because they require veterinary
certification under EU rules. In general, data in TRACES depend on accurate
entry at the point of origin and expedience in validation. TRACES does not
record poultry meat and other poultry products intended for human
consumption because these do not require official veterinary certification
under EU rules.
*[TRACES is EU's Trade Control and Expert System; for background, refer to
<http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/487&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en>.
- Mod.AS]
TRACES electronic database indicated some 24 consignments of live poultry
and 2 consignments of other birds (birds of prey and other birds) that have
been imported from Germany since mid April 2007.
The 2 reported outbreaks of H5N1 in commercial poultry in the EU (Hungary
and the UK) in early 2007 appeared to be linked (see full epidemiological
report at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/pdf/epid_findings050407.pdf>.
The most recent case of H5N1 in the EU was reported in the Czech Republic;
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/monitoring/pdf/hpaih5n1czechrep210607.pdf>).
At this stage, it remains unknown how closely the viruses from Germany and
the Czech Republic may be related, and further tests are under way.
Our risk assessments
(<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/monitoring/pdf/hpaidevelopments110507.pdf>;
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/monitoring/pdf/hpaieurope300606.pdf>)
have also considered a possibility that the virus may have been introduced
in wild bird populations in a number of discrete pockets and maintained at
a very low level but remain unnoticed. On that basis, we have concluded
that sporadic outbreaks of H5N1 (or any other type of H5 or H7 HPAI) may
continue to occur within a wider region worldwide, including Europe (and
the UK), leading to sporadic outbreaks in the summer of 2007 when birds
congregate for moulting. Moulting waterfowl are unlikely to move longer
distances.
Outbreak assessment: while dead swans may be an indicator species because
they are easier to detect, this detection again highlights the importance
of surveillance for dead birds and how essential it is to continue to
maintain high biosecurity standards with regard to domestic poultry.
Conclusion: on the basis of this report and the previous risk assessments,
we consider that recent epidemiological developments, both in Europe and
worldwide, do not significantly alter our previous overall conclusion that
there is an increased but still low likelihood that the virus may be
introduced from the currently affected areas to the UK.
Should H5N1 virus, or any other type of H5 or H7 HPAI, be detected in wild
birds in the affected area, it is unlikely that it may be introduced to the
UK by direct movements at this time of the year. However, this risk will be
reviewed should the virus be detected in wild birds in areas within the
major migratory flyway that may involve direct movements to the UK in the
near future.
Based on the disease report and situation assessment, the likelihood of the
introduction of the virus from Germany to the UK via legal importation of
live poultry is considered negligible at this stage. However, this
likelihood may be reviewed should any consignments be identified by the
German authorities to have originated from the currently affected area. At
this stage, the likelihood of the introduction of the virus via legal trade
in poultry meat from the area currently under restriction cannot be
determined. In any case, EU rules require an affected member state to
inform other EU MS of any relevant consignment that may have originated
from the area that is currently placed under restrictions. Nevertheless, it
is important to continue to maintain and implement appropriate biosecurity
measures.
On the basis of this outbreak and previous experiences, further
developments may be likely, and we continue to monitor and review the
situation.

Six dead wild birds have tested positive in Germany for a lethal strain of
bird flu, but authorities said on Monday [25 Jun 2007] they did not expect
the disease to spread outside the southern region where it was discovered
over the weekend.
On Sunday [24 Jun 2007], 3 wild birds found dead in Nuremberg in the
southern state of Bavaria tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of the
disease. The number of cases has since risen to 6, with 5 swans and one
goose infected, the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, a veterinary institution,
said.
Authorities continued to investigate the outbreak, the 1st in Germany this
year [2007], which was discovered as part of a national testing program for
dead birds.
Investigations were focusing on how the disease entered Germany. It was
possible it spread from the Czech Republic, where an outbreak was reported
recently, the spokeswoman said. "But this is only conjecture," she said.
Poultry farmers in the Nuremberg region have been ordered to confine all
poultry to closed stalls. As of Saturday [23 Jun 2007], a 21-day ban was
imposed on moving poultry or poultry products in or out of the area, which
is now a quarantine zone.
City officials also warned cat and dog owners not to allow their pets to
roam freely in the quarantine zone.
Last year [2006], some 13 European Union member states had confirmed cases
of bird flu: Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Greece, Britain, the Czech
Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, France, and Hungary.
Bird flu has been spreading across southeast Asia, killing 2 people in Viet
Nam this month [June 2007], the 1st deaths there since 2005. Globally, the
H5N1 virus has killed nearly 200 people out of over 300 known cases,
according to the World Health Organization [WHO]. None of the victims were
from Europe.
