[Livestock anthrax tends to be under-reported in Tajikistan. Though the human incidence appears to be decreasing, it is not uncommon for the reasons we see exemplified in this report and for inadequate availability of veterinary services in many of these isolated villages. Recent human incidence is: 2000 (338), 2001 (157), 2002 (163), 2003 (126), 2004 (113), 2005 (50), 2006 (33), 2007 (45), 2008 (45), 2009 (25), and 2010 (15).
