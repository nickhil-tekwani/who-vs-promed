Homemade savory jelly caused an outbreak of foodborne botulism in Denmark last month [June 2018], according to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI). The agency, which is under the Danish Ministry of Health, said 9 people became ill after eating dinner at a private party in Sonderborg. Danish authorities previously said a sample from the homemade dish was positive with botulinum toxin type A. The same type was identified in the patients.

Experts from Fodevarestyrelsen (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration), SSI, and DTU Food - The National Food Institute found the outbreak was limited to those who ate dinner together. Foodborne botulism is extremely rare in Denmark. From1985 to 2017, SSI registered only 6 cases. Homemade canned, preserved, or fermented foods are often found to be the causes of foodborne botulism. Commercially processed food is another common cause.

Steen Ethelberg from SSI told Food Safety News that 7 of the patients were lab-confirmed and developed varying degrees of symptoms in the following days. All were hospitalized, and most have now recovered.

Authorities confirmed botulinum toxin type A in a mouse assay after collecting and combining leftover food from the party and a glass that it was prepared in. However, they could not explain exactly how the savory jelly became contaminated or what ingredient was to blame.

_Clostridium botulinum_ is a bacterium that produces botulinum toxin. The toxin blocks nerve functions and can lead to respiratory and muscular paralysis. Symptoms are caused by the toxin that's produced by the bacterium and usually appear within 12-36 hours -- with a range of 4 hours to 8 days -- after exposure.

[The paralytic intoxication botulism, or sausage poisoning, as it was originally termed, is caused by one of the neurotoxins produced by (primarily) _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria in foods not properly prepared. It was 1st seriously studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany, in 1793. The outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this outbreak, the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly increased, prompting a study of the disease by local health officer Justinius Kerner (1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were attributed to the consumption of sausage. The illness became known as "botulism" after "botulus," the Latin word for sausage. - Mod.LL
