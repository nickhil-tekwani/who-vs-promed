A veritable zoo of nasty new viruses is circulating in Europe and could
kill people without even being detected, the New Scientist online
(<http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg19025503.300.html> reported
on Saturday [6 May 2006, abbreviated from an article in the New Scientist
print edition of 4 May 2006 - Mod.CP].
Tahyna virus, which can cause encephalitis in humans like West Nile virus,
is common across Europe in mosquitoes, rabbits, and birds, the magazine
quoted Professor Ernie Gould of the University of Oxford as saying. Gould
is engaged in a study commissioned by the British government on the risk of
insectborne and other arthropodborne viruses emerging in Britain. According
to Gould, such diseases may already be infecting and killing people. About
50 Britons die every year from viral encephalitis, yet fewer than 40 per
cent of these deaths are ever pinned on a specific pathogen. The figures
are similar in other developed countries.
"Wildlife is a huge reservoir of potential pathogens, but at the moment we
do very little in the way of surveillance," the report quoted Joe Brownlie
of the Royal Veterinary College, London, as saying. Brownlie stressed the
need to test more animals and birds.
"No one knows what major diseases may arise, but improved detection,
identification and monitoring will be critical in catching them earlier
than we do now," the British chief scientific adviser David King said.

[Tahyna virus is a mosquito-transmitted member of the family
_Bunyaviridae_, which is currently classified in the genus
_Orthobunyavirus_, as one of 15 members of the _California encephalitis
virus_ species. The California encephalitis viruses are serologically
related tripartite genome negative strand RNA viruses that can exchange
genome subunits by genetic reassortment. They are present mainly in South
and North America, whereas Tahyna virus is present in Europe (and a close
relative -- Lumbo virus -- is in Africa). Tahyna virus has the potential to
become a human pathogen in Europe, and increased surveillance would be
appropriate. - Mod.CP]
