A senior health official warned Saturday that geese, ducks and other birds
may have to be slaughtered if the recent mass killing of chickens fails to
wipe out the so-called "bird flu." Another person -- a 19-year-old woman --
was found to have bird flu, the government said, raising the number of
confirmed cases to 16. Four people have died. The woman was hospitalized in
critical condition.
Dr. Margaret Chan, director of health, said the killing of Hong Kong's 1.3
million chickens was the first step in wiping out the H5N1 virus that has
killed four people. Officials may have to look beyond chickens and see if
the virus exists in geese, ducks and the "non-chicken population," she said.
On Friday, officials admitted they did a sloppy job in the mass gassing of
the chickens. Bedraggled birds somehow survived the slaughter, and dogs
were seen scampering off with carcasses. Scientists will test rats, cats
and dogs to see whether animals picked up the virus from chewing on chicken
carcasses intended for burial. Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa has said
shortages of staff and equipment hindered the government's effort this week
to stop the mysterious spread of the flu, which typically strikes poultry,
to humans.
