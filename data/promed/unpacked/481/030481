Foot and mouth disease in Tirah
-------------------------------
1. An outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) was suspected yesterday, Wed 15 Jan 2014, in a dual-purpose (dairy/mutton) sheep holding situated on the outskirts of the township of Tirah, in central [Hamerkaz] Israel.

2. The flock includes about 200 sheep, of which about 100 adult ewes and 100 lambs, as well as a few goats. It is a closed unit, no outdoor grazing exercised. The ewes had been officially ear tagged and vaccinated against FMD.

3. Clinical examinations revealed, in the ewes, lameness, typical FMD lesions (interdigital, lingual, and buccal), as well as the death of 3 lambs (3-5 days old).

4. From samples submitted to the FMD laboratory, Virology department, Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan, FMD virus isolated; serotyping pending.

5. A zone of 10 km [6.2 mi] radius around Tirah has been declared infected, with consequent quarantine measures applied.

[Tirah (syn Et Tira, Tira) is situated in Israel's Central district ("Mehoz HaMerkaz"), adjacent to the separation ("Green") line between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (West Bank). See map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/02/Et_Tira.html.

It may be assumed that this outbreak has been caused by the similar virus reported earlier this week, in Iksal, Nortern district ("Mehoz HaZafon"; see ProMED-mail post 20140114.2170228), namely serotype O. An official OIE notification with serotyping results is anticipated, as well as the genotype involved.

The appearance of distinct clinical cases in adult, apparently vaccinated animals, raises questions about the efficacy of the vaccine with which they reportedly have been vaccinated or its adequacy against the field strain currently circulating. Alternatively, there might have been a protracted time lapse since their last vaccination. Date(s) of previous vaccination(s) would be helpful. - Mod.AS
