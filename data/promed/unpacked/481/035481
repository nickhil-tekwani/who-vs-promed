Vaccinating cattle in the Province of Buenos Aires against anthrax
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Province of Buenos Aires is the main beef cattle rearing province in Argentina. By Resolution No. 115, the minister of agriculture, Lic. Alejando Rodriguez, has established obligatory vaccination against anthrax (6703 Act) for its more than 16 million cattle in the Assessment Area.

Evaluation of this zoonosis in 30 counties over the period 1977-2013, and 450 outbreaks of bovine anthrax, 11 per cent of a total of 3964 samples submitted from acute animal death tested positive. During 2013 and into 2014, 39 outbreaks have been identified in cattle. Last year [2013], 7 human cases of cutaneous anthrax were reported in this province.

The soil samples, which are very important, show ideal conditions favoring the maintenance of the pathogen's spores, thus the pastures are called "Campos Malditos" ["accursed pastures"]. In a recent interview with a journalist from the Diario El Tiempo de la ciudad de Azul, the expert, Dr Ramon Noseda, said: "Having anthrax in any territory is an indicator of its decline in health, demonstrates the neglect and lack of interest of the state to act effectively. The Resolution No. 115 of the Province of Buenos Aires will try to reverse too many years of lack of state control. The public health (authorities) encourage this public health measure."

[Ramon and his colleagues have been fighting anthrax in Buenos Aires province for many years, and had established a control and surveillance area for the worse affected counties (partidos). But outbreaks continued usually in herds which had not been vaccinated that spring. This compulsory vaccination should help and will certainly make it easier to identify and target specific problems and places. We wish them luck. - Mod.MHJ
