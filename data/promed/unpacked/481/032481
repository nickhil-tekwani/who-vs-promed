Subject: Update on Waco house finches

The message below is being forwarded in response to queries on the
mycoplasma suspected in house finches in Texas. While the pathogen continues
to be called _Mycoplasma conjunctivitis_, I continue to think it is _M.
gallisepticum_ which was first reported on ProMED-mail, 4 Apr 1995, as
present in finches in 21 US states and Canada. As more information becomes
available, ProMED-AHEAD will post it on the network; similarly, if any one
of you gains more insight into the situation, please sent a report to
<promed@usa.healthnet.org>. Thank you.

Subject: Update on Waco house finches
I talked to Nada Wareham, our local wildlife rehabber tonight, to determine
the status of our diseased house finches. She is picking up nets in the
morning and plans to swab samples from the finches Friday morning (unless we
are still under tornado watch). While I had originally understood she was
working with CDC, she is in fact working with Page Latrell at NWHC lab in
Madison. I had earlier provided her information on the lab from previous
visits to your website. She expects to send the cultures on Saturday so they
will be at the Madison lab on Monday.
The woman who first reported the problem at her Speegleville (a suburb of
Waco, Texas) feeder has described symptoms that fit to a t Mycoplasma
Conjunctivitis. Nada, who has previously worked with birds suffering from
Avian Pox, is very familiar with its traits. Based on her conversations with
this woman, Nada also believes the woman is describing MC.
The situation began several weeks ago. The woman reports that there were
about ten finches coming to her feeder and only several exhibited swelling
and crusting around their watery eyes. She noted they would wipe their eyes
all the time on the feeder. She is now down to just three or four finches
and Nada said she believes that all are exhibiting some of the MC symptoms.
In addition, one American Goldfinch is exhibiting signs of conjuctivitis.
