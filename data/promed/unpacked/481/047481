South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape health departments were
confident that they have the Zimbabwe cholera spillover under control
in their regions, but Gauteng hospitals are still seeing new cases.

Gauteng had confirmed cholera in 16 of the 46 people who presented
the symptoms of the curable intestinal infection since November 2008.
Only 2 people who sought treatment were South African, and the
[majority] came from Zimbabwe, said Dr Chika Esomugha, medical
advisor to the Gauteng department of health in a statement.

[Gauteng, formerly known as Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV),
is the smallest province in South Africa, with only 1.4 percent of
the land area, but it is highly urbanized. It lies below Limpopo
(formerly Northern Province). From the posting, it appears that most
of the cases may have come from Zimbabwe but local transmission could
have occurred.

[2] Cholera - Malawi (Southern Region)

Barely a day after Balaka district reported the 1st death of a man
suffering from cholera, the government has admitted the disease is
fast spreading and 4 people have so far died in Lilongwe alone.

However, the government says it has put in place all procedures to
control the cholera outbreak, which is slowly sweeping across Malawi.

In Zimbabwe, the outbreak has claimed 746 lives with over 14 000 new
cases being reported. The disease has also been traced in Zambia and
South Africa.

Though minister of health, Khumbo Kachali, said yesterday [11 Dec
2008] there were no confirmed cases of cholera in government
hospitals, his director of Preventive Health Services in the Ministry
of Health, Dr Stone Kabuluzi, confirmed of 36 cholera at Likuni
Mission Hospital in Lilongwe out of which 4 people have lost their lives.

"Reports from the hospital indicate that 2 patients died right at the
hospital because they came a bit late while 2 others are also
suspected to have died at their homes from cholera," he said.

Dr Kabuluzi however said his ministry has instituted necessary
measures to contain the disease not to further spread to other parts
of the country. He said cholera quarantine shelters were also present
in all district health centers.

Apart from Lilongwe and Balaka other cases of cholera, an infectious
disease characterized by serious vomiting and diarrhea, have been
reported in Mwanza, Chikwawa, and Mangochi.

[The Southern Region of Malawi where all the cases are reported from
lies just east of the Tete province of Mozambique, where cholera is
also active.

[3] Cholera - Congo (Pool, Bouenza)

The lack of clean drinking water and proper hygiene fueled the spread
of cholera in the south and southwest of the Republic of Congo, says
the Congolese Red Cross, which has just completed a campaign to teach
people how to recognize and stem the spread of the disease.

It said the cholera outbreak began in the Bouenza region in February
2008 and that by the end of November 2008 127 cases of the disease
and 3 deaths had been registered. At least 22 other cases have been
reported in the Kinkassa area and in the Pool region, which surrounds
the capital, Brazzaville.

"In Kinkassa, the patients are under observation. In Bouenza, the
disease has been halted and the number of deaths limited thanks to
the rapid intervention of the authorities, NGOs, and other
organizations such as UNICEF [UN Children's Fund]," said Yvette
Mbazo'o Mve of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies.

She said the lack of hygiene and clean drinking water explained the
rise of cholera, which is sometimes called the "dirty-hands disease."
In Congo, only 14 percent of people have access to clean drinking
water in rural areas, while in the towns and cities this rises to
nearly 60 percent.
