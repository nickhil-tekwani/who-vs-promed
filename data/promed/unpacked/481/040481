Poison victim believes it was accident
---------------------------------------
One of the 2 Los Angeles women who were poisoned with thallium while
in Moscow told federal and county health investigators that she
believes the poisoning was an accident, a lawyer representing the
women said Friday [9 Mar 2007].
Yana Kovalevsky, 26, also told investigators that the only place she
and her mother, Marina, met on a regular basis during their stay in
Moscow was the Marriott Hotel near Red Square. Yana said the 2 had
breakfast there nearly everyday, though she was not certain that was
where the poisoning occurred, said Frank Capwell, the Kovalevskys'
lawyer.
Officials with the FBI and the Los Angeles County Department of
Public Health interviewed Yana on Thursday [8 Mar 2007] at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where the 2 were listed
in stable condition. Investigators did not interview Marina because
she was asleep at the time, Capwell said.
Capwell said the Kovalevskys had no plans to file a lawsuit, though
they might explore that possibility in the future.
"We're concentrating on their recovery before we even approach
whether a civil remedy will be sought," he said.
The hospital has set no release date for the Kovalevskys. Capwell
said doctors expect them to make a full recovery in about a month.
Also Friday [9 Mar 2007], doctors at Cedars-Sinai confirmed that the
Kovalevskys were poisoned with thallium, a toxic metal used as a
catalyst in certain metal alloys, optical lenses, jewelry and
semiconductors, as well as in dyes and pigments.
Thallium compounds are also found in rat poison and insecticides.
Experts say thallium can cause gastrointestinal irritation,
paralysis, loss of vision, and heart and liver problems. Saddam
Hussein, the late Iraqi dictator, was known to use thallium against
his enemies.
Friends and relatives have been at a loss to explain why Yana and
Marina, a well-known physician in Los Angeles' Russian community,
would have been poisoned. They say the 2 are not involved in politics
and had previously traveled to Moscow without incident.
Leon Peck, Marina's brother, who flew to Moscow late last week to
bring the 2 home, said he believed the "only sane and logical
explanation" was that the women had been mistakenly targeted in an
intentional poisoning, especially because it is so difficult to
acquire thallium.
"My feeling is that it was an accident in that they were mistaken for
someone else," he said. "You cannot get thallium anywhere. My feeling
is that it is impossible to find it."
Peck said the Kovalevskys "couldn't be targets for anything. Who
would like to kill them?"
The FBI has opened a criminal investigation into the Kovalevsky case
in conjunction with Moscow police and the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Health.
The Kovalevskys traveled to Moscow in mid-February 2007 to attend the
50th birthday party of one of Marina's friends.
About a week into their trip, the 2 began to experience headaches,
stomachaches, nausea, diarrhea, shortness of breath and excruciating
pain, friends and relatives said. They were admitted to a poison
treatment institute in Moscow, where doctors concluded they had
ingested thallium.
Capwell said Yana found the conditions at the institute to be
"deplorable." Yana told investigators the doctors did not have the
proper medications and did not use anesthesia during procedures.
Peck, a Beverly Hills oral surgeon, purchased about USD 2000 worth of
Prussian Blue, an antidote to thallium poisoning, from a Santa Ana
pharmacist and flew to Moscow late last week to administer it himself.
Peck and the Kovalevskys arrived at Los Angeles International Airport
on Wednesday [7 Mar 2007] afternoon, and ambulances took the mother
and daughter to the critical-care unit at Cedars-Sinai.
