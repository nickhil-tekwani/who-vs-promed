NT [Northern Territory] Health is urging Territorians and visitors to take steps to protect themselves from Japanese encephalitis (JE) after an increased number of feral pigs have tested positive for the disease in the Top End in recent days.

Medical Entomology Unit director Nina Kurucz warned that JE is a serious disease carried by mosquitoes capable of infecting humans and animals.

"The highest risk period for being bitten by an infected mosquito is after sundown within 5 kilometres [3.1 mi] of wetlands where feral pigs and water birds potentially infected with JE are present," Ms Kurucz said.

She said that 44 feral pigs infected with JE have been recorded in Victoria Daly, Litchfield, Marrakai-Douglas Daly, and Cox-Daly region and the Tiwi Islands since March this year [2022].

"The best way to prevent JE and other mosquito-borne viruses is to avoid getting bitten," Ms Kurucz said. "It is recommended people wear protective light-coloured clothing with long sleeves, long trousers, and socks in areas where mosquito bites are likely. People should also use a protective repellent containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalypt."

The Northern Territory Government and the Australian Government's Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS) have partnered to undertake ongoing JE surveillance activity across the region. The Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade (DITT) is also helping the NT Health's monitoring program by surveilling the domestic animal population for signs of JE.

NT Health said it is important to take steps to avoid mosquito bites since there is no specific treatment for JE. A vaccine, however, is available.

While potentially fatal, JE is not transmittable from person to person or from eating infected pork meat.

"Most people with JE will be asymptomatic but, on rare occasions, it can result in severe disease and even death. Symptoms can include fever, headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, confusion, seizures, and paralysis. People who believe they may be infected with the JE virus should seek urgent medical assistance," Ms Kurucz said.

Territorians can avoid mosquito bites in likely areas by:
- Wearing protective light-coloured clothing with long sleeves, long trousers, and socks;
- Avoiding outdoor exposure near wetlands and flooded areas, especially after sundown;
- Using a protective repellent containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalypt (PMD) and other mosquito protection devices;
- Ensuring infants and children are adequately protected against mosquito bites;
- Considering insecticide barrier treatments by pest control companies for use around residential grounds;
- Ensuring windows and doors have screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering houses.

"JE is a notifiable disease, so animal owners, vets, hunters, landholders, and the public should report suspicious or unusual signs in animals to the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888," NT Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Sue Fitzpatrick said.

Dr Fitzpatrick said DITT is working with property owners with feral pigs infected on or near their properties by providing free testing for registered pigs.

"We're ... urging people to report unexplained pig miscarriages, stillbirths, or neurological signs in young piglets. Horse owners are also asked to report any cases of neurological signs in horses so that we can test for JE," she said.

[It is not clear if the 44 pigs were found positive by antibody test, PCR identification of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) RNA sequences, or virus isolation. If they were IgM positive, that would indicate recent infection as would paired acute-convalescent samples, although paired sample from individual wild pigs is unlikely. Single positive IgG samples would indicate infection sometime in the past, assuming that there were no cross-reactions with other flaviviruses. If prospective studies indicate new JEV infections in wild pigs, that would raise the question about long-term maintenance of JE virus in the Northern Territory. Should that be the case, there is the possibility of the virus moving southward in the future into the 4 states (Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria) where it has been circulating currently in times of vector abundance.

The open question now is if JEV will become established in any or all of the 4 affected states irrespective of what is going on in the Northern Territory. Ongoing surveillance of piggeries and mosquitoes should provide evidence of the continuing presence of the virus in the 4 states. Providing adequate surveillance over the very large geographic 4-state area of the outbreak will be a challenge for surveillance efforts. One hopes that the virus will disappear in the affected area and transmission will cease permanently. We shall see if it does. - Mod.TY
