Bulawayo City Council has issued a rabies alert after 4 rabies cases have been recorded in the city.

In the latest council report, the local authority said people should be on high alert.

"A total of 12 dog notices were issued for various violations of the Bulawayo (Dog Control and Licensing) bylaws.

"The department was on high alert of rabid dogs as 4 cases of rabid dogs were reported in the city," read the report.

Dog owners are encouraged to ensure that their dogs are vaccinated against rabies. The Centre of Disease Control (CDC) says that rabies is deadly and can be transmitted after an individual is bitten by an infected animal.

In Zimbabwe, rabies is one of the top 5 priority diseases and it is notifiable. It is estimated that rabies causes 410 human deaths per year in the country (ref 1).

Bulawayo is situated in Zimbabwe's Matabeleland; map at https://tinyurl.com/3s2uff9z. The city's population counted 653 337 in 2012; estimated as over 1 million recently.

[3] South Africa (Kwazulu-Natal & Eastern Cape): dog-mediated human cases

A total of 7 cases of human rabies have been laboratory-confirmed in South Africa since [23 Aug 2021]. The cases are from Limpopo (3), KwaZulu-Natal [KZN] (2) and the Eastern Cape (2).

Three probable cases of human rabies were identified in KZN. That was according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in its August Communicable Diseases Communiqu√©.

One of the 3 cases of probable rabies was reported in a 40-year-old man from Empangeni, King Cetshwayo District, in KZN. He sustained an unprovoked attack by a stray dog in mid-June [2021], suffering multiple bites to his face, left forearm, and palms of his hands. The next day, he received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) at a local hospital, which included wound washing, rabies immunoglobulin (RIG), and rabies and tetanus vaccinations.

Five weeks later, he developed fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, agitation, restlessness, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, hypothermia, sweating, hyper-salivation, symptoms in keeping with rabies disease.

He later died in hospital on 25 Jul 2021, several days after his illness began. The NICD said a single saliva sample collected before death tested negative for rabies, which is insufficient to exclude the diagnosis of rabies. No further samples were available for laboratory investigation.

The NICD said the most recent case was that of a 5-year-old girl from East London, Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality in the Eastern Cape. The child was attacked by a dog on [9 Jul 2021], sustaining facial wounds, and was purportedly given PEP but was then lost to follow-up. It is unclear whether the PEP included RIG.

She experienced fever, muscle spasms, anorexia, confusion, sleeplessness, and hyper-salivation 2 weeks later and died on [28 Jul 2021] in hospital. On [2 Aug 2021], rabies was confirmed in a brain sample from the deceased child using a direct Immunofluorescence assay test.

World Rabies Day is celebrated on 28 Sep every year to bring attention to the prevention and control of rabies around the world.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for his submission.

In South Africa, the control of rabies is difficult because of its endemic presence in domestic dogs, the most important species in the transmission of this zoonosis. Several wildlife species are involved as well. Dog rabies is endemic, especially in the densely populated rural areas of Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa, and has persisted in KZN despite concerted efforts to control it by parenteral vaccination campaigns. Failure of vaccination campaigns is thought to be due to the high density of dogs, especially in urban townships, and the high population turnover, with most dogs being younger than 3 years of age (ref 1).

[4] South Africa (Kwazulu-Natal): dog, dumb-form rabies, pet vaccination
Date: Fri 27 Aug 2021

https://southcoastherald.co.za/443707/sudden-outbreak-of-rabies-a-serious-concern/


The Lower South Coast SPCA urges all pet owners to get their pets vaccinated against rabies. This comes after 2 dogs were confirmed to have tested positive for rabies in the last week [w/e 22 Aug 2021].

Rabies is a deadly virus that can spread to people from the saliva of infected animals. There is no specific treatment for rabies. Once symptoms appear, it's nearly always fatal. However, a vaccine can prevent infection.

Carla Steenkamp, vice chairman of the LSC SPCA said 2 of the dogs were found in Ramsgate and Marburg. The 3rd, which is suspected of rabies was collected in Gcilima.

"Two of the dogs suffered from the 'dumb form' of rabies which means the dogs act depressed, become insensitive to pain, and develop paralysis of the throat and jaw muscles," she explained. She also said the animal may look like they are choking or have something stuck in their throat as they salivate and drool.

Pets with dumb rabies usually fall into a coma and die within 3 to 10 days of infection.

"We are pleading with pet owners to get their dogs vaccinated. We don't know why the sudden outbreak but it's very scary that we have rabies in our urban areas," she added.

[5] Morocco (Marrakech-Safi): human, dog mediated
Date: Wed 25 Aug 2021

https://ar.lesiteinfo.com/maroc/557818.html


A young man died on [Tue 24 Aug 2021] at the Mohammed VI Regional Hospital in Chichaoua [Marrakech-Safi] from a rabid dog bite.

A SiteInfo source stated that the man was transferred a few days ago to the regional hospital in a critical condition, after being bitten by a rabid dog in the rural commune Ait Haddou Youssef, before he breathed his last on [Tue 24 Aug 2021], after rabies spread in his body. This caused a state of panic among the victim's relatives and neighbours.

Hassan Benmasoud, head of the branch of the Moroccan Center for Human Rights in Chichaoua, said: "According to the information we have obtained, the deceased came from the Ait Haddou Youssef rural commune, and despite being bitten by a rabid dog, he did not receive the antiserum at the time, and he continued to be treated using the popular methods in circulation, and after 40 days his condition deteriorated."

[Dog-mediated rabies is endemic and enzootic in Morocco. Dogs are the main vectors of rabies. The national strategy for rabies prevention and control calls for collaboration between 3 ministries: the Ministry of Public Health (population awareness/education and post-exposure prophylaxis in humans), the Ministry of Agriculture (veterinary services for free, mass vaccination of carnivores, and surveillance/monitoring programs in animals), and the Ministry of the Interior (dog population management and landfill management). Between 2000 and 2019, an average of 400 cases of rabies in animals and 20 cases in humans have been recorded per year at the national level.

[7] Israel (Hazafon): dog, response to RFI
Date: Mon 6 Sep 2021
From: Israel Veterinary Services (Ministry of Agriculture) [edited]


In ProMED posting 20210827.8626789, we published the following media report:
"A dog with rabies was found in the [village] of Shezor in the Galilee region [Hazafon/Northern district]. Government health services are asking anyone who sees an animal displaying signs of rabies, or has been in contact with one, to contact veterinary services, the Health Ministry, or their local healthcare provider immediately." Our comment included the following request for information:

"The recent case in Shezor involved an owned domestic dog. Details on the pet, including its age and vaccination history, will be appreciated."

In response, we have kindly received the following information from Israel's Veterinary Services (Ministry of Agriculture):

"The dog, a 10-year-old mixed male was vaccinated against rabies for the 1st time in his life in January 2021 with a single vaccine dose of the RABISIN vaccine. No booster vaccination (which, according to the manufacturer's instructions, should be given during the same year) has (yet) been applied.

"On 18 Aug 2021, the dog was brought to a veterinarian for examination due to various signs including neurological signs that lasted a total of 3 days. During the last 2 days, the dog showed signs of aggression and died. The case was reported to the official municipal veterinarian through the attending practitioner notice. The municipal veterinarian demanded to remove the dog from his grave, several hours after burial and sent the dead animal to the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI), where rabies was demonstrated by immunofluorescence testing of brain tissue. The public health authorities have subsequently applied "post-exposure treatment" to 9 people suspected to had come in contact with the rabid dog. Following the diagnosis, 3 stray dogs were killed in the village and 14 were vaccinated with a booster vaccine."

[The chronology above may demonstrate the complexity of the implementation of the control and prevention measures related to rabies in domestic dogs within a rabies-infected region. According to Israel's legislation, all kept dogs must be vaccinated annually by an officially accredited and assigned veterinarian, marked with an official electronic chip, registered, and licensed (the licensing is to be renewed annually). There is a countrywide dog registry, maintained by the State Veterinary Services. Currently, about 400 000 dogs are registered. The dog, addressed in the above report, though kept adjacent to the Lebanese territory, from which rabid animals are known to cross the border (see 20210203.8159646 and 20210425.8327732), had not been vaccinated (nor registered) prior to its 10th year; a single vaccination did not protect him 8 months post-vaccination. Hopefully, such cases remain sporadic. - Mod.AS
