An Ada County dog likely contracted the plague after it came into contact with ground squirrels south of Boise last month [May 2015], health officials said. According to Central District Health Department (CDHD), the dog became ill at the end of May 2015. Plague was confirmed in ground squirrels in an area south of Boise to the Snake River and from Kuna to Mountain Home nearly 2 weeks ago.

The dog's owner took it to a veterinarian where a sample was taken and submitted to the State Public Health Laboratory for testing. Preliminary tests indicate the dog likely has the disease. CDHD spokesperson Christine Myron said final results are expected in a week. The dog was treated for the plague and is now recovering. Those who handled the dog while it was ill are being monitored and provided preventative medication if needed, Myron said.

Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas. It can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets. "This is a reminder that people who live and recreate in the area of impact need to take precautions to avoid contact with ground squirrels and their potentially infected fleas. Do not let your dog touch ground squirrels in the affected area. People can be exposed to plague when pets bring infected fleas back into the home, by caring for a sick pet without proper precautions, or by contact with rodents carrying fleas," said Sarah Correll, epidemiologist for Central District Health Department.

To prevent plague, the public health department recommends the following:

- see your doctor about any unexplained illness with a severe fever if you have been in the affected area;
- avoid picking up or touching dead animals; wear gloves if you must handle dead animals;
- do not let pets sleep in bed with you. This has been shown to increase your risk of getting plague;
- do not let your pets hunt or roam in the affected area;
- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets;
- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles;
- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;
- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;
- don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents can get to it;
- If you enter the identified Area of Impact, take the proper precautions:
- wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants;
- use DEET on clothing in accordance with label instructions or wear clothing pre-treated with permethrin;
- use DEET on exposed skin, in accordance with label instructions.

Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases, there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck areas. Plague signs in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced.

[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.

This article leads us to believe the contact with ground squirrel, or fleas from the ground squirrel, transmitted plague to the dog.

Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.
