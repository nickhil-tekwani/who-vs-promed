The number of salmonella cases linked to pre-packed leafy greens grown and distributed by a Bacchus Marsh farm has doubled overnight.
The Health Department has confirmed 54 people - mostly adults - have suspected cases of the _Salmonella [enterica_sertype] Anatum strain associated with greens grown at Tripod Farmers. 2 people have so far been hospitalised.

The Health Department has urged consumers to return pre-packed lettuces by Tripod Farmers sold at supermarkets including Coles and Woolworths. The Coles 4 Leaf Mix, Woolworths salad mix, SupaSalad Supamix, and Wash N Toss salad mix, with best before dates leading up to, and including, 14 Feb 2016, are part of a statewide recall. Several other brands and products have been added to the list. Diet-food delivery service Lite n' Easy has also warned its customers not to eat the salad component in its pre-made lunches and to seek medical attention if they had eaten them and felt unwell.

The department's senior medical advisor, Finn Romanes, said there were a higher than usual number of cases of the _S._ Anatum strain.
Dr Romanes called the outbreak of "moderate size, but quite significant" and urged people to not consume the recalled bags.

Dr Romanes said tests of 3 products from 2 batches of pre-packaged lettuce distributed by Tripod Farmers also tested positive for the
Salmonella bacteria. Given the prevalence of the products and their distribution through supermarkets, he said the cases known to date were likely to be the "tip of the iceberg." "We do expect to see more cases," he said. "We are working with the company to understand what may have occurred... They have instituted a comprehensive clean-up to make sure any risk is minimized."

8 cases of salmonellosis in Queensland may be linked to pre-packaged lettuce distributed by a Victorian-based company, the state health body says. Queensland Health has issued an immediate recall of packaged lettuce products including baby spinach, baby rocket, cos and kale grown and distributed by Tripod Farmers. The recall comes after more than 50 cases of the same rare _Salmonella_ Anatum strain in Victoria.

The potentially-tainted products have not been sold at Coles or Woolworths in Queensland but were distributed to trade outlets including Aussie Farmers Direct, Favco, Fresh Mart Australia, Fruitique and Sofra. Queensland Health says they are yet to fully determine whether the cases of infection are related to the lettuce.

"(We are) liaising with companies who may have incorporated the recalled product into other foods sold to the public," Queensland Health executive director Sophie Dwyer said.

6 people in South Australia have also been diagnosed with the same strain.
