A cattle farm in Yecheon, North Gyeongsang Province, was found to
have been infected with the deadly foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]
Monday [6 Dec 2010], the 1st outbreak outside Andong, where the
disease was 1st reported early last week.

Confirmation of this has put the provincial government and state
quarantine agencies on the highest alert as it has become more likely
the highly contagious virus will spread throughout the province and
possibly beyond.

Three suspected FMD cases reported in Yeongju and Daegu have tested
negative. But another farm in Cheongdo, about 100 km away from the
epicenter, has reported suspected signs of the virus on its livestock
and is awaiting laboratory test results.

According to the North Gyeongsang Provincial Government, a livestock
farm in Yecheon, some 21 km southwest of Andong, was confirmed to be
infected with the animal disease. Over 200 cows within a 500-meter
radius of the infected farm were destroyed and buried underground to
stem the spread of the virus to other regions.

The 1st outbreak outside Andong came a week after the disease hit 2
pig farms there on 29 Nov 2010, about half a year after the last
epidemic broke out in Korea. Over the past week, a total of 39
suspected cases at pig and cattle farms have been reported.

30 out of the 39 farms have tested positive for FMD, while 8 were
confirmed to be negative. The remaining case is under examination.

As of 9 a.m. Monday [6 Dec 2010], a total of 47 000 cows, pigs,
goats, and other domestic animals at infected farms and nearby ones
were culled and buried under the disease prevention program. The
provincial government said about 30 000 more livestock will be buried.

Nearly 400 veterinarians and civil servants have been mobilized
throughout the province to spread disinfectant at livestock farms, as
well as check on suspected cases of the disease. A total of 180
makeshift guard posts have been set up on major roads to restrict the
movements of livestock, people and vehicles in and out of the infected areas.

"We are doing everything we can to prevent the deadly disease from
spreading further. We are culling infected animals as quickly as
possible and taking all possible preventive measures against the
disease," a provincial government official said. About 10 special
teams have been formed to quickly and effectively deal with future
outbreaks, he said.

South Korea remained free of FMD from 2002 until an outbreak in
January [2010], and again in April of this year [2010]. The country
was declared clear of FMD in late September [2010] by the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

But following the latest outbreaks in Andong, the nation was deprived
of its OIE status, with Japan and other countries halting imports of
livestock products from Korea.

[This epizootic appears to be more extensive than the previous FMDV-O
epizootic in S. Korea earlier this year (April-May 2010), which
caused -- in 2 separate regions -- a total of 13 outbreaks. The
current situation begins to resemble Japan's recent FMDV-O outbreak
dynamics, most probably caused by a similar virus (topotype SEA,
strain Mya-98). This underlines the potential of this virus strain to
spread beyond the affected countries, namely Japan, S. Korea,
Mongolia, Hong Kong SAR (and, most probably, China) and Russia's
Zabaykal. - Mod.AS]
