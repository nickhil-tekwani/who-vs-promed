The number of leprosy patients in Gujarat has increased by 17 percent during the last couple of years. Compared to the 7500-odd patients in 2011-12, there were over 9000 persons affected by the disease in the state during the 2012-13 fiscal year, stated the health minister in a written reply to a question posed by Congress MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] Tejashree Patel.

While the districts of south Gujarat, like Surat (1339), Vadodara (1146), and Valsad (1009) have the maximum number of leprosy patients, the highest percentage increase in patients was seen in the predominantly tribal district of the Dangs where the number of patients more than doubled from 143 in 2011-12 to 327 patients in 2012-13. Similar was the case in the adjoining district of Tapi where the numbers swelled to 786 in 2012-13 compared to 493 patients a year ago.

The number of such patients has been on a steady rise in the state since 2010-11, the figures provided by the state government reveal. The administration also provides a monthly assistance of Rs 800 [about USD 13] to these patients. This aid is continued till they are cured, the reply added.

[Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by a bacillus, _Mycobacterium leprae_ (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/). _M. leprae_ multiplies very slowly and the incubation period of the disease is about 5 years, but symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. Although leprosy is not highly contagious, because patients with the lepromatous form of leprosy excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions (that is, are multibacillary), a patient with untreated lepromatous leprosy poses increased risk for transmission of the infection to close, long-term contacts, such as household members. As the organism is also present in skin lesions in these patients, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Because the organisms that are shed by lepromatous patients can persist on surfaces in the environment, fomites are also a potential source of infection. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to pose a risk for spread of the disease.

Although India achieved what WHO refers to as "the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem" (that is, a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population) in December 2005 (http://209.61.208.233/en/Section10/Section20_16172.htm), leprosy has not been eradicated in India. In 2012 India contributed 58 percent of new cases detected worldwide (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf). In fact, India was among countries that reported more new cases in 2012 (134 752 new cases) than in the previous year (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf). In 2012, 50 percent of new cases in India had multibacillary leprosy, which is an indication of the proportion of new cases with contagious disease in the community; 10 percent of new cases occurred in children, which is an indication of ongoing disease transmission; and 0.5 percent of new cases of leprosy had chronic deformities and disability, which reflects problems in case finding (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf).

A discussion of the problem of leprosy in India appeared last month (12 Sep 2013) in the New York Times (http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/india-restarts-battle-against-leprosy/). The article cites a study published in 2009 "showing that [the number of] those affected by the disease in parts of rural and urban Maharashtra was 3 to 9 times more than the official figures" and "a third of those afflicted were children." The article reports, "In 2011, the WHO warned India that the disease was spreading, and that same year, the government's leprosy eradication department began active detection surveillance in high endemic areas. Instead of relying on voluntary reports, government officials initiated door-to-door surveys. These measures account for the rise in new cases seen in the government statistics, said Dr V.V. Pai, director of the Bombay Leprosy Program." This article reports, "In the fiscal year that ended on 31 Mar [2013], the [Indian] government's National Leprosy Eradication Programme recorded an annual new case detection rate of 10.78 for a population of 100 000 people -- an increase of 4.15 percent from the previous fiscal year."

In addition to case detection, the strategy to control leprosy is antimicrobial therapy of the contagious human reservoir. Leprosy is a curable disease with multidrug therapy (MDT) that is provided free of cost to all affected people worldwide (http://www.novartisfoundation.org/page/content/index.asp?MenuID=558&ID=1722&Menu=3&Item=44.19). Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months of therapy and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months of therapy.

However, a recent article in The Hindu (13 Jan 2013) quotes V Narasappa of the National Federation of Leprosy Cured People in India, who says that, "People in the rural areas do not even know MDT is available free and, importantly, they keep away from health facilities for fear of stigma" (http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/leprosy-continues-to-haunt-india-social-stigma-remains/article4358263.ece). This article also says that only 69.5 percent people were able to complete their treatment in Delhi, 66.7 percent in Tripura, 67.7 in Meghalaya, and 32.4 percent in Himachal Pradesh (http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/leprosy-continues-to-haunt-india-social-stigma-remains/article4358263.ece).
