We have had two types of experience with nosocomial _Aspergillus_
infections over the past ten years at a large County hospital.
Cases of _Aspergillus_ wound infections were noted to increase among
patients in the 7 bed Burn ICU after the occasional rains we get in
Southern California. All cases were operated on in an adjacent dedicated
operating room (OR) and disease onset was within a few days of surgery.
Settle plates and other samples or air yielded 1-2 colonies of Aspergillus
sp. per 20 minutes settle plate sample time, in the unoccupied OR. The ICU
itself has HEPA filtered air. Without any specific standard, but after
cleaning the air handling ducts and changing the OR filters (not a HEPA
system) we noted only a very rare colony of Aspergillus on subsequent
settle plates. After performing monthly monitoring for about two years,
with a yield of 0-1 colonies of _Aspergillus_ per run, we went to quarterly
monitoring. In the past five years we have had two outbreaks of
_Aspergillus_ wound infections (defined as two or more cases within 6
months). On each occasion we noted a small rise in colony counts (2-5)
which, after duct cleaning returned to "normal", with no further cases.
Having defined these standards for our unit, we now perform duct cleaning
quarterly (monitor after) and when either one case of _Aspergillus_ wound
infection or more than one colony is noted on a surveillance settle plate,
we do additional duct cleaning.
On our 28 bed hematology ward, it was noted that the mortality from
_Aspergillus_ pulmonary infection among adult acute lymphoma patients and
aplastic anemia patients was approximately 80% over a six month period.
There was (and still is) ongoing construction on the adjacent campus. All
ventilation was from open windows, there being no central air handling
system in this 69 year old hospital. After temporary room HEPA filtration
equipment resulted in a decline in infections, the ward was remodeled with
a central HEPA, positive pressure air handling system supplying each two
bed, single bed rooms and support areas. The only subsequent cases of
_Aspergillus_ pulmonary infection have occurred in patients temporarily
admitted to other hospital units prior to transfer to the hematology ward.
The overall case rate in the past 8 years has been less that 1%.
