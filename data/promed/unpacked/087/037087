A veterinary student was diagnosed with West Nile virus (WNV) in May
2009 after performing a necropsy on a 4-month-old Welsh pony from
Gauteng, South Africa.

Six days after performing the necropsy, the student developed fever,
malaise, myalgia (muscle pain), stiff neck, and a severe headache. A
rash appeared 2 days later and symptoms persisted for approximately
10 days. RNA (genetic material) extracted from the student and the
pony identified lineage 2 WNV -- a fatal form of the virus previously
diagnosed in horses in South Africa in 2008.

WNV is a mosquito-born flavivirus that circulates primarily in birds
and mosquitoes. Humans and horses are considered incidental, dead-end
hosts for WNV. An infected horse does not normally pose a risk for
infecting humans with WNV since the virus is present at very low
levels in the blood, insufficient to infect mosquitoes.

"The student used a bone saw and was the one that removed the brain
from the horse and would have had much more exposure to droplets,"
said Marietjie Venter, PhD, associate professor at the University of
Pretoria, South Africa. "At the time, the veterinarians did not take
extra precaution besides wearing gloves when doing horse autopsies
since they did not see them as being high risk for zoonotic diseases
in Africa."

Since no other humans in contact with the pony became ill or
developed antibodies against WNV, Venter and colleagues suspect WNV
levels could be higher in nerve tissues.

"Veterinarians should therefore be wearing eye protection, gloves,
and masks when doing postmortems on animals with fatal encephalitis,"
advised Venter. The student recovered and is now a practicing veterinarian.

This case report was described in a Letter to the Editor of the
journal Emerging Infectious Diseases published in March 2010. More
information on WNV in South Africa is available in Venter's article,
"Lineage 2 West Nile virus as cause of fatal neurologic disease in
horses, South Africa." The article is available online at

[Bone saws that are powered by air or electricity, can aerosolize a
variety of particles, from disease to pieces of tissue.

The article is correct in stating personal protective equipment
should be used. It should include gloves, eye protection, or face
shield, and should always be used when signs of encephalitis are
suspected. Portals of entry, such as respiratory system, mucus
membranes of the eyes, or nicks, cuts or abrasions, allow entry of
aerosolized tissue.

When zoonotic diseases are suspected, personal protective equipment
may extend beyond normal gloves and eye protection.

We are glad the student recovered and is a practicing veterinarian. - Mod.TG]
