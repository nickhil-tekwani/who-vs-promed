The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) announced on Tuesday [3 Sep 2019] that a horse in Douglas has been confirmed as being infected with Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus infection.

The new case brings the total number of horse cases of EEE to 8 in Massachusetts this year [2019]. As a result of this finding, the risk level in Douglas has been raised to critical, and the risk level in Oxford and Webster has been raised to high.

"Cases of EEE in mammals, including horses, serve as a reminder that there is a continuing risk to humans," said Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel, MD, MPH. "Even as we head into September, it remains critically important that people take steps to protect themselves and their families from mosquito bites."

In total, there are 29 communities now at critical risk, 39 at high risk, and 123 at moderate risk for the EEE virus in Massachusetts. A map of the state's current EEE risk levels can be found [at] http://www.mosquitoresults.com.

There have been 4 confirmed human cases of EEE this year [2019] -- including a male in Grafton.

The DPH is imploring all Massachusetts residents to use mosquito repellent, and those in high- and critical-risk communities should consider staying indoors during the dusk to dawn hours to reduce exposure to mosquitoes.

[2] Massachusetts - 8 horses

On 9 Sep 2019, the Massachusetts Health and Human Services (MHHS) announced 8 confirmed cases of Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). The affected horses came from 5 counties:

- Essex (town of Methuen, with onset of clinical signs 22 Aug 2019)
- Hampshire (Granby, onset of clinical signs 8 Aug 2019)
- Middlesex (Holliston, onset of clinical signs 23 Aug 2019)
- Norfolk (Medfield, onset of clinical signs 24 Aug 2019)
- Worcester (Uxbridge, Brookfield, and Douglas, onset of clinical signs 16, 22, and 27 Aug 2019, respectively).

Michael Cahill, director of the Division of Animal Health (DAH) at the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR), said none of the horses were vaccinated against EEE, and all were euthanized.

"Based on the information collected, we believe all of the affected animals were infected on their home farms, and that information in combination with any human illness reports is used by the Department of Public Health in determining areas that may need to be targeted for aerial spraying of mosquitoes," he said. "Quarantines are not an effective means of controlling the disease since horses are dead-end hosts (there is never enough virus in their blood to allow for the transmission of virus to another mosquito)."

[3] New Jersey - 5 more horses

Five more horses in New Jersey have been euthanized after contracting the severe mosquito-borne illness Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), officials said in a statement.

The deaths come after the virus claimed the lives of 3 other horses and an alpaca in New Jersey in recent months, all of which were euthanized after testing positive for the disease.

So far this year [2019], 10 animals -- including 9 horses and one alpaca -- have contracted the virus in the state, according to the New Jersey Department of Agriculture.

The 5 horses euthanized include an 18-year-old gelding horse in Morris County, a 4-month-old gelding in Salem County, a 4-year-old gelding and a gelding of unknown age in Ocean County, and a 1-year-old filly in Atlantic County, the statement said.

The horses were not vaccinated for the virus, officials said.

"As more cases of Eastern equine encephalitis are reported, we strongly encourage horse owners to check their records to verify that their animals are protected from this disease, or to know if vaccination is needed," New Jersey Department of Agriculture Secretary Douglas Fisher said in a statement. "Animals that have been vaccinated are much less likely to contract deadly diseases such as Eastern equine encephalitis. It is the most effective strategy, and equine vaccines are available commercially."

The virus -- which is known to affect both horses and camelids like alpacas -- can cause inflammation of the brain tissue and has a greater chance of killing horses than West Nile virus, officials said. The virus [EEE], also known as "sleeping sickness," is rare and also affects the animal's nervous system. [This virus has romped across the country every year. It is NOT rare. - Mod.TG]

Officials are urging horse and alpaca owners to contact their veterinarians to ensure their animals are up-to-date on their vaccinations.

Officials said horses and alpacas are not likely to spread EEE to humans because the animals are considered "dead-end" hosts for the virus. However, people can still contract EEE from mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, chills, body and joint aches.

For more information about EEE, visit the state Department of Agriculture website at https://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/ah/diseases/diseaseworksheets.html.

EEE and West Nile virus, officials say, must be reported to the state veterinarian at 609-671-6400 within 48 hours of diagnosis.

The New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory is available to help with testing for both EEE and West Nile virus and can be reached via email at <Jerseyvetlab@ag.state.nj.us>.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (WDATCP) confirmed on 23 Aug 2019 a 12-year-old Warmblood mare tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The mare experienced onset of clinical signs, including fever, muscle fasciculations, and recumbency, on 19 Aug 2019. She had no history of vaccination and was humanely euthanized.

This is Wisconsin's 3rd case of EEE in 2019.

EEE 101: Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the USA.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:

- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the USA. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

[The long list of horses affected by a disease having a preventative vaccine is sad, troubling and concerning. Rains, hurricanes, and damp areas are all seemingly promoters of mosquitoes and the diseases carried by the mosquito.

Please vaccinate and protect your horse. The vaccine is cheap compared to losing your animal. In addition to vaccines, please use sprays approved to be on horses for additional mosquito control. - Mod.TG
