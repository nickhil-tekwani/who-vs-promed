The Villa Montes [Tarija] municipal health technician, Samuel Quintasi, stated that a person from a rural area contracted [a] hantavirus [infection] and was sent to a 3rd level hospital, although he did not specify if in Tarija or in Santa Cruz del la Sierra.

Due to timely medical attention for the patient, this individual is in stable condition and has been released from the hospital with recommendations to avoid new infection on returning home.

"Health personnel have visited the area, zone 54, where we are carrying out epidemiological surveillance," the municipal official explained.

Hantavirus [infection] causes an emerging zoonotic disease that is transmitted by rodents, including mice and rats. [The disease] is characterized by presentation of fever, muscle pain, and gastrointestinal disturbance, followed by the beginning of respiratory difficulty and hypotension.

Cases of hantavirus infection in humans in general occur in rural areas where one can encounter rodents that have the virus, but transmission is also possible in urban areas.

The virus is acquired by inhalation of [inhalation of aerosols or contact with excreta, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents].

[Infection] can be prevented by reducing people's contact with rodents, in combination with environmental hygienic practices that impede colonization by these animals of houses, recreational areas, or work areas.

The area under surveillance is where in April [2019], soldiers subsequently died of hantavirus [infections].

[It is difficult to tell if this patient is the same one that the Tarija Departmental Health Services (SEDES) reported as a new case of hantavirus infection in the Padcaya municipality (see Hantavirus - Americas (22): Bolivia (TR) 20190521.6480158). The hantavirus involved in the case above is not mentioned.

Cases of hantavirus infections in Tarija department are not new. Tarija department is endemic for hantaviruses, and cases occur there sporadically. Last year (2018), there were 11 cases. The previously reported 2015 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) that occurred in Tarija department were confirmed. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia, including 7 cases in Tarija during 2014. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases in Bolivia were not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the rodent hosts of the hantavirus that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include the following:
- Laguna Negra virus (small vesper mouse, _Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyslaucha.html and large vesper mouse, _C. callosus_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyscallosus.html);
- Bermejo (Chaco rice rat, _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html); and
- Oran (long- tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

Since previous cases in Tarija department have occurred in Bermejo, perhaps Bermejo hantavirus was involved.

Dr Jan Clement commented earlier that there is a need to be able to differentiate Seoul orthohantavirus (SEOV) as a causative agent, but that is hampered by the fact that most current commercial ELISA or WB formats no longer contain a SEOV antigen, so that a preliminary presumption of a hantavirus infection can even be missed in non-research laboratories (ibidem, and: Reynes JM, Carli D, Bour JB et al. Seoul virus infection in humans, France, 2014-2016. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(6): 973-7; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/6/16-0927_article.

SEOV is widely distributed around the world in the brown rat and is likely found in Tarija department. - Mod.TY
