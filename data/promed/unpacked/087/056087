The Davidson County Health Department reports the 2nd case of rabies
for the year 2010.

A cat caught and killed a rabid bat Tuesday [4 May 2010] in the Hasty
community. The cat was not properly vaccinated and has been
destroyed. There was no human exposure reported.

Do not handle your animal with bare hands after it has had contact
with a wild animal. Saliva from the wild animal may still be present
on the domestic animal's fur, and by handling the animal, you may
expose yourself to the rabies virus.

If there are stray dogs, cats or wildlife in your neighborhood, call
Animal Control at 249-0131. Call the Rabies Hotline at 242-2348 if
you or your pet comes in contact with another animal.

Two family pets were euthanized Wednesday [5 May 2010] after chewing
on a dead bat that tested positive for rabies.

Dr. Greg Weech, a veterinarian for Galesburg Animal Hospital and the
rabies administrator for Knox County (Illinois), confirmed an English
mastiff and a German shepherd were euthanized Wednesday [5 May 2010]
morning. The dogs found were in the backyard of the home with the bat
Monday afternoon.

Weech said it is the 1st confirmed case of rabies in Knox County he
can remember. He has been a vet at the Galesburg Animal Hospital since 1982.

Weech's memory is correct, according to statistics kept by the
Illinois Department of Public Health, which go back as far as 1990.
In the 21 years of statistics available, no animals tested positive
for rabies in Knox County.

In 2009, 83 animals -- all bats -- tested positive for rabies in
Illinois. Last year [2009], the most frequently tested animals were
bats (2502), dogs (1620), cats (979), skunks (291) and raccoons (173).

So far in 2010, 8 animals -- all bats -- have tested positive for
rabies statewide.

The dogs had to be euthanized, according to Weech, because they had
not had their rabies vaccinations updated and posed the threat of
developing the disease and passing it on to other animals or humans.

According to the World Heath Organization, rabies is a disease caused
by a virus and transmitted to humans from animals. Rabies infects
domestic and wild animals and is spread to people through close
contact with infected saliva via bites or scratches.

The disease is present on nearly every continent of the world, but
more than 95 percent of human deaths occur in Asia and Africa. While
on average one person dies of rabies every year in the United States,
upwards of 60 000 people die from it worldwide annually. Once
symptoms of the disease develop, rabies is fatal.

"The problem comes when animals or humans handle an animal that has
rabies," Weech said. "The dogs had the bat in their mouths and had
chewed it extensively."

The bat, which was dead when the dogs found it, was taken to the
Galesburg Animal Disease Laboratory. When the bat tested positive for
rabies, the lab informed Weech. He informed the owners Tuesday [4 May 2010].

The owners explained that they could not afford to have the pets
quarantined for the mandatory 6 months, which at USD 14 per day would
have left them with a bill for USD 2574 and would not have included
treatment charges.

"We made the decision based on what was best for the community and
best for the dogs," the owner said. "There is no way we wanted to be
responsible for the dogs spreading rabies. And we did not want them
to suffer for one minute."

Weech said all pets should be vaccinated for rabies once a year.
Three-year vaccinations are available, and pet owners should consult
a vet. He said anyone who finds a dead bat or other animal should not
touch it and should report the animal to Knox County Animal Control
Department at 345-3735.

"The owners were smart," Weech said. "They put a bag over the bat and
picked it up using that. We don't want people touching the dead
animal if they can at all avoid it. It's better to call and have it
removed by the county."

Rabies Facts
From the Illinois Department of Public Health

What is rabies?
Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus that attacks the central
nervous system. The virus is present primarily in the saliva, brain
tissue and spinal fluid of a rabid animal.

What animals can get rabies?
Rabies can affect all mammals. Since 1995 in the United States, more
than 7000 animals per year -- most of them wild -- have been
diagnosed as having the disease. The disease is found in all states
except Hawaii as well as in Canada, Mexico and most other countries
around the world.

In wild animal species, rabies is more common in bats, skunks,
raccoons and foxes, but the disease also has been found in deer and
in large rodents, such as woodchucks. Cats, dogs and livestock can
get rabies, too, if they are not vaccinated. Some animals, including
chipmunks, gerbils, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, rabbits, rats and
squirrels, rarely get rabies. Birds, fish, insects, lizards, snakes
and turtles never get rabies.

Most of the recent cases of human rabies that have occurred in the
United States have been caused by rabies virus from bats. In
Illinois, rabid bats can be found anywhere. Awareness that bats can
be a source of the rabies virus can help people protect themselves.

The 1st sign of rabies is usually a change in the animal's behavior.
An animal need not be "foaming at the mouth" to have rabies. Other
signs include difficulty walking, a general appearance of sickness or
a change in the animal's normal behavior.

How are people exposed to rabies?
People usually are exposed to the rabies virus when an infected
animal bites them. Exposure may occur if the animal's saliva enters
an open cut or mucous membrane (nose, mouth, eyes). The presence of a
bat in a home, or any contact with a bat, represents a possible
hazard for rabies and should be reported to the local health
department so that the circumstances can be evaluated. The last human
case in Illinois was reported in 1954.

What should a person do if an animal bite occurs?
Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical
attention immediately. The local health department or the county
animal control office also should be notified immediately. The animal
should be captured without damaging its head and only if direct
contact with the animal can be avoided.

What if a pet is exposed to a rabid animal?
If your pet has been in a fight with another animal, call your
veterinarian. A vaccinated pet may need a booster dose of rabies
vaccine as soon as possible. Unvaccinated animals exposed to a known
rabid animal must be confined and professionally observed for 6
months or euthanized.

What can people do to protect themselves and their pets from rabies?
Do not feed, touch or adopt wild animals or stray dogs or cats.

Vaccinated pets serve as a buffer between rabid wildlife and humans,
so be sure dogs and cats are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations.
Consult with your veterinarian about when your pet needs to be vaccinated.

Do not allow pets to roam free.

Do not attract wild animals to your home or yard. Store bird seed or
other animal feed in containers with tight-fitting lids.

Feed pets indoors. Make sure garbage cans are tightly capped. Board
up any openings to your attic, basement, porch or garage. Cap
chimneys with screens.

Encourage children to immediately tell an adult if they are bitten or
scratched by an animal. Teach children not to approach or to touch
any animal they do not know.

Report all animal bites to the local animal control.

[Rabies state law varies slightly from state to state regarding
length of quarantine when an animal has been previously vaccinated.

However, almost all states are clear that unvaccinated animals with
known rabies exposure are to be euthanized. The risk of transmitting
this fatal disease to humans is high in such circumstances.

All pets should be vaccinated against rabies. This includes those
large animal pets such as horses and show cattle or animals with
valuable genetics.

All of these articles urge people not to touch a dead animal that may
have rabies. People should wash their hands with soap and warm water
after any possible contact with a rabid animal. If you are bitten or
scratched by a wild animal or any animal you do not know, then seek
appropriate medial attention as you may need post exposure
prophylaxis to prevent rabies in yourself. - Mod.TG]
