At least 36 residents of Tanzania's northern district of Hai [Kilimanjaro region] have contracted anthrax, an infection caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, after eating the carcass of a cow, authorities said on [Thu 9 Mar 2017]. Reports from the area show that the victims presented themselves to the district hospital and regional referral hospital with all the symptoms of anthrax including swollen eyes, lesions on the face, hands, cheeks, and fingers.

Elias Machange, head of the Livestock and Fisheries Department at Hai district council, Kilimanjaro region, said the disease was reported a few days ago when people in the area ate meat from a cow. He said the meat had all the symptoms of anthrax, a serious illness caused by a microbe called _B. anthracis_ that lives in soil. "This is so because people in the affected villages have a tendency of eating meat which wasn't approved by the responsible authorities. That's why it is important for people to eat meat which have been approved by the responsible authorities," Mr Machange said.

Yohana Sintoo, Hai district council executive director also confirmed the outbreak of the disease, saying it had affected 3 villages of Sanya Station, and Tindigani in Kia ward and Nkwasira village in Masama West ward. "It is true all the patients were rushed to the district hospital and others to the regional hospital," he said, adding that some of them were discharged soon after recovering. The official said that so far, a team of health experts had been dispatched to the affected villages. "They are sensitising the public on the best ways of taking precautions on the disease," said Sintoo.

Helga Mchovu, chairman of the Hai district council suggested the need for the government to carry out regular vaccination on livestock to address such challenges.

Last April [2016], Rombo district was one of the districts in Kilimanjaro region hit hard by the disease, which claimed one life, while many others were infected [see Anthrax - Tanzania (02): (KL) human, bovine 20160411.4152843; Anthrax - Tanzania: (KL) human, bovine, susp 20160407.4145113]. Humans are normally infected only by handling the carcasses, skins or wool of infected animals.

[The symptoms mentioned are characteristic of cutaneous anthrax, and presumably from these 36 persons being involved in the slaughter and butchering of this affected cow, or in the distribution and purchasing of the meat. We have yet to hear of gastroenteric cases in the 3 villages.

Cutaneous anthrax responds well to antibiotic treatment but gastroenteric anthrax is usually lethal. Frankly I don't know any precautions the public can take as it is up to the owners of sick and dead cattle to not butcher them, and for the authorities to be on top of the risks and make sure that livestock are vaccinated. When there are human anthrax cases it is a result of a lack of veterinary responsibility. - Mod.MHJ
