People are urged to avoid consuming cow carcasses as it may lead to
death.

Six residents of Sabu Raijua District, East Nusa Tenggara, were
reportedly in a serious condition after consuming carcasses of
anthrax-ridden cows in the wake of an anthrax outbreak. Over a week,
56 cows were dead of the disease.

Head of East Nusa Tenggara Province Animal Husbandry Bureau Samuel
Rebo said that the government has deployed a team to Sabu island in
order to identify the outbreak and treat the cattle infected by the
deadly bacteria. "The team will carry on with mass vaccination over
livestock in the region so that the bacteria will not cause further
infection toward healthy animals," said Samuel Rebo in Kupang, on
Thursday [25 Aug 2011].

The Animal Husbandry Bureau urged people to avoid consuming cow
carcasses as it may lead to death. "If there's a dead cow, it should
be buried," said Samuel Rebo. He said Sabu Raijua District is one of
the anthrax-endemic areas.

"To avoid anthrax from spreading to other regions, Raijua Sabu
District is closed for cattle traffic for the time being," he said.
The anthrax incubation period lasts 3-7 days with symptoms that are
classified into 3 kinds, namely pre-acute, acute, and chronic.

"Humans can be infected with anthrax germs when they have direct
contact with anthrax spores, eat contaminated food, or inhale anthrax
spores," said Samuel Rebo.

[Year after year, there are outbreaks involving cattle in East Nusa
Tenggara, with or without reports of human cases. I suspect that there
is an incidence threshold which triggers human reporting to explain
the years without reports. For example in 2007, the official incidence
was 74 cases with 5 deaths, but ProMED-mail reported 788 people ill
after eating meat from sick cattle and buffalo. In 2009, there 47
cases reported in East Nusa Tenggara. It would be very cost effective
to have a proactive livestock control programme involving annual
vaccination in the most severely afflicted islands. Reactive
vaccination is very expensive, and the local farming population has
already lost an unnecessary number of stock. - Mod.MHJ]
