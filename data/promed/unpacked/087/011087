Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease in the Asia-Pacific Region: Role of Enterovirus 71
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[The August issue of the Journal of Virology contains a paper by Peter
McMinn, Katie Lindsay, David Perera, Hung Ming Chan, Kwai Peng Chan and
Mary Jane Cardosa, which describes phylogenetic analysis of strains of
Enterovirus 71 isolated during linked epidemics in Malaysia, Singapore and
Western Australia. This paper sheds some light on the unusual severity of
the epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease which have occurred in the
Asia-Pacific region in recent years. The abstract of the paper is reproduced
below. - Mod.CP
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a frequent cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease
(HFMD) epidemics associated with severe neurological sequelae in a small
proportion of cases. There has been a significant increase in EV71 epidemic
activity throughout the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. Recent HFMD
epidemics in this region have been associated with a severe form of
brainstem encephalitis associated with pulmonary edema and high case
fatality rates. In this study, we show that 4 genetic lineages of EV71 have
been prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997, including 2 previously
undescribed genogroups (B3 and B4). Furthermore, we show that viruses
belonging to genogroups B3 and B4 have circulated endemically in Southeast
Asia during this period and have been the primary cause of several large
HFMD or encephalitis epidemics in Malaysia, Singapore, and Western Australia.
