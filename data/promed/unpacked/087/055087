AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE BEEF SLAUGHTER PROCESS
September 12, 1997
Media Sources
LINCOLN, Neb. -- USDA investigators will search slaughterhouses next week
for the source of contaminated beef that led to the Hudson Foods recall of
25 millions pounds of ground beef.
Nebraska state epidemiologist Thomas Safranek was quoted as saying, "I am
very doubtful that they will ever identify the supplier," adding that while
not participating in the investigation, he suspects Hudson didn't keep
records that would help identify the supplier of the tainted meat because
processing plants often mix beef trimmings from various suppliers and don't
keep track of which goes where, making it virtually impossible to find the
source of the contamination.
[Actually, generally such records ARE kept. The problem is making a strict
identification in each and every blend, particularly when the ends of lots
are forced into a batch and the rework issue is taken into account.
Approximate identification of meats used in most blends is generally fairly
simple.--RAL
Agriculture Department spokeswoman Jacque Knight was cited as saying that
investigators will examine slaughter-plant production, shipping records and
records of testing for _E. coli_. Investigators have said the meat supplied
to Hudson was contaminated before it ever reached the plant. The suppliers'
names haven't been released.
The investigation will focus on companies that supplied Hudson with beef on
June 5, one of the days the contaminated beef was believed to have been
processed.
The story adds that to date, about six million pounds of Hudson meat have
been returned. The other 19 million pounds recalled were consumed by
customers or thrown away.
