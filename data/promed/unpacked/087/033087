Four infectious diseases have stricken a North Korean city on the
east coast, affecting up to 4000 people, a source claimed Mon, 15 Jan
2007. "Chongjin is overrun by scarlet fever, typhoid, typhus and
paratyphoid. About 3000 to 4000 are suffering from the diseases," the
source said, asking to remain anonymous.
The source reported the infected people are mostly less than 40 years
of age. North Korean health authorities have halted railway
operations to prevent the spread of disease and have imposed travel
bans. "When scarlet fever erupted late in 2006, North Korean
authorities also imposed travel bans across the country," the source added.
Good Neighbors International, a South Korean civic organization which
provides aid to North Korea, confirmed that the rapid spread of
disease in the North has resulted in school closings and travel bans.
Another source also claimed that Chongjin has only one hospital
equipped with 150 beds in each district, but about 600-700 patients
are seeking treatment in one district.

[We have had previous postings regarding a multi-province outbreak of
scarlet fever in North Korea. How much any the other diseases
mentioned -- typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever and typhus -- represent
in the numbers is not stated. Any further details of these outbreaks
would be welcome.
The salmonelloses (typhoid and paratyphoid) are spread by
contaminated food or (more commonly) water, in contrast to the
person-to-person spread of the Group A beta-hemolytic toxin-producing
streptococcus that causes scarlet fever. These diseases are usually
endemic in areas of the world where sanitation conditions are not
ideal. It may well be the case that the number of cases represents
the endemic rate of the area. In some medical or lay press
publications, typhoid can be referred to as "abdominal typhus"
because of the similarities of the 2 infections, and it is possible
that this is the case here.
The classical typhus diseases are:
Epidemic typhus -- caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_ and is spread by
the droppings of the infected clothing (body) louse (_Pediculus
humanus corporis_) directly in conjunction with feeding on a person
or through aerosol from infested clothes;
Murine (endemic) typhus -- caused by _Rickettsia typhi_ and
transmitted to humans by fleas infesting rats or mice; and
Scrub typhus (Tsutsugamushi fever) - caused by _Orientia
tsutsugamushi_ (also a rickettsial organism) and transmitted in
humans by chiggers, which are found in areas of heavy scrub vegetation.
