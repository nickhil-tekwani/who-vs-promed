Follow-up report No. 1
Text of a fax received on 12 August 1999 from Dr Celal Ã–zcan, General
Director of Protection and Control, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs, Ankara:
End of previous report period: 2 August 1999 (see Disease Information, 12
[30, 107, dated 6 August 1999).
End of this report period: 12 August 1999.
Background: When Turkey was informed on 7 July 1999 of the bluetongue
outbreaks in Bulgaria, it urgently implemented measures in the region,
namely: vaccination, animal movement control, insect control, external
parasite control, clinical surveillance and monitoring. All clinically
suspicous cases were investigated in laboratories and no cases were
confirmed.
On 26 July 1999, 5 samples were collected from sick animals in Karapinar
locality of Vaysal village, Lalapasa, Edirne, and were sent to the
Veterinary Control and Research Institute, where bluetongue antibodies were
detected.
>From 26 July to 5 August, an intensive clinical survey for bluetongue was
carried out in Lalapasa district. New cases were detected in Hacidanisment
and Kalkansogut villages which are close to each other and use common
grassland.
New outbreaks:
Location No. of outbreaks
Kalkansogut village, Lalapasa District: 1
Hacidanisment village, Lalapasa District: 1
Description of affected population in the new outbreaks: sheep that had not
been vaccinated against bluetongue.
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species: Ovine
susceptible: 7567
cases: 52
deaths: ---
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Central Veterinary Control and
Research Institute.
B. Diagnostic tests used: competitive ELISA (antibody detection). Virus
isolation, identification and typing are still in progress.
Epidemiological details:
- Typical signs of bluetongue were observed in 12 out of 30 sheep flocks in
the 3 villages.
- Typical clinical signs were observed in 62 (sic) out of 7567 sheep, one of
which was in poor condition and died, probably due to a combination of
infections. Mortality has remained low.
- There have been no significant disease occurrences in the cattle
population of the area.
- All the known infected villages are located in the northern part of
Thrace. The spatial distribution of infection suggests that the bluetongue
incursion may have been due to infected wind-borne vectors from the
north-northeastern border with Bulgaria.
Control measures during reporting period: the measures mentioned in the
previous report have been maintained:
- surveillance;
- vector control;
- control of wildlife reservoirs;
- quarantine and movement control inside the country;
- vaccination with bluetongue virus serotype 4 vaccine.
In Lalapasa district, the incidence of the disease is expected to decrease
due to the strict control measures implemented.
