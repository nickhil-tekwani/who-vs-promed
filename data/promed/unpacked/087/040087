Japanese encephalitis [JE] has claimed the lives of 2 children [in
Gorakhpur], taking the toll in the viral infection in the district to 149
this year [2010], a health official said today [11 Aug 2010]. Over 100
people suffering from acute encephalitis syndrome are being treated at
various hospitals in Gorakhpur division [Uttar Pradesh (UP)], additional
director, Health, UK Srivastava said. These include patients from Bihar
[state] and Nepal also, he said. 29 districts of eastern UP, some parts of
Bihar and neighbouring Nepal have been hit hard by the virus.

Though the water borne encephalitis is caused due to consumption of
contaminated water in which the enterovirus develops, JE is [transmitted]
by mosquito bite. Pigs and birds are host and carriers of the JE virus.

[As in previous reports from Gorakhpur, both JE virus encephalitis and an
unspecified acute encephalitis syndrome are mentioned. In the report above,
149 encephalitis cases are attributed to JE virus infection. It is not
clear if the more than 100 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome are
included in that number, or are in addition to the 149 JE virus cases.
Enteroviruses are mentioned, but not explicitly as etiological agents in
the cases mentioned. Specific enteroviruses were not mentioned. Further
information on the etiological agents involved in the acute encephalitis
syndrome cases would be of interest.
