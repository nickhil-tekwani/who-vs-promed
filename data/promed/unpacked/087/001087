Remarks on Dr. Radford Davis's comments regarding Zoonotic
Transmission of Hepatitis E Virus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[In the proMED-mail post archived as "Hepatitis E virus, new
genotypes - Japan (03) 20020724.4850"] Dr. Davis [referring to
non-human primates] commented that he was "unaware of any evidence
that proves any other animal species is capable of harboring
hepatitis E virus (HEV) and transmitting it to humans". If anyone
cares to do a literature search or knows anything about HEV, he/she
would find that there is ample evidence documenting otherwise.
Pigs and chickens have been confirmed to harbor HEV, and the HEV
genomic sequences in these animal species have been determined. Swine
HEV and avian HEV are genetically and antigenically related to human
HEV. It has been shown that swine HEV infects chimpanzees and rhesus
monkeys and conversely human HEV infects pigs. In addition, pig
veterinarians and pig handlers in several countries (including the
U.S.) had significantly higher anti-HEV prevalence compared to
matched control blood donor populations. Human HEV strains resembling
swine HEV have been identified from patients in a number of
industrialized countries, including 2 US patients. The viruses
recovered from the 2 US patients are extremely similar to the
prototype swine HEV, and the US human HEV infects pigs.
US Army scientists have reported the detection and genetic
identification of a HEV strain from rodents, and the "murine HEV" is
closely related to human HEV. In addition to pigs, human HEV has been
successfully transmitted to rats and lambs. Furthermore, there are a
number of other animal species (cats, dogs, cattle, etc.) that have
been found to be seropositive.
What evidence do we need for a zoonosis claim? Our lab is responsible
for the discovery of the swine and avian hepatitis E viruses (see
references below). In my opinion, the claim that hepatitis E is a
zoonosis and that animal reservoirs exist, is very appropriate and
this concept has been accepted by the hepatitis E research community.
The 4th International Conference on Emerging Zoonosis will have a
topic on Hepatitis E.
