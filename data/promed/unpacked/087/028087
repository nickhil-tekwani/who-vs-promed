Bird Flu Found in US Duck for 1st Time
--------------------------------------
Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has been found in a green-winged teal [_Anas carolinensis_ or _Anas crecca carolinensis_] in northern Washington state. It is a different strain from that in China, Asia and Egypt.

A green-winged teal shot by a hunter in northern Washington state has tested positive for H5N1 bird flu -- a relative of the virus that's infected nearly 700 people globally and killed 400 of them.

It's the 1st case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza ever seen in the US. The good news is that the strain is genetically different from the strain that's circulated in China, across Asia and most recently in Egypt. It doesn't appear to have infected any people or even domestic poultry.

But it shows that wild migrating birds can carry dangerous viruses to the US, says Hon Ip, an expert on wildlife pathogens at the US Geological Survey in Madison, Wisconsin.

The US Department of Agriculture will need to keep a close eye out for other birds with H5N1, Ip said.

"USDA and the Department of the Interior are going to have to spend time to understand the implication of this introduction," Ip told NBC News. "At the moment, we do not know of a single human case with our H5."

Flu is a mutation-prone virus and there are hundreds of strains. Even with precise-sounding names such as H5N1, there can be a large degree of genetic variation. Scientists are watching for mutations and other genetic changes that can make a virus strain more likely to infect people and poultry.

The H5N1 that most people are worried about has killed or forced the destruction of hundreds of millions of chickens around the world. It occasionally infects people, and the fear is it will mutate into a form that makes it pass easily from person to person. That would spark a pandemic that could kill millions.

Since 2006, Ip's lab has been watching for H5N1 and other strains of bird flu in wild migrating birds along the US west coast, as well as in Alaska and Maine. They've found many different types -- most recently a pathogenic strain of H5N8, as well as many non-pathogenic strains that don't appear to make birds sick.

To make matters more complicated, this strain of H5N1 found in the teal appears to be a mix of H5N1 and the H5N8 found in Washington state and elsewhere in the US as well as in Europe, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.

That makes it of concern to poultry farmers but not to people -- yet, Ip says. "But because the H5 comes from the Asian H5N1, I would say the risk is not zero," Ip adds.

A wild bird can infect domestic flocks, which is why agriculture officials are on high alert. And infected domestic birds can infect people. Wild birds can infect hunters and other people who come into contact with them.

"Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments, especially in households," the World Health Organization says. "Human infections remain rare and these influenza A(H5N1) viruses do not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of these viruses remains low."

[Is this really the 1st time a US duck has had highly pathogenic influenza? Or is it the 1st time in 2014-2015 that highly pathogenic H5N1 has been found in a US duck? I am not sure which reflects the truth. Or maybe it is only the 1st time we have identified this strain in a US duck?

Regardless, many have long suspected that migrating birds are capable of transmitting viruses such as this one over long distances and infecting commercial flocks.

Increased surveillance and biosecurity in commercial poultry operations in the United States needs to be maintained and/or strengthened to prevent an introduction into commercial poultry flocks.

This outbreak was previously reported in an OIE report, posted on ProMED-mail as posting 20150122.3109001.
