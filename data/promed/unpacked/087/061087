CJD-BSE CONNECTION? - UK (13)
=============================
[ Some further questions were raised by Robert Tryblis. I include
the relevant parts of the questions and Blanchfield's full replies. MH-J]
You will find answers in the forthcoming update of the IFST Position
Statement, due out shortly, and which I shall post here when it is
available.

Meanwhile, some answers to your queries.

Not necessarily. It depends on the age of slaughter, and the incubation
period , which may varying among individual cattle from 2 to 8 years.
Probably most _beef_ cattle would be slaughtered first.

I was originally informed that was the case. I have now tried to find out
more about this. It now appears that it was an early recommendation back
in 1989, but was given low priority in the research programme and as
research results have accumulated, the need for it became less relevant. I
believe it may have been either not started, or abandoned. I shall try to
find out more.

>If Kuru is a form of CJD then CJD can be transmitted by eating infected
>tissue, particularly brain tissue, or by infection through cuts etc.
Infected tissue particularly brain tissue _from people who died of CJD (or
its kuru form)_. The "cuts etc" is speculation and I know of no evidence to
support that.

There is no evidence that anyone could get CJD from eating sheep brains (in
France and the Middle East. where sheep's brains and eyeballs are often
consumed). And cattle brains (plus spinal cord, retina and other offals) are
excluded from the food chain.

>One cause of BSE is attributed to the ingestion of contaminated material.
By cattle. The banning of ruminant material from animal feedstuffs from July
1988 has led, after a time lag (due in part to farmers using up their stocks
of cattle feed after July 1988, but due mainly to the incubation period) to
a dramatic decline in new cases (30% drop from 1993 to 1994, and an
estimated 47% drop from 1994 to 1995). This may be seen as confirming that
contaminated feedstuff was the main cause. It also lends support to the view
that cattle will prove to be a "dead end host" for BSE, and that, _if the
control measures are strictly adhered to_, the disease will eventually
become virtually extinct.

>As I understand it both CJD and BSE are as a result of changes to prion
>protein in the brain. These changes are triggered by presently unknown
>agents. The big question being can the BSE agents cause changes in human
>prion protein.
Research recently published in Nature (Collinge et al, "Unaltered
susceptibility to BSE in transgenic mice expressing human prion protein",
Nature (1995), 378, 21/28 December), is indicative of the inability of
bovine aberrant PrP to affect normal human PrP. Professor J Collinge and
his colleagues at Imperial College School of Medicine studied mice
genetically-engineered so that they produced human prion protein as well as
normal mouse prion protein. They injected the mice with CJD, and the mice
fell victim to the disease, demonstrating that with human protein, the human
disease CJD was transmitted. They then exposed similar mice to BSE.
Abnormal _mouse_ prion protein was formed, but no abnormal _human_ prion
protein. An encouraging first stage, but they are now repeating the
experiments with genetically-modified mice that express only human protein
and no mouse protein. These have remained well at 264 days after
inoculation (60 days longer than for CJD to develop in mice of this
genotype) but this study may need to go on for 600 -700 days if these mice
die of old age rather than succumbing to BSE. Thereafter, it is considered
important to repeat the studies with mice expressing human protein of
genotypes other than the one originally chosen (which was the one considered
to be most susceptible to human prion diseases). Even if successful, as
Prof Collinge has pointed out, safety can never be proved with certainty.
But then that is true of safety in any aspect of life.=20

>What I do not understand is why it is only the brain and spinal column that

In the early days of the introduction of controls, before research results
on BSE were available, several offals were banned from entering the food
chain, based on the known organs of sheep infected by scrapie. . As research
results have accumulated since then, however, with exhaustive tests on every
kind of tissue and secretion from cattle with BSE, these have shown that
nothing carries the infective agent except brain spinal cord and, very
recently, retina. Nevertheless the wider ranging ban has been maintained to
cover the other original banned materials.

In general, speculation and deduction from speculation is the best that one
can do before one has research-based factual evidence. But when factual
evidence becomes available it supplants speculation, and gives the answers.

>The main argument against BSE agents causing CJD is the "species barrier".
>Please excuse my ignorance of this subject. There are diseases, such as
>Cowpox, which can pass from cattle to man. Since we know that the cow/human
>barrier can be passed how is it possible to say BSE cannot cross,
>particularly since we don't know exactly what the agent is ?
There is not an absolute called "_the_ species barrier". It will vary from
disease to disease, it will vary as between different animal species, and
between a given animal species and humans. Collinge's work reported above,
already indicates that, for BSE the species barrier between cattle and
humans is very much greater and harder to cross than between cattle and
mice.
That is not an "argument" but based on experimental evidence, which takes
precedence. There are, however, also "arguments" in the matter. CJD occurs
more or less uniformly throughout the world, regardless of whether BSE
exists or not in countries (on 1994 figures, the highest in Europe being in
The Netherlands (where there is no BSE) at 1.04 CJD cases per million
person-years (compared with UK 0.93 cases). UK figures for 1995 are not
yet available but it looks like being lower than 1994. Because it is such a
rare disease, the numbers are too small for reliable epidemiology. Otherwise
one might wonder why clergymen and professional drivers suffer above-average
CJD incidence. There is no evidence that butchers, abattoir workers or
veterinary surgeons (all hypothetically exposed to higher contact with BSE)
have higher than average CJD. And lifelong vegetarians have died of CJD..
