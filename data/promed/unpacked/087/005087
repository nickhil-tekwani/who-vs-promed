I would like to know what makes people believe this disease is due to
"Poisoning"? Has somebody excluded a bacterial or virological cause? What
are the symptoms and how long is the incubation time? If this were poisoning
due to pollution then it is hardly understandable why the fish should have
survived while people who are eating fish will die. Does the poisoning
occur in all the people who eat the fish, or only in fishermen and in people
who are preparing the meals?

[We regret it was not clear that the poisoning is due to potent pesticides
used by fishermen in Lake Victoria to increase their catch manyfold. New
readers should check the references given at the top of most posts for
background on the post they are reading. This is easily done by going to
the new ProMED-mail website, <http://www.promedmail.org> , & in this case
entering the words 'poisoning' & 'fish' (without the ' ') in the Search
box. - Mod.JW
