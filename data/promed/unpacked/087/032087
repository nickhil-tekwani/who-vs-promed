Pakistan: 4th Suspected Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever
Death in Quetta
---------------------------------------------------
A 4th Pakistani has died of suspected Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection in the southwestern city
of Quetta, hospital officials said. The man was admitted to hospital
in early May 2004 with 17 other patients showing symptoms of
Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever. A resident of Quetta, the
capital of Baluchistan province, he died from the disease in the
city's Fatima Jinnah Hospital on Sun 6 Jun 2004, hospital official
Mohammad Waris told Agence France Presse (AFP).

12 of the sufferers have since recovered and have been
discharged from hospital while 5 others, including 2 women, were
still in the hospital's isolation ward. 3 of them are from Quetta, one
suspected patient came from a remote town in Mastung district,
and the other was from Chaman, bordering Afghanistan, he added.

A Pakistani couple and their son from Baluchistan's Qila Saifullah
district died on 1 May 2004 after bleeding through multiple body
openings, hospital officials said. Provincial health secretary Pir Jan
Khawajakahil told AFP in May 2004 that the authorities suspected
the victims had died as a consequence of CCHFV infection and
had sent their blood samples for further tests in South Africa.

CCHF is a tick-borne virus stemming from livestock that is
transmitted into open cuts and sores. It causes massive bleeding
through the nose, mouth and ears and can lead to organ failure.
The extremely contagious disease can be passed on by contact
with the blood and other body fluids of an [infected person]. Initial
symptoms include headaches, fevers and vomiting. At least 235
cases of suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever have been
reported in Baluchistan since 2001. Hospital officials said 35 of
them proved fatal.

[Laboratory confirmation of the identity of the causative agent is
still lacking, but the diagnosis of CCHFV infection is unlikely to be
erroneous, since Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is endemic in
Baluchistan. Since the previous report from the province on 17 May
2004, the number of cases admitted to hospital with suspected
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has increased. The precise
number is unclear, as none of the reports received to date
provides cumulative totals. Similar confusion applies to the number
of deaths; earlier a 4th death was reported to have occurred on 17
May 2004 (see preceding ProMED-mail post). - Mod.CP]
