---------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it should be considered whether the vaccines given were
genuine or had any activity, rather than as an instance of vaccine
failure. There are government registered rabies vaccination centres in
India where the vaccine administered would be genuine. But vaccines
bought in a pharmacy might not be genuine or be inactive.

About 15 years ago when I was running a virology diagnostic service
in a London hospital we had a young man from London who had been
bitten by a dog he never caught at a temple in a large city in India.
He went to a government run clinic for rabies vaccination and had his
1st dose. He decided to continue his travels and bought subsequent
doses at urban pharmacies on the days he was designated to have his
course of vaccine so he completed it whilst on his travels.

He returned to London and wondered whether he might still get rabies
and whether he responded to the vaccine. The Public Health Laboratory
Service at Colindale requested a blood sample and did antibody titres
to rabies. The result was the lowest possible level of antibody where
it could be said to be positive (I can't recall exactly but about 1
unit of antibody per ml). As they regularly test post vaccination they
have a good idea of what the normal range of levels should be. The
only explanation was that the 1st dose of vaccine had raised this just
detectable level of antibody but the remaining vaccine shots he had
bought from pharmacies was inactive, the equivalent of pink water!

[We must presume that the patient has survived. It may be that the
level of antibody generated by the primary immunisation was
protective. Alternatively the dog responsible for the bite may not
have been rabid. Whatever the explanation, travellers in India should
be aware of the existence of counterfeit medicines and should seek
treatment only from government-run pharmacies. - Mod.CP]
