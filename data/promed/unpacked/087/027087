In the last week of September, just before a European Union(EU) animal
health inspection team was due to arrive in the country, the Uruguayan
government announced the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak had ended.
The official view was the decision to vaccinate the entire herd had been
a success.
It nevertheless took just over 5 months to stamp out the epidemic, since
the first outbreak was detected at Palmitas, in Soriano department, on 23
Apr 2001. The last one was in San Jose department on 20 Aug 2001, and the
country was declared free of new infections when no further new ones were
found over the next 30 days. It will take some time yet before the
country can be declared FMD-free.
There were a total of 2057 outbreaks during the epidemic, 62% of them
during May alone. It was then the decision was made to vaccinate the
country's entire herd, and from June, the number of new outbreaks began
to fall sharply.
The EU mission had declined to give Uruguayan meat the all-clear on its
last visit to the country. It was planning to visit 2 meat packing plants
and a ranch, and to inspect the documentation provided by the government,
to determine to what extent the measures recommended previously been
carried out.
The Uruguayan authorities had high hopes of being given a clean bill of
health this time, clearing the way for a resumption of boneless meat
exports to the EU. The Community's veterinary committee was due to meet
in Dublin on 9 Oct 2001 to consider the mission's report.
Measures introduced to prevent the spread of the disease, meanwhile,
remain in place. No sheep can be sent for export to the EU, for example,
if they come from a farm less than 50km away from an outbreak that
occurred less than 60 days ago.
