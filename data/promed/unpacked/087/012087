[1] Nigeria: steps to prevent Ebola virus introduction
Date: Wed 9 May 2018

The Federal Ministry of Health has stepped up surveillance at all entry points into Nigeria to prevent the spread of Ebola disease into the country, the Minister of Health, Isaac Adewole, has said. This, he said, is as a result of the Ebola outbreak reported in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The minister, while briefing State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council [FEC] meeting held at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on [Wed 9 May 2018], said the Council ordered steps be taken to keep the outbreak from Nigeria. He said the development in DRC is of great concern to the Nigerian government.

"FEC has now directed the Federal Ministry of Health to step up emergency surveillance activities at all land and airport borders, so that we can actually keep Nigerians safe," he said.

"Part of the new measures to be taken include screening passengers coming into the country. Not only that, we will be screening incoming passengers, particularly passengers from DRC and neigbouring countries. We will also ensure we step up all activities screening people coming in so that we will not be caught unawares."

Ebola has a tendency of spreading across borders through human migration if not well monitored. In 2014, the disease was imported to Nigeria through a Liberian diplomat who flew into Nigeria in an attempt to get to the US after contracting the disease in Liberia. As a result of this, 8 Nigerians died from the disease and many others were infected, majority of them health workers.

Adewole said over the last one month, DRC recorded 19 suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fever and lost 16 persons in the cases.

Explaining steps to be taken by the government, the minister said Nigeria will set up an emergency operation centre. This he said would be chaired by Joshua Obasanya, who led the Nigerian team in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea during the outbreak in 2014.

He added that the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) will also consider sending a team to DRC as part of building capacity for managing the outbreak.

"We want to assure Nigerians that the federal government is concerned about the outbreak and will do everything possible to keep the country safe," he said. ...

Kenya will commence screening of all travellers at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport [JKIA], Busia, and Malaba border points following cases of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki says the government has also installed thermal guns at the border points to detect elevated temperatures.

"Following an outbreak of Ebola in the DRC, my Ministry of Health (MoH) is now conducting routine screening of all travellers at JKIA, Busia, and Malaba border points. In these places, we have installed thermal guns to detect elevated temperatures," Kariuki said in a statement. She says her ministry has also established The National Health Emergencies Council that will act expeditiously to prevent any importation of Ebola or any other disease of public health importance.

"The ministry will this afternoon [9 May 2018] issue a formal alert to all health providers and Kenyans making them aware of the outbreak including DRC outlining the measures to take including enhanced surveillance and preparedness," she added. ...

[3] WHO: fear of virus spread
Date: Wed 9 May 2018
Source: STAT News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/09/new-ebola-outbreak-congo-raises-who-concerns/


The new Ebola outbreak on the western edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has ignited serious concern at the World Health Organization, with signs pointing to an epidemic that may have been underway for weeks or months.

Though there are only 2 confirmed cases at this point, preliminary investigations point to cases in several locations that may date back as far as early this year [2018], Dr Pierre Formenty, the WHO's top Ebola expert told STAT. There is also fear that 2 healthcare workers may be among the infected, which happens often in Ebola outbreaks and can fuel the disease's spread.

The country's ministry of health, which declared the outbreak on [Tue 8 May 2018], said then that there are at least 21 people known to have symptoms consistent with Ebola, and 17 of whom have died.

While the outbreak is in a remote area where road travel is taxing and slow, one of the towns where cases may be occurring, Bikoro, is a port on a lake that connects to the Congo and Ubangi rivers. That opens up the disturbing specter of infected individuals traveling by boat to DRC's densely populated capital, Kinshasa, or to Brazzaville, the capital of the neighboring Republic of the Congo to the south, or Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic to the north.

"If it was only the roads, we know that the roads are very bad and that it's difficult for people to travel. But if you reach Bikoro and you take a boat ... everything could happen," Formenty said in an interview on [Wed 9 May 2018].

"For us it's a worrying situation in a bad context in terms of logistics. And we need to go fast."

The population of Kinshasa is roughly 11.6 million, about 2 million people live in Brazzaville, and the population of Bangui is about 800 000.
Formenty spoke to STAT after a more than 2-hour-long conference call with organizations that will be involved in planning and executing the outbreak response.

He said a team made up of people from DRC's ministry of health, the WHO, Doctors Without Borders -- which takes the lead on running Ebola treatment units during outbreaks -- arrived in Bikoro on [Wed 9 May 2018]. Formenty will travel there this weekend [12-13 May 2018].

Over the next few days, more responders will be sent to the area to set up testing and treatment operations, plan for an expected vaccination campaign, and investigate how big the outbreak is and how far it may have spread.

Formenty said the WHO is in talks with the governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo to try to set up a system to control movement of boats on the Congo River, hoping to intercept and assess anyone who may be sick.

Although to date the number of confirmed cases is small, the signs are troubling. Formenty, a veteran of many Ebola outbreaks, noted that there have been suspected cases in at least 2 locations -- Bikoro and a village called Ingende, which is nearly 40 miles [about 64 km] away on roads that can only be traveled on motorbikes.

Among the suspected cases, there are individuals who cared for sick people, as well as people who attended funerals of suspected cases. Looking after someone sick with Ebola and taking part in traditional burial practices -- which may involve washing and touching the deceased -- are classic ways Ebola spreads through communities.

The regional hospital is in Bikoro. The WHO was informed [Wed 9 May 2018] of 4 new suspected cases there, 2 of whom are healthcare workers. "Maybe these 2 healthcare workers are just severe malaria cases, but my gut feeling says probably not," Formenty said.

Healthcare workers are at exceptionally high risk during an outbreak, especially during the early days before it's clear that Ebola is present. The WHO's expert advisers on vaccines have said in the past that they should be offered vaccination during an outbreak -- and Formenty said he expects that to happen this time.

"So the heath care workers in the catchment area of this outbreak are going also to be proposed to be vaccinated and to be part of the vaccine trial," he said.

The final decision on whether to use an experimental vaccine being developed by Merck [rVSV vectored glycoprotein (VSV-EBOV)] rests with the ministry of health. But Formenty noted that during an Ebola outbreak in the country last year [2017], officials agreed to use the vaccine. In that outbreak, transmission stopped after only 8 cases and the vaccine was not deployed. But that earlier approval should speed the process of an emergency use authorization this time, he said.

[5] DR Congo: control of outbreak
Date: Wed 9 May 2018
Source: The Atlantic [edited]
https://theatln.tc/2I1SCTD


The new [Ebola virus] outbreak has hit the town of Bikoro in the northwestern part of the country. The nearby ilkoko Iponge [Ikoko Impenge] health facility -- picture a small building with no electricity and limited supplies -- reported 21 suspected cases over the past 5 weeks. 17 have died, but it's not clear how many of these people actually had Ebola. So far, just 2 cases were actually positive for the virus in laboratory tests, out of 5 samples that were sent to the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa.

Some might wonder why lab tests are necessary. Isn't Ebola so horrific that a case would be obvious? Actually: no. Ebola's symptoms have been grossly exaggerated by 'The Hot Zone' and other popular accounts. In reality, it is often indistinguishable from more common illnesses like malaria or typhoid. Only a minority of patients hemorrhage, and most do so lightly. The virus doesn't liquefy its victims' organs, nor cause blood to gush from every orifice. When Ebola kills, it's usually through extreme dehydration.

For now, there is no reason for alarm. Despite the unprecedentedly large Ebola epidemic in West Africa, which infected 28 000 people and killed 11 000 between 2014 and 2016, most Ebola outbreaks have been small and contained affairs. Several have involved handfuls of cases. Already, experts from the World Health Organization, Doctors Without Borders [MSF], and local Congolese health institutes have traveled to Bikoro. The CDC is supporting local public health partners, and the WHO is planning to deploy more personnel and protective equipment, and has released USD 1 million from a contingency fund to help stop the outbreak.

[...]

Most of [the DRC] is smothered by inaccessible forest, with just 1700 miles [about 2736 km] of paved road. The remoteness of this terrain made it easier to control outbreaks like the most recent one, which hit the Likati health zone in 2017. It was contained within just 42 days, after just 8 suspected cases and 4 deaths. The DRC and its partners are now looking to repeat that success in Bikoro.

It could be more challenging. Unlike Likati, Bikoro lies close to the Congo River -- a major trade route -- and close to the border with the neighboring Republic of the Congo. These connections increase the risk that the outbreak will spread. Then again, it also makes it easier to mount a response.

The DRC has become very good at controlling Ebola. The INRB [National Institute of Biomedical Research] in Kinshasa is more than capable of doing diagnostic tests without having to ship samples out to the United States. Its director, Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, was the 1st scientist to encounter Ebola at a time when he was the DRC's only virologist, and has been involved in every outbreak response since. He and his colleagues have also trained a crack-team of researchers and disease detectives. "We're advanced in public health," said Gisele Mvumbi, a CDC-trained Congolese epidemiologist at the INRB, whom I met when I visited the DRC earlier this year [2017]. "If you compare us with Europe or the United States, eh, but here in Africa, we are high. We have experience."

The country excels at spotting diseases early. In the wake of the Kikwit outbreak [in 1995], scientists like Muyembe and Emile Okitolonda, who leads the Kinshasa School of Public Health, trained medical staff in all of the country's 500-plus health zones to report potential symptoms. Now, even traditional healers and pastors know to do this. "Here, we have a surveillance system that works," Okitolonda told me when I met him in the DRC. "Here, nurses know that if they see a suspected case, they report it."

[6] Ebola Makona virulence studies

[The following 2 summary reports are based on this reference: Marzi A, Chadinah S, Haddock E, et al. Recently identified mutations in the Ebola virus-Makona genome do not alter pathogenicity in animal models. Cell Rep. 2018; 23(6): 1806-16; available at https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30569-2]

https://us11.campaign-archive.com/?u=f8609630ae206654824f897b6&id=a2378b26e6


The background
--------------
Scientists have theorized that the Makona strain responsible for the massive 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak might have been more virulent -- meaning it might have become more dangerous as it infected more people -- than earlier known strains.

The study
---------
To test that theory, Feldmann's group infected some mice and macaques with the Makona strain and others with the Mayinga strain, from the 1st known Ebola epidemic in 1976.

The finding
-----------
The Makona viruses -- even those that had acquired mutations scientists worried might have made them more dangerous -- weren't more lethal than the Mayinga strain. If anything, the Mayinga strain might have been more virulent, the team found.

Early during the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, scientists speculated that the genetic diversity of the circulating Makona strain of virus (EBOV-Makona) would result in more severe disease and more transmissibility than prior strains. However, using 2 different animal models, [US] National Institutes of Health [NIH] scientists have determined that certain mutations stabilized early during the epidemic and did not alter Ebola disease presentation or outcome. Their work, published in Cell Reports [see reference above], offers further evidence to support previous findings from molecular sequencing that the diversity of EBOV-Makona did not significantly impact the course of disease.

EBOV-Makona swept through Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone from late 2013 to early 2016. Scientists from NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) compared EBOV-Makona isolates from early in the outbreak -- March 2014 -- to isolates circulating between 5 and 9 months later, when certain mutations had emerged in the viral surface glycoprotein and elsewhere. They then infected mice and rhesus macaques with these various virus isolates to assess disease progression and viral shedding.

"We were unable to find any significant differences between early and late isolates lacking or carrying those mutations, suggesting that these mutations do not lead to alterations in the disease-causing ability in animal models," the authors write.

They also compared their results from the EBOV-Makona isolates to findings from macaques infected with the original EBOV-Mayinga strain from 1976. They determined that EBOV-Makona is less virulent than EBOV-Mayinga.

No convincing finding has been published showing that EBOV-Makona bears unusual biological features explaining increased pathogenicity or transmissibility, the authors write. The NIAID group suggests intensifying studies on non-viral factors that may explain increased case numbers and fatalities. Examples include population mobility, available health care, and virus persistence in survivors -- all which may affect outbreak dynamics.

[_Zaire ebolavirus_ (ZEBOV) poses a significant threat to human health as evidenced by the 2014-2015 epidemic that originated in West Africa and the 2017 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The ZEBOV variant responsible for these epidemics (Makona) shares significant genetic similarity with previously identified variants (Kikwit and Mayinga), but published reports had suggested slower disease progression in nonhuman primates. Nonetheless, scientists have theorized that the Makona strain responsible for the massive 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak might have been more virulent. To address this question, the study described above was conducted. The investigators found no evidence of increased virulence, and instead found what had been seen earlier, that is, slower progression of disease with the Makona strain. - Mod.LK]
