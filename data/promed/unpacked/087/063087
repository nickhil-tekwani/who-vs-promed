If is reported that leptospirosis has infected more than 300 persons in
Thailand, with 22 resulting deaths. The epidemic is centered in the
northeast sector, which is described as "poor farming country". It is
uncertain why health officials appear certain that the current oubreak is
caused by rats, rather than by cattle, pigs, possums or hedgehogs. Most
victims are farmers, with a lesser number of "meat workers".
