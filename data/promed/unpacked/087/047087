On 4 Oct 2019, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) officials reported another equine case of eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) and another horse with West Nile virus (WNV).

On 23 Sep 2019, the latest horse with EEE, an unvaccinated yearling Belgian mare in St. Joseph County, began showing clinical signs, including muscle twitching and leaning against objects. She was confirmed positive on 1 Oct 2019 and is reported as recovering.

34 animal-involved EEE cases have occurred in 15 Michigan counties: Allegan, Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Genesee, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Kent, Lapeer, Livingston, Montcalm, Newaygo, St. Joseph, and Van Buren. According to an MDARD statement, mosquitoes spreading EEE remain active and were caught in traps set 1 Oct 2019 in southwest Michigan.

As of 8 Oct 2019, officials have treated more than 541 000 acres for mosquitoes in efforts to halt the spread of EEE and WNV. [Both diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes. - Mod.TG]

The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) announced a horse from Francestown has tested positive for EEE virus infection. This is the 2nd finding of EEE in a horse this year [2019]; the 1st was identified on 28 Aug 2019 in Northwood. The same mosquitoes causing disease in horses are also capable of causing disease in humans.

The arboviral risk level for Francestown will be increased to high. The arboviral risk level indicates the risk of transmission of these infections to people from mosquitoes. The surrounding towns of Bennington, Deering, Francestown, Greenfield, Lyndeborough, New Boston and Weare will increase to moderate.

"It is critical to keep using personal protective measures like insect repellent this time of year until we have a hard frost statewide," said Lisa Morris, Director, Division of Public Health Services. "We want everyone to enjoy outdoor activities while taking the appropriate steps to prevent mosquito bites possibly causing serious and potentially fatal illnesses."

EEE is one of 3 mosquito-transmitted diseases present in New Hampshire, including West Nile virus (WNV) and Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and was 1st identified in the state in August of 2004. Since 2004, there have been 15 human infections with EEE identified in NH; the last human case of EEE in NH was in 2014, when there were 3 cases. There have been no EEE infections identified yet this season in humans.

Any horse residing in or traveling to New Hampshire during mosquito season is at risk of becoming infected with EEE, WNV or JCV. Because of this risk, it is recommended horse owners consult their veterinarians regarding appropriate vaccination schedules based on their risk factors.

Signs of EEE virus usually appear 4 to 10 days after being bitten by a mosquito carrying the EEE virus. People who get sick from EEE can develop a flu-like illness, including fever, headache, weakness, and muscle and joint pains. A more serious central nervous system infection can develop such as meningitis and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). EEE typically causes a more serious disease than WNV and carries a high mortality rate for those who contract the serious encephalitic form of the illness. There is no specific treatment for the disease.

Prevention guidelines for EEE and other arboviruses can be found below. Anyone with questions about arboviruses, including EEE, can call the New Hampshire Bureau of Infectious Disease Control. Fact Sheets on eastern equine encephalitis and other arboviruses are available on the DHHS website at http://www.dhhs.nh.gov. For more information, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at http://www.cdc.gov.

Prevention Guidelines for Eastern Equine Encephalitis and West Nile Virus provided by NHHS:
1. Eliminate standing water and other mosquito breeding locations.
** In warm weather, mosquitoes can breed in any puddle that lasts more than 4 days!
** Remove old tires from your property.
** Dispose of tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots, or other containers. Don't overlook containers that have become overgrown by aquatic vegetation.
** Drill holes in the bottom of recycling containers having been left outside.
** Make sure roof gutters are clean and draining properly.
** Clean and chlorinate swimming pools and hot tubs. If not in use, keep empty and covered and keep covers free of standing water.
** Aerate garden ponds or stock them with fish.
** Turn over wheelbarrows and change water in birdbaths at least 2x weekly.
** Turn over plastic wading pools when not in use.
** Remind or help neighbors to eliminate breeding sites on their properties.

2. Be aware of where mosquitoes live and breed and keep them from entering your home.
** Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Weeds, tall grass, and bushes provide an outdoor home for adult mosquitoes, including several species commonly associated with West Nile virus and EEE virus.
** Mosquitoes can enter homes through unscreened windows or doors, or broken screens. Make sure doors and windows have tight-fitting screens. Repair or replace all screens in your home that have tears or holes.
** Resting mosquitoes can often be flushed from indoor resting sites by using sweeping motions under beds, behind bedside tables etc. and once in flight, exterminated prior to sleeping at night.

3. Protect yourself from mosquito bites.
** If outside during evening, nighttime, and dawn hours when mosquitoes are most active and likely to bite, children and adults should wear protective clothing such as long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and socks.
** Consider the use of an effective insect repellent, such as one containing 30 percent or less DEET (N,N-diethyl-methyl-meta-toluamide) for children and adults. Use DEET according to the manufacturer's directions. Children should not apply DEET to themselves. Repellents that contain Picaridin, para-menthane-diol or oil of lemon eucalyptus have also been determined to be effective.
** Vitamin B, ultrasonic devices, incense, and bug zappers have not been shown to be effective in preventing mosquito bites.

New Jersey Department of Agriculture (NJDA) officials have confirmed eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) case numbers 11 and 12 for 2019. Case number 11, a yearling filly from Burlington County with unknown vaccination status, was euthanized. Case number 12 is a 3-year-old Camden County gelding reported as having been vaccinated. His status was not reported.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes feeding on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:

** Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
** Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol). [These products are not for horses. - Mod.TG]
** Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
** Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
** Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the U.S. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2019] to vaccinate your horses.
** Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
** If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
** Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
** Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis_ israelensis [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at (some) hardware stores.

[It is a little surprising that these northern states are still experiencing mosquito-borne outbreaks of these diseases. However, cooler weather does not equal a hard freeze. Likely, it will take a hard freeze to stop the spread of disease and kill of some of the mosquitoes.

Take care of your horses with horse approved mosquito repelling spray, and vaccinate your horse. It is not to late!

However, be aware that mosquitoes have ready food source -- you and your pets -- and can reside in basements or under beds. Basements with dehumidifiers may provide a source of water or even leak small amounts of water. Check and empty these units frequently. Mosquitoes in the house may also transmit heartworms to your dogs and cats. - Mod.TG
