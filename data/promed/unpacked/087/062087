_P. vivax_ malaria in Virginia: Loudoun's Third Malaria Patient Is Recovering
------------------------------------------------
A Loudoun County teenager is being treated for malaria, and health
officials believe she likely was infected last summer at the same time 2
other county residents contracted the mosquito-borne illness. The teenager,
who was hospitalized and has responded well to medication, began suffering
from a fever and chills 12 Mar 2003, Loudoun health officials said. They
suspect that the parasite that causes malaria had remained dormant in her
body and that she was infected months ago in the same eastern Loudoun
neighborhood where 2 other teenagers likely were bitten by infected mosquitoes.

"We can't guarantee that's what we'll find, but that seems the most likely
answer," said David Goodfriend, director of the Loudoun County Health
Department. "If not, it's just an amazing coincidence that she was right at
the same spot as the other 2. All 3 were within a block of each other on
the same night."

Goodfriend said tests have confirmed that the 3 people had the same kind of
malaria -- the vivax strain. When health workers questioned the teenager,
they learned she had spent time in the same eastern Loudoun suburb where
officials believe the other 2 teenagers were infected last summer,
Goodfriend said. He said the teenager has not traveled recently and does
not recall any recent mosquito bites.

[_Plasmodium vivax_ has a dormant life stage -­ the hypnozoite -­ which
rests in the liver and activates after a variable time (often less than 12
months) and gives rise to an attack of malaria disease. It is therefore not
surprising that a person who has been at the exactly the same location at
the same time as the 2 other patients would develop an attack now. The
surprising aspect is that she was infected without having clinical malaria
at the time of infection. The case does not change the previous assessment
of the situation in Loudon: that all cases were infected at the same point
in time and space. There is no data to indicate any risk will be present
when warm weather returns this spring and summer. - Mod.EP]
