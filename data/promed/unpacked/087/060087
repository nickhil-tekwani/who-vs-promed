Virus 'triggers child diabetes'
-------------------------------
A common virus may be the trigger for the development of many cases
of diabetes, particularly in children, UK researchers have reported.
Signs of enteroviruses were found in pancreatic tissue from 60
percent of children with type 1 diabetes, but in hardly any children
without the disease. They also found that 40 percent of adults with
type 2 diabetes had signs of the infection in insulin-producing cells.

The study published in "Diabetologia" raises the possibility of a
vaccine. Although genetics is known to play a fairly substantial role
in a person's risk of developing diabetes, environmental factors must
also be involved and the idea of a viral cause of diabetes has been
considered for decades. The latest study was made possible by a
pathologist in Glasgow who for 25 years collected tissue samples from
children across the UK who had died less than 12 months after being
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Dr Alan Foulis believed that
enteroviruses -- a common family of viruses which cause symptoms such
as vomiting and diarrhoea -- would be present but until recently the
technology was not sensitive enough to detect them. Along with
colleagues from the south west-based Peninsula Medical School and the
University of Brighton, he has now been able to look for evidence of
the enteroviruses in tissue samples routinely taken during autopsy in
72 children and compare that with samples from 50 children without
the condition. In those with diabetes who had signs of the virus, it
was specifically found in the insulin-producing beta cells.

Immune trigger
--------------
The researchers suggest that, in children with a genetic
predisposition to type 1 diabetes -- an autoimmune disease in which
beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed -- enterovirus infection can
trigger the immune reaction that kicks off the disease process. With
type 2 diabetes -- the type often linked to obesity in adults -- the
researchers speculate that the infection affects the ability of the
cells to make insulin, which in combination with the greater demand
for insulin in obese people, is enough to set off the disease.

At the same time, a separate study, published in "Science", by
researchers at Cambridge University, found 4 rare mutations in a gene
which reduce the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. It also backs
the viral theory because the gene in question is involved in the
immune response to infection with enteroviruses.

There are 100 different strains of enterovirus, so although the
results open the way for the development of a vaccine, researchers
still have to pin down which types are involved. The study's author,
Professor Noel Morgan from the Peninsula Medical School, said the
results showed the underlying infection with enteroviruses was not a
"rare event." "The next stages of research -- to identify which
enteroviruses are involved, how the beta-cells are changed by
infection and the ultimate goal to develop an effective vaccine --
will lead to findings which we hope will drastically reduce the
number of people around the world who develop type 1 diabetes, and
potentially type 2 diabetes as well," he added.

Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Diabetes UK, said the study
was "a big step forward" in understanding the potential triggers for
the disease. "We've known for some time that type 1 diabetes cannot
be explained by genetics alone and that other, environmental triggers
may also play a part. "The next steps to identify the viruses and
find out what they are doing to the infected beta cells will be
hugely exciting and will take us a step closer to preventing type 1 diabetes."

Karen Addington, chief executive of the Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation, which funded the research, said the findings were important
as the incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing every year and
there is currently no way to prevent it. "Type 1 diabetes is a
life-threatening condition that requires a life-time of painful
finger prick blood testing and insulin injections," she pointed out.

[These findings have been foreshadowed by by posts in ProMED-mail
over a period of more than 10 years (see below). Unfortunately the
above account of current research does not reveal the type of
technology employed. It is premature to envisage control of type 1
diabetes by vaccination even if the presence of enteroviruses in
the pancreas is a predisposing factor. According to the 8th Report of
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (published as
'Virus Taxonomy' by Elsevier/Academic Press in 2005), the genus
_Enterovirus_ of the family _Picornaviridae_ is comprised of 5 virus
species -- _human enterovirus A, B, C, D_ and _Poliovirus_. These
virus species are composed of assemblages of many different strains
and serologically distinct viruses (for example the species _Human
enterovirus B_ includes at least 7 serologically distinct
Coxsackieviruses, 33 echoviruses, and 6 unassigned enteroviruses. Any
one or combination of these viruses could be the virus detected in
pancreatic tissue of diabetes type 1 patients. It is premature at
this stage to consider vaccination as a potential treatment for type
1 or type 2 diabetes. - Mod.CP]
