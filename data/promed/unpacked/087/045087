Data released by the directorate of health services (DHS) has revealed
that 39 [people in Goa] have tested positive for chikungunya this year
[2011]. From January to 12 Aug 2011, almost 291 people were tested for
chikungunya [virus infections], of which 39 were positive.

According to DHS officials, the outbreak of vectorborne diseases
coincides with monsoon and post-monsoon periods. "Dry spells in
between rains lead to water stagnation and an increase in the
population of mosquitoes. Precautions have to be taken to prevent such
stagnation. Personal protection to avoid mosquito bites and reporting
to the nearest health centre in case of fever are essential," said an
official.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in India, so sporadic cases and
outbreaks are not surprising.
