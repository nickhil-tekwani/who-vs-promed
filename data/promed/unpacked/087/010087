A 15-month-old boy in the capital's [Phnom Penh's] Russei Keo district has been diagnosed with H5N1 virus, bringing the number of the cases to 18 so far this year [2013], a joint statement by the World Health Organization and Cambodian Health Ministry said Wednesday [4 Sep 2013].

The boy was confirmed positive for human H5N1 avian influenza last Friday [30 Aug 2013] after he was admitted to the Kantha Bopha Hospital with fever, cough, diarrhea, sneezing, lethargy and dyspnea, the statement said.

"The boy was treated with Tamiflu, and he is in stable condition," it said.

"Investigations are being carried out by the Ministry of Health in the boy's village in order to determine whether the child came into contact with sick or dead poultry," the statement said.

Only 8 cases out of the 18 cases this year [2013] survived.

The latest death case was a 9-year-old boy from northwestern Battambang province, who died last month [August 2013].

Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians, Health Minister Mam Bunheng said.

"Children seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found," he said in the statement. "I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and make sure children wash their hands with soap and water after any contact with poultry."

Cambodia sees the worst outbreak of the virus this year [2013] since the disease was 1st identified in 2004. To date, the country has recorded 39 human cases of the virus, killing 29 people.
