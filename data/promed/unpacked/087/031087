From: Esther Fajardo <efajardo@finlay.edu.cu>

I would appreciate information about a serogroup B meningitis outbreak
occurring in New Zealand: circulating serotype, number of cases, number of
deaths, therapy used, etc.

[The New Zealand Health Online web page does indeed indicate that New
Zealand has been experiencing problems with meningitis, but no details are
offered. ProMED-mail would appreciate information responsive to Esther
Maria Fajardo's request. - Mod.ES]
