Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 106
---------------------------------
Weekly update:
--------------
As of Sun 20 Jun 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases
of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18 209 deaths.

The WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through
frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member
States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.

Situation update:
-----------------
Worldwide, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remains
low. Active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists in
parts of the tropics, particularly in the Caribbean, West Africa, and
South and Southeast Asia. Pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses
have been detected only sporadically during the early part of winter
in the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. Global
circulation of seasonal influenza virus type B viruses has declined
substantially and persists at low levels in parts of East Asia,
Central Africa, and Central America. During the past month, seasonal
influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected at low levels across parts
of East Africa and South America.

In most countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
(Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand) pandemic
and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically
during the 1st 2 weeks of June 2010 and overall levels of respiratory
disease in the population remain low. In Chile, during the 2nd week
of June, approximately 1 percent samples tested positive for
influenza (the majority were pandemic influenza virus). In Argentina,
small numbers of influenza type B viruses were detected during early
June 2010.

In both Chile and Argentina, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
continued to be the predominant circulating respiratory virus. In
South Africa, very small numbers of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses
were detected since the beginning of June 2010. In both Australia and
New Zealand, levels of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) are below
recent historical seasonal levels and there have been only sporadic
detections of seasonal or pandemic influenza virus during the 1st
half of June 2010.

In Asia, the most active areas pandemic influenza virus transmission
currently are in parts of southern India, Bangladesh, Singapore, and
Malaysia. In India, there have been recent reports of increasing
pandemic influenza activity in the southern state of Kerala,
including reports of small numbers of severe and fatal cases,
particularly among pregnant women; the extent of illness in the
community is currently being assessed. In Bangladesh, pandemic and
seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to co-circulate at low
levels during early June 2010. In Thailand, limited data suggests
that there continues to be low levels of pandemic and seasonal
influenza virus co-circulating in parts of the country.

In Singapore, during the 3rd week of June 2010, levels of ARI (acute
respiratory infections) declined below warning levels and the
proportion of patients with ILI (influenza-like illness) testing
positive for pandemic influenza virus fell from 28 percent to 19
percent. In Malaysia, limited data suggests that overall pandemic
influenza activity declined throughout June 2010 as pandemic virus
continued to circulate at low levels. Throughout East Asia, overall
pandemic and seasonal activity remained very low to sporadic. In
China and Japan, levels of ILI remained at or below baseline levels
for the summer months. Low and declining levels of seasonal influenza
type B viruses continued to circulate across China, Hong Kong SAR
(China), and Chinese Taipei.

In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and
seasonal influenza activity remained very low, except in Cuba and
Colombia, where low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue to
circulate (approximately 8 percent of respiratory samples tested
positive for pandemic influenza in both countries during the early
part of June 2010). In Cuba, pandemic influenza virus transmission
remains active but has declined substantially since peaking during
mid-April to mid-May 2010; no new fatal cases have been reported over
the past 4 reporting weeks.

In Colombia, persistent but low level circulation of pandemic
influenza virus has increased slightly since late May 2010; however,
the overall level of respiratory diseases in the population was
reported to be low to moderate during mid June 2010. In several
countries of the region, there has been recent circulation of
seasonal influenza viruses including type A (Venezuela during May
2010) and B (Bolivia during March and May 2010; El Salvador during
late May and early June 2010). Variable ongoing co-circulation of
other respiratory viruses, including RSV, continues to be reported
across the region.

In sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has
been limited to several countries. Ghana, in West Africa, continued
to have active circulation of pandemic influenza virus long after
overall activity peaked during early April 2010; the proportion of
respiratory samples testing positive for pandemic influenza virus
increased from 16 percent to 23 percent during the 1st 2 weeks of
June 2010. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in
parts of central and southern Africa, most notably in Cameroon.

As reported in previous updates, small numbers of seasonal H3N2
viruses continue to be detected across Africa, particularly in
eastern Africa; the most recent detections have been reported in
Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa during the 2nd week of June 2010. The
persistence of H3N2 in this area over time very likely represents
sustained community transmission of the virus.

Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere (North
America and Europe), pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have
been detected sporadically or at very low levels during the past month.
