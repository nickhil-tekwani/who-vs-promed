A total of 3 game operations are under quarantine in Saskatchewan because
of chronic wasting disease [CWD]. One is a white-tailed deer operation
north of Moose Jaw, while the other 2 are hunt operations in Prince Albert.
Chronic wasting disease is a fatal neurological disorder that causes brain
lesions in deer and elk. Dr Cornelius Kylie of the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency confirms that the animals at the quarantined facilities will be
destroyed.

The affliction is similar to mad cow disease in cattle, and infected
animals rapidly lose weight and act strangely before death. Although the
exact cause of the disease is unknown, the agency says it is associated
with the presence of an abnormal protein called a prion.

In Alberta, the government has conducted periodic culls to control the
disease in wild deer populations. There is no treatment or vaccine
currently available for the disease, and there is no scientific evidence to
suggest the disease affects humans.

depopulation or if they are under quarantine until tracing is completed. It
is to be hoped that someone in Canada will provide us with information on
the length/purpose of the quarantine. - Mod.TG

An Indiana hunter will be allowed to keep the head mount of a deer he
killed in Wyoming that tested positive for chronic wasting disease.

The unidentified hunter knew about the CWD risk and submitted a portion of
the animal to the Wyoming Game and Fish Department for testing before
having the meat deboned for transport home. After the animal tested
positive for CWD, Wyoming officials contacted the hunter and the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.

Indiana DNR officials disposed of the meat, but the hunter was allowed to
keep the mount, according to Dr Jennifer Strasser, a veterinarian with the
Indiana Board of Animal Health and a state conservation officer. "As long
as the skull cap and cape are cleaned properly, the hunter can safely keep
the mount," she said. The Indiana DNR (Department of Natural Resources) has
tight restrictions on transporting deer, elk, and other cervids into the
state. For information go to <http://www.in.gov/dnr/deerhealth/cwd.htm>.

[The article does not tell us if the head and cape were cleaned by the
hunter or by a professional taxidermist. Neither does the article indicate
how this was verified, or if it was verified. If it were done by a
taxidermist then one must wonder where the taxidermist is located, in
Wyoming or Indiana, or some other state. In the past Indiana had no
regulations regarding disposal of offal associated with a head mount and
Indiana DNR had no way to track such either. Unless something has changed,
the Indiana DNR did not have a complete list of taxidermists within the
state. Without such a list or regulation of how the offal for a head/cape
mount are to be disposed of it is possible that CWD could have been allowed
to enter the state. - Mod.TG
