Swine flu infection at Kitchener turkey operation
-------------------------------------------------
Radio 570 News has learned through several reports that there is a
swine flu infection at Hybrid Turkeys in Kitchener. The province will
not name the operation.

Ontario Chief Veterinarian, Dr. Deb Stark, told an afternoon news
conference they have a very willing operator that has come forward,
and the province is going to respect the request to keep the name
confidential. Dr. Stark says they 1st became aware of the situation
on Friday [16 Oct 2009].

Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Arlene King, says the
risk to human health is minimal, adding there is no risk to food
safety. She says no birds or eggs from the farm have entered the food chain.

Last April [2009], swine flu appeared in pigs on an Alberta farm and
has since been found in other swine herds in the country.

Chile has confirmed cases of swine flu in turkeys as well.

Turkeys catch swine flu at Ontario farm
---------------------------------------
The Ontario government is investigating an outbreak of H1N1 influenza
at a turkey farm. The birds have been infected by the H1N1 virus but
there has been no transmission to humans, a source confirms. Cooking
destroys the virus, so no one is at risk from consuming turkey, the
source says.

The Chief Veterinarian for Ontario, Dr. Deb Stark, and Chief Medical
Officer of Health, Dr. Arlene King, are holding a news conference on
the issue on Tuesday [20 Oct 2009]. [Thus far, aside from the 1st
article there is no real news different than what is contained in
these 2 news releases. - Mod.TG]

[The real questions here are: How did the turkeys acquire the
disease? Were infected humans responsible for transmitting the virus
to the birds, as has happened at the swine farms? Or has a different
mechanism of transmission been identified? While we respect the
Ontario officials protecting the name of producers, we would
appreciate more insight into the method of transmission to the birds.

As the 1st article in the series indicates, Chile has previously
identified H1N1 in turkeys. - Mod.TG]
