Viet Nam: 1st new human case of avian influenza in 4 weeks; Cambodian women
H5N1-negative so far
-----------------------------------------------
A 52-year-old Vietnamese man who ate chicken that had died of a disease has
been infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus, the country's 1st human
case in a month, a health official said on Mon 16 May 2005. The man from
the northern province of Vinh Phuc was hospitalized with a fever last
Thursday [12 May 2005] after eating the chicken with his family, a
provincial medical official told Reuters by telephone. "We have taken blood
and saliva samples of 4 family members for avian influenza virus tests, and
those of the man have been confirmed positive," he said. 3 family members
are under surveillance, and the area surrounding their home in Vinh Phuc,
63 km (39 miles) northeast of Hanoi, was disinfected, the official said.
Viet Nam's last human H5N1 case was in early April 2005, and no new
outbreaks among poultry have been reported for nearly a month. The virus
has killed 52 people in Asia since 2003, 36 in Viet Nam, 12 in Thailand and
4 in Cambodia.
Vietnamese doctors treating a 20-year-old Cambodian woman said on Monday
[16 May 2005] that her condition had worsened since she had been
transferred to a Vietnamese hospital from Cambodia's Kampot province last
Wednesday [11 May 2005]. She has been on a respirator, they said. A
researcher at the Ho Chi Minh City-based Pasteur Institute said preliminary
tests on the Cambodian woman showed she was not infected by the virus, but
more tests were being conducted. The woman is from the same area where 4
Cambodians died earlier this year [2005] from bird flu.

[The report that the deceased Vietnamese man had eaten diseased chicken
prior to his death sits uneasily with the later statement that there have
been no new outbreaks among poultry reported in Viet Nam for nearly a
month. Human-to-human transmission seems an unlikely source for the virus
responsible for his death, since the members of his family have tested
negative for avian influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP]
