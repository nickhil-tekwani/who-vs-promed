Thailand: embargo on ice production after hepatitis outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health today [Wed 25 May 2005] announced
strict control measures for ice factories, following a major outbreak
of hepatitis A in Thailand's northern provinces of Lampang and Chiang
Rai, which health officials have traced to contaminated ice.
Speaking in response to the hepatitis outbreak, which has already
infected 906 people, the Permanent Secretary for Public Health, Dr.
Vichai Tienthavorn, said that initial inspections pointed to an ice
factory in Chiang Rai Province which drew its water from local
artesian wells. Samples taken from the water show it to be
contaminated with coliform bacteria, indicating fecal contamination.
The 1st victims of the hepatitis outbreak were discovered on 7 Apr
[2005] in Lampang's Wieng Pa Pao district, and the number of cases
surged during the 1st 2 weeks of May [2005]. There are now 906 people
being treated for the disease, of whom 11 are in Chiang Rai's Mae
Saruay district, 531 in Wieng Pa Pao and 264 in Wang Neua.
Local hospitals are still seeing a steady trickle of 10-50 patients a
day, although doctors have stressed that none of the cases are
serious. Hepatitis A, spread through the consumption of contaminated
food or water, causes jaundice for a couple of weeks, but normally
clears up of its own accord.
Dr. Vichai urged members of the public to avoid the disease by
ensuring that they paid attention to food hygiene, while also
announcing controls on ice production factories. Mobile medical teams
are now going around the northern provinces to take blood samples
from anyone thought to be at risk from the virus.

[Hepatitis A virus, a picornavirus, is a very stable virus resistant
to temperatures of 60 C and beyond and to low pH. Hence, hepatitis A
virus would be able to survive indefinitely in frozen or semi-frozen
water. Iced water and ice cubes are frequently contaminated with
potentially pathogenic viruses and microorganisms where there are
lapses in hygiene, or where a contaminated water source is used in
their preparation. Where there is fecal contamination of water
supplies, the concentration of hepatitis A virus can be high, because
the virus replicates in the liver and is released into the
environment in abundance via bile fluid. The consequences can be
serious, as in this incident in Thailand, wherever ice is
manufactured from a source of water subject to fecal contamination.
Fortunately, jaundice caused by hepatitis A virus is a self-limiting
disease, and there are rarely any serious consequences of infection
and no persistence of the virus. There is a good vaccine, and
outbreaks can be contained by vaccination. Immersion of ice in a good
whisky would probably account for most contaminating microorganisms,
but, unfortunately, probably not hepatitis A virus. - Mod.CP]
