Tempe takes steps against 'fever' mosquito
--------------------
A mosquito that spreads the non-lethal but debilitating dengue fever
and sometimes even the deadly yellow fever appears to have made it to
a second Tempe neighborhood. The mosquito's appearance marks the first
time the species has been identified this far north. Until now, the
mosquito was found only as far north as Tucson. It is common in
Central and South America.
"It could be that it already has a good foothold in the Valley," said
Craig Levy, vector-control manager for the Arizona Department of
Health Services.
Maricopa County health officials caught the mosquito, known as _Aedes
aegypti_, in traps near Ninth Street and Ash Avenue. That's a couple
[of miles away from where an entomologist first spotted the "ankle
biters" near Southern and Rural roads and contacted health officials.
