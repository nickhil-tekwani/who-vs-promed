California officials say more horses have contracted a potentially
fatal virus which cancelled horse shows around the country in May
[2011].

The state Department of Food and Agriculture said Wednesday [21 Sep
2011] that several horses in Tuolumne, San Joaquin, and Sonoma
counties contracted equine herpesvirus in the past few weeks.

There are currently 22 confirmed cases of the disease in 12 different
counties. 2 of the horses either died or were euthanized, and the rest
have been placed under quarantine.

The outbreak was traced to a horse show in Utah.

Equine herpes can lead to respiratory illness, neurological problems,
paralysis, and miscarriage. There is no vaccine.

The virus cannot be transmitted to humans, but is transmitted among
horses by air or by sharing feed, brushes, bits, and other equipment.

[This is suspicious that it is a continuation of the situation that
arose from the cutting horse show in Utah. While the article mentions
a horse show, it may be something different than the cutting horse
show earlier this year (2010). - Mod.TG]
