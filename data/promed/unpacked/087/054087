[2] Virus-vector relationships
Date: Wed 13 Aug 2014
Source: Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences [posted ahead of print] 7 Oct 2014 vol. 281 no. 1792

Karima Zouache, Albin Fontaine, Anubis Vega-Rua,Laurence Mousson, Jean-Michel Thiberge, Ricardo Lourenco-De-Oliveira, Valerie Caro, Louis Lambrechts, Anna-Bella Failloux. Three-way interactions between mosquito population, viral strain and temperature underlying chikungunya virus transmission potential.

Abstract
--------
Interactions between pathogens and their insect vectors in nature are under the control of both genetic and non-genetic factors, yet most studies on mosquito vector competence for human pathogens are conducted in laboratory systems that do not consider genetic and/or environmental variability. Evaluating the risk of emergence of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of public health importance such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV) requires a more realistic appraisal of genetic and environmental contributions to vector competence. In particular, sources of variation do not necessarily act independently and may combine in the form of interactions. Here, we measured CHIKV transmission potential by the mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in all combinations of 6 worldwide vector populations, 2 virus strains and 2 ambient temperatures (20 C and 28 C). Overall, CHIKV transmission potential by _Ae. albopictus_ strongly depended on the 3-way combination of mosquito population, virus strain and temperature. Such genotype-by-genotype-by-environment (G x G x E) interactions question the relevance of vector competence studies conducted with a simpler set of conditions. Our results highlight the need to account for the complex interplay between vectors, pathogens and environmental factors to accurately assess the potential of vector-borne diseases to emerge.

[If laboratory studies are to provide vector competence data relevant to field conditions, the above report makes a strong case for including the 3 factors that they cited. However, that presumes that we know the range of environmental conditions (microclimate temperature ranges) where the vectors live in nature throughout their extrinsic incubations periods. These are not likely to be constant, nonfluctuating temperatures usually employed in laboratory experiments. - Mod.TY]
