South Korea has culled over 6 percent of poultry in the country to curb a bird flu outbreak that has hit farms and migratory birds nationwide, government officials said on Friday [14 Mar 2014].

That brings the total number of farm birds slaughtered to 10.16 million, close to a record 10.2 million during an outbreak in 2008, according to data from the agriculture ministry.

No human infection has been reported, but a dog tested positive for bird flu antibodies, suggesting it had been exposed to the disease without being infected, the ministry said in a statement.

Asia's 4th-largest economy has had 4 bird flu outbreaks in the past 10 years, without any cases of human infection reported.

Sales of chicken in one of Seoul's largest markets dropped by more than half on average last month [February 2014] in the wake of the latest outbreak, according to a ministry official. No nationwide data is available.

South Korea's 1st case of H5N8 bird flu -- different from the strain that has caused human deaths elsewhere in Asia -- was found on 17 Jan 2014 at a duck farm in North Jeolla province, around 300 km (186 miles) southwest of Seoul.

Some 28 poultry farms across the nation have been hit by the disease, the ministry said.

South Korea has been stepping up disinfection measures for migratory birds, the suspected source of the present outbreak, at 37 sites across the country. It also curbed the movement of some livestock workers in affected areas.

China has seen a wave of human H7N9 bird flu cases and deaths in 2014.

[2] H5 seropositive dog

Authorities have confirmed that a dog at a farm in Korea's Chungcheongnam-do province has been infected with the H5N8 strain of avian influenza [AI].

Korea's agriculture ministry said Friday [14 Mar 2014] that the dog had tested positive for having antibodies against the H5 strain, meaning its immune system is battling the virus.

It's the 1st time in Korea that a mammal has come down with the AI virus. Authorities say the dog became infected after eating an infected chicken at the farm. Prior to this case, it was believed that the [H5N8] AI virus could only be transmitted among the same species.

"More studies need to be conducted on the possible effects of the H5N8 strain virus on mammals. There is no explanation yet as to why the dog was infected."

It's raising concerns that humans could be susceptible to the H5N8 strain, but health authorities say that's very unlikely, although the farm's workers are being tested.

All the poultry at the farm have already been culled.

A fresh strain of the avian influenza virus broke out in mid-January [2014] at a duck farm in Jeollanam-do Province, and more than 70 cases of the virus have been confirmed since.

Ref: Lee YJ, Kang HM, Lee EK, Song BM, Jeong J, Kwon YK, et al. (2014). Novel reassortant influenza A(H5N8) viruses, South Korea, 2014 [letter].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 16 Jan 2014, clinical signs of HPAI, such as decreased egg production (60 percent) and slightly increased mortality rates, were detected in ducks on a breeder duck farm near the Donglim Reservoir in Jeonbuk Province, South Korea. On 17 Jan 2014, a farmer (5 km [about 3 miles] from the Donglim Reservoir) also reported clinical signs of HPAI in breeder ducks. In addition, 100 carcasses of Baikal teals were found in the Donglim Reservoir.

RNAs extracted from organs (liver, pancreas, and trachea) of dead Baikal teals were positive for H5 subtype virus by reverse transcription PCR. We isolated viruses from suspected specimens by inoculation into embryonated specific pathogen-free chicken eggs. The H5N8 subtype was identified by using HA and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays.

Three viruses isolated from domestic ducks and wild birds were designated:
1. A/breeder duck/Korea/Gochang1/2014 (H5N8) ("Gochang1"),
2. A/duck/Korea/Buan2/2014 (H5N8) ("Buan2"), and
3. A/Baikal Teal/Korea/Donglim3/2014 (H5N8) ("Donglim3").

[Summary]: We characterized 3 distinct novel reassortant influenza A(H5N8) HPAI viruses during an influenza outbreak in South Korea. "Buan2" and "Donglim3" viruses showed high nucleotide identities, which suggested that the outbreak viruses in domestic ducks and Baikal teals might have an identical origin. Although research on the epidemiologic features of this outbreak is currently underway, it seems likely that on the basis of reassortant sequence features of the 8 genome segments, these 2 distinct viruses originated in eastern China. These influenza viruses are a potential threat to the poultry population in South Korea, including gallinaceous birds in live bird markets, or during movement of domestic ducks from one farm to another.

[According to South Korea's reports to the OIE, the H5N8 epizootic started 6 Jan 2014. As of 4 Mar 2014, 26 outbreaks, spread throughout the country in duck and chicken farms, have been reported. The mortality in chickens is much higher than in ducks. A summary and an interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14668.

The most recent follow-up report, No. 4, submitted 4 Mar 2014 (http://tinyurl.com/o6atum3) included the following epidemiological comments: "The H5N8 subtype of viruses have a series of basic amino acid at the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site such as LREKRRKR/GLF or LRERRRKR/GLF, which means highly pathogenic to chickens. The intravenous pathogenic index was 3.0, which means highly pathogenic to chickens. Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (QIA) injected intravenously 0.1ml of the 1/10 diluted virus into each of ten 6-week-old SPF chickens. All birds were died within 24 hours. QIA submitted the genetic information to GenBank and submitted manuscript to scientific society (Emerging Infectious Disease, MS#EID-14-0233) about the brief situation of outbreaks and the genetic information on 27 Jan 2014."

The mentioned viral genotyping results are covered in item [3] above, informing the identification in South Korea of 3 novel reassortant influenza A(H5N8) HPAI viruses, 2 from domestic ducks and one from wild teals. The teal-origin isolate and one of the 2 duck-origin isolates are closely related. The origin of the 2 distinct viruses is suspected to be eastern China.

The recent discovery of an H5 seropositive dog deserves attention. Official confirmation and completion of the test for the neurominidase identity are anticipated. So far, there is no indication of human infection; information on the number of serological tests applied in contact humans (apparently negative) will be helpful. - Mod.AS
