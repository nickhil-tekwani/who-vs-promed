The White House bet on Abbott's rapid tests. It didn't work out. Federal officials relied too heavily on the tests, then took the results for granted, experts say. After months of crowded events and often maskless encounters, a growing number of top government officials, including President Trump, and their close contacts have tested positive for the coronavirus.

The fault for the outbreak lies in no small part with an ill-conceived disease-prevention strategy at the White House, health experts said: From the early days of the pandemic, federal officials have relied too heavily on one company's rapid tests, with little or no mechanism to identify and contain cases that fell through the diagnostic cracks. "It seems the White House put all their eggs in one basket: testing," said Dr Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine physician at Brown University. "But there is no single strategy, no single thing we can do to be safe. It has to be multimodal."

Other health experts noted that the tests deployed by the White House, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, were given emergency clearance by the Food and Drug Administration only for people "within the 1st 7 days of the onset of symptoms." But they were used incorrectly, to screen people who were not showing any signs of illness. Such off-label use, experts said, further compromised a strategy that presumably was designed to keep leading officials safe from a pandemic that so far has killed more than 210 000 Americans.

"It's not being used for the intended purpose," said Syra Madad, an infectious disease epidemiologist based in New York. "So, there will be potentially a lot of false negatives and false positives." Abbott's rapid coronavirus tests, called the ID NOW and BinaxNOW, are speedy, portable, and easy to operate, delivering results in minutes. But the convenience comes at a cost: The products are less accurate than laboratory tests that use a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, and they more frequently miss infections or mistakenly designate healthy people as infected, as happened to governor Mike DeWine of Ohio in August [2020].

Nonetheless, shortly after Abbott's ID NOW test received emergency approval from the FDA in the spring [2020], the White House adopted it as a rapid screening tool for staff members and visitors who came into close contact with the president. Sometime around the end of August or early September [2020], the White House switched to using the BinaxNOW -- a similarly quick test that hunts for bits of coronavirus protein rather than viral RNA -- according to a senior administration official.

Federal officials recently purchased the BinaxNOW to distribute by the millions to governors and vulnerable communities around the country. Rapid tests have been hailed by some experts as a welcome solution to the lengthy delays that have plagued expensive laboratory tests, although the products come with problems of their own.

People without COVID-19 symptoms have been among those taking the test on White House grounds, where individuals who received negative results were granted swift access to the president and his advisers. Dr Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), described these procedures as a misguided attempt at a "zero-fail testing protocol" in an interview on CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday [4 Oct 2020], saying that officials "weren't taking any precautions beyond testing people who are going to be in contact with the president."

However, according to the products' packaging, both Abbott rapid tests are intended for people with COVID-19 symptoms, early on in their illness. When Abbott submitted the tests for emergency authorization from the FDA, the company provided data only for people with symptoms. When used appropriately, the company has said, both tests perform about 95 per cent as well as PCR. But how well the products do in asymptomatic individuals remains murky.

On Saturday evening [3 Oct 2020], Andrea Wainer, Abbott's executive vice president of rapid and molecular diagnostics, emailed a document entitled "Perspectives on testing" to several public health experts, including Dr Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, containing preliminary results outlining the ID NOW's performance in people without symptoms. Among an unspecified number of individuals, the test picked up about 88 per cent of the infections found by laboratory PCR tests, the company statement said. Numbers were not reported for the BinaxNOW.

"By studying the test in the asymptomatic people, Abbott knows it works in that population," the document said. "It can't say that for itself, because the test isn't approved for that, but that data has been shared with others and the FDA too." In response to queries about the document, Ms Ross said the data had been collected from "a few dozen individuals".

Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California, noted that tests like the ID NOW have produced lacklustre results in the hands of other researchers, missing 25 per cent or more infections in people with symptoms. Even [fewer] data are available on the BinaxNOW, reportedly the principal test now used in the White House and a product that Adm Brett Giroir, the senior official leading the administration's testing effort, recently touted for off-label use on Twitter. The post provoked confusion and ire from health experts and members of the public. "No, no, no," said Dr Butler-Wu, who recalled her dismay on seeing the tweet. "You can't just take a product and off-label it and assume it's happy days."

Still, experts said, fault for the outbreak at the White House lay with officials who blindly trusted that testing alone could act as an impervious filter to the coronavirus. Even if Abbott's tests had performed as well as advertised on everyone, regardless of symptoms, "it's statistically impossible it wouldn't have missed some infections," Dr Butler-Wu said. "And clearly, it did."

White House officials have repeatedly declined to provide specific details about the testing procedures for staff members and visitors, sparking frustration among experts trying to assess the situation. "There should be a very clear protocol that everyone could recite," said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. Especially ambiguous, Dr Nuzzo added, was how often people in the White House were taking tests, and under what circumstances, especially those who might not qualify as "close contacts" of the president. Any slip-ups could create ample opportunity for the coronavirus to hop into a new host.

On Monday [5 Oct 2020], Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, announced that she had tested positive and would isolate herself. Ms McEnany, who had been in close contact with several White House staff members who have since tested positive, had tested negative "every day since Thursday [1 Oct 2020]," she said. But she was likely infectious for several days before her positive result, including on Sunday [4 Sep 2020], experts said, when she spoke briefly without a mask to reporters outside the White House. These and other encounters illustrated to Dr Madad that officials were treating negative results as a free pass to eschew masks and to mingle, regardless of exposure history. "That's absolutely incorrect," Dr Madad said.

Exposure to an infected person should be reason enough to quarantine for 14 days, according to the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A negative test result might simply be failing to pick up on low amounts of the coronavirus as the pathogen slowly accumulates in the body. Symptoms can take up to 2 weeks after an exposure to appear, if symptoms appear at all. And levels of the virus, which might correlate with contagiousness, can often be at their highest right before an infected person starts feeling ill.

Even people who remain asymptomatic throughout the duration of their infection are known to harbor the virus in abundance, and appear to be responsible for a large proportion of transmission events. "The guidelines have been very clear," Dr Madad said. "Even if you have a negative test, you quarantine if you've been exposed." White House officials, however, seem to have been emboldened by the false sense of security imbued by negative results, even though they represent only a snapshot in time.

To Dr Jha, the White House's unfolding outbreak was no surprise. "It's remarkable that it hasn't happened until now," he said. Pinning the protection strategy entirely on testing, while disregarding masks and physical distancing, he added, "shows they fundamentally don't understand a negative test, and how infectious disease works."

[The false sense of security that comes with a single negative test result discussed above seems pervasive. The problem with this attitude was raised in the comment on "[1] Rapid antigen POC (point of care) testing" in ProMED-mail. COVID-19 update (426): rapid POC tests, older adult vaccine, WHO, global 20201005.7836586. Although the original article in that post was a review of lateral flow POC antigen testing, and the Abbott ID Now test is a POC PCR-based assay, the take home message is the same, even when the assay has increased sensitivity as does PCR. That is, a negative test result only indicates there is less RNA or antigen present, depending on the specific assay, than the detection limit of the assay, and may or may not be 0, or truly negative. Furthermore, it is only negative for that point in time and could be positive the following day. Therefore, as discussed in that earlier post and similarly discussed above, in addition to testing, protective measures must include masks and physical distancing. The antigen assays are less sensitive than detection of RNA using RT-PCR, that is, they have a higher threshold of detection or the amount of antigen present presumably must be greater for detection to occur than if one tested by RT-PCR. While the benefit of this is that the POC antigen assay is more likely to detect only those individuals who are infectious [see Michael Mina tweets; https://twitter.com/michaelmina_lab], it also is more likely to miss more lightly infected individuals at early timepoints after infection. This is even greater support for the need for masks and physical distancing. The Abbott ID Now test has apparently been replaced by the White House by the Abbott Binex Now test, the latter being a lateral flow antigen assay, similar to the ones evaluated in the ProMED post referred to above. While the lateral flow tests are simple to use with no equipment needed, they may be less sensitive than the Abbott ID Now and lead to more "negative" results and consequently even more false confidence. Wear masks!

CDC updates "How COVID is spread" webpage

Today [5 Oct 2020], CDC issued updated guidance to its How COVID-19 Spreads website, which includes information about the potential for airborne spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

CDC continues to believe, based on current science, that people are more likely to become infected the longer and closer they are to a person with COVID-19. Today's update acknowledges the existence of some published reports showing limited, uncommon circumstances where people with COVID-19 infected others who were more than 6 feet [2 m] away or shortly after the COVID-19-positive person left an area. In these instances, transmission occurred in poorly ventilated and enclosed spaces that often involved activities that caused heavier breathing, like singing or exercise. Such environments and activities may contribute to the build-up of virus-carrying particles.

CDC's recommendations remain the same based on existing science and after a thorough technical review of the guidance.

People can protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19 by staying at least 6 feet [2 m] away from others, wearing a mask that covers their nose and mouth, washing their hands frequently, cleaning touched surfaces often, and staying home when sick.

Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Community mitigation measures can help slow the spread of COVID-19.

What is added by this report?
The number of COVID-19 cases in Arizona stabilized and then decreased after sustained implementation and enforcement of statewide and locally enhanced mitigation measures, beginning approximately 2 weeks after implementation and enforcement of mask mandates and enhanced sanitations practices began on [17 Jun 2020]; further decreases were observed during [13 Jul 2020-7 Aug 2020], after statewide limitations and closures of certain services and businesses.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Widespread implementation and enforcement of sustained community mitigation measures, including mask wearing, informed by state and local officials' continual data monitoring and collaboration can help prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the numbers of COVID-19 cases.

Mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), requires individual, community, and state public health actions to prevent person-to-person transmission. Community mitigation measures can help slow the spread of COVID-19; these measures include wearing masks, social distancing, reducing the number and size of large gatherings, pausing operation of businesses where maintaining social distancing is challenging, working from or staying at home, and implementing certain workplace and educational institution controls (1-4). The average number of daily cases increased approximately 151%, from 808 on [1 Jun 2020] to 2026 on [15 Jun 2020] (after stay-at-home order lifted), necessitating increased preventive measures. On [17 Jun 2020], local officials began implementing and enforcing mask wearing (via county and city mandates), affecting approximately 85% of the state population. Statewide mitigation measures included limitation of public events; closures of bars, gyms, movie theaters, and water parks; reduced restaurant dine-in capacity; and voluntary resident action to stay at home and wear masks (when and where not mandated). The number of COVID-19 cases in Arizona peaked during [29 Jun-2 Jul 2020], stabilized during [3-12 Jul 2020], and further declined by approximately 75% during [13 Jul-7 Aug 2020]. Widespread implementation and enforcement of sustained community mitigation measures informed by state and local officials' continual data monitoring and collaboration can help prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the numbers of COVID-19 cases.

On [11 Mar 2020], Arizona declared a public health state of emergency to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Additional guidance was provided to local officials, businesses, communities, and individual persons to implement social distancing and close schools statewide ([15 Mar 2020]); postpone and limit large gatherings to fewer than 50 persons; recommend telework options; restrict access to congregate settings; require restaurants to provide dine-out options only; and close all bars, gyms, and movie theaters in counties with confirmed COVID-19 cases ([19 Mar 2020]) (Table). Based on Arizona data and CDC guidance (1,2), ADHS [Arizona Department of Health Services] also recommended limiting persons' time away from their place of residence except for essential activities (that is, stay-at-home order, "Stay Home, Stay Healthy, Stay Connected") ([31 Mar 2020]).

During [1 Apr 2020-15 May 2020], the 7-day moving average of daily cases ranged from 154 to 443 (Figure). During [29 Apr 2020-11 May 2020], Arizona initiated a phased approach for retail shops and stores, cosmetologists, and barbers to reopen and operate, and for restaurants to resume dine-in services; the stay-at-home order ended [15 May 2020].

Average daily cases increased 151% from [1 Jun 2020] (808) to [15 Jun 2020] (2026), necessitating an increased focus on preventive measures by businesses, communities, and individual persons. Updated guidance from state officials provided local governments the authority to implement mask policies ([17 Jun 2020]) and enforcement measures tailored to local public health needs (local policies were applicable to approximately 85% of the total Arizona population). Arizona limited organized public events to fewer than 50 persons (with some exceptions); closed bars, gyms, movie theaters, and water parks and recreational tubing facilities ([29 Jun 2020]); and limited restaurants' indoor dining to less than 50% capacity, with at least 6 feet [2 m] of separation between patrons ([9 Jul 2020]). The 7-day moving average of daily cases peaked during [29 Jun 2020-2 Jul 2020] (range = 4148-4377), stabilized during [3-12 Jul 2020] (range = 3609-4160), and subsequently decreased 75% from [13 Jul 2020] (3506) to [7 Aug 2020] (867). Mitigation measures put in place in June [2020] were extended through August [2020] to further limit transmission.

Quantitative data on the effectiveness of community mitigation measures at suppressing the spread of COVID-19 are limited. The primary goal of implementing widespread enhanced mitigation measures in Arizona was to protect and save lives and maintain capacity in the health care system. A combination of voluntary and enforceable measures is more effective than any single measure (6). Mitigation measures mandated through public policy can effectively increase social distancing (7), and wearing masks has prevented transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (8).

Enhanced mitigation measures should be implemented by communities and persons to slow COVID-19 spread, particularly before a vaccine or therapeutic treatment becomes widely available. State, local, and tribal officials are best positioned to continually monitor data and collaborate to determine the level and types of enhanced mitigation required. Mitigation measures, including mask mandates, that are implemented and enforced statewide appear to have been effective in decreasing the spread of COVID-19 in Arizona.

[This article seemed to follow naturally from the previous section [2], supporting the implementation of mitigation measures aimed at mask usage, social distancing, and avoiding crowds -- basically avoiding the 3 Cs. What is sad is that when restrictions are lifted, transmission climbs again, not unrelated to people mistaking the success of the measures as having eliminated the threat of the virus and dropping all mitigation measures that should be focused on avoiding the 3 Cs, and use of masks.- Mod.MPP]
