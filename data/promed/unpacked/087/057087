Suspected encephalitis has struck again in Bihar, claiming the lives of 15 children belonging to poor families.

In the past 24 hours, the mystery disease has killed 2 children -- a 6-year-old boy and a one-and-a-half-year-old girl -- in Muzaffarpur, a north Bihar district currently affected by severe floods. Both the victims belong to poor families.

Doctors said the victim identified as [BK] was admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur with high fever on Tuesday [10 Aug 2021], but he collapsed on Friday [13 Aug 2021] despite all efforts by them.

"He was brought in a critical condition after which we provided him with all medical support. Unfortunately, we failed to save him," the hospital's paediatric department's head Dr Gopal Shankar Sahani said on Saturday [14 Aug 2021].

The other victim, a girl identified as [KK], too was suffering from high fever, and her condition remained critical when admitted to the hospital. "Her test report confirmed she was infected with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES)," the doctor said.

According to doctors, a total of 60 cases of suspected encephalitis were reported to this hospital so far this year [2021]. Most of the cases were reported from 6 north Bihar districts, such as Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, East and West Champaran, Vaishali, and Sheohar. All of them are flood-prone districts that face annual flood devastation with the houses of the villagers remaining flooded for weeks.

A health bulletin released by the Muzaffarpur district administration said it had launched massive efforts to check this disease, yet it continues to target children. The 1st case was reported in February this year [2021].

However, compared to previous years, there has been a drop in the number of cases and deaths. Last year [2020], the state reported 7 deaths and 57 cases. In 2019, the total deaths were recorded at 164, whereas the total cases remained at 653.

Officials cite various measures behind the drop in cases of suspected encephalitis. According to them, they have been launching various preventive measures to check this disease. Under part of these measures, all children up to the age of 5 years are being provided nutritious meals, and the villagers are being told not to allow their children to go to bed without having a meal in the evening.

Apart from these, vulnerable families are being provided free ration and concrete houses with toilet facilities to protect children from deadly disease. Also, massive awareness campaigns are being launched in villages.

[Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is mentioned as the diagnosis, but Japanese encephalitis (JE) is not. JE virus is endemic in northeastern India, and cases occur there annually. Although there are fewer cases of AES and JE in Bihar state this year [2021] than in previous years, these cases continue to occur in that state.

As mentioned in many previous ProMED posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis (JE), enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and intoxication from lychee fruit consumption. Previous cases mentioned hypoglycemia. Dr T Jacob John noted that hypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption, and Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, East Champaran, and Sitamarhi are litchi-growing districts in Bihar. These 4 are non-Japanese encephalitis districts (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20200831.7730992 and Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) corr, comment 20200902.7740196). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Interestingly, the above report mentions that various preventive measures have been initiated without stating what those measures are, other than advising that children should not go to bed with empty stomachs. - Mod.TY
