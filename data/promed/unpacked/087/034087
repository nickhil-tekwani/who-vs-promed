Costa Rica: 9 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever so far in 2003
--------------------------------------------------------------
2 new cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) have been reported in Santa
Cruz, Guanacaste, both women, aged 21 and 42. The younger has been
discharged from hospital, the older is in a stable condition.
This brings the total of cases of DHF in 2003 to 9. In Santa Cruz about 80
cases of dengue are being seen per week. In the whole country, 3430 cases
of dengue have been reported in 2003, including 9 of DHF.

Europe: imported cases of dengue fever
--------------------------------------
TropNetEurop has observed an increase of imported dengue fever cases in
Europe since autumn 2002. For the whole year, we have seen a clear increase
of report numbers within our sentinel system from 140 to 218. By far the
majority of all patients with dengue fever have been reported from Germany:
99 out of 218 (45 per cent), followed by Sweden, Spain, and Austria. Out of
all dengue reports, 80 per cent concerned confirmed cases. Most patients
with dengue fever were Europeans (94 per cent), mainly tourists or business
travellers. If compared to 2001, the rate of infections per geographical
area has shifted towards South East Asia and Oceania. In particular,
Thailand and Indonesia were contributing an increasing numbers of dengue
patients. Reporting of dengue generally follows a clear seasonal pattern
with peaks during the travel seasons in summer and winter. However, 2002
saw larger-than-usual numbers during and after the Easter holiday and well
into the summer season. During August, September, and December,
significantly fewer patients with dengue were seen.
More than a quarter of the patient population was admitted to hospital for
an average of 5.5 days (median 4 days). Most probably this is a sign of
insecurity regarding the diagnosis. Many patients with "malaria-like"
symptoms after returning from the tropics are kept as inpatients for a few
days until the diagnosis has been established. Complications warranting a
diagnosis of "dengue hemorrhagic fever" occurred in 8 per cent of all
patients. This is a clear increase in comparison to 2001, when complicated
dengue occurred in only 1.6 per cent of patients. Most of the patients with
complications had been to Thailand. Among those complications were 2
patients with affected optic nerves.

Germany: additional information on imported dengue cases
--------------------------------------------------------
We would like to add some more details to the Reuters Health report in the
preceding ProMED-mail update [see: Dengue/DHF update 2003 (27)
20030707.1663]. There was indeed a large increase in dengue reporting
between 2001 (60) and 2002 (231) in Germany. Except for one nosocomially
acquired case in 2002, all infections were linked to travel to
dengue-endemic areas (in 40 per cent of cases travel to Thailand). However,
we would like to [comment on the use of] the term "dramatically" in the
Reuters Health post, as at least part of the increase was probably due to
more complete reporting in 2002 (a new reporting system was introduced in
2001) and to a more general availability of commercial test systems for
dengue virus antibodies. In addition, interpretation of the data in light
of German tourism patterns and reports about dengue "outbreaks" in tourist
areas of Thailand and the city of Rio de Janeiro indicate that numbers were
strongly influenced by the intense dengue transmission seasons in Brazil
and Thailand in 2002. As for 2003 we are currently seeing reductions in
case notifications of 45 per cent and 75 per cent for the first and second
quarter, respectively, compared with 2002. A detailed analysis of German
dengue surveillance data for 2001-2002 is currently being submitted for
publication in a scientific journal.

Australia: total of locally acquired cases in Townsville reaches 14
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2 more locally acquired dengue fever cases have been confirmed in the twin
cities in the past week. This takes the number of locally acquired cases to
14 while the number of imported cases still stands at 7. Last month the
Townsville Bulletin reported that health authorities feared the city was
heading towards a Cairns-type epidemic, with 12 cases having been confirmed
at that time. The Tropical Public Health Unit said yesterday any risk of
the outbreak escalating had been reduced by the low numbers. But if this
pattern continued in low numbers until the warmer weather arrived, there
was a risk of an explosion.
This year Townsville has recorded its greatest number of dengue fever cases
in 10 years. The 14 locally confirmed cases are the most since the city's
outbreak in 1993, when 450 people were struck with the disease. The
Tropical Public Health Unit's director of environmental health, John
Piispanen, said it was as important as ever that people checked around
their homes for possible [mosquito] breeding sites.
The unit is doing work in Pimlico (where one of the cases was confirmed)
and in West End. The second most recent case was in North Ward. Mr
Piispanen said health unit staff had been door-knocking at homes within a
100 km radius of the confirmed Pimlico case to spray inside houses and
check for possible breeding sites.

*Original [antigenic] sin and dengue fever
------------------------------------------
Dengue fever is caused by an arthropod-borne flavivirus and usually
presents as a self limiting febrile illness, but in more severe cases, a
high fever, hemorrhaging, and plasma leakage can occur. There are many
cases of dengue fever each year, and the development of an effective dengue
vaccine is hampered by a lack of understanding of the precise role of
immune cells in dengue fever.
In a paper published in Nature Medicine [July 2003; 9(7): 921-7
<http://www.nature.com/nm/>], Juthathip Mongkolsapaya and colleagues at the
John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, with involvement of several institutions
in Thailand, show that profound T-cell activation and death may contribute
to the systemic disturbances leading to dengue fever, and original
antigenic sin in the T-cell responses may suppress or delay viral
elimination, leading to higher viral loads and increased immunopathology.
Mongkolsapaya et al performed a detailed analysis of dengue virus-specific
T-cell responses in Thai children with dengue. They observed that during
acute infection, up to 7 per cent of circulating CD8+ T cells reacted with
the A11-restricted GTS epitope, and there was an association between the
magnitude of the T-cell response and the disease severity. Most of the CD8+
T cells present showed an activated phenotype and were undergoing
programmed cell death. In addition, they observed that many dengue-specific
T cells were of low affinity for the infecting virus and showed higher
affinity for other, probably previously encountered, strains. "Larger
studies will identify more CD8 epitopes, and it is reasonable to expect
that some of these will be serotype-specific. If we can identify enough of
these, it may be possible to incorporate them into a dengue vaccine that
would improve safety by avoiding potential antibody enhancement or
cross-reactivity in T-cell responses," conclude the authors.

[The co-circulation of multiple serotypes of dengue virus has been reported
from many countries. Worldwide, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) accompanies
many but not all outbreaks of dengue fever and is observed both in children
and adults; secondary infection by a different dengue virus serotype has
been established as an important risk factor for this severe form of the
disease. However, other risk factors -- such as the interval between dengue
virus infections, ethnicity, and underlying chronic conditions of the
patient -- have also been identified. The sequence of dengue virus
infections and association with certain genotypes are further factors of
importance. The various interpretations of the phenomenon are discussed in
a recent review by SB Halstead ( Dengue. Current Opinion in Infectious
Diseases. 2002; 15: 471-6, Oct). The paper by Mongkolsapaya et al, by
examining the cellular immune responses of children in Thailand, where DHF
appears to be particularly severe, adds a further dimension to the debate.
The abstract of the paper in Nature Medicine by Juthathip Mongkolsapaya and
13 others, which is entitled "Original antigenic sin and apoptosis in the
pathogenesis of dengue haemorrhagic fever" reads as follows:
"Dengue virus presents a growing threat to public health in the developing
world. 4 major serotypes of dengue virus have been characterized, and
epidemiological evidence shows that dengue hemorrhagic fever, the more
serious manifestation of the disease, occurs more frequently upon
reinfection with a second serotype. We have studied dengue virus-specific
T-cell responses in Thai children. During acute infection, few
dengue-responsive CD8+ T cells were recovered; most of those present showed
an activated phenotype and were undergoing programmed cell death. Many
dengue-specific T cells were of low affinity for the infecting virus and
showed higher affinity for other, probably previously encountered, strains.
Profound T-cell activation and death may contribute to the systemic
disturbances leading to dengue haemorrhagic fever, and original antigenic
sin in the T-cell responses may suppress or delay viral elimination,
leading to higher viral loads and increased immunopathology."
*Original antigenic sin refers to the phenomenon first described by Francis
in 1953 whereby the serological response of an individual to influenza A
virus infection is dominated throughout life by the nature of the antibody
produced in response to the first influenza A virus infection, and is
characteristic of viruses where there are cross reacting antigenic types.
