After a campaign launched against polio vaccinations on social media, a 25 [per cent] increase in refusals was recorded during the recent polio campaign in the federal capital, which started [10 Dec 2018].

A 2 month old girl was vaccinated on [30 Nov 2018] in Tehsil Ghazi. She fell sick and died in Haripur on [2 Dec 2018]. The incident was reported in the media, and it was alleged that she died due to the polio vaccine. The story was shared widely on social media, after which the number of refusals increased in the federal capital. Refusals are attributed to social media rumours about the death of the baby due to the polio vaccine. A report of an inquiry into the matter says the girl's death had nothing to do with polio vaccination and that she died of pneumonia.

"Most of the refusals were from educated people who are active on social media. During the last polio campaign, we had 69 refusals from across the city, and this time we have just as many in the Defence Housing Authority alone. Parents refused to vaccinate their children and misbehaved with polio teams," focal person for polio in Islamabad, Dr Asif Rahim, told Dawn.

A video recording of one such incident, available with Dawn, shows a man misbehaving with a polio team and saying parents should be able to decide if they want to vaccinate their children. "You have visited my house 5 times. Now stop coming here, or I will call the guards. I have seen news of a child dying because of a polio vaccine. I will not allow my children to be vaccinated; you can do whatever you want," he says in the clip.

An Islamabad Capital Territory official said most people lie and say they have already vaccinated their children in a hospital and that they are unable to produce a certificate or card when asked. "We have been facing refusals in Bahria Town and Kural urban societies where it has become very difficult to vaccinate children. The percentage of refusal coverage is still lower than in previous campaigns despite the presence of additional deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners," the official said. "The media should cover such issues with responsibility, because such news can increase the number of refusals in the coming polio campaign in January [2019]."

On the other hand, a report of an inquiry initiated by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government into the death of the 2 month old baby girl says the polio vaccine had nothing to do with her death. The report of the fact-finding committee, available with Dawn, says she died of pneumonia and that her 4 year old brother and other children in the vicinity were also vaccinated, and they are all well and healthy.

The report recommends regulatory measures for the publication of news on sensitive issues such as polio in order to avoid chaos among the public. It says the matter should be thoroughly inquired before publication of such news, because polio eradication is a national cause, and such activities can damage the campaign.

[In the past few weeks, we have been posting the weekly updates reflecting a slight increase in the numbers of reported cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) attributable disease over 2017 reported cases with comments raising concerns of the possibility of not achieving eradication of the polio virus. I've chosen to post this media report as an example of the fragility of the polio vaccination efforts, susceptible to rumors spread on social media and in those sections of the journalistic media that search for sensationalism to sell content. Unfortunately, the "anti-vaxxer" movement jumps on any rumor to bolster support for not vaccinating children, and in Pakistan, where WPV still circulates and causes disease -- 8 cases confirmed to date in 2018 -- an increase in vaccine refusals jeopardizes the entire polio eradication effort. The majority of the anti-polio vaccine movement in Pakistan was in the lower-educated population that were susceptible to rumors put forth by the fundamentalist movement claiming the vaccine campaigns were a Western plot to sterilize the children. The above media report suggests there is now a growing anti-vaxxer movement similar to that seen in North America and Europe, which blames the vaccine for creating ill health effects rather than celebrating the prevention of disease, in a population more akin to that seen in the anti-vaxxer movement in the West. Sigh. Either way, the children are the ones who ultimately suffer.
