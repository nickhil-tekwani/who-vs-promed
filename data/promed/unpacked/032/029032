The Lansing Correctional Facility in Kansas sees 750 inmates test positive for COVID-19, with an Iola family saying their family member is one of them.

30-year-old [PK] doesn't have severe symptoms, but he is being housed with inmates who do. He also hasn't seen a doctor since being diagnosed.

His mother says it's scary since there's so much that they don't know about the virus or what's happening.

[4] Yemen: high number of deaths
Date: Sat 16 May 2020
Source: The National [abridged, edited]
https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/yemeni-officials-report-hundreds-of-apparent-coronavirus-deaths-in-aden-1.1020126


Local health officials in southern Yemen's main city say hundreds of people have died there in the past week with symptoms of what appears to be the coronavirus.

The officials told the Associated Press they fear the situation in Aden is only going to get worse as the country has little capacity to test suspected cases of COVID-19, and a 5-year-long civil war has left the health system in shambles.

One gravedigger in Aden said he had never seen such a constant flow of dead, even in a city that has seen several rounds of bloody street battles during the civil war.

Officially, the number of coronavirus cases in Yemen is low: 106 in the southern region, with 15 deaths. Authorities in the Houthi rebel-controlled north announced their 1st case on 5 May [2020] and said only 2 people had infections, including a Somali migrant who died.

But doctors say the Houthis are covering up an increasing number of cases to protect their economy and troops. And the surge in deaths in Aden -- more than 500 in just the past week, according to the city registrar -- has raised the nightmare scenario that the virus is spreading swiftly in a country with almost no capacity to resist it.

The rise in suspected COVID-19 cases in Yemen has set alarm bells ringing across the global health community, which fears the virus will spread like wildfire throughout the world's most vulnerable populations such as refugees or those affected by war.

"If you have a full-blown community transmission in Yemen, because of the fragility, because of the vulnerability, because of the susceptibility, it will be disastrous," said Altaf Musani, the World Health Organisation chief in Yemen.

WHO says its models suggest that, under some scenarios, half of Yemen's population of 30 million could be infected and more than 40 000 could die. Half of Yemen's health facilities are dysfunctional, and 18% of the country's 333 districts have no doctors. Water and sanitation systems have collapsed. Many families can barely afford one meal a day.

Yemen has only 500 ventilators and 700 ICU beds. There is one oxygen cylinder per month for every 2.5 million people. WHO has provided about 6700 test kits to Yemen, split between north and south, and says another 32 000 are coming. The health agency says it is trying to procure more protective equipment and supplies to fight the virus, but efforts have been hampered because of travel restrictions and competition with other countries.

The government's national coronavirus committee declared Aden an "infested city" last Monday [11 May 2020] because of the spread of the coronavirus and other diseases caused by recent floods.

It said the "administrative and political situation in Aden" was hampering efforts to combat the coronavirus and that "this should be remedied so relevant entities can carry out their duties."

[5] Oman: surge in cases
Date: Sat 16 May 2020
Source: Saudi Gazette [edited]
https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/593197/World/Mena/Oman-confirms-404-new-cases-deaths-number-20


Oman confirmed 404 new coronavirus cases on Saturday [16 May 2020], raising the total to 5029 as the death toll climbed to 20, according to a health ministry statement. Meanwhile, the sultanate's number of recoveries increased to 1436 as more patients continue to recover.

Most of the newly recorded cases are non-Omanis, and 67 are Omani nationals, the health ministry said. The ministry continued to urge individuals to maintain social distancing and adhere to preventative measures implemented to slow the spread of the deadly virus.

"With our commitment to health isolation and social distancing, we will prevent ourselves, our families, and our community from the spread of the coronavirus," the ministry said in a statement.

Oman announced its 1st 2 cases of the virus on 24 Feb [2020] after 2 Omani women were infected during a trip to Iran.

Strict measures were imposed throughout Oman to prevent the further spread of the virus. A lockdown had been implemented in the capital Muscat and was extended until the end of May [2020]. Ramadan mass gatherings were also banned throughout the sultanate.

[6] Guam: sailors retest positive aboard aircraft carrier
Date: Fri 15 May 2020
Source: SF Chronicle [edited]
https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Five-sailors-aboard-Roosevelt-carrier-retest-15273804.php


In an alarming development, 5 sailors aboard the Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier in Guam have retested positive for COVID-19 after quarantining for the disease; they have been removed from the embattled warship a 2nd time, the Navy announced Friday [15 May 2020].

The news raises questions about whether the massive vessel with nearly 5000 sailors can safely return to sea. It also adds uncertainty to the broader understanding of the virus' ability to reinfect individuals, effective quarantine requirements, and the accuracy of testing.

"This is not behaving like any infectious disease I have heard of if these tests are accurate," said John Swartzberg, a UC Berkeley infectious disease expert. "None of this makes sense."

All 5 sailors had previously tested positive and were evacuated off the ship, which has been stuck in Guam since late March [2020] after the virus swept through the close quarters of the nuclear-powered carrier. They spent at least 14 days in quarantine on the island; the healthy sailors isolated in individual hotel rooms and the infected sailors together in group quarantine on the naval base. The sailors were allowed back on the Roosevelt only after testing negative twice, the tests administered at least 48 hours apart.

The Navy said those handful of sailors who retested positive this week "met rigorous recovery criteria, exceeding CDC guidelines."

"While onboard, these 5 TR sailors self-monitored and adhered to the strict social distancing protocols established by the Navy," the Navy said. "These 5 sailors developed influenza-like illness symptoms and did the right thing reporting to medical for evaluation. The sailors were immediately removed from the ship and placed back in isolation, their close contacts were mapped, and they are receiving the required medical care."

A defense official said this new issue arose when one sailor, who had been asymptomatic even after testing positive and in group quarantine on the base, began to show flu-like symptoms. Contact tracing led to about 20 other sailors, and 4 of those tested positive. The others tested negative and were sent to Guam hotels to begin a new round of 14-day quarantine, the official said.

The ship has been docked in Guam for almost 2 months dealing with the outbreak. Former commanding officer Capt. Brett Crozier lost his job after sending out a memo that his crew needed to be immediately evacuated or sailors would die, a story reported exclusively by The Chronicle.

Swartzberg said the development was baffling. It meant these sailors had the virus smoldering for a longer time than expected, meaning incubation periods could be longer than 2 weeks. Or more likely, he said, there were false test results among the several tests given the 5 sailors.

"It's very possible COVID has some more surprises for us," he said.

Even before the Navy began cycling hundreds of sailors at a time in late April [2020] back onto the ship, some previously healthy sailors in hotel rooms began testing positive at the end of their quarantine period. The Navy started a medical study last month [April 2020] in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, knowing they had a unique population to learn about how the virus works. About 300 samples were collected, and results are expected next month [June 2020], the Navy said.

More than 4000 of the 4800 crew members were evacuated from the ship, and the skeleton crew left aboard spent weeks cleaning and sanitizing the vessel. The quarantined sailors were expected to return to a clean ship.

As of Thursday [14 May 2020], more than 2900 sailors had reboarded the Roosevelt, and about a quarter of the 1000 who had tested positive had recovered, the Navy said.

Whatever the explanation is for these retested positives, Swartzberg said the development further complicates matters for the military.

"This is a major problem for the U.S. Navy," he said. "Ships are a perfect breeding ground for this virus."

WHO periodically updates the global surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) document, which includes surveillance definitions.
Definition of COVID-19 death: COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g., trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South-East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 45 015 new cases (51.8% of the global newly reported cases), and 3123 deaths (63.2%) for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 46.3% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil 31%, Peru 9.5%, Mexico 5.4%, and Canada 2.9%. The Americas region is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European region as the 2nd-highest region.

The European region reported 22 150 new cases (25.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 1446 deaths (29.3%). Russia reported 41.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 16.1%, Turkey 7.7%, Belarus 4.3%, Italy 3.6%, Spain 2.9%, and Sweden at 2.8%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 10 479 new cases (12.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 143 deaths (2.9%). Saudi Arabia reported 22.0 % of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran at 20.0 %, Pakistan 15.1%, Qatar 11.0 %, Kuwait 8.4%, the United Arab Emirates at 7.1%, and Oman at 3.9%.

The African region reported 2271 new cases (2.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 44 deaths (0.9%). South Africa reported 34.6% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 12.7%, Algeria 8.3%, Senegal at 5.3 %, and Ghana 4.8%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1171 new cases (1.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 33 deaths (0.6%). Singapore reported 67.7% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 18.4% and Japan 3.7%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 56.8%, Japan 11.6%, Malaysia at 9.5, Australia at 7.9% and Viet Nam at 6.6%.

The South-East Asia region reported 5741 new cases (6.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 151 deaths (3.0%). India reported 69.2% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 20.9% and Indonesia 8.5%. These 3 countries make up 95.7% of all reported cases in the region. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 67.9% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 27.7%, and the Maldives 2.8%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 16 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South-East Asia.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.UBA
