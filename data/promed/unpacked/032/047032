Meningitis kills 13 newborns in Guatemala hospital
--------------------------------------------------
A meningitis outbreak at a hospital in Guatemala's second largest city has
killed 13 newborns and left 5 others seriously ill, officials said Saturday.
The infants died over the past week after officials detected the outbreak
in the maternity ward at Quetzaltenango's largest public hospital. The 5
others were being treated with antibiotics and were expected to recover.
Meningitis attacks the spine and brain. The germ enters the bloodstream
through contact with the nose or throat discharges of an infected person.
If left untreated, it can kill a person within a few weeks. [Meningococcal
disease would be expected to have a more fulminant presentation than
implied by this description. - Mods.MPP/ES]
Officials think the disease was brought in by one of the mothers in the
ward in early July, the hospital's director of internal medicine, Rene
Aceituno, said.
Hospital staff moved all the newborns to a different area and believe the
outbreak now is under control. Workers, wearing masks, removed sheets,
clothing, furniture and ceiling tiles from the infected area Friday.
The outbreak has caused a panic in this largely Indian community some 125
miles southwest of Guatemala City. Local newspapers reported overcrowding
in a half dozen other Quetzaltenango-area hospitals in the wake of the
outbreak.
