Russia: Rabies Outbreak Affects 20 People in Nizhniy Novgorod Region
--------------------------------------------------
According to reports, an outbreak of rabies in the Nizhniy Novgorod region
of Russia has affected 20 people in 10 districts. NTV Moscow said that an
emergency vaccination plan is being implemented in Mukhtolovo after a rabid
dog bit a number of residents. The report noted that individuals who have
been bitten or who may have been in contact with the dog are lining up at
area clinics to get vaccinated against rabies.
Cases of rabies have also been recorded in Tatarstan, Chuvashiya, Mordovia,
Vladimir, and Ryazan.

[It is not clear from this brief report whether any of those bitten by the
rabid animal have developed clinical rabies, or merely that 20 people have
been bitten and are now receiving post-exposure treatment. Further
information would be welcome. - Mod.CP]
