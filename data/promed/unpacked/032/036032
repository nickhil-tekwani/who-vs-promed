[Cases continue to be identified, diagnosed and reported in Saudi Arabia. As of today [25 Mar 2016], there have been a total of 1360 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 579 deaths reported by the Saudi MOH. The newly reported cases come from Buraidah in Qassim province, and Riaydh Alkhobara (also known as Riyadh Alkhabra), also located in Qassim province, about 73 km to the south west of Buraidah. The former case (from Buraidah) was classified as a primary case, although there was no history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. The latter case, reported as a fatal case at the time of initial confirmation report, is still pending classification. There is clearly increased transmission of the MERS-CoV ongoing in Qassim province at this time, with Buraidah reporting 32 newly confirmed cases since 3 Mar 2016. These reports include classification of: 9 primary (4 of whom had no contact with camels noted), 18 secondary, and 6 unclassified cases.
