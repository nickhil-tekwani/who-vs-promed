Abstract
--------
We report a seasonal increase of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) cases in France, with 54 cases detected between [19 Aug and 14 Nov 2018]. Molecular typing revealed that 20 of 32 of the isolates belonged to clade D1, only sporadically detected before in France. Median age of D1-cases was 42 years, 10 developed severe respiratory signs and one had neurological complications. The 2018-D1 viruses showed a genetic divergence of 3.34 percent with D1 viruses identified previously.

[EV-D68 virus has been associated with a wide range of infections including neurological and severe respiratory diseases since its global emergence in 2014 (Lancet Infect Dis. 2016;16(5):e64-75. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(15)00543-5/fulltext). As EV-D68 circulation is driven by a biennial pattern in European countries, an upsurge of EV-D68 cases was expected in 2018.

Before 2014, EV-D68 infection had been confirmed in only 699 people worldwide. In 2014, more than 2000 cases of enterovirus D68 were reported in 20 countries including Canada, Europe, and Asia. In the Lancet Infect Dis 2016 paper referred above, the authors systematically reviewed reports on enterovirus D68 to estimate its global epidemiology and its ability to cause respiratory infections and neurological damage in children, based on data extracted from 70 papers to report on prevalence, symptoms, hospitalisation and mortality, and complications of enterovirus D68, both before and during the large outbreak of 2014.

The authors concluded that: "The magnitude and severity of the enterovirus D68 outbreak underscores a need for improved diagnostic work-up of paediatric respiratory illness, not only to prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics, but also to ensure better surveillance of diseases. Existing surveillance systems should be assessed in terms of capacity and ability to detect and report any upsurge of respiratory viruses such as enterovirus D68 in a timely manner, and focus should be paid to development of preventive measures against these emerging enteroviruses that have potential for severe disease." - Mod.UBA
