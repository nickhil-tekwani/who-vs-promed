The Central Visayas region in the Philippines, which includes the provinces of Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental and Siquijor, has reported a 1175% increase in measles cases in 2022 compared with the same period in 2021.

From the beginning of the year through 6 Aug 2022, the Central Visayas (Region VII) reported 51 measles cases. This compares with 4 cases reported in 2021 during the same period.

Measles is up nationally across the archipelago with 339 cases, a 153% increase compared with 2021 (134 cases).

According to a Crisis24 report, measles vaccination coverage in the Philippines is estimated at 57%, much lower than the 92-95% required to prevent wider community transmission (https://bit.ly/3Qjy6My).

A measles outbreak is ongoing in Tanzania since June 2022, according to the World Health Organization.

As of 23 Aug 2022, a cumulative total of 223 suspected measles cases, with 2 IgM positive cases are reported since the onset of the outbreak in June 2022.

A total of 88 cases were admitted to the local hospitals. About 48% (108 cases) of the suspected cases were children under 5 years of age.

The majority of cases are reported from Magharibi B, Magharibi A and Wete districts. The Ministry of health is working on strengthening surveillance and routine vaccination activities as well as the planning for a mass measles vaccination outbreak response.

For the 1st time in 3 years, Maricopa County has 3 confirmed cases of measles. Those infected are 1 adult and 2 children, and all 3 were unvaccinated. Health officials said one case was so bad, that person is in the hospital. The Maricopa County Department of Public Health confirmed all 3 are related but wouldn't say how. One of them traveled abroad to an area impacted by measles and brought it back.

MCDPH says it's conducting case investigations and contact tracing on all 3 cases. "We are working diligently with the cases and their healthcare providers to identify any potential exposures and notify people who were exposed promptly," said Dr. Nick Staab, a medical epidemiologist at MCDPH. "The most important thing you can do to protect yourself is to get vaccinated against measles if you have not already been vaccinated."

The Arizona Department of Health Services is sounding the alarm about vaccinations. In Arizona, just more than 90% of kindergarten students received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. That's down from the 2 previous school years. Ninety-five percent is needed for herd immunity.

Santa Cruz and Yuma counties have the highest vaccination rates, while Maricopa County stands at 90%. Yavapai County is at the lowest with 77%.

State data also show that the number of kids with personal belief exemptions has increased over the same time period. "It is concerning, very concerning; especially for the children that are around here," Kenneth Nielson, a Phoenix man said.

Measles can linger in the air for up to 2 hours, and around 90% of unvaccinated individuals exposed to measles will be infected. The virus is preventable with 2 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, typically given during childhood. Those born prior to 1957 or who had measles as a child are considered immune.

Anyone who may have been exposed should watch for the following symptoms between 7 to 12 days after being exposed:
- fever (101 F, 38.33 deg C or higher)
- red, watery eyes
- cough
- runny nose
- a non-itchy red rash, raised, and blotchy, that may start at the hairline and moves down the body, lasting 5 to 6 days.

Those who develop symptoms are encouraged to seek medical care, testing, and avoid others. They should call the provider ahead to inform them about symptoms and potential exposure before going in so the provider can reduce the possibility of others in the office getting exposed. Individuals who do not have a healthcare provider can find a federally-qualified community health center or a provider at <FindHelpPhx.org>.

MCDPH is also telling community healthcare providers to be on the lookout for fever and rash among unvaccinated patients, primarily if they have known exposure. "Measles is both highly contagious and preventable," said Dr. Staab. "It can be a severe illness, so we strongly encourage anyone who has not been vaccinated to get vaccinated to prevent further spread."

[It is notable that this measles outbreak in Arizona, US, started following infection in another unnamed country, demonstrating the importance of vaccination even when measles has been eliminated in one's own country. But even with 90% of the children vaccinated, as is the case with some counties in Arizona, this highly infectious virus can spread. Measles is a problem in many countries now. See the CDC list of the 10 countries with the most cases (https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/data/global-measles-outbreaks.html).

Measles is active in all regions of the world. The measles cases in the US have all been associated with travel-related cases that subsequently infected unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated persons. According to the CDC, almost 41 countries put off, or were planning to put off, measles campaigns for 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. - Mod.LK
