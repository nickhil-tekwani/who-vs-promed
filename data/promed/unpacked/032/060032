A prolonged and mysterious die-off of the nation's honeybees, a trend worrisome both to beekeepers and farmers who depend on the insects to pollinate their crops, apparently worsened last year [2014].

In an annual survey released [Wed 13 May 2015] by the Bee Informed Partnership, a consortium of universities and research laboratories, about 5000 beekeepers reported losing 42.1 per cent of their colonies in the 12 month period that ended in April [2015]. That is well above the 34.2 per cent loss reported for the same period in 2013 and 2014, and it is the 2nd highest loss recorded since year-round surveys began in 2010.

Most striking, however, was that honeybee deaths spiked last summer [2014], exceeding winter deaths for the 1st time. Commercial beekeepers, some of whom rent their hives to farmers during pollination seasons, were hit especially hard, the survey's authors stated.

"We expect the colonies to die during the winter, because that's a stressful season," said Dennis van Engelsdorp, an assistant entomology professor at the University of Maryland who directs the survey for the bee partnership. "What's totally shocking to me is that the losses in summer, which should be paradise for bees, exceeded the winter losses."

Bees are not in danger of extinction, but their health is of major concern to agriculture, where honeybees' pollination services are estimated to be worth USD 10 billion to USD 15 billion a year. Nobody knows with certainty why. Beekeepers once expected to lose perhaps 10 per cent of their bees in an average year. But deaths began to spike in the middle of the past decade, when a phenomenon in which bees deserted their hives and died en masse -- later named colony collapse disorder -- began sweeping hives worldwide.

Those mass die-offs have abated somewhat in recent years, experts say, but colonies remain in poor health and overall death rates remain much higher than in the past.

[Mounting evidence indicates that bee colony collapses are caused by interacting stress factors that affect the balance between pathogens and host immunity. It has been shown that otherwise silent infections with 'deformed wing virus' become uncontrollable and kill the bees when accompanied by infection with the mite _Varroa destructor_. Other studies implicated pesticides interacting with cold (other stressors). It is likely that many factors, mostly anthropogenic stressors, interacting in synergy, disrupt the health of bees and make them less capable of resisting infections. - Mod.PMB
