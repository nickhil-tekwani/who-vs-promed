Iraq's Agriculture Minister Falah Hassan Zaidan al-Lahibi said on [Thu 11 Jan 2018] that one poultry field in the central Iraqi province of Babil was infected with avian flu, days after controlling the epicenter of the disease in Diyala province.

The ministry spokesman Hamid Nayef said in a statement that "the Veterinary Department moved as soon as it was informed of the news in all its departments and in cooperation with the relevant authorities in the province in order to determine the location of the presumed infection. The samples were taken from the infected site and sent to the central laboratories in the veterinary department, which was identified as H5N8 serotype.

Al-Nayef pointed out that "avian flu is a disease that is transmitted by migratory birds to Iraq during this season, which has been massive" noting that "The disease has been diagnosed in Diyala province in the past few days, and was fully controled"
