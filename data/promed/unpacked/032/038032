USDA TO DESTROY 3 VERMONT SHEEP FLOCKS QUARANTINED FOR TSE WASHINGTON, 14
Jul 2000
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced it is acquiring 376
sheep from 3 Vermont flocks after 4 sheep were confirmed positive on July
10 for a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). USDA is purchasing
1 flock of 21 sheep and has issued an order to seize 2 other flocks of 355
sheep.
The owners of the sheep will receive fair market value for their animals,
which USDA will then destroy to prevent the possible contamination of other
livestock. TSE is a class of degenerative neurological diseases
characterized by a very long incubation period and a 100 percent mortality
rate. TSE's are not known to be very contagious.
Two of the better known varieties of TSE are bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and scrapie in sheep. Unlike BSE, there is
no evidence scrapie poses a risk to human health. Further testing, which
will take several years, is required to determine which type of TSE has
infected these sheep. The original sheep, imported from Belgium and the
Netherlands in 1996, were placed under limited federal restrictions when
they entered the country, as part of USDA's voluntary scrapie eradication
efforts. In 1998, USDA learned it was likely European sheep were exposed to
feed contaminated with BSE.
At USDA's request, the state of Vermont imposed a quarantine on these
flocks, prohibiting their slaughter or sale for breeding purposes. Since
1996, USDA has been actively monitoring these flocks for any evidence of
TSE. Milk from these sheep was sold and used to produce cheese that also
was sold. While none of the original imported sheep were slaughtered for
human consumption, prior to imposition of the quarantine and detection of
TSE, some offspring of these animals were slaughtered for human
consumption. USDA is working with other federal agencies and the state of
Vermont to determine if there are any associated human health concerns.
Through USDA's import restrictions and one of the world's most aggressive
surveillance programs, BSE has never been diagnosed in the United States.
In addition, USDA offers producers the opportunity to protect their sheep
from scrapie and certify them as scrapie_free. Movement of any infected
sheep is restricted. Through a coordinated effort, USDA continues to work
with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)to ensure
the health of America's livestock and the safety of its food supply. For

[These sheep are being treated as any dairy cow. However, these were
valuable milking sheep whose value as a breeding animal would have been
quite high. Consequently, I wonder what a fair market value is?
There is a trace back system used in the cattle markets that was relatively
effective.
There is fear among many agencies in the US with regard to BSE and other
TSE diseases. This fear was heightened when the UK listed the US as being
in a designated Class II, meaning the US is at risk of having BSE. Perhaps
this is an effort to be seen by the UK that the US is moving to eliminate
any possible BSE. The class II status has implications with regard to how
the UK will handle beef exports from the US.
What happens to the farm? Will the owners be allowed to bring in new sheep?
Can they turn the farm over to dairy cattle, or raise captive deer? Will
the farm be required to remain vacant or idle of animals for a period of
time, and for how long? In the Colorado and Wyoming cases of Chronic
Wasting Disease there was a type of chemical decontamination. Will that be
required here? Are their other domestic animals, such as dairy cows on the
farm? What has happened to those animal, or even the wild animals? These
are questions needing answers. I hope the USDA can provide us some answers.

Veterinarians have found the first evidence sheep may have become infected
with BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, mad cow disease). Three flocks
in America were this weekend forcibly taken from their owners to high
security laboratories for slaughter and testing after tests showed clear
signs of the disease.
The flocks of Friesian milking sheep were imported from Europe to Vermont
within the last 4 years. Checks have shown their parent flocks had eaten
British-bought feed likely to contain material from BSE-infected cows.
Linda Detwiler, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
veterinarian responsible for monitoring BSE and related diseases in America
said they would be taken to Plum Island near New York, America's most
secure biological facility.
She said: "Four sheep were confirmed positive on July 10 for a
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) - the class of diseases that
includes BSE. Specific tests for scrapie, the TSE normally found in sheep,
have proved negative so there is a distinct possibility they have BSE
instead."
Scientists have known for some years, under laboratory conditions, sheep
can catch BSE from eating infected bovine material. Until now there has
never been any clear evidence of this happening on farms. Some experts
believe, however, sheep with BSE would have been misdiagnosed as suffering
from scrapie which has identical symptoms. Four scientific tests were used
on the Vermont sheep. The first looked at the brains of culled animals and
found clear signs of the lesions seen in sheep with BSE-like diseases.
When tests designed specifically for scrapie proved negative the samples
were sent to other scientists to see if they could find prions - the
protein particles thought to cause and transmit TSEs.
A USDA scientist who carried out one set of tests, said several of the
animals had proved positive - and her results had been independently
confirmed by another scientist using a different technique.
"The sheep are negative for scrapie but they definitely have some kind of
prion disease. it could be a new form of scrapie - or BSE," she said. The
evidence in favor of BSE is strengthened by the animals European parent
flocks having been certified completely free of scrapie. Despite the fact
infective feed is now banned, if BSE had once entered the sheep
population, it could still persist. In cattle BSE appears to pass from cows
to calves and in sheep scrapie is renowned for its ability to transmit
between generations and across flocks, although the mechanism is not known.
Professor Peter Smith, acting chair of the Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee (SEAC) which advises the government on safety issues,
greeted the news with concern. "If BSE is found in sheep it will be very
serious indeed," he said.
Tomorrow SEAC will meet to discuss Britain's first cluster of 4 variant
CJD cases around the village of Queniborough in Leicestershire.
The USDA's fear it has found BSE in sheep will also be discussed. Detwiler
said it would take a year for further tests to confirm whether or not the
sheep have BSE. If so it will raise the possibility Americans may be at
risk from vCJD since milk from the sheep has been sold for human
consumption as has a limited amount of meat.

[This is extremely misleading. There is no evidence the actual sheep
parents of the Vermont flocks were fed meat and bone meal (MBM) while in
Belgium. The issue is how many parental generations back is this in
reference to? There is an assumption on the part of the USDA some flocks
from a particular time period may have been fed MBM. Usually this breed of
sheep is pasture raised and not fed MBM or grains.
The USDA says the 4 sheep were confirmed positive for TSE. What clinical
signs, if any, were these sheep displaying or were the sheep slaughtered
for meat or simply died of other causes? Few studies are done on
strain-typing asymptomatic sheep early on in disease progression. Maybe
these sheep would have had more typical scrapie symptoms had they lived
longer?
Some of the assumptions and actions here do not appear to be scientifically
valid. For example, the researcher conducting the testing is not named and
neither is the method used to supposedly identify this prion. Good
scientific procedures would name the procedure and whether it is a verified
method. However, perhaps the article source was remiss in not naming the
scientist or the method. - Mod.TG

The USDA issued itself a Super Urgent Emergency Forcible Seizure Order on
Friday afternoon (to bypass the judicial system) to seize and incinerate
the sheep.
A fax of Secretary Glickman's signed order is actually a "Declaration of
Extraordinary Emergency because of an Atypical Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathy of Foreign Origin".
"A transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (prion disease) of foreign
origin has been detected in the United States. It is different from TSE's
previously diagnosed in the US. The TSE was detected in the
progeny of imported sheep... TSE's are caused by similar, as yet
uncharacterized, agents [sic that usually produce spongiform changes in
the brain. Post-mortem analysis has indicated positive results for an
atypical TSE of foreign origin in 4 sheep in Vermont.
Because of the potentially serious consequences of allowing the disease to
spread to other livestock in the US, it is necessary to seize and dispose
of those flocks of sheep in Vermont that are affected with or exposed to
the disease, and their germ plasm. The existence of the atypical TSE of
foreign origin represents a threat to US livestock. It constitutes a real
danger to the national economy and a potential serious burden on interstate
and foreign commerce. Based on review and consultation the Department has
determined that Vermont does not have the funds [sic to compensate flock
owners. Without such funds, it will be unlikely to achieve expeditious
disposal of the flocks and germ plasm. Therefore..." the USDA has to take
over the operation, citing 21 USC 134-134b of 1962.

[This is a serious issue. ProMED-mail has posted on BSE in sheep before.
The situation is less than desirable. But there some issues and questions
this does not answer.
USDA does not seem to have data on transmissibility or they would not be
stating it would take several years to test. If there was such a thing as
typical TSE, it would be easier to assess an atypical one.
I question the ability of anyone to state this it is "different from TSE's
previously diagnosed in the US". No one person has looked at even a
fraction of the slides. This is a disease with tremendous natural
variability and one has only to look at CJD variability within identical
twins to see this.
Furthermore, USDA has known for several years where these sheep are. Now
quite suddenly they move against these owners and flocks yet there is
evidence BSE does not move like a viral disease. So why the sudden rush? It
would be appreciated if someone with answers could enlighten us. - Mod.TG
