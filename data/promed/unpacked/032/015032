Dr. Sam Holland, South Dakota State Veterinarian, reports [that anthrax]
has struck a cattle ranch in Butte County. The State Veterinarian was
called on Sun 10 Aug 2003, and specimens were collected and taken to the
lab on Mon 11 Aug 2003.
The case involves an unvaccinated herd of approximately 160 cattle with
losses of 16 head (15 females and 1 bull). The [surviving] herd was scheduled
to be treated immediately with antibiotics and vaccinated, and carcasses
properly disposed of under the supervision of the Animal Industry Board.
The cattle affected are approximately 30 miles from the area in Butte County
where 7 ranches were affected in 2002.
Dr. Holland says he advised practicing veterinarians to be alert for anthrax
in his July 2003 newsletter. Rendering companies have also been alerted so
that carcasses are not rendered but properly burned and buried on the farm.

[In a parallel message, Sam said that the herd is being resampled from some
continuing cases. However hard one tries, cases can be incubating between
submission of the initial samples and confirmation. And it is clear from
this history that veterinary help was sought late -- when significant
numbers of deaths had already occurred. This is their first outbreak in
2003. The South Dakota deaths have, thankfully, been only a fraction of
those seen in North Dakota & Minnesota [in previous years]. - Mod.MHJ]
