Angola: Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak Not Yet Under Control
--------------------------------------------------
As the death toll from the Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak in Angola
creeps up to the 300 mark, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has
expressed concern at the current situation and is warning that the outbreak
is not yet over. Uige-based WHO spokesperson Aphaluck Bhatiasevi told IRIN
on Mon 16 May 2005 that some recently-identified cases of the killer
disease had not been linked to earlier cases, raising fears that the
epidemic was not yet under control since it first appeared in October 2004.
"The outbreak is not over. We've seen new cases in new municipalities that
don't have obvious links to earlier cases of Marburg. We are very concerned
about the situation," she said, speaking by phone from the northern Angolan
province where all cases have so far originated. "We are trying to do as
much tracing as possible. But some of the cases we have seen in the last 10
days don't have a clear link to previous cases," she added.
The rare haemorrhagic fever, which is [caused by a virus] from the same
family as Ebola virus, is spread by body fluids including saliva, tears and
blood. There is no specific cure and some 292 people have so far died from
among the 336 people who are known to have been infected.
Deputy Health Minister Jose Van Dunem said that no new cases had been
reported in over 21 days in provinces other than Uige, indicating that the
epidemic was "over" in most of Angola. "We're having cases only in Uige
city in the slums," he said. "We could say that [the epidemic] is over
everywhere except Uige. But we need to maintain our surveillance system."
But convincing some communities to change their traditions in order to
protect themselves from the communicable disease remains a serious
challenge. "We're working hard on social mobilisation in communities in
Uige, trying to motivate a change in behaviour," Van Dunem said. "We have
some cultural problems. People think if they don't bathe the dead body then
they are not properly putting them to rest," he added. Bodily secretions
increase after death, making the corpses of Marburg victims highly
contagious. Specialists say communities must adapt their burial traditions
in order to stop the chain of transmission of the disease.
Bhatiasevi said some breast milk had tested positive for Marburg [virus],
prompting calls for mothers suspected of being infected to avoid
breast-feeding or wet [nursing] other children. "If we get an alert from
any suspected case of Marburg who may be breast-feeding, we try and convey
the message to them," she said. "But we have to be very careful with this
message, as breast milk is one of the major food sources for children
here," she added. According to a joint WHO and health ministry statement,
44 percent of reported Marburg cases have been among children.

[The finding that breast milk was found to be positive for the Marburg
virus is intriguing. No further information on this finding is given. One
wonders what proportion of the earlier cases in children less than 5 were
preceded by illness in their mothers, who in turn may not have come to the
attention of the health sector, were ill and died at home. Information on
findings of epidemiologic studies would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
