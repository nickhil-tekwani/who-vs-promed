If you take a drive through the streets of Dromolaxia, a once
anonymous village near Larnaca, you'll still get a sense of the slow
rhythm of life, but dig a little deeper and you'll find a community
in mourning.

Before 1974, Dromolaxia was a mixed village of Greek and Turkish
Cypriots. After the war, much of the land was expropriated and used
for livestock farming. The farms are all around the village and very
much a part of daily life and commerce.

Since the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], the village has
found itself at the heart of a 3-km (2 mi) exclusion zone, painting a
gloomy picture for its residents while instilling a sense of pending
doom for all the farmers in the area.

Veterinary Service officials dressed from head to toe in all-white
are everywhere as if on the set of a futuristic disaster movie. They
move around farms in white cars, spraying, decontaminating, setting
up check-points, testing animals, and when the order comes in,
culling and burying them.

The dirty business of mass killing has not gone unnoticed in the
coffee shops of Dromolaxia. One old man sipping coffee told the
Cyprus Mail that since the culling started, there was an unavoidable
sense of morbidity in the air.

"It's very hard to see the animals go. The farmers leave when they do
it. It's just a quick injection and then they drop. There's no
kicking or fussing, nothing. The farmers can't bear to watch. How can
you kill 2000 animals for one case of FMD? It's very sad," said
George Karajas, an 80-year-old refugee from Famagusta.

"It's much harder for the small farmers. They suffer more because
they look after their sheep day and night. Rain or snow, they are
there for them when they are pregnant, help them to give birth, milk
their young. For them it is very hard, they can't look," he added.
And of course, where there is a coffee shop, there are rumours.

"We hear whispers, rumours that they'll sell the farm land and others
will come and build a polyclinic there instead. Land prices have shot
up in this little village," said Karajas.

One farmer was having his animals tested by 2 men in white carrying
test tubes. He looked flustered and disturbed. "Look, I can't speak
now. They want to take more tests. I'm trying to finish with this
business for once and for all," he said, with the permanent frown
above his eyes revealing a month's worth of stress. Behind him,
dozens of sheep moved agitatedly around the 2 costumed Vet Service
officials, sounding as stressed as their owner. Asked if they were
slated for culling, he replied: "That's how it looks."

His neighbour was more optimistic: "I've been given the all clear but
they don't want to give me a certificate saying so. I don't know what
is going on. Is it possible FMD is really here? I mean look at these
animals, if they had fever, would they still be eating?"

The 2nd farmer felt the government was putting the EU before its own
people. "It's Europe first, Europe first. But no one knows what to do
here. If you go to the Vet Service and ask for vaccinations, they
say, go to the private sector. But when we say let us bring in
private experts to check for FMD, they say 'No'," said the goat
farmer. "And if anyone did buy faulty vaccinations from the north, no
one will admit it," he added.

[Subscribers's attention is drawn to the sentence above. The
possibility that vaccination has taken place in the past within
Cyprus territory(ies), or that vaccinated animals found their way
into local flocks, deserves thorough investigation. Its outcome may
be significant in explaining the detection of several seropositive
adult sheep within a population of susceptible, predominantly
seronegative population of sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs. See item 2
for the total number of tested animals. - Mod.AS]

"There's just no way of reaching a safe conclusion with all this. It
was the authorities that brought scrapie to the island from Germany.
We had no such thing in Cyprus." [Cyprus has a very high incidence of
scrapie, initially recorded and reported during the late 70s/early
80s of the previous century. Recently, the EU required the culling of
more than 110 000 sheep and goats because of scrapie. This
requirement has been contested by Cypriot farmers; the issue is
pending. - Mod.AS]

The farmer, who did not wish to be named, said the farm had been in
his family for over 80 years. Since the outbreak, fear, confusion,
and sadness hung above the farms like a dark cloud, he noted.

The Cyprus Mail tried to get to the Kyriacou farm, the site of mass
culling yesterday [15 Nov 2007] but was stopped by a checkpoint set
up by the Veterinary Service. A quick chat with a local in the coffee
shop revealed another way to the farm. Sure enough, the Vet officials
were more lenient there, allowing this reporter to pass without
question.

Once inside, an odd picture was painted of everyday routine with a
backdrop of abject abnormality. White-clad officials roamed around
hundreds of dead sheep, lying on the ground while some helpers passed
around drinks and water in a plastic bag. Dozens of sheep were loaded
by Vet Service employees onto a digger, which threw them onto a truck
to be dumped later in mass graves nearby.

The Vet Service follows strict procedures when working within the
zone. All workers go back to base after a day's work and burn their
white borrowed clothes. All cars get sprayed on the way out. And yet,
farmers in civilian clothing could go in and out of the farm without
obstruction. Even the Cyprus Mail slipped in, revealing a lax
attitude to the sealing of the exclusion zone.

As the camera snapped away, one of the workers caught wind of my
presence. "Oi! What the hell is that journalist doing there?"

One farmer observing the mass culling warned me to leave immediately
before they got ratty.

On the way out, I owned up to my intrusion, got my shoes and car
sprayed, leaving behind a chilling scene of work, routine and 1900
animals, dead.

Yesterday [14 Nov 2007] 2 more farms in Dromolaxia felt the backlash
of recent FMD outbreak, with around 2000 animals slated for slaughter.

The Veterinary Services yesterday started culling animals from one of
the biggest farms in Cyprus, owned by Kyriacos Kyriacou, estimated to
hold around 1900 sheep, cows, and goats.

Today [15 Nov 2007] they will also be visiting a neighbouring farm to
cull all 80 farm animals there. Officials from the Services visited
the 2 farms early yesterday morning and informed the owners of the
decision.

The announcement naturally provoked reactions and it took 2 hours of
reasoning and the arrival of a strong police force for the farmers to
finally give in.

Kyriacou wanted to see the results of the European Lab tests before
allowing the veterinary services into his farm. Mayhem ensued as
other farmers in the area arrived to offer their support and it was
then that men from the Rapid Reaction Unit (MMAD) arrived to make
sure things didn't get out of hand.

Two hours later and after receiving the certificate from the EU lab,
which showed that at least one sheep from Kyriacou's flock had FMD,
he allowed the culling to begin, but not before reminding the
government of vast losses his sector had suffered.

["Had FMD," most probably, means that the animal was found positive,
at Pirbright -- the EU lab -- by the seroneutralisation test. -
Mod.AS]

The cull will continue today [15 Nov 2007] due to the large number of
animals that need to be slaughtered and it will expand to the
neighbouring farm that belongs to Costas Papadopoulos, who has
already been informed that his 80 sheep will be slaughtered. It was
determined there too that one of his animals was suffering from the
FMD.

[It is not clear if the animal above was tested in Cyprus or at
Pirbright. If at Pirbright, the comment in the previous passage is
applicable. If in Cyprus, the NSP I-ELISA (enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay) 3ABC test has been performed, detecting NSPs
(non structural proteins). -Mod.AS]

Agriculture minister Fotis Fotiou said the decision was made on
Tuesday night [13 Nov 2007] after a lengthy meeting with the vet
services.

However, he said so far there were no other indications for positive
samples of FMD apart from these 2 cases. He added that the services
would continue to check farms for the next few weeks until the
problem is wiped out.

The minister also explained under which circumstances entire flocks
were killed and when only the animals that are affected. He said in
the cases that the disease is confirmed, the EU instructions are
clear that the entire farm's animals should be killed. While if it is
just a positive indication, then only the suspicious animals are
killed.

[The statement above is in need of clarification. Does it mean that
positive NSP I-ELISA 3ABC tests will be regarded as "confirmed",
while negative such tests, combined with positive seroneutralisation,
will be regarded as "positive indication"? - Mod.AS]

Fotiou said animals tested outside the 10 km (6 mi) quarantine zone
had so far "thankfully tested negative" to the disease.

According to an announcement by the Veterinary Services yesterday [14
Nov 2007], tests are carried out on a continuous and daily basis and
4084 samples from 152 [holdings] have been tested so far.

[It would be helpful to obtain figures on the segmentation of the
figure above among the various species included. - Mod.AS]

Animals from 4 farms in the 3 km (2 mi) exclusion zone in Dromolaxia
have been slaughtered.

The tests are carried out by specialists from the EU, the UN special
department for FMD, and a number of Greek vets.

"The Veterinary Services are sending out a plea to everybody for
cooperation in this truly big effort and expressing their thanks to
the state services and organisations for their contribution to these
efforts."

The head of Veterinary Services, Charalambos Kakoyiannis, told state
radio yesterday [15 Nov 2007] that mass culling was the only option
for the 2 farms after all alternatives had been exhausted.

Brussels made it crystal clear that there was no choice than to
proceed with the immediate culling of livestock or risk serious
consequences for Cyprus, including spread of the disease and further
measures taken by the EU, said Kakoyiannis.

Despite taking hard measures against FMD, the authorities have yet to
isolate the virus or locate its origin, the veterinary head warned.
This could take anywhere from days to months, he added.

On a more positive note, 4700 samples from 180 farms have come up
clear of the disease, meaning no FMD has been found outside of the 3
km (2 mi) exclusion zone in Dromolaxia, said Kakoyiannis.

[The Cypriot authorities deserve to be commended for their dedication
and efficiency in swiftly handling the event from its operative
aspects and in safeguarding adequate compensations to the affected
animal owners.

The decision to apply stamping out in the flocks found "infected" on
ground of several positive serological tests in adult animals --
while virus/antigen remaining undetected -- is assumed to be the
outcome of EU policy. Additional commentary, in particular explaining
the decision -- or correcting the said assumption -- will be welcomed.

The commentary to the previous posting in this thread, 20071114.3698,
included the following: "The positive 3ABC tests, detecting Non
Specific Proteins (NSP), may be indicative of a past application of
(partly or poorly purified) inactivated FMD vaccines." 'Non Specific
Proteins' should have read 'Non Structural Proteins'. We are grateful
to Dr Hagai Yadin for drawing out attention to the lapse. - Mod.AS]
