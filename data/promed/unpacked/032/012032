This morning, [6 Aug 2018], health authorities in Los Santos province reported 6 new cases of hantavirus [infections] in the province. The regional coordinator of epidemiology, Carlos Muñoz, said they are 5 adults and a 12 year old child. He stated that of these 6 new cases, only one patient, a 41 year old woman resident of Las Tablas, developed hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and the rest remain as hantavirus fever cases.

Muñoz stated that to date, 55 people have been ill from hantavirus [infections] in Los Santos. Of these, 38 correspond to the Tonosí district, while the remainder are located in the other Los Santos districts, with the exception of Macaracas that has reported no cases to date.

Of the ill individuals, 3 remain hospitalized, 2 in the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital and the 3rd in the Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital. Muñoz stated that always, when one examines the cases of the ill people, one finds risk factors and said that there are conditions that permit the nesting of the [reservoir] rodent and for it to be near the houses, making it much more feasible that the people become infected.

[The number of cases of hantavirus infections continues to increase in Los Santos province, now having reached 55, with most having occurred in the Tonosí district. Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. The specific situations in which these patients acquired the infection are not mentioned, other than the proximity of the rodent reservoir to their houses.

As mentioned before, there is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. However, as noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces and saliva, the source of human infections. - Mod.TY
