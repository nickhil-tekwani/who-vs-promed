Human infection is clearly associated with mycobacterial infection in
fish, most notably _Mycobacterium marinum_. _M. marinum_ causes an
infection often called "swimming pool" or "fish tank granuloma."
These names are derived from the epidemiologic niche of the organism,
occurring 2 to 3 weeks after contact with contaminated water. The
lesions classically begin as small violacious papules on the upper
extremities that progress to shallow, crusty ulcerations and scar
formation. Although usually singular, multiple ascending lesions
resembling sporotrichosis may be seen. Not necessarily associated
with cutaneous disease, deeper soft tissue infection with _M.
marinum_ has been reported in bursae or joints as well.
Most patients are clinically healthy with a previous local hand
injury that becomes infected while cleaning a fish tank, or patients
may sustain scratches or puncture wounds from saltwater fish, shrimp,
or fins contaminated with _M. marinum_. Swimming pools seem to be a
risk only when nonchlorinated. Diagnosis is made from culture and
histologic examination of biopsy material, along with a compatible
history of exposure.
Photographs of cutaneous infections due to _M. marinum_ in humans can
