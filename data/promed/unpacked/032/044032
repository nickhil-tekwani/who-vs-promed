A Rhode Island resident has been diagnosed with a rare tick-borne disease that can cause muscular weakness or even paralysis, state public health officials said Tuesday [29 Jun 2021].

The case of Powassan virus disease was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state Department of Health said in an emailed statement. The case was confirmed in a previously healthy man over the age of 70 from Providence County, who developed neurological symptoms and is now recovering, officials said.

Powassan [virus] is found mostly in the Northeast and the Great Lakes regions of the US and in eastern Canada. Only about 166 cases have been reported in the US in the past 10 years, health officials said.

Initial symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, and weakness. It usually progresses to brain membrane inflammation, altered mental status, seizures, difficulty understanding or speaking, muscular weakness or paralysis, movement disorders, or cranial nerve palsies.

The disease can often lead to hospitalization. There is no vaccine or treatment for Powassan, so preventing exposure to ticks is the best way to avoid the disease.

[This is the 2nd time ProMED has posted a report of a Powassan encephalitis case in Rhode Island. This is not surprising since this year (2021), neighboring Connecticut and nearby Maine have each reported cases of this virus infection.

Human Powassan (POW) virus infections have been recognized in the USA, Canada, and Russia. In the USA, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states, including Rhode Island and the Great Lakes region. A previous ProMED post (Powassan virus encephalitis - USA (05) 20170713.5173071) stated that Powassan virus (POWV, Flaviviridae) is the only North American member of the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses. It is transmitted to small- and medium-sized mammals by _Ixodes scapularis_, _Ixodes cookei_, and several other _Ixodes_ tick species. Cases of Powassan virus infection occur primarily in the late spring, early summer, and mid-fall, when ticks are most active.

As noted in earlier posts, humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50% of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958, when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada.

There are 2 distinct genetic lineages of POWV now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and blacklegged tick virus (lineage II). Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. In the past 8 years, both basic and applied research for POWV disease has intensified, including phylogenetic studies, field surveillance, case studies, and animal model development.

Residents and visitors in Rhode Island and other localities where Powassan virus occurs are well advised to heed CDC advice to avoid tick bites (see https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html). The fact that cases of human Powassan virus infections occur only rarely does not mean that precautions should be ignored. - Mod.TY
