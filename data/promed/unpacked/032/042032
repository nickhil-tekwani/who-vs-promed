Uganda
• No cVDPV2 positive environmental sample was reported this week. There are 2 positive samples linked to the N'Djamena outbreak in Chad reported in 2021.

Ukraine
• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There are 2 cases reported in 2021.
• The GPEI is extremely concerned about the unfolding effects of the current crisis in Ukraine on the country's health system. A functioning health system must be kept neutral and protected from all political or security issues affecting countries, to ensure that people have continued access to critical and essential care. At the same time, we have seen time and again that large-scale population movements, insecurity and hampered access contribute greatly to the emergence and/or spread of infectious diseases, such as polio.
• A national supplemental polio immunization campaign targeting nearly 140 000 children throughout Ukraine who had not been vaccinated against polio began on 1 Feb 2022, but is currently paused, as health authorities have shifted focus towards emergency services. Surveillance to detect and report new cases of polio is also disrupted, increasing the risk of undetected spread of the disease among vulnerable populations. The GPEI is working to urgently develop contingency plans to support Ukraine and prevent further spread of polio.
• The GPEI has a long history of working in a variety of complex environments and will continue to adapt its operations to the reality on the ground, to the degree possible, without compromising on the safety and security of health workers. At the same time, immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries, to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from the current large-scale population movements. It is critical that necessary resources are mobilized and made available to assist with the humanitarian needs, including relief, disease response/prevention efforts both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.

Yemen
• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There are 13 cVDPV2 cases and 3 cVDPV1 cases reported in 2021.

Officially reported WPV1 and cVDPV cases as of [8 Mar 2022]

[This week's report has 3 countries reporting AFP cases associated with cVDPV - cVDPV2 in DR Congo and Nigeria and cVDPV3 in Israel. Other areas with documented cVDPVs through environmental sampling include cVDPV2 in Cote d'Ivoire and Mauritania, and cVDPV3 in the Palestinian Authority.

Unfortunately the charts showing the virus isolates and date of most recent isolate by source (AFP case other humans (non-AFP infected) and environmental samples) for WPVs and cVDPVs for this past week (as of 9 Mar 2022) have not been posted as yet (see https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/). It would be interesting to see the time table of positive samples... did the ESs pre-date the identification of the AFP case (the answer seems to be yes reading between the lines) and did the positive ESs in the Palestinian Authority precede, follow or were basically chronologically the same?

According to the Polio Eradication Initiative website, as of 1 Mar 2022 there had only been 2 countries reporting isolation of cVDPV3 since 2016 - China (positive ES 25 Jan 2021) and Somalia (positive AFP case 7 Sep 2018). Unless there has been undetected circulation in those countries for 1 and 3 years, respectively, it is highly likely this virus is a new outbreak in the region.

Other information not mentioned is whether the cVDPV3 isolates in the Palestinian Authority are genetically related to those identified in Israel.

A map showing Israel and the Palestinian Authority can be found at: https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/israel_map.htm.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus confirmed in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Monday [7 Mar 2022], a case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) was confirmed in an unvaccinated girl aged 3 years and 9 months in Israel. The girl had developed acute flaccid paralysis and upon testing of her stool, poliovirus was confirmed. Further testing of the poliovirus isolated from the girl revealed genetic links to VDPV3-strains detected in environmental samples collected from sites in in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory between September 2021 and January 2022. These isolates, previously classified as ambiguous VDPV3, have now been reclassified as circulating VDPV3 (cVDPV3). This confirms an outbreak of cVDPV3 in both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.

Local health authorities are conducting field, epidemiological and virological investigations, to determine more clearly the source and origin of the isolated virus, and potential risk of further spread associated with it.

Experts from the headquarters, regional and country offices of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partnership, which includes WHO, Rotary International (RI), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI), are working together to help ensure an appropriate response and cessation of this outbreak.

Detection of this cVDPV3 underscores the importance of strong disease surveillance and high population immunity levels, in order to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus introduction or emergence.

The GPEI partnership urges all health authorities to enhance surveillance for poliovirus and implement enhanced vaccination response to prevent further transmission, so that no child is at risk of lifelong paralysis from a disease that can so easily be prevented. GPEI is committed to assisting the health authorities in their efforts to stop the cVDPV3 outbreak.
