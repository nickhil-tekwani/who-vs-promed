In light of the discussion on anthrax in elephants in India the following
may be of interest.
In 1998 an anthrax outbreak was diagnosed in elephants in the remote
Linyanti area of Chobe National Park in Northern Botswana. The diagnosis
was made in the field from a fresh carcass and later confirmed at the
National Veterinary Laboratory, Gaborone.
There are a few notable features of this outbreak. It occurred during the
late winter, the dry season in southern Africa. Due to the large population
of elephant in northern Botswana there is tremendous pressure on the
ecosystem with significant compromise to ecosystem and wildlife health,
especially along the swamps and rivers. This concentration of elephants had
(in 1998) resulted in the habitat being devoid of grass with significant
damage to the various trees, especially mopane. With the lack of grass the
earth was a dust bowl extending many kilometres away from water, many of
the elephant carcasses were found close to water holes or the edge of the
swamp. Just the action of elephants walking past carcasses on the way to
water, or milling around and investigating recent deaths, would stir up
dust and anthrax spores, in this instance grazing may not be that significant.
Of more importance in controlling an outbreak in a remote area is how to
dispose of carcasses? Even under ideal situations it may take 24 or more
hours to burn a carcass, requiring major manpower to collect wood to burn.
In one case, a fire was started but due to lack of manpower and the fact
that it started to rain, the fire failed to destroy the carcass. In the
morning several hyaena, one lion and numerous vultures were seen at the
carcass, it had been opened in several areas with body fluids trailing away
from the carcass.
In the 1998 outbreak over 36 carcasses were burnt through a combined effort
of the Wildlife Department, Department of Animal health and Production and
others. Is this effective in preventing dissemination of the spores? What
else could have been done?

[It is a temptation to be the distant "expert" but I have copied this
posting to real wildlife experts in Africa for comment. In the meanwhile
... hot-dry weather is frequently associated with extensive sudden wildlife
(& livestock) outbreaks and is presumably related to the reduction in
immunity under this climatic stress. Peter Turnbull & Paula Lindique
measured the possibility of spore aerosols in the Etosha and though they
recovered spores in dust down-wind the levels were always way below any
possible ID50. The proximity of carcases to water would suggest a
recurrence of the standard contaminated water-hole / river-bed-pond model
of the Kruger. Dealing with elephant carcasses is always a problem,
frequently exacerbated by the absence of adequate firewood or liquid fuels.
Burning infected carcasses is normally the optimum decision in livestock &
game outbreaks, and the success of the Chobe park people in burning 36
elephant carcasses is outstanding. Some have recommended covering elephant
carcasses with thorn brush to discourage scavengers. Putrification with the
normal acidification of the carcass tissues that accompanies it will
rapidly kill the vegetative organisms. So the environmental contamination
around an unopened carcass may be relatively modest. -Mod. MHJ
