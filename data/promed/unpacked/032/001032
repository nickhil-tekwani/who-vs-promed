Malaria cases in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Western Pacific Region, which includes the Philippines, declined by 43% to 1.7 million last year [2019] from the year 2000, according to estimates by the group.

Estimated deaths from malaria -- a preventable and treatable disease that continues to kill hundreds of thousands of people yearly -- also fell by 52% to 3200 during the period, the WHO said in a report posted on its website.

"Over the same period, malaria case incidence reduced from 5 to 2 cases per 1000 population at risk, and malaria mortality rate reduced from 1 to 0.4 deaths per 100 000 population at risk," it said.

Papua New Guinea accounted for 80% of all cases of malaria -- an intermittent and remittent fever caused by a protozoan parasite that invades the red blood cells -- in the region.

The WHO said of the 10 countries, Cambodia, China Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Malaysia are on target to achieve a more than 40% reduction in cases. South Korea and Viet Nam are expected to cut the number of cases by as much as 40% this year [2020].

Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu have experienced an increase in cases since 2015.

"All countries are on track to reduce the malaria mortality rate by at least 40% by 2020, except for Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and Solomon Islands," the WHO said.

Of the estimated cases in 2019, 79% came from Papua New Guinea, 9.5% from Solomon Islands, 8.1% from Cambodia, and 2.4% from the Philippines. The rest came from Laos, Viet Nam, South Korea, and Vanuatu. China and Malaysia did not report any cases.

Globally, there were about 229 million malaria cases and about 409 000 deaths last year [2019], down from 238 million cases and 736,000 deaths in 2000.

[The news highlighted above comes from the WHO World Malaria Report 2020 which has just been released (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240015791).

It is good to see a continued reduction in cases. What is in particular important is the situation in Laos, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and eastern Thailand where resistance to artemisinins and their combinations has been increasing over the past decade. This is described in detail for the Greater Mekong Subregion on page 40 and following pages figures 4.2 and 4.3. Malaria eradication in these countries is particularly important as probably the only way to prevent artemisinin resistance to spread, in particular to Africa. - Mod.EP]
