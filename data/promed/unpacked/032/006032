India: Hepatitis E Virus Responsible for Jaundice Outbreak in Maharashtra
---------------------------------------------------
Even as the number of jaundice cases in Baramati went up to 348 and in
alandi to 67, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) has identified
hepatitis E virus (HEV) as the cause of the epidemic. NIV officer-in-charge
A.C. Mishra said 5 samples had tested positive for the virus. "Actually,
this is the 1st time it has taken an epidemic proportion. Normally, the
virus is in an endemic form with stray cases," Mishra told Newsline. He
confirmed that the virus spread through contaminated water. "This (positive
test for hepatitis E virus) definitely means that the water supply has been
contaminated due to leaks in the sewage line," he said. Mishra said as an
immediate measure, the leaking drainage lines should be repaired. He said
they were yet to receive samples from Alandi. "The NIV team has visited
Alandi," Mishra said.
Meanwhile, the district health authorities have restricted the sale of ice.
"Hoteliers, sugarcane, and fruit juice stall owners have been strictly
warned not to use ice," Zilla Parishad CEO Rajendra Chavan said. Chavan,
along with district health officer B Nanavare, visited Baramati, Alandi and
Sherewadi on Monday. Nanavare said blocks of ice being used at sugarcane
juice stalls were contaminated at Baramati and Alandi. Nanavare said a
door-to-door survey was under way at Alandi. "However, it is a mild form of
jaundice and there has been no hospitalisation of patients," he said.
Private doctors at Alandi have been asked to report jaundice cases to the
health authorities.
When contacted in Baramati, Silver Jubilee Government Hospital's medical
superintendent Vijay Kokane said though there were only 40 patients
admitted to the hospital, a door-to-door surveillance had shown an increase
in the number of persons infected with jaundice. "There are nearly 348
patients infected by the disease," he said. Deputy director of health
services (Pune region) Y H Doiphode said that on Monday alone 56 new cases
had been identified.
The health authorities have also decided to immunise pregnant women against
jaundice, irrespective of whether they had been infected with the virus, by
administering immunoglobin. They have also asked people to boil water
before using it for consumption.
