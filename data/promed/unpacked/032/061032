The cholera outbreak in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, continues to spread. The latest official statistics report 733 cholera cases. The majority of cases continue to be treated in the main Ministry of Health hospital in the city, Juba Teaching Hospital, where MSF has sent 4 staff to support their cholera treatment activities.

MSF opened a dedicated 100-bed cholera treatment center in the Gudele 2 district on Sat 24 May 2014, and will open another treatment center and one or more oral rehydration points in the coming days. The plan is to have enough capacity to treat all patients if the epidemic accelerates, and to reduce some of the pressure on the very busy Juba Teaching Hospital. By the morning of Wed 28 May 2014, the Gudele 2 treatment centre had seen 88 patients, with around 20 new patients arriving each day. As news of the new treatment center spreads, we expect more patients to come, as it is close to some of the areas of Juba that are most affected by the outbreak.

Further cholera treatment supplies are being prepared, ready for sending to South Sudan in case the number of cholera patients rises sharply.

At least one person is reported dead and 3 others admitted with suspected cholera in Yei on Wed 28 May 2014, the Catholic Radio Network reported.

Yei town lies to the southwest of Juba in Central Equatoria State, near the borders with Uganda and Congo. County Disease Surveillance Officer Michael Lugala said they recorded four cases in the Tarawa neighborhood of Yei. He said that one victim was in Juba before developing the disease. The officer also pointed out that county health facilities lack stand-by drugs to treat emergency cases.

A cholera outbreak in Juba, north of Yei, has affected about 800 people so far. The government is working together with the World Health Organization, MSF, Medair, UNICEF, Oxfam, and other health organizations to contain the disease.

Re: county health facilities lack stand-by drugs to treat emergency cases; expensive drugs are not always necessary, many cases can be cured using home-made oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution. A simple recipe for this is at http://rehydrate.org/images/diy3.gif. - Mod.JW]
