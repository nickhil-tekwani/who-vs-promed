---------------------------------------------------------------
Hop (_Humulus lupulus_), Cannabaceae family, is commercially grown in many countries for the brewing and pharmaceutical industries. In Slovenia, 90 percent of production is exported.

Since 2007, symptoms similar to _Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd) infection have been observed in several hop gardens in the Savinja Valley [Savinjska Region] and Koroska Region. Symptoms include stunting, leaf curl, small cone formation, and dry root rot. In the 1st year of finding the disease, the incidence varied from 1 to 30 percent and increased by as much as 10 percent each subsequent year, predominantly along plant rows.

For leaves and cones of symptomatic and asymptomatic plants, reverse transcription-PCR specific for HSVd gave a single product from symptomatic plants with expected lengths of around 300 bp, but no product from asymptomatic plants. 5 sequences were obtained with 96 to 99 percent identity with various HSVd variants (grapevine, citrus, and cucumber) reported in GenBank.

HSVd has been previously reported in hop in Japan, South Korea, North America, and China. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the detection of HSVd on hop in Europe.

Strict phytosanitary measures have been taken to prevent further spread and to eradicate HSVd infections.

[_Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd) is the only species of genus _Hostuviroid_ (family _Pospiviroidae_). It was 1st described in the 1940s as the causal agent of hop stunt disease in Japan. Since then it has been found worldwide infecting a wide range of both woody and herbaceous plants including citrus, stone fruit species, grapevine, and pomegranate with symptoms ranging from latent to severe in different hosts. Specific sequence variants have been isolated from hop, almond, apricot, citrus, cucumber, grapevine, peach, pear, and plum. Economically important diseases caused by different strains of HSVd include hop stunt, citrus cachexia, cucumber pale fruit, peach dapple and plum dapple.

Three major phylogenetic groups have been suggested, namely plum-type, hop-type, and citrus-type isolates. Recombinants of these have also been identified. HSVd strains can vary between ca. 297 (hop and grapevine strains) and 303 nucleotides (cucumber strain). HSVd susceptibility may vary widely between host species and cultivars.

Hop stunt disease is caused by the specific hop strains of HSVd, which have been reported to be very variable. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stunting, and loss of plant vigour leading to yield losses. Infection also alters biochemical compounds within the plant that are responsible for flavour development during brewing. The disease was confined to Japan and North Korea, but in 2004 it was discovered in the USA and in 2007 in China. In Europe, an incursion of hop strains was reported from Germany earlier on hop plants imported from the US but the consignment was destroyed in quarantine. Like most viroids, HSVd can be spread by mechanical means, such as contaminated cutting tools and with infected plants or cuttings. Disease management may include phytosanitation (removal of infected plants, disinfection of orchard tools) and use of certified clean planting material.
