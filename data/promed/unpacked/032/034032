Schmallenberg virus [SBV] has now been detected for the 1st time in Norway. The virus was detected in biting midges and has not been found in cattle herds. Fisheries and Veterinary Research now implementing measures to assess the risks of infection.

To get a better overview of infection status in Norwegian livestock, the Veterinary Institute is examining bulk milk for SBV antibodies. Samples from all dairy farmers in coastal areas from Rogaland to the Swedish border will be collected. In herds with positive test results, individual animals will be tested and there will be further investigation into the surrounding farms to see if the infection has spread.

The disease was first discovered in Germany in 2011 and quickly spread to several European countries. SBV has also been detected in cattle in Sweden and Denmark.

[With the discovery of SBV in culicoids [midges] in Norway, the number of European countries where this emerging teratogenic orthobunyavirus has been detected since its initial discovery in Germany, Netherlands, and Belgium in the summer/fall of 2011, has risen to 15. The updated list includes Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Luxembourg, UK, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, Poland, Finland, and Norway. It remains to be seen if SBV has already infected, in Norway, susceptible animal species (cattle, sheep, goats). The active vector season will probably continue during November.

According to the data collected in the UK in sheep earlier this year (2012), the overall impact of SBV on British farms was found to be, so far, relatively limited (see http://tinyurl.com/8z26b44). When infection occurs in animals that are not pregnant, the impact is very limited and protects against SBV affecting future offspring.

However, the fast and efficient spread of SBV (and earlier, BTV-8) in Europe is alarming. Fortunately, SBV is -- most likely -- not zoonotic. Other culicoid-borne viruses, which might be similarly introduced in the future, may have a different pathogenicity profile in animal and, in a worse scenario, in man. The epidemiology of SBV deserves a thorough study.

SBV is one of the topics to be addressed during IMED 2013 (Vienna, February 2013). - Mod.AS
