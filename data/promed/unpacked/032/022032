Kiribati's Ministry of Health and Medical Services has confirmed that 4 children under the age of 5 were reported to have died from the diarrhea outbreak currently experienced on South Tarawa and Betio [in the Gilbert Islands]. Director of Public Health from the Ministry, Dr Teatao Tiira, told Radio Kiribati News the outbreak is affecting both children and adults.

Dr Teatao said a special unit has been set up at the Nawerewere and Betio hospitals to deal with the increasing cases of diarrhea reported daily to the hospitals. He said hygienic practices such as washing of hands daily before eating, boiling of water, serving and eating food while they are hot and constant preservation of food to keep flies away are some of the many [measures] people should [take] daily during this diarrhea outbreak.

[The etiology of this outbreak is not known and could be viral, bacterial (including cholera) or parasitic.

Kiribati (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiribati), officially the Republic of Kiribati, is an island nation in the central tropical Pacific Ocean. The permanent population is just over 100 000 (2011) on 800 square kilometres (about 310 square miles). The nation is composed of 32 atolls and one raised coral island, Banaba, dispersed over 3.5 million square kilometres (about 1 351 000 square miles), straddling the equator, and bordering the International Date Line at its easternmost point.

The name Kiribati is the local pronunciation of Gilberts, which derives from the main island chain, named the Gilbert Islands after the British explorer Thomas Gilbert, who discovered them. The capital, South Tarawa, consists of a number of islets connected through a series of causeways, located in the Tarawa archipelago. Kiribati became independent from the United Kingdom in 1979. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the IMF and the World Bank, and became a full member of the United Nations in 1999.

The island nation is the setting for the book The Sex Lives of Cannibals: Adrift in the Equatorial Pacific by J. Maarten Troost, which is about neither sex nor cannibals but rather a non-fiction, humorous account of a couple's State Department assignment to the country. - Mod.LL
