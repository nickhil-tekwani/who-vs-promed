Update on the avian influenza situation as of 16 Sep 2004: country situation
-----------------------------------------------
Thailand:
Suspected cases of HPAI infection were reported, on 16 Sep 2004, in
ducks in Supan buri; native chickens in Chaceangsao, Kalasin,
Lopburi, and Udornthani; and ducks and native chickens in Sakaew
Provinces. An outbreak in broilers was confirmed in Nong nangnual,
Uthai thani Province, on 16 Sep 2004, and 14 459 birds were culled.
Outbreaks were also reported during August [2004] in Narathiwat
Province, which is adjacent to the Malaysian State of Kelantan.
On 9 Sep 2004, the Thai Ministry of Public Health announced the death
of an 18-year-old man in Prachinburi Province due to H5N1 infection.
The man was a fighting cock breeder whose farm had been infected with
H5N1 HPAI. As of 8 Sep 2004, a total of 27 outbreaks in 11 provinces
are subject to the 21 day-surveillance period imposed by the
Department of Livestock Development (DLD), Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives. The National Committee on Avian Influenza
eradication reviewed the results of a 2-month study on the use of
vaccines, and, on 15 Sep 2004, the National AI Task Force announced
that it will maintain the ban on vaccination of all kinds of poultry.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives launched a training
program on AI control strategies, including compensation for
destroyed fowl, for Ministry officials throughout Thailand.
Viet Nam:
Quang Tri Province in the center (19 Aug 2004), Hai Duong Province in
the north (20 Aug 2004), and Ho Chi Minh City (15 Sep 2004) reported
new H5N1 infections, for a total of 13 provinces that have reported
H5N1 HPAI since July [2004]. Some 2500 quail in Hai Duong, and 100
chickens in Quang Tri, were culled. In Ho Chi Minh City, samples from
35 flocks, with a total of 34 900 ducks, tested positive for H5 AI
virus, but all the fowl were found to be healthy. These ducks were
located in Cu Chi, Nha Be, Thu Duc, and No. 9 districts of Ho Chi
Minh city. Veterinary authorities isolated the infected flocks and
made arrangements for the birds to be culled. In Ho Chi Minh City,
421 households raise more than 881 000 poultry, of which, 53 percent
are quail, 32 percent are chickens, and 15 percent are ducks. The
death of 180 ducks, in a flock of 2000, was also reported in Phan
Rang, Ninh Thuan Province.
Malaysia:
A total of 8 H5N1 HPAI outbreaks were reported in northern Kelantan
state. One of the latest outbreaks was identified in Kampung Laut, in
Bachok district, which is 5 km outside the 10 km quarantine zone.

[2] Thailand: exceptions to vaccine ban

Government bans flu vaccine for poultry: go-ahead for rare bird and
fighting cock trials
-----------------------------------------------
The government's decision to ban use of bird flu vaccines for
poultry, while agreeing to experiments on rare pet birds and fighting
cocks, has left chicken exporters breathing sighs of relief, after
fears the vaccine could cause the industry to collapse.
Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisaeng, who chairs the committee in
charge of tackling the bird flu problem, said the meeting members
agreed on the ban for both public health and economic reasons. The
meeting of agencies responsible for bird flu eradication took into
account the likely impact of the vaccine on exports, the country's
disease control capability, and overall economic productivity. The
pros and cons were weighed carefully, he said.
The issue has been bitterly divisive, pitching owners of prized
fighting cocks against chicken farmers, particularly those raising
broilers for export. Owners of fighting cocks insisted the vaccine
would build up poultry immunity, which would make the country safe
from a bird flu pandemic. However, chicken exporters said major
importers, like the European Union (EU), would ban vaccinated
chickens.
Mr. Chaturon promised a study would be made of vaccine use in the
event of a serious bird flu outbreak. A serious outbreak meant
"uncontrollable and expansive" spread of the infection, he said. He
said international organizations dealing with communicable diseases
in animals felt the vaccine would be useful if and when flu levels
reached epidemic proportions. The current bird flu outbreak had not
reached a critical stage, and the vaccine was therefore deemed
unnecessary. The meeting members thought the vaccine should be
administered on a trial basis to rare pet birds and fighting cocks.
But, such experiments would be strictly supervised by state agencies.
International organizations and trading partner countries would be
consulted prior to the experiments being undertaken, and the
government would exchange vital vaccine information with them.
The deputy prime minister said the Food and Agriculture Organization
had neither supported nor advised against vaccine use. It had said
that vaccination may, and should, proceed in the event an outbreak
became severe. The experiments would also boost development of the
country's bird flu surveillance system and heighten the level of
knowledge necessary to fight the virus. The meeting members also
discussed various ways to enhance the effectiveness of post-outbreak
measures, including quarantine zoning and a ban on the transport of
poultry.
Veterinarian Songkram Luengthongkham, chairman of the Thailand
Institute of Veterinarians, said vaccination could accelerate virus
mutation.
Panya Chotitawan, president of Saha Farms, and chairman of the
Broiler Raisers for Exporting Association, welcomed the ban on
vaccine use. He said it would help the government better concentrate
on integrating approaches in trying to control the disease. "We've
wasted time discussing something nonsensical and made hardly any
headway on control," said Mr. Panya.
Prathana Ngamwongwan, president of the Indigenous Chickens for
Development and Conservation Association, denounced the decision as
politically driven. However, he said he was optimistic the vaccine
might eventually be given the go-ahead, judging from the government's
green light for vaccination experiments on rare birds and fighting
cocks.
The EU said yesterday [Wed 15 Sep 2004] that it had extended a ban on
imports of chicken meat and pet birds from Thailand, and other Asian
countries hit by avian flu, to 31 Mar 2005, AFP reported.
New outbreaks have shown the crisis is far from over. Other countries
concerned are Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia,
Pakistan, South Korea, and Viet Nam, the EU's executive commission
said in a statement.
The EU decided in January [2004] to suspend imports of poultry from
Thailand to prevent the disease from being introduced into Europe.
Shortly afterwards, it suspended imports of pet birds, such as
parrots, from Southeast Asia.
