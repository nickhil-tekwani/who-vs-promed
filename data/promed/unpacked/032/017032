[Concerning "CJD and various tissues (02)"]
Oz wrote that "at least some clinically BSE affected cattle brains...were
consumed by humans in Britain before 1987," and concluded that nvCJD
concerns "seem quite unwarranted and grossly out of proportion."
I don't agree:
* It was not only brain tissue. From the mid 80s and up to, at least, 1989,
infected carcasses en masse were entering the human food chain in Britain.
Included were cattle organs such as brain, spinal cord, spleen, thymus,
intestines and tonsils.
* Action was not taken in 1987. These specified offals were mainly, but not
totally, removed from the human food chain in November 1989.
Oz continues:
>Those of us that
>consumed British beef during the 80's are either infected or not and the
>safeguards that were put in place in 87 to 90 have certainly reduced the
>original tiny risk many millionfold to a quite insignificant figure, if not
>indistinguishable from zero.
* There is no scientific evidence to show that the risk originally was "tiny".
* There's no evidence that the safeguards put in place 1887-90 reduced the
risks "to a quite insignificant figure, if not indistinguishable from zero."
