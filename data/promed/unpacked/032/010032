[The following six comments have been received in response to Dr Jon

positive results to be expected among patients with no evidence of liver
disease: see ProMED-mail post archived as "Hepatitis A - USA: update:

I am a Nurse Epidemiologist who has been doing Hepatitis A virus IgM and
IgG tests as part of occupational exposures for the past 16 years. I have
never seen Hepatitis A virus IgM positives except in individuals who could
document the illness.

Re: Hepatitis A Virus IgM Antibody Prevalence
---------------------------------------------
The presence of IgM antibody -- as the only immunoglobulin isotype detected
in an assay -- usually means a recent case of infection. However, it has
been demonstrated that pure polysacharride antigens will induce only an IgM
response. Plus low "intensity" chronic infections -- in animal studies --
only produced an IgM response. The issue/opportunity is that we know very
little of the dynamics/mechanisms of the human immune response to
infectious agents. Additional comments [to Dr. Finnerty at <fin@nih.gov>]
are welcomed.

Re: Hepatitis A Virus IgM Antibody Prevalence
---------------------------------------------
In a couple of years of work on viral hepatitis surveillance in north
central Texas for the state health department I can recall seeing only one
Hepatitis A virus IgM positive result that didn't come with very elevated
liver functions attached, out of several thousand submitted. Is Dr.
Rosenberg perhaps confusing this test with the hepatitis A IgG or hepatitis
A virus total antibody tests, which are said (e.g. the Red Book) to be
positive for about 20% of the US population who have no evidence of current
acute viral hepatitis (i.e. presenting a serologic history of remote
previous exposure)?

I know one of the ProMed-mail moderators offers stern caveats to the use of
single serum IgM testing for diagnosing most diseases. Yet it would seem
from my public health surveillance experience that the hepatitis A virus
IgM is among the most reliable IgM tests out there.

The biggest problem I encountered with the IgM test was the occasional slow
converter. Since the titer level for a positive test is set fairly high,
once in awhile you'd have an icteric patient who was highly suspect (e.g.
household contact of a confirmed case) and who would test negative on the
first test. On two of the three occasions I can think of, this was an older
person who might therefore have had a slower-moving immune system. One of
these two was re-tested and was positive. The third was a child that stayed
negative through three tests, but still managed to pass it on to family
members, who did test IgM positive.

Re: Hepatitis A Virus IgM Antibody Prevalence
---------------------------------------------
Can you clarify what you mean regarding the "addition of hepatitis A virus
IgM antibody to a screening panel for liver disease"? As you know, when a
patient is seen by a physician with what appears to be acute hepatitis,
their serum or plasma is sent to the laboratory to be tested for IgM
anti-HAV if the clinician suspects a recent hepatitis A virus infection.
The physician usually asks for an acute hepatitis panel, but the various
tests are individually run. I am unclear as to what you are describing and
how it could be a factor in the outcome of the test.

Regarding the specificity of the IgM anti-HAV test, I am glad that you said
that "up to" 10 percent of healthy persons will have a positive IgM
anti-HAV test, because the percent is closer to 0 in my experience. Abbott
Laboratories would say that it is <0.1 percent. My estimate is based on
considerable experience testing samples for hepatitis A virus (and other
hepatitis agents), including the development of some of the initial tests
for this virus. Indeed, I can't recall detecting any false-positive
reactions in a properly performed assay nor do I recall being asked to
render an opinion in which the IgM anti-HAV was considered to be falsely
positive. This may partly be due to the fact that the sample is diluted to
about 1:4000 for the assay thereby removing any problematic components such
as rheumatoid factor. Following an acute infection, the IgM anti-HAV
response usually declines to non-detectable levels within 3 to 6 months,
although the antibody can persist for over 200 days in about 14 percent of
patients. The range is reported to be <30 to >420 days. Thus, the detection
of this antibody more precisely indicates a recent infection which could
have occurred more than a year ago. Of course, if the patient is jaundiced
or is acutely ill, the presumption is that this represents acute disease.

Re: Hepatitis A Virus IgM Antibody Prevalence
---------------------------------------------
I am sending this comment without recourse to specific literature, but I
would expect false positive hepatitis A virus IgM antibody rates to be less
than 2 percent at the most. In routine clinical practice we screen many
patients for acute hepatitis A, and false positives are occasionally found
(not 1 in 10), usually in people with positive rheumatoid factor tests. I
am sure you will receive more informed comment on the performance of
different kits from laboratory based colleagues.

opinion favours the interpretation that any background of false-positive
