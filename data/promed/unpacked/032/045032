[Since the start of the (continuing) 2022 FMD epizootic in Israel, and as of 16 Mar 2022, the disease has been confirmed in 18 holdings (16 cattle, 2 sheep). Most outbreaks, affecting 14 holdings in 4 moshavs (collective villages), are clustered in the north-western part of Hazafon district; map at https://tinyurl.com/ys5f9nhs. Kfar Yehoshua, indicated as "Beit Hankin", and the other 3 villages, are visible on the map.

Israel's FMD policy includes annual mass vaccinations of large and small ruminants; young bovines are boosted during their 1st 18 months. In most of the recent foci, clinically affected animals were young or had last been vaccinated more than 12 months earlier. However, in Kibbutz Kalia's dairy operation (south Jordan Valley) all cattle had reportedly been vaccinated in November 2021, 4 months before the current outbreak, which has affected all ages. It has, therefore, been debated if the vaccine applied confers full/durable immunity against the circulating virus strain (FMDV O, topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia 2, sublineage ANT-10; see https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2021-00020-PAT-GTR-O-O_001.pdf). The same genotype caused the 2010/2011 outbreak in Bulgaria, introduced from Turkey, likely with the involvement of wild boar (Archive number 20110522.1556).

In an earlier circular of the VSAH, dated 19 Jan 2022, information on FMD outbreaks in the West Bank, obtained from the Palestinian veterinary services, was made public. Among the locations: Ein al-Hilweh (Jordan Valley, Tubas subdistrict), Yata (Hebron subdistrict), Jenin subdistrict, and Salfit subdistrict.

FMD vaccine matching tests, applicable in the current situation, in case performed, have not as yet become available. It deserves to be noted that vaccine matching data, performed by the WRLFMD, present antibody responses in cattle after a single vaccination (typically 21 days after vaccination). The WRLFMD advises that the long-term performance of FMD vaccines after a 2nd or multiple dose of vaccine should be monitored using post-vaccination serological testing. - Mod.AS
