Residents of Saraf Omra locality in North Darfur are complaining about the high incidence of death and infections caused by fever, diarrhea and abdominal chest pain, reported Radio Dabanga on Mon 24 Dec [2012]. They said that the fever is accompanied by vomiting and headache.

Dr. Shafie Abdalshafi declared that people tend to confuse symptoms of yellow fever with cases only related to diarrhea and vomiting. Abdalshafi is the head of the emergency team investigating the emergence of yellow fever at the Saraf Omra hospital and denied that new cases have been diagnosed recently.

Nevertheless, the doctor told Radio Dabanga that another emergency team arrived at the locality from El-Fasher on Sunday [23 Dec 2012]. He explained the team will join the medical group already stationed in the area "to complete epidemiological investigation into cases and complaints of local citizens."

According to Abdalshafi, the results of the investigation will be included in a medical report that will be submitted to the ministry of health of North Darfur.

In a related event, several Saraf Omra residents have also complained to Radio Dabanga about the scarcity of health care and medicine in the locality. They said that the high price of medicines is forcing them to use traditional herbs for treatment, while noting that they must pay at least 30 Sudanese pounds (SDG) [USD 6.80] for drugs. In addition, a doctor's visit costs 5 SDG and a medical check-up 45 SDG [USD 10.20], citizens claimed.

At the same time, a statement by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) claimed the organization vaccinated 750 000 people against yellow fever in Darfur in collaboration with the Sudanese federal ministry of health.

The 1st phase of the campaign reportedly targeted 2.2 million people and ended on 4 Dec 2012. It was launched by the Sudanese health authorities, and the MSF brought medical and logistical assistance, it was stated.

According to the MSF, it supported the campaign in 5 localities in North and Central Darfur, including Saraf Omra, El-Seraif, Wadi Saleh, Azum, and Zalingei.

"We had very little time to prepare," said MSF's Kevin Coppock. "Fortunately, this year [2012], we set up an emergency response program. Within 24 hours, we were able to mobilize emergency teams, drugs, and medical supplies. The organization claims it is currently tending to 68 patients suspected of having yellow fever in North Darfur.
In addition, it claims that joint medical teams have also treated 72 patients suspected of having yellow fever in El-Geniena hospital, West Darfur, and 62 patients in Zalingei hospital, Central Darfur.

Drugs, medical supplies, vaccination training, and health promotion teams are provided in Saraf Omra and El-Seraif by the MSF. The organization also provided a mobile team to conduct yellow fever active case detection, vector control, and health education in Zalingei.

According to figures provided by the federal ministry of health, as of 19 Dec [2012], 836 people were suspected of being infected with yellow fever in Darfur, the MSF report indicated.

[The yellow fever outbreak continues in North, Central and West Darfur. The statement above indicating that there were no new YF cases diagnosed must relate only to that hospital, since MSF health teams are treating 68 cases of suspected YF in North Darfur currently. Clearly, there are 2 outbreaks of unrelated diseases going on in North Darfur, YF and a different one involving diarrhea, which is not a YF symptom. The 18 Dec 2012 report from the WHO indicated that 1.2 million of the targeted 2.2 million Darfur inhabitants have been vaccinated so far. It is good to learn that MSF teams are involved in surveillance and vector control. To date, there have been no reports of the status of YF virus vectors in the Darfur states.
