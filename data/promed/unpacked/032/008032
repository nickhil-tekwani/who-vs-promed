Poland Reports First Case of Mad Cow Disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
WARSAW: Poland detected its first case of mad cow disease near the
southern border with Slovakia on Sat 04 2002, but the country's chief
veterinarian called it an isolated incident.
Poland had been considered a "low-risk" country for mad cow, which is
believed to cause the human brain-wasting disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease, which has killed more than 100 people in western Europe,
mainly Britain.
Poland, an exporter of beef to the European Union and Eastern
Europe's largest farm economy, checks all cattle older than 30 months
for mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
before slaughter.
But the European Commission wrote in a report in Feb 2002 that it was
concerned about the ability of Poland, expected to join the EU in
less than two years, to detect BSE and contain the disease from
spreading if an outbreak occurred.
"There is no cause for panic because after tests were conducted, the
(infected) cow was isolated and, along with others from the herd,
taken off the market. So consumers are safe," chief veterinarian
Piotr Kolodziej told private Radio Zet.
"BSE is not like (the fast-spreading virus) Ebola or foot-and-mouth
disease. So if it's under control -- and it is under control in
Poland -- I think the EU will also approach this situation properly
and conclude that things are being handled correctly," Kolodziej
said. Kolodziej said the infected nine-year-old cow -- found in a
slaughterhouse in the village of Mochnaczka Wyzna just 6 miles from
the Slovak border -- was the first positive BSE test result in more
than 100 000 checks throughout Poland.
Interior Minister Krzysztof Janik said police and veterinary services
were investigating the source of the disease, which usually
originates from bone-meal-based feed.
"Last night the case was confirmed and from this morning police and
vet services have been mobilized to track down the source of the
disease," Janik told public television.
PAP news agency reported that the slaughterhouse where the
contaminated cow was found had been disinfected Saturday.
"The remains of the BSE-infected cow and three other carcasses will
be destroyed by veterinary inspectors in accordance with accepted
procedures," the head veterinarian of the southern Malopolska region
told PAP.

[From the said preliminary information, it is not clear if the
9-year-old cow showed clinical symptoms of BSE before slaughter or
was detected as positive by the post-slaughter BSE testing in random
sampled bovines. Additional information might be forthcoming.
Provided the 9-year-old cow was born in Poland, it could have been
infected by infected meat & bone meals (MBMs) throughout its life,
probably at least 3 years ago. In principle, such MBMs could have
been either of local or of foreign origin. Since the notification is
emphasizing the short distance from the Slovak border, this might be
an indication of a reference by the Polish authorities to the fact
that Slovakia is included in the list of 19 BSE-infected countries.
The first BSE case was detected in Slovakia in 2001, 4 additional
cases identified until the end of the year.
The only plausible connection of the Polish case with other countries
-- Slovakia included -- could have been the import (or smuggling) of
BSE-contaminated MBMs. This first case of BSE in Poland leaves
several questions unanswered, the main one, obviously, is tracing the
source of infection. For the annual rate of BSE incidence in the
infected countries, the reader is referred to OIE's web-site:
