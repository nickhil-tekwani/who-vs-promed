Khentii province affected with FMD
----------------------------------
A fresh outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] has been detected in the
north eastern province of Khentii, as the Government tries to fight against
the disease in Sukhbaatar and Dornod provinces for the last few months.

According to the Veterinary and Breeding Authority of Mongolia (VBAM), the
epicenter is 35 km [28 mi] from Bor-Undur in Darkhan Soum, Khentii.

Out of 64 cows and 540 sheep and goats tested, 17 infected cows have been
slaughtered and buried immediately. The provincial authorities together
with VABM set 6 controlling posts on main roads from and to the epicenter.
Disinfection was undertaken in a 7000 hectare [17 300 acres] area
surrounding the epicenter and of 122 people and 47 vehicles passing these 6
posts. The inspection of suspicious cattle continues in neighboring soums
[townships] of Khentii and Dornogobi provinces, said Orgil, a VBAM head.

So far, 25 125 heads of livestock and 125 pigs in Darkhan Soum [have been]
vaccinated, which is only 14.5 per cent of the planned vaccination.

As of 8 Nov 2010, FMD in Dornod and Sukhbaatar provinces forced the
authorities and herding families [to] eliminate over 24 000 heads of
livestock and the government has spent MNT 3.2 billion [approx. USD 2.5
million] for its efforts to fight against the disease.

[Mongolia's last report to the OIE concerning its most recent, reoccurring
FMD epizootic in 2 eastern provinces, which started on 26 Aug 2010, was
submitted on 16 Oct 2010. According to the said (follow-up report no. 2),
"no new outbreaks" have been recorded since the previous (no. 1) follow-up
report of 11 Sep 2010.

Since 16 Oct 2010, several media reports have described the continuing, or
rather increased spread of the disease (see also ProMED-mail archives
20101027.3904, 20101025.3873 and 20101020.3800). The current report informs
about its spread westwards into a 3rd province, Khentii (Hentiy in the
administrative map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/mongolia_pol96.jpg>).

The current spreading epizootic, reportedly also characterised by unusually
high morbidity rate (100 per cent in 2 affected locations -- see
ProMED-mail 20101027.3904) requires a reporting level which, I hope, will
match Mongolia's past reporting record.

On top of the anticipated updating, it will also help to obtain
quantitative and qualitative (efficacy and safety) data on the FMD
vaccine(s) applied in Mongolia for mass vaccinations since the appearance
of FMDV serotype O in April 2010.
