Ghana's Ministry of Health, in conjunction with the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, is researching the mode of
transmission of Buruli ulcer and how to prevent it. Various tests have
been conducted by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research
in Accra and counterpart institutions in the US to establish whether
or not the disease is waterborne.
Dr Frank Bonsu, Programme Manager of the Ghana National Tuberculosis
and Buruli Ulcer Control Programme, Monday said this would give
medical experts an idea as to where to tackle the problem. Dr Bonsu
said although the mode of transmission is not entirely known, changes
in the environment such as construction of irrigation systems, seem to
play a role in the re-emergence of the disease in some communities and
countries.
The disease was first detected as far back as the 18th Century, and in
Ghana it became known in the early 1990s, although many cases were
recorded in Agogo in the 1970s.
Dr. Bonsu said "Its incubation period is between 2 months and several
years, but the disease often starts as a painless nodule on the skin
which, if left untreated, leads to massive ulceration with
debilitating deformities." He said the bacterium produces a toxin that
destroys the skin and bone, and suppresses the immune system.
Children under the age of 15 who live in poor areas of rivers,
wetlands, and stagnant bodies of water are the most vulnerable, and
research has shown that the disease mostly affects the exposed parts
of the body.
Buruli Ulcer has rapidly emerged as an important cause of human
illness worldwide, Dr Bonsu said, adding that in Africa, countries
affected include Angola, Benin, Cote d' Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria,
Togo, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Gabon, and DR Congo.
In Ghana, a national case search conducted in 1999 recorded a total of
6330 cases with Greater Accra (Ga district) topping the list with 1110
cases.
Dr Bonsu said the only way of controlling the disease is to strengthen
health services in general and make surgical services available to
patients. Currently, the strategy promoted by the Global Buruli Ulcer
Initiative consists of intensifying information, training health care
providers, ensuring early detection, strengthening health services,
and rehabilitating people already deformed by the disease.
