USDA vets allowed to take samples from condemned cattle
----------------------------------------
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) veterinarians at slaughterhouses are
now allowed to take samples from condemned cattle, a step taken in response
to last month's [April 2004] failure to test a cow in San Angelo that had
signs of mad cow disease.
Previously, samples only could be taken by officials from the USDA's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which has offices that are
often hours away from slaughterhouses. "It's to ensure there's a minimal
opportunity for miscommunication," said Steve Cohen, spokesman for the
department's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).
The USDA this week completed its investigation into the San Angelo case and
handed it over to the department's inspector general for review, officials
said Friday.
On 28 Apr 2004, a cow brought to slaughter at the Lone Star Beef
meatpacking plant passed an initial visual inspection by the veterinarian.
But the animal was condemned by the vet after it staggered and fell,
indicating injury or a potential central nervous system disorder that is
one of the signs of mad cow disease. No part of the animal entered the
human food chain and there was no risk to public health, officials said.
The vet recommended samples be taken from the cow's brain for testing, but
the USDA APHIS in Austin said no test would be done on the animal, Lone
Star Beef vice president Burley Smith said.
"We said very clearly that was a mistake," said Ed Loyd, a USDA spokesman
in Washington. "We want to make sure that doesn't happen again. We believe
this will adequately address that." Smith said Friday the move was needed.
"I think it's necessary so something like this doesn't happen to anyone
else," he said.
Beginning next week, health inspection service officials will begin
training as many as 90 food service [a.k.a. FSIS] vets on how to take
samples, said Barb Masters, acting administrator for the food safety
service. Eventually, all of the 300 vets at beef slaughterhouses will be
trained, Loyd said.
The cow in San Angelo was taken a rendering plant where the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), which regulates rendering plants, approved it for use
in swine feed. Swine are thought not to be susceptible to mad cow disease.
On 1 Jun 2004, the department will begin testing more than 220 000 cattle,
more than 10 times the number it tested during 2003. The surveillance
tests, which will last for 12 to 18 months, will include 201 000 animals
considered at high risk for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), known
also as mad cow disease, because they show signs of nervous system
disorders such as twitching. Random tests also will be conducted on about
20 000 older animals sent to slaughter even though they appear healthy.
Those tests are aimed at sampling cattle old enough to have eaten feed
produced before 1997, when the FDA banned the use of cattle tissue in feed
for other cattle.
Cattle eating the tissue of a diseased cow is considered the primary way
the misshapen protein blamed for BSE is transmitted. For humans, eating
meat that contains BSE can cause a similarly rare but fatal illness in
people, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

[It is widely touted that the FDA established a feed ban rule in 1997, an
action taken prior to detection of the disease in the US, which was hailed
as a major safety advance. The feed ban rule, as it is commonly known, is
codified in Title 21 part 589.2000 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
However, it appears not to have been strictly enforced -- as warning
letters to numerous feed manufacturers often appear on the FDA web site
(<http://www.fda.gov>). There are allegations that not all the
manufacturing sites have even been inspected for compliance. News articles
from California indicate very few of their plants have been inspected, yet
the FDA website indicates almost all have been inspected. Clearly, one of
these is not correct.
Furthermore, FDA does not seem to be regulating "on-farm" mixing of feed,
which allows producers to feed prohibited products to their animals. When
FDA was asked about this situation, the reply from Stephen Sundlof,
Director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine of FDA, indicated
that since a prion cannot be detected in a feed sample, it becomes
difficult to have the feed sample hold up to the scrutiny of a court case.
However, DNA tests of some feed samples have detected prohibited products
of mammalian origin. If DNA tests are to be believed, how does such a
result fail to hold up to the scrutiny of the court?
It would appear that USDA has relied on FDA to enforce a codified law --
which is not being strictly enforced, while USDA is trying to increase
sampling to demonstrate that BSE does not exist in the USA. Yet, Secretary
of Agriculture Veneman indicates that more cases of BSE would not surprise
her.
The animal from San Angelo was clearly a wake-up call to USDA to make sure
that all of its various branches, FSIS, and APHIS were operating on the
"same page" of instructions for ensuring that animals were appropriately
recognized and sampled. - Mod.TG]
