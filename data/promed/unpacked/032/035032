The public health specialist of the Ministry of Health in Western
Bahr al-Ghazal state has revealed that 17 suspected cases of anthrax
disease in humans have been reported in the state. Martin Mayen said
that the 1st 2 suspected cases were reported in February 2011, and 15
more cases were reported to his office this week from Mabior Abiem
and Nyin Akok of Marial Bay Payam.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease that primarily affects animals but can
be transmitted to humans through consumption of infected meat or
contact with an infected carcass. Mayen urged people not to eat meat
from any animal unless they know how it died, and how long it has been dead.

Meanwhile, the Minister of Animal Resources and Fisheries in Lakes
State, Zakaria Magot Ater, told Radio Miraya that they have
vaccinated over 17 000 head of cattle since January this year [2011].
He said that the free cattle vaccination campaign targets all cattle
camps in the state. However, Ater said they are running short of
vaccines for anthrax, black quarter, and hemorrhagic septicemia.

[The Sudan has not reported any cases of anthrax in any species,
including humans, since 2005, so I suspect that this report reflects
the new southern independence from Khartoum and the latter's lack of
outreach during the continual fighting.

According to Google (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_(state)>)
"Lakes is in the Bahr el Ghazal region of Sudan, in addition to
Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal, and Warrap states,"
and so we can presume that Minister Ater's statement about running
short of vaccines relates to the area at risk. The small map in the
radio report shows Gharb Bahr Al Ghazal, Warab, and Al Buhayrat.
