The following is a press release from the Wyoming Livestock Board:

A case of equine infectious anemia (EIA) has been found in one horse located in Johnson County [Wyoming]. The affected horse has been euthanized and all horses on the associated premises and adjacent premises, within 200 yards, have been quarantined pending further testing.

The disease was found when testing was conducted as required for interstate movement of horses. All quarantined animals have tested negative once for the disease and will undergo a 2nd test in 60 days. EIA is a viral disease of the equine family (horses, donkeys, mules) that is transmitted by biting insects, primarily horse flies and deer flies. Horse owners may know EIA as the disease for which the Coggins test is used.

There is no vaccine, no treatment, and no cure for the disease, and affected horses must be euthanized. The disease is required to be reported to the state veterinarian and is regulated by both the Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) and USDA-APHIS [US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service].

Affected horses may carry the disease asymptomatically for years, or they may become acutely or chronically infected. Signs of the disease include fever, depression, anemia, and dependent edema, sometimes progressing to loss of condition, lethargy, anorexia and, potentially, death. It typically has a long incubation period post exposure.

Disease prevention efforts include insect control, good sanitation, testing of new horses brought to the premises, using only new and clean needles and syringes on each horse, and following state and federal regulations on the disease.

State Veterinarian, Dr Jim Logan, reminds veterinarians and horse owners that it is required for EIA test charts to be completed with all requested information including pictures and descriptions of horse markings, horse's name, age, breed, sex, and color, and complete owner and veterinarian information before the testing laboratory can legally test samples.

A horse in Johnson County has been euthanized after testing positive for an incurable and potentially deadly virus that appears only rarely in Wyoming, officials said Monday [30 Jun 2014].

Five other horses were being quarantined for 60 days. So far, those horses have tested negative for equine infectious anemia but will be retested, Wyoming Livestock Board officials said.

The virus can infect horses, mules and donkeys, causing them to become weak and lethargic. Such infections happen worldwide but only isolated cases have occurred in Wyoming every 2 or 3 years, Wyoming State Veterinarian Jim Logan said. The virus typically is transmitted by biting horse flies or deer flies. No vaccine exists.

"In the South -- in other areas where it's humid and more conducive to the vectors -- it's much more common to see it," Logan said.

Livestock officials declined to identify the owners of the euthanized or quarantined horses.

Veterinarians initially diagnosed the disease on 18 Jun 2014. They conducted follow-up testing to confirm the virus before they euthanized the horse Wednesday [25 Jun 2014], Logan said.

State laws require horses to be tested for diseases including equine infectious anemia before being shipped across state lines. The euthanized horse had lived in Wyoming for several years and likely was tested in anticipation of a move, Logan said.

The horse wasn't showing signs of the disease. However, a horse can carry the virus for years without symptoms or it can become acutely or chronically infected.

Three of the quarantined horses belonged to the same owner and the other 2 belonged to someone else.

The quarantined horses had come within 200 yards of the infected horse. That's about as far as a fly can carry the disease because the virus can't persist in an insect for long, Logan said.

Horse owners can guard against equine infectious anemia with good insect control, good sanitation practices, testing horses for the virus, and using only new and clean needles and syringes on horses, officials said.

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is an infectious and potentially fatal viral disease of members of the horse family. Another name for EIA is swamp fever.

The equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is categorized as a lentivirus: it contains genetic RNA material, which it uses to produce DNA. This DNA is then incorporated into the genetic makeup of infected cells. Identified in France in 1843 and 1st tentatively diagnosed in the United States in 1888, EIA has commanded a great deal of attention over the years. No vaccine or treatment exists for the disease. It is often difficult to differentiate from other fever-producing diseases, including anthrax, influenza, and equine encephalitis.

By far, the majority of horses are inapparent carriers: they show no overt clinical abnormalities as a result of infection. They survive as reservoirs of the infection for extended periods. Inapparent carriers have dramatically lower concentrations of EIAV in their blood than horses with active clinical signs of the disease. Only one horsefly out of 6 million is likely to pick up and transmit EIAV from this horse. All horses infected with EIAV are thought to remain virus carriers for life. The inapparent form may become chronic or acute due to severe stress, hard work, or the presence of other diseases.

When horses are exposed to EIAV, they may develop severe, acute signs of disease and die within 2 to 3 weeks. This form of the disease is the most damaging and the most difficult to diagnose because the signs appear rapidly, and often only an elevated body temperature is noted. 1/5th of a teaspoon of blood from a horse with acute EIA contains enough virus to infect one million horses. The clinical signs of the acute form of EIA are nonspecific; in mild cases, the initial fever may be short lived (often less than 24 hours). As a result, horse owners and veterinarians may not observe this initial sign when a horse is infected with EIAV. These infected horses often recover and continue to move freely in the population. The 1st indication that a horse was exposed to, and infected with, EIAV may well be a positive result on a routine annual test.

If the horse survives this 1st acute bout, it may develop a recurring clinical disease with these signs:
- Fever: an infected horse's temperature may rise suddenly to about 105 F [40.6 C] or, rarely, as high as 108 F [42.2 C]. Then it may drop back to normal for an indeterminate period until the onset of another episode.
- Petechial hemorrhages: minute blood-colored spots appear on the mucous membranes.
- Depression: the horse appears more or less dejected (head hangs low) and generally listless.
- Weight loss: the horse may refuse feed or may eat an inordinate amount but still continues on an obvious decline from normal weight.
- Dependent edema: the horse may develop swelling, which is evidence of fluid collecting under the skin in the legs and under the chest and other underbody surfaces.
- Anemia: the horse's blood may experience a marked drop in its red corpuscle count and appear thin and watery. The animal may also have an irregular heartbeat, and a jugular pulse may become evident.

The horse with chronic EIA is the classic "swamper" who has lost condition, is lethargic and anorexic, has a low hematocrit, and demonstrates a persistent decrease in the number of blood platelets, especially coincident with fever induced by EIAV.

EIA is considered a classic blood borne infection. People have played an important role in EIAV transmission over the years by using blood-contaminated materials on different horses. The EIAV most frequently is transmitted between horses in close proximity by large biting insects, such as horseflies and deerflies. The bites from these flies stimulate defensive movement by the horse, which often results in an interruption of the blood feeding. When interrupted, the fly is motivated to complete the feeding as soon as possible. It then attacks the same or a 2nd host and feeds to repletion. In this manner, any infective material from the blood of the 1st host that is present on the mouthparts of the insect can be mechanically transmitted to the 2nd host. Insect transmission of EIAV is dependent on the number and habits of the insects, the density of the horse population, the number of times the insect bites the same and other horses, the amount of blood transferred between horses, and the level of virus in the blood of the infected horse from which the initial blood meal was obtained. The rate of transmission cannot be predicted accurately because of these variables.

Controlling the spread of EIAV involves minimizing or eliminating contact of horses with the secretions, excretions, and blood of EIAV-infected horses. This has been carried out in most areas of the world by testing and segregating test-positive horses from those with negative test results. Once the reservoirs of EIAV are identified, separated, and maintained a safe distance from the other horses, the transmission of EIAV is broken. Until all horses are tested, one must assume that each horse is a potential reservoir of EIAV and take precautions to see that his or her horses commingle only with horses with impeccable backgrounds (that is, they came from farms with only test-negative horses and have never been exposed to test-positive horses).

Horse owners can take a number of precautions to reduce the risk of infection:
- Use disposable syringes and needles. Follow the rule of one horse/one needle.
- Clean and sterilize all instruments thoroughly after each use.
- Keep stables and immediate facilities clean and sanitary. Remove manure and debris promptly and ensure that the area is well drained.
- Implement insect controls. The local veterinarian or animal health official can provide information about approved insecticides and other insect-control measures. Avoid habitats favorable to insect survival.
- Do not intermingle infected and healthy animals. Do not breed EIAV-positive horses.
- Isolate all new horses, mules, and asses brought to the premises until they have been tested for EIA.
