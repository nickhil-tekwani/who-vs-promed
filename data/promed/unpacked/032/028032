Viet Nam: 2 more avian influenza patients
-----------------------------------------
2 more Vietnamese residents have contracted avian influenza in the
country's north, a state-run newspaper reported on Mon 20 Jun 2005, as more
than 6000 chickens were slaughtered in the southern Mekong Delta following
a fresh outbreak. The 2 [avian influenza patients] were among 5 people
admitted to a hospital in Hanoi with sore throat or bronchitis, the Saigon
Giai Phong daily quoted hospital officials as saying.
The latest cases took the number of Viet Nam's avian influenza patients
since December 2004 to 64, 18 of whom have died. The disease has also
killed 12 Thais and 4 Cambodians.
Health workers slaughtered and buried more than 6000 chickens last week
[3rd week June 2005] at a farm in the province of Ben Tre in the Mekong
Delta, after the birds were found to carry the H5 component of the bird flu
virus, a state health official said. The tests were conducted after the
farm owner reported that more 3000 of his chickens had died, Mai Van Hiep,
director of the provincial animal health department, told Reuters. Ben Tre
is one of the areas where the virus 1st emerged in late 2003 then spread to
the northern region, where the virus appears to develop rapidly during the
winter. "We do not exclude the possibility of an outbreak," Hiep said by
telephone from the province, 85 km (55 miles) southwest of Ho Chi Minh City.
Scientists fear that avian flu, which is infectious in birds but does not
spread easily among humans, could mutate into a form capable of generating
a pandemic in which millions of people without immunity could die. Last
week [3rd week June 2005], a Vietnamese doctor who treated bird flu
patients tested positive for the virus. [A 2nd test failed to confirm the
initial diagnosis. - Mod.CP]. But the Health Ministry insisted that there
has so far been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus.

Viet Nam: 2 more avian influenza cases in north
-----------------------------------------------
2 more people from northern Viet Nam have contracted avian influenza, and
thousands of chickens have dropped dead in the south, officials said on Mon
20 Jun 2005. The poultry outbreak is the country's 1st in 3 months.
The 2 new victims tested positive for the virus after being admitted to
Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi over the weekend, said hospital director Tran
Quy. That brought the number of human cases to 13 over the past 2 weeks, he
said, adding that the patients, all from the northern provinces, are in
stable condition.
Bird flu began ravaging poultry farms across Viet Nam in late 2003, killing
or forcing the cull of more than 45 million birds. The virus began jumping
to humans at about the same time, and has killed 38 people in Viet Nam, 12
in Thailand and 4 in Cambodia.
Meanwhile, more than 4000 out of 6700 chickens on a farm in the southern
province of Ben Tre died suddenly on 9 Jun 2005, said Mai Van Hiep,
director of the provincial animal health bureau. The authorities killed the
remaining chickens 2 days later, and tests showed they were infected with
the H5N1 [serotype] of avian influenza, he said. Hiep said it was the 1st
reported outbreak in the province since March 2005.

[It is not clear whether these cases of avian influenza have been confirmed
by laboratory test or whether the information has been communicated to the
World Health Organization. The 1st report fails to state that a 2nd test of
the doctor in the Bach Mai Hospital did not confirm that he had contracted
avian influenza (see: Avian influenza, human - East Asia (90): Viet Nam
20050617.1707). - Mod.CP]
