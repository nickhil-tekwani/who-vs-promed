The death in southern Iraq of a man with bird flu-like symptoms who
owned pigeons with the deadly H5N1 strain has spurred fears the
disease is spreading from the Kurdish north. The man who died in the
city of Amara owned 2 pigeons which tested positive for the H5N1
strain, making him the 1st suspected human case of bird flu outside
Kurdistan where 2 people have died of the disease.
On Monday, Ibtisam Aziz, head of a committee set up to fight the
virus, said the virus was still confined to a village in the Raniya
area of Sulaimaniyah province [in the Kurdistan region] where the 1st
case involving a teenage girl was confirmed. 4 people are currently
under observation in Kurdistan as suspected bird flu patients,
officials said on Tuesday [7 Feb 2006].
Adel Muhajir al-Maliki, governor of Amara, said the man was admitted
to a city hospital suffering from the flu but was discharged after 5
days and subsequently died at home on Sunday [5 Feb 2006]."We suspect
he died of bird flu as our investigations revealed that he had birds
at home," Maliki told AFP.
Dawood Mohammed Sharif, head of Baghdad's veterinary laboratory, said
samples from the man's 2 pigeons had tested positive for H5N1 virus.
"The samples of the pigeons have been sent to Cairo for further
tests," Sharif said, while the governor added that samples taken from
the man were dispatched to Baghdad.
Jon C. Bowersox, health attache at the US embassy in Iraq, has warned
against hunting birds."Birds that are migrating down from the north
could be infected and some people make their income by hunting birds.
It is not simply a matter of chicken," Bowersox said.
In Kirkuk, just south of the Kurdish provinces, rumors are rampant of
avian flu cases being covered up by the local government and the
price of a chicken has plummeted to a mere 500 dinars (0.33 dollars).
In the city of Sulaimaniyah 5 people earlier suspected of suffering
from bird flu were released Tuesday after their health improved
following treatment, senior health official Mohammed Khushnow told
AFP. Of the 5, Sabria Mohammed, a 40-year-old woman, was a carrier of
H5N1 but her health improved after she was treated with the
anti-avian influenza drug Tamiflu, he said.
On Monday, Iraq confirmed its 2nd human death from bird flu in the
Kurdish north. Hamma Sur Abdullah, 40, who died of flu-like symptoms
a little over a week after his niece, was confirmed by a lab in Cairo
as having died of the same cause. A few days after Abdullah's death,
the World Health Organisation (WHO) lab confirmed that the girl,
Shajin Abdel Qader, had died of bird flu.
2 WHO teams, meanwhile, were out in the field in Kurdistan on Tuesday
assessing the capacity of the region's medical and veterinary
services to tackle the threat. A consignment of masks, gloves and
gowns was also being shipped out from the United States to help Iraqi
doctors tackle any larger outbreak.
"At the moment this is an agricultural emergency," Sam Yingst, one of
the WHO team members, said on Sunday. "But we believe that there is a
possibility that it may become a human public emergency, though it
will require a significant change in the nature of the virus." A
massive cull of poultry has been underway in Kurdistan.
In the eastern province of Diyala along the Iranian border, health
ministry officials were spreading disinfectant Monday [6 Feb 2006]
around poultry-producing areas. "We are checking people coming from
Kurdistan and Iran to Diyala and spreading disinfectants on their
vehicles," said Hashim Ibrahim, head of Diyala's veterinary
department.
Neighbouring Turkey, which has had 21 cases of the flu strain, was
previously the only country outside east Asia to report fatalities
from the virus. 4 people have died there.

[According to this AFP report, 3 of the suspected human cases of H5N1
avian influenza in the Kurdistan region of Iraq are now confirmed
cases (2 of whom have died), 4 others are still under observation,
and 5 have been discharged from hospital. The death of a man in
southern Iraq is likely to be the 4th confirmed case, as he possessed
two H5N1-infected pigeons. - Mod.CP]
