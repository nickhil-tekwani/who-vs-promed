CDPC Note: A news report about illnesses possibly related to _Pfiesteria_
toxin was posted on CDPC a few days ago (August 30). Since I didn't know much
about _Pfiesteria_, I did a net search and found several Web sites with
interesting and up-to-date information on this organism. The following note
is copied from one of these homepages.
September 1, 1997 - From The NCSU Aquatic Botany Laboratory _Pfiesteria
piscicida_ homepage:
<http://www2.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/project/aquatic_botany/pfiest.html#Toxic>
The toxic dinoflagellate, _Pfiesteria piscicida_, has been implicated as the
primary causative agent of many major fish kills and fish disease events
(finfish and shellfish) in North Carolina estuaries, coastal areas, and
aquaculture operations. _Pfiesteria_ and closely related toxic species
("Pfiesteria-like complex") have also been confirmed in fish kill/disease
areas and aquaculture facilities outside North Carolina, from the mid-
Atlantic to the Gulf Coast. Fish kills caused by _P. piscicida_ usually occur
in the warmest part of the year, and often precede low dissolved oxygen
levels in the estuaries. _Pfiesteria_ likely has been in this region for a
long time (thousands of years) as a nontoxic predator on other organsisms
(bacteria, algae, small animals). Many experiments in lab and field
indicate, however, that human influences (e.g., excessive nutrient enrichment
to the poorly flushed Albemarle-Pamlico estuarine ecosystem) have slowly
shifted the environment to encourage the fish-killing activity of
_Pfiesteria_.
Human Health Impacts of _Pfiesteria_:
-------------------------------------
Thirteen people who worked with dilute toxic cultures of _Pfiesteria_
sustained mild to serious adverse health impacts through water contact or by
inhaling toxic aerosols from the cultures. These people generally worked with
the toxic cultures for 1-2 hours per day over a 5-6 week period. The effects
include a suite of symptoms such as narcosis (a "drugged" effect),
development of sores (in areas that directly contact water containing toxic
cultures of _P. piscicida_, and also on the chest and face), uniform
reddening of the eyes, severe headaches, blurred vision, nausea/vomiting,
sustained difficulty breathing (asthma-like effects), kidney and liver
dysfunction, acute short-term memory loss, and severe cognitive impairment (=
serious difficulty in being able to read, remember one's name, dial a
telephone number, or do simple arithmetic beyond 1 + 2 = 3). Most of the
acute symptoms proved reversible over time, provided that the affected people
were not allowed near the toxic cultures again. Some of these effects have
recurred (relapsed) in people following strenuous exercise, thus far up to
six years after exposure to these toxic fish-killing cultures. Moreover,
subcutaneous injection of crude toxin preparations from fish-killing cultures
have induced serious learning impairment and memory loss in experimental
laboratory rats (work by Drs. Levin and Schmechel at Duke University). The
discovery, the "hard way," that _Pfiesteria_ is unusual in its ability to
produce toxins that can be easily airborne, led to mandates by state and
federal officials that all further work with toxic fish-killing cultures of
this dinoflagellate be conducted in biohazard III, isolated, quarantined,
limited-access facilities. These precautions must be followed for any
research with live toxic cultures of _Pfiesteria_.
Fish kills and fish disease events linked to _Pfiesteria_ can extend for
6-8 weeks in North Carolina's estuaries, thus potentially providing the
circumstances for humans in field settings to be hurt due to this
dinoflagellate's toxins. However, it will not be possible to determine
the extent to which people in our estuaries are being affected by
_Pfiesteria_ toxins, or whether it is safe to consume fish from toxic
outbreak areas, until we have a way to diagnose the presence of these toxins.
That will require identification of the chemical toxins produced by
_Pfiesteria_, which is the subject of intensive research.

[Given the recent flurry of reports about this organism, and the likelihood
that our readers might be increasingly interested in this subject, I have
taken the liberty of posting this nice synopsis, thanks to Jim Chin. -- Mod
