A 3rd envelope was reported by the Secret Service as being intercepted before arriving at the White House. The 1st 2 envelopes were addressed to secretary of defense James Mattis and to chief of naval operations, Admiral John Richardson. "The Secret Service can confirm receipt of a suspicious envelope addressed to the president on [Mon 1 Oct 2018]," the service said in a statement on Tuesday [2 Oct 2018]. "The envelope was not received at the White House, nor did it ever enter the White House," the statement added. "We can confirm we are working jointly with our law enforcement partners to fully investigate this matter."

The packages were intercepted at a nearby mail facility that is not inside the Pentagon. The 1st 2 envelopes triggered alarms during screening at a mail facility. All mail sent to the Pentagon via the US Postal Service on Monday [1 Oct 2018] was placed under quarantine as a precaution. "The Pentagon Force Protection Agency detected a suspicious substance during mail screening at the Pentagon's remote screening facility. The envelopes were taken by the FBI this morning (Tue 2 Oct 2018) for further analysis," spokesman Col. Rob Manning said in a statement. It remains unclear who sent them or whether any government workers were exposed to the toxin.

Ricin can be extracted from castor beans and turned into powder, acid, mist, or pellets. It is not yet clear which form the substance detected at the Pentagon was.

At around the same time, 2 people were hospitalized after being exposed to a white powder contained in mail sent to senator Ted Cruz's Houston campaign office. Their injuries are not known. Neither of the victims worked for Cruz's campaign. All workers from Cruz's Houston campaign office were evacuated.

It is not known if the 3 incidents are linked or what the substance sent to Cruz's office was. Ricin exposure can lead to death if the toxin is inhaled directly. It is commonly used in terror plots and is found in castor beans. Ricin causes a painful death that begin with nausea and vomiting. The toxic components then cause internal bleeding and, ultimately, lead to respiratory failure. After initial exposure to ricin, symptoms ordinarily appear in around 10 hours, and death can occur within 72 hours.

Several past terror plots that used the toxin were foiled in Europe, including an intended attack on a London underground station in 2003 and a separate attack in Germany in June this year [2018].

Since the anthrax attacks in 2003 that killed 5 people after the powder was distributed through mail, the US government has increased measures to protect workers and officials from exposure to any harmful substances. These measures include putting mail through x-ray machines and scanners that detect vapors and identify anything poisonous or toxic. In Washington, DC, the US Postal Service also samples the air as mail is being sorted before it is sent to government buildings.

The Pentagon on Wednesday [3 Oct 2018] said the letters addressed to Mattis and Richardson contained unprocessed castor seeds, the natural material from which ricin is produced. The seeds themselves pose little, if any, threat to humans, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Secret Service, which intercepted the letter mailed to Trump, declined to comment on the 3rd letter. All 3 were intercepted Monday [1 Oct 2018], officials said. The letters addressed to the Pentagon never made it into the Defense Department's headquarters, and the envelope to Trump was never in the White House, US officials said. No one was harmed by the envelopes.
