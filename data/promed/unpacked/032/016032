It may well turn out our host for the majority of East to West migration of
the WNV is none other than young apparently healthy asymptomatic _Homo
sapiens sapiens_, in all innocence.

I've been following the spread of this virus since the first cases emerged
in 1999, both intra- and interstate. From the New York epicenter, there
was concentric spread up and down the coast, while the virus on the
mainland worked its way up the Hudson River for the most part, with the
counties falling like dominoes from south to north. While certainly
inadvertent mechanical movement could play a role, the pattern of spread
has largely remained contiguous, from one area into an immediately
adjoining one.

Factors such as surveillance intensity, density of horses, density of
fatally affected avian species (or density of people around to find them),
etc., give a bit of a patchwork pattern to it, but the overall pattern
remains from east to west and both north and south from the epicenter.

The influence of either nonmigratory birds or heavy local mosquito density
also shows up in some locations. For example, in Wyoming, there is a
cluster of equine cases (18) in the county of Goshen, which directly
borders on the most heavily affected Nebraska county of Scotts Bluff (75
cases). In fact, 4 of the 6 Wyoming counties where viral activity has been
detected are clustered around this area, all neighboring Goshen county to
the north, south, and west, with Scott's Bluff to the east. The most
distinguishing feature of Scott's Bluff [see URL below for map] is an
exceptionally heavy network of waterways. A key element of the
epidemiology may very well be the species of birds that are not fatally
infected and are responsible for keeping the virus in circulation and
moving it locally.

Weather patterns also appear to be very important. States that have
experienced a heavy number of equine cases prior to the traditional heavy
encephalitis season of very late August into September and October have all
had torrential rains and flooding as an antecedent factor.

If the CA woman did acquire the virus from local infected mosquitos, a good
place to start looking for them may very well be the 200-acre bird
sanctuary located within 5 minutes of Los Angeles International
Airport. Marsh/sea birds like the wood stork, which migrates between
Mexico and the US, commingle in Mexico, then split into 2 groups, the
larger of which goes to Texas and the Gulf states, with a few birds
branching over into southern California. Migrating storks have been
strongly suspected as being involved in intercontinental spread of West Nile:

Note that although the migration patterns of bird species are pretty well
defined, the movements of individual birds are entirely unpredictable.

It would not be surprising if one or more birds have crossed from east to
west, north to south, or any combination outside of normal migration
routes. Random movements are not uncommon, particularly for raptors,
seabirds, waders, and waterfowl. Also it is not necessarily true that a
bird raised on the east coast will instinctively return there year after
year; the vast majority do, but not all. In fact, young birds in particular
can and frequently do explore new routes or travel vast distances to find
new territories, or simply get lost or blown off course. Extreme conditions
such as drought or flooding will increase the numbers that move outside of
the normal migration patterns. Wide mountain ranges and vast expanses of
water are no obstacle or deterrent to many species.

In addition, there are literally thousands of records each year of birds
turning up somewhere they 'shouldn't' be, again most often due to birds
getting lost or swept off-course by wind currents. Transatlantic,
transcontinental, and transpacific crossings by birds in this manner are a
common annual occurrence; though the numbers are relatively small, they are
larger than expected and certainly greater than recorded.

Consider occurrences of WNV infection in Italy attributed to the Senegal
strain, or other cases of WNV infection or seropositivity in France,
Portugal, Spain, and Romania. Migratory birds certainly may further the
spread of a disease across vast distances, and it does not depend on
individual birds travelling the full distance; a stepping-stone or
relay-type scenario is entirely possible. This makes the length of time a
bird or group of birds will survive with infection not such a limiting factor.

Consider also the fact that WNV was detected in crows in New York in late
1998. It should be surprising if the disease has not spread to California
by now -- some 2 and a half years later.

Regarding other vertebrates, I wonder whether there have been any recent
movements of potential reservoir/carrier species between zoos or private
collections across the US that might be implicated? I suspect that WNV is
indeed present in many more areas than so far detected.

In an effort to highlight the geographic and epidemiological impact of West
Nile Virus, I put together the following overview that can be accessed from
the Emerging Infectious Disease Network: West Nile Virus web site
<http://www.humanitarian.net/eidnet/wnv>:

14 Sep 2002 - WEST NILE VIRUS: BIODEFENSE AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TRACKING

Includes comparative maps of spread from 1999-2002 and current (as of 11
Sep 2002) USGS United States maps for bird, human, mosquito, sentinel, and
veterinary cases (note where there have been no reports or samples submitted).

<http://www.humanitarian.net/eidnet/wnv/wnv_biodefense.html>
[The CDC county-based chloropleth maps are outstanding!]

It would be interesting to compare the various strains isolated in global
regions prior to the 1999 outbreak. I would think that if the strain now
in the US is structurally different, then it could be (1) a result of a
mutation that accidentally found its way to the United States or (2) a
direct result of bioengineering.

A note regarding a reference to the WNV strain: I just ran across this
release by USGS/Department of the Interior:

14 Dec 1999
West Nile Virus May Be New Deadly Strain, USGS Tells Congress
<http://www.usgs.gov/public/press/public_affairs/press_releases/pr1128m.html>

[In this report, McLean is reported as saying: "Recent crow die-offs
suggest the West Nile virus, which emerged in New York in late August,
could be more deadly to North American bird species than to species in
Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, where the virus is normally found, a
USGS scientist reported today at a congressional field hearing held in
Connecticut by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Dr. Robert G. McLean, director of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center
in Madison, Wis., briefed the committee on the role of native bird
populations and other wildlife in the emergence of West Nile virus in the
United States. Detection of the virus in birds and other animal species
provides critical information to public health agencies tracking the
infection in people.

'The high mortality in crows and other bird species is unusual for these
viruses,' McLean said. "This suggests that this virus is more virulent to
our native birds or it may represent a new, more virulent strain of the
virus."]

Bob McLean was a contact point for USGS, always helpful and an excellent
resource. As always, it looks like there is more to the picture than meets
the eye.

[Yes, a few birds do get lost and end up in the wrong place. But consider
the odds of one or 2 lost WNV-incubating birds being able to start an
outbreak in a new place. Modelling requires a lot more than
that. Stepping-stone or relay transmission is also stretching plausibility
-- since it requires a week or so for a mosquito, after taking an infected
blood meal, to produce infectious saliva, thatÂ´s postulating local
outbreaks at multiple stopovers en route. The most likely scenario is
still importations along mass-migration routes, which are not East-West and
-- assuming Mexico is in fact infected -- the South-North migration from
Mexico to California had not yet started in early August 2002, when the
California case was infected. As for the US WNV strain being more
virulent, it is not at all surprising to find unexposed populations of
vertebrates dying from the first introduction of a normally relatively
benign virus. Think myxomatosis in Australian rabbits, or measles in
Amazonian Indians, who had never been exposed to it before. - Mod.JW]

[I suspect we are coming to the end of productive comments on this topic
until critical research can clarify the various excellent points raised. I
am willing to consider one more posting on this subject, otherwise the
thread is being cut. - Mod.MHJ]
