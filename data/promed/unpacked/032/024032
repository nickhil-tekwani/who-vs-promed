Background on salmonellosis and alfalfa sprouts
-----------------------------------------------
A outbreak of _Salmonella enterica_ serogroup Newport infection from Dec
1995 to Jan 1996 involved 133 cases in British Columbia (Canada) and Oregon
(USA) and was traced to contaminated alfalfa sprouts. 242 cases of _S.
stanley_ infection were ascribed to alfalfa sprouts in 1995 and over 500
cases of _S. montivideo_ and _S. meleagridis_ infection were ascribed to
alfalfa sprouts in 1996.
An international outbreak (about 242 cases in the USA and Finland, 1997) of
_Salmonella stanley_ was traced to alfalfa sprouts and involved at least 17
states. A separate outbreak of _S. infantis_ and _S. anatum_ infection (109
cases) the same year was also attributed to alfalfa sprouts.
A mixture of alfalfa and clover sprouts was implicated in an outbreak of 60
cases of salmonellosis in California in 1997 and 1998. Eighteen cases of
salmonellosis were associated with alfalfa sprouts in California in 1998.
A multistate outbreak (34 cases) of _S. havana_, _S. cubana_ and _S.
tennessee_ infection the same year was also ascribed to alfalfa sprouts and
about 85 cases of salmonellosis in Oregon, Washington state, and California
(USA) were ascribed to alfalfa sprouts in 1999.
175 cases of _S. muenchen_ infections were recorded during a multistate
outbreak (USA) traced to alfalfa sprouts in 1999. An outbreak (32 cases) of
serotype Kottbus infection in Arizona, California, Colorado, and New Mexico
during 2001 was also attributed to contaminated alfalfa sprouts.
