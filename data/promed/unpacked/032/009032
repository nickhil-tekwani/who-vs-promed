Unusual Virus Identified in Aborted Calf, Say Oregon State University
Researchers
---------------------------
A [member of a group of viruses that can move from one animal species
to another and cause a wide range of diseases has been found in the
lungs of an aborted calf fetus.
The findings by researchers in the College of Veterinary Medicine at
Oregon State University were reported today in the Journal of the
American Veterinary Medical Association [see ref. below.
As one part of the larger viral family of caliciviruses, these
"vesiviruses" are so named because they are indistinguishable from
viruses of ocean origin that from the 1930s to 1950s caused repeated
outbreaks in the United States of a disease in pigs called vesicular
exanthema of swine, or VES.
The VES-like viral group is still classified as a "foreign animal
disease agent" in the U.S., in part because some of the disease
symptoms they can cause -- blistering of the mouth, nose, and feet --
mimic those of foot and mouth disease, a highly contagious and costly
disease for many agricultural animal species.
The proven recurrence of this group of viruses in an aborted calf,
along with the larger body of knowledge about how these viruses can
spread, mutate, cross interspecies boundaries and occasionally cause
major disease outbreaks, is a cause for concern, according to Dr.
Alvin Smith, professor and head of the OSU Laboratory for Calicivirus
Studies.
"We are well aware of the importance of reporting a possible new virus
of bovine abortion," said Smith and other researchers in their study.
"However, we assign much greater importance to the urgent need for
differential diagnostic reagents for vesicular diseases."
Foot and mouth disease, the researchers said, is not zoonotic, or able
to be transmitted from other animals to humans. But some infections by
vesiviruses do make that leap.
"The need for prompt and accurate diagnosis of vesicular diseases in
livestock is not only important for the control of foot & mouth
disease, but is also important because of the human health
implications involving caliciviruses," the report said. "This public
health issue is given even greater impetus by our recent reports of
vesicular disease in humans, and possibly abortion and hepatitis,
involving this pathogenic class of VESV-like caliciviruses, genus
vesivirus, (which are) endemic in certain ocean species and U.S.
livestock."
According to Smith, research has shown for 30 years that ocean mammals
are a vast reservoir of different calicivirus strains, including the
VESV group that caused a major animal health epidemic in the United
States. For at least 15 years, he said, it's also been clear that
these viruses are still endemic at high levels in the nation's
livestock populations.
They should no longer be considered a foreign animal disease agent,
Smith said, which by statute means they must be eradicated if they are
diagnosed in U.S. animals.
Researchers at OSU, in collaboration with a private biotechnology
company, have developed various assays and tests that can more
accurately diagnose vesiviral infections. Those tests, if more widely
used, could improve the diagnosis of diseases caused by this viral
family and aid in their control, the scientists said.
Caliciviruses are characterized by their ability to survive in a broad
range of environments, from the deep ocean to family farms, infect a
wide range of species, cross from one species to another, and cause
disease symptoms that vary from mild to deadly.
Vesiviruses have been shown to infect swine, seals, cats, dogs,
cattle, snakes, whales, primates and humans, among others. The
diseases they have been associated with include blisters, hepatitis,
diarrhea, abortion, pneumonia, encephalitis, myocarditis, and fatal
hemorrhage. A single strain of calicivirus has been shown to have at
least 21 animal hosts, ranging from oysters to sea lions, whales,
horses and humans.
One of the most deadly of the calicivirus strains, closely related to
vesiviruses, causes rabbit hemorrhagic disease, a highly infectious
and deadly disease that has killed hundreds of millions of rabbits
around the world, in some cases up to 95 percent of local populations
within 24-48 hours of exposure. That strain, Smith said, was one not
known to exist prior to the 1980s. It probably evolved through
mutation, he said, or was perhaps brought to rabbits through the most
common reservoir for many caliciviral strains, marine animals.
Co-authors on the study just published include researchers from AVI
BioPharma, a private company, and Dr. David Matson, a medical doctor
at the Center for Pediatric Research in Norfolk, Va.

[The family _Caliciviridae_ comprises 4 distinct genera; the
"Norwalk-like viruses" and the "Sapporo-like viruses", which are
associated with human disease, and 2 genera which contain viruses of
veterinary importance. The genus _Lagovirus_ contains Rabbit
hemorrhagic disease virus and European brown hare syndrome virus, and
the genus _Vesivirus_ contains Vesicular exanthema of swine virus
(VESV), from which the genus takes its name. The genus Vesivirus
comprises 2 virus species; the species VESV which includes also
several closely related viruses isolated from marine mammals,
primates, skunk and reptiles, and the distinct species Feline
calicivirus.
VESV was recognized first in California in 1932, and by 1953 had
spread to 42 states; 13 serotypes were identified and outbreaks of
disease were associated with the practice of feeding food waste to
pigs. By 1956, however, the disease had been eradicated from the
United States by vigorous enforcement of feeding regulations and a
comprehensive slaughter policy. The stimulus was potential confusion
with the clinically indistinguishable and less easily controlled
vesicular diseases of swine -- foot-and-mouth disease, vesicular
stomatitis, and swine vesicular disease.
It was established subsequently that VESV and viruses isolated from
ailing sea lions inhabiting San Miguel Island, California, were
essentially the same virus. Like VESV, the San Miguel sea lion viruses
(SMSV), were antigenically heterogenous, and some 17 serotypes have
been identified. Retrospective analysis suggested that the multiple
serotypes of VESV had evolved during replication of the virus in its
natural host, the sea lion, rather than in swine. Although as stated
in the above article vesiviruses are endemic in the United States, the
report is significant because vesicular exanthema of swine has not
recurred in the USA (or anywhere else). The relationship of this
newly isolated virus to VESV and other members of this virus species
is a matter of considerable interest.
The designation of VESV-like viruses as "foreign animal disease agent
in the U.S." is bizarre, since the disease vesicular exanthema of
swine was only observed in the USA. - Mod.CP
