[...] 4 cases of diphtheria have already been reported in Ukraine [in 2018]. Experts say this might be the beginning of a new outbreak, TSN reports.

Epidemiologists say measles is a smaller disaster, whereas the major one will begin with an outbreak of diphtheria: "Imagine we have only 19% of children of those born in 2016 protected from diphtheria. If there are cases, how [easily do] you think the disease will spread? It's only one year, and we have such 10 years."

The last time the outbreak of diphtheria was recorded was in the 1990s. A total of 20 000 people became ill, and about 700 died. Dr. Andriy Snytsar says the risk of death is extremely high. Diphtheria affects the kidneys, heart, and nervous system. There are a few hours to save a patient from diphtheria. If the serum is injected too late, the patient dies. The only protection against diphtheria is vaccination, and the amount of available vaccines is sufficient to cover Ukraine's needs. Adults must be revaccinated every 10 years.

[ProMED-mail previously posted in June 2018 a report of 2 cases of diphtheria in the Luhansk region of Ukraine (Diphtheria - Ukraine: (LH) 20180625.5872810). The above news report says there are 4 cases of diphtheria in Ukraine so far in 2018, in the presence of a very low diphtheria vaccination rate (19% of children born in 2016 are vaccinated against diphtheria). However, we are not told where in Ukraine or when these cases occurred.

In the early 1990s, a diphtheria epidemic emerged in the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, which included Ukraine; the diphtheria epidemic was attributed to disruption of vaccine supply and economic difficulties associated with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1995 and 1996, as a result of concerted national and international efforts, the NIS raised adult and childhood coverage and began to control the epidemic (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/181/Supplement_1/S35/843033). However, cases of diphtheria are still being reported most years in Ukraine, although the annual number of cases has been less than 10 since 2010:
2017 / 2016 / 2015 / 2014 / 2013 / 2012 / 2011 / 2010 / 2009 / 2008 / 2007 / 2006 / 2005
0 / 4 / 2 / _ / _ / 5 /8 / 17 / _ / 61 / 81 / 68 / 96 (http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/incidences?c=UKR). - Mod.ML
