Pseudorabies, a disease commonly found in domestic and feral pigs, has been detected in a feral pig within the Lake Mendocino wildlife area, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the lake.

The Corps said the virus is not transferable to humans, but could be fatal for dogs and other infected animals.

The United States Department of Agriculture confirmed the pseudorabies virus at the lake from a blood sample taken from a euthanized pig.

This marks the 1st time pseudorabies has been detected among the feral pig population in Mendocino County, says the Army Corps. There are no other known cases at this time.

While primarily affecting pigs, pseudorabies can be spread to dogs, cats and other animals. The most common method of transmission is contact with raw feral pig meat, the Army Corps said.

If any household pet is suspected of coming into contact with a feral pig or eating feral pig meat, a veterinarian should be contacted immediately.

Park staff currently estimate there are still 30 to 50 feral pigs that migrate between adjacent land and the Lake Mendocino wildlife area, based on staff observations and reports from the public, the Army Corps said.

Staff are partnering with USDA wildlife specialists to reduce the feral pig population under an authorized permit from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, according to the Army Corps.

There are no further impacts to camping or other recreational activities at the lake at this time.

[The rapid growth of the feral swine population in the USA raises concern and entails health risks for humans, domestic animals and the whole ecosystem. Pseudorabies is an acute, frequently fatal disease with a worldwide distribution that affects swine primarily and other domestic and wild animals incidentally. The pseudorabies virus has emerged as a significant pathogen in the USA since the 1960s, probably because of the increase in confinement swine housing or perhaps because of the emergence of more virulent strains. Pseudorabies is a reportable disease. _Brucella suis_ is another pathogen that can spill over from feral swine. To see the USDA National Feral Swine mapping system, go to:
