I refer to the previous posting on salmonella in dog snacks in Denmark and
wish to offer some corrections.
The report quoted in the posting refers to the finding of _Salmonella_ in
dog snacks in a small routine screening carried out by the Danish Plant
Directorate, where more than half of the samples were found positive with a
variety of salmonella serotypes. This prompted the examination of a further
35 samples of IMPORTED dog snacks (pigs ears, bull penises), which found 29
of them to be _Salmonella_ positive, three with _[S. typhimurium_ DT104.
The infected batches of product have been withdrawn from retail outlets.
Our very comprehensive monitoring of salmonella in pigs in Denmark show the
prevalence of DT104 to be very low, indeed (i.e. practically zero).
The finding of DT104 is interesting, because Denmark has a 0-tolerance for
DT104 and the Danish pig industry at their own expense cull herds, where
DT104 is found. It is correct, as supposed by Ralph Blanchfield, that some
farmers feed their dogs these snacks, and they may therefore be a source of
infection for the herds, as well as for people handling them.
In addition to the recent report from Canada on salmonella infected dog
treats and the present one from Denmark, a recent article in the Norwegian
MSIS bulletin (No. 48, 1999) also reported massive contamination of this
type of product with salmonella. The Swedish annual report to the EU
commission on the trend in zoonoses in 1998 reported that 67 percent of 48
batches of dog snacks imported into Sweden were positive for salmonellae.
In Denmark and Norway there are no known human salmonella cases that have
been attributed to this type of product, however, for Denmark this may be
because nobody thought to ask.
These dog snacks may be manufactured from dried pigs ears, bull penises or
from cattle hide. It would appear that for pigs ears the manufacturing
process consists of drying at temperatures between 75 and 90 degrees
centigrade. It is not know whether the salmonella survive the drying or
whether they represent re-contamination.
It would appear prudent to always be aware that these products may be
contaminated with _Salmonella_ and to take appropriate precautions (hand
washing, keep away from small children, etc.)
