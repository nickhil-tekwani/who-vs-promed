30 cases of Mayaro in Goias
---------------------------------
Up to 1 Jul 2015, Goias has recorded 30 cases of Mayaro fever. O Popular was told on 7 Mar 2015 that 3 cases had been identified.

A biomedical member of State Zoonosis Coordination of the Department of Health (SES), Liliane Rock Siriano, explains that the numbers still do not worry them, since the disease was confirmed only in people who had contact with the countryside and wild forests. She says the numbers may be even higher, since the symptoms are initially very similar to those of dengue. "The identification is only made with differential diagnoses and they are not always completed," she explains.

Mayaro fever is caused by MAYV virus and causes high fever, body aches and joint pain. The resemblance to dengue stops there. After the 1st symptoms, severe pain in the body, especially the joints, appears. This may cause temporary incapacitation for work and, in some cases, can lead to hospitalization. The disease can also cause some skin rashes, nausea, back pain and photophobia (aversion to light). Liliane explains the symptoms usually last a few days and usually evolve to cure without sequelae. Only the pain may continue. This symptom is similar to chikungunya, which also has low lethality and features intense joint pain.

Mayaro virus has been known since the 1950s, with about 1000 confirmed cases. Liliane points out that in 1987 Goias experienced an outbreak of the disease, but does not believe a new epidemic [is occurring].

[Information on person-times-place is almost absent. Apparently all are autochonous cases. What is the link between them? What is the location of infection -- other than "countryside and wild forests"? How was the diagnosis made? What laboratory techniques were used: serology? Viral isolation? PCR? Dengue was discarded and mainly chikungunya (which like Mayaro, is an Alphavirus, Togaviridae)? Additional information would be welcome. Let's be on the watch. - Mod RNA

As Mod.JT noted in a previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20110222.0587), Mayaro fever is a zoonosis produced by an arbovirus. Mayaro virus (MAYV), of the Alphavirus genus, Togaviridae family, is endemic in tropical areas of South America (Trinidad, Suriname, French Guyana, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela). The transmission cycle is very similar to yellow fever virus, with primates as reservoirs and _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes as vectors. Human cases are associated with recent exposures to humid forest environments that the vectors inhabit. Unfortunately, in the periodical article cited in the report, no information is provided about previous exposure of the confirmed cases to non-urban forest environments.

Although to date no urban outbreaks of Mayaro fever have been described, MAYV is capable of replicating in _Aedes albopictus_ cells
[C6-36 cells] in culture. Also, it is possible to infect _Ae. aegypti_ under laboratory conditions after ingestion of a moderate [virus] dose orally and later transmit the infection [virus] to hamsters. It is estimated the the capacity for MAYV urban transmission depends in large measure on the magnitude and duration of viremia in humans in relation to the susceptibility of _Ae. aegypti_ to the virus. However, no data are available for these critical aspects. - Mod.JT

Because of the clinical similarities of MAYV and dengue virus infections, one cannot help but wonder how many MAYV infections in the South American tropics are incorrectly attributed to dengue virus in the absence of laboratory confirmation. Are we seeing the tip of a large iceberg?
