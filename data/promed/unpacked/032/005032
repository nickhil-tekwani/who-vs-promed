Haitian health authorities on Fri 30 Sep 2011, said the number of
deaths caused by cholera increased to 6435 in the Caribbean country
since October 2010.

The Haitian Health Ministry said the number of people infected with
cholera almost reached half a million, although the ministry repeated
the epidemic was decreasing. The report said 455 727 people had been
treated due to cholera, and 242 205 had to be hospitalized.

The western province of Artibonite suffered the plague most with 1196
deaths. The southwest province of Nippes registered the smallest death
toll of 181. Meanwhile, in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, 221
people have been killed since October 2010 when the epidemic first
broke out in central Haiti.

The Dominican Republic, a country neighboring the island country Haiti
to the east, has also been suffering the disease since November 2010,
which has killed at least 135 people there.

[The Hispaniola outbreak of cholera in Haiti, and to a less extent its
neighbor the Dominican Republic, is an infectious disease analogy of a
wild fire beginning in an area after a drought producing a great
amount of dry tinder. A large number of people in an area with minimal
sanitary conditions made worse by a large earthquake [12 Jan 2010]
provided ingredients to make a cholera wildfire when the pathogen was
introduced onto the island. - Mod.LL]
