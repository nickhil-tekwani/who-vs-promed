After recording 2 386 836 dengue fever cases in 2013, the nations of the Western hemisphere have seen a significant decrease in cases of the mosquito borne disease with 5 epidemiological weeks left in 2014, according to Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) data released Monday [8 Dec 2014].

After 47 weeks in 2014, the PAHO is reporting 1 081 067 dengue cases in the Americas, or less than half the cases seen in the whole of 2013.

Brazil has seen a dramatic difference in cases, where in 2013, the South American country recorded 1 468 873. Thus far this year [2014], Brazil has only seen 547 612 cases.

In addition to the total number of cases, the number of fatalities has also declined significantly, from 1318 deaths in 2013 to 624 deaths so far in 2014. Severe dengue is also down dramatically, from 37 903 last year [2013] to 14 316 in 2014, with 5 weeks left.

The number of dengue cases in the Americas is only slightly higher than the number of chikungunya cases reported during the same period.

Dengue is an infectious disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV). There are 4 serotypes called DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. Infection with one serotype produces lifelong immunity against reinfection with that serotype. All serotypes have been isolated in the Americas. In several countries, they circulate simultaneously, creating a serious risk for an epidemic.

The _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes are transmitters of dengue [viruses]. The _Aedes aegypti_ female mosquitoes are the main source of dengue transmission. These species bite during the day, with the most active feeding period 2 hours before and after dawn and dusk.
