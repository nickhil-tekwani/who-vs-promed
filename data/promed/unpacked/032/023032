2002/075 Situation of quarantine pests in Latvia in 2001
The NPPO of Latvia recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of the
situation of several quarantine pests in 2001. The situation of the
pest concerned is indicated in bold, using the terms of ISPM no. 8.
Beet necrotic yellow vein furovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) During
a survey [for this virus that causes] rhizomania, 46 samples were
collected from [sugar beet] farms. [No] virus was ... found. Absent,
confirmed by survey.
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest)
57 seed potato production farms were inspected and 190 samples were taken.
Infection was found in 5 farms. Strict control measures are being taken, in
accordance with EU Directive 93/85/EEC. Present, found at 5
production sites, under official control.
_Erwinia amylovora_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest)
65 sites of fireblight host plants (_Chaenomeles_, _Cotoneaster_,
_Crataegus_, _Malus_, _Pyrus_, _Sorbus_) covering a total area of
385.91 ha were inspected and 67 samples were tested for the presence
of _Erwinia amylovora_. [None was found]. Absent, confirmed by survey.
_Globodera rostochiensis_ [Gr] and _Globodera pallida_ [Gp] (both EPPO A2
quarantine pests)
4 474 soil samples were collected from 59 seed potato production
farms and 56 nurseries and tested. Gr ... was confirmed in 97
samples. 16 seed potato production farms and 6 nurseries were
infested. Eradication measures are being taken in the infested
area[s]. Gp ... was not found. Gr: Present, found in several
production sites, under eradication. Gp: Absent, confirmed by survey.

[Of the 4 items in this report, a comment on the potato cyst
nematodes may be in order. Gr (Golden nematode, Potato cyst nematode)
and Gp (White cyst nematode, Potato cyst nematode) are closely
related species that infect potato. There are some morphological
differences between Gp and Gr; e.g. in the larval lip region, etc.
Both have narrow host ranges (potato, tomato and some weeds). Gr is
extensively distributed in at least 28 countries in the Americas,
European Union, former Soviet Union, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
Gr, but not Gp, has been reported from USA. Gr is considered by many
to be potentially the most damaging pest of potato. Both Canada, USA
and Mexico have established domestic and foreign quarantine
restrictions designed to prevent spread of Gr from known infested
areas to uninfested areas within their borders and to prevent
introduction from areas known to be infested outside their borders.
