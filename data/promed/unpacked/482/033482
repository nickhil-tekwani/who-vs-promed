500 cattle and goats in Bertholene vaccinated against anthrax
-------------------------------------------------------------
The laboratory of the French agency for food safety (AFSSA) has confirmed
anthrax on a farm. Anthrax has occurred in a goat and cattle in Bertholene.
As a preventive measure, 500 animals have been vaccinated.

The Aveyron departmental directorate of veterinary services (DDSV 12) on
Wednesday [22 Jul 2009] announced a case of anthrax in a cattle and goat
farm in Bertholene. The suspicion goes back to 15 Jul 2009, when the
necropsy of several dead animals was undertaken by the departmental
laboratory. Anthrax was then confirmed by the French agency for food safety
(AFSSA), based in Maison-Alfort.

But without waiting for the result, DDSV initiated the required sanitary
measures -- disinfection, clinical monitoring, and limiting the movement of
animals on this farm -- have been undertaken. And, in recent days, an
extensive vaccination campaign was initiated for nearly 150 cattle and 350
goats.

At the same time, all persons working on the farm and those in direct
contact with the animals have been entrusted to the care of the
inter-regional epidemiology unit (CIRE) and the internal medicine
department of the Jacques Puel hospital in Rodez. Although no human cases
of the disease have been detected, all persons were subjected to preventive
treatment.

"This disease was not reported in the department for many years. However, 2
outbreaks were found in Lozere and the Cantal in early 2007," says DDSV
indicating that [these] diseased animals were found in summer grazing
cattle from herds in Aveyron.

Even if it remains limited to a single holding, the emergence of this
disease constitutes a new blow to agriculture in Aveyron.

[We apologise for the late posting of this report but it has only just
surfaced. Input from our French members would be appreciated in reference
to these outbreaks in France, specifically into the emergence of such
numbers of outbreaks in a matter of 2 weeks. Normally the disease is very
sporadic in this country. Also with the appearance on this disease in the
French communes in the Savoie on the Italian border one must question
whether it may also be occurring in livestock in NW Italy. - Mod.MHJ
