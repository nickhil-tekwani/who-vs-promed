Indonesia: fatal case of rabies in Ruteng (Flore)
-------------------------------------------------
Eligilius Tantu (15), [a] dog-bite patient who was bitten by a rabid dog,
died in the regional public hospital (RSUD) Ruteng, on Wed. The Topok
resident from the Ponggeok Village of th Satar Mese Subdistrict died after
being treated for 6 days in this hospital.
The director of RSUD Ruteng, Dr Dupe Nababan, confirmed the news to the
Kupang Post in RSUD Ruteng, on Thur (8 Feb 2007). He explained that the
victim was already in a critical condition when sent to RSUD Ruteng. The
patient had suffered several symptoms, such as suffocating, pain in the
throat, hydrophobia, fear of light, fear of wind, anxiety, and drooling.
Therefore, the only medical treatment that could be given to the victim was
symptomatic.
"As soon as we received further information from the family, that the
patient had been bitten by a rabid dog, we came to the conclusion that the
patient suffered from rabies." The patient, however, already was in a
critical condition. Dr Dupe Nababan explained, that in this stage, the
chance for the patient to survive was small. Mr Nababan explained, that the
victim had been bitten by the rabid dog on his left arm in November 2006.
The victim had already [undergone] VAR (anti rabies vaccination) 4 times in
a local health centre in Ponggeok region. However, on the last week before
death, the victim's condition worsened and he was sent to the principal
hospital in Ruteng.
Another rabid dog victim was admitted to the principal hospital right after
the death of the first rabies victim. She was a 3 year old girl.
Unfortunately, she was already in a very critical condition. She had the
similar symptoms as the first victim and her condition was even slightly
worse. On 13 Jan 2007, she had been bitten on her lower lip by her mother's
employer's dog. According to Dr Nababan, it was very difficult to save a
victim with those symptoms. "The patient was already in a very critical
condition. There was not much anymore that we could do," he said.
Dr Nababan gave some first aid tips for treating victims of rabid dog
bites. Right after the bite, the wound should be washed clean with water
and soap. The next important thing to do is to seek medical attention and
get anti rabies vaccination (VAR) injections. He also suggested that stray
and local dogs should be eliminated, because rabies virus spreads very
rapidly in an infected area. It starts with one infected dog and will
multiply in a very short time. Right now, the local Government has shot
many dogs, with or without owners." However, the effort wasn't maximal,
because the rabies prevention movement only took place in Manggarai region.
To reach the ultimate goal of eliminating the virus, the government should
eliminate every single dog in Flores, he said.
Together with the second representative of Manggarai region, Dr Deno
Kamelus, head of livestock section, drh. Yoseph Mantara, and head of the
health section, Dr Yulius Weng, the regional leader of Rotok explained,
dogs are animals which associate very closely with community. It was a very
hard decision to eliminate rabies-infected dogs. Manggarai's local
Government was determined to eliminate all dogs to stop the spreading
virus. However, the Regional Government of Rotok, will distribute new,
healthy dogs to some people who got their previous dog infected and needed
to be eliminated. The head of the regional health section, Dr Yulius Weng,
explained that at this moment, Manggarai [has] run out of VAR . Some new
vaccines will be sent to Manggarai from Kupang region.
Nine people from Manggarai died of rabies in 2005. In 2006 and 2007 two
more people died because of the same disease. Another rabies victim is
currently under treatment.

[The lack of success in treatment of these two rabies cases (one already
fatal) on Flores emphasizes the need for administration of anti-rabies
vaccine as early as possible after contact between a bite victim and a
rabid animal. Although the currently available tissue culture and
egg-adapted anti-rabies vaccines are universally protective, the technique
and timing ofof administration are critical.
The World Health Organization has recently published a comprehensive update
on pre- and post-exposure adminstration of anti-rabies vaccine. This
document is published in the 23 Feb 2007 issue of the WHO Weekly
Epidemiological Record (vol62(8): 6-68), available via
<http://www.who.int/wer>.
The attempt to control human rabies by slaughter of domestic and feral dogs
and their subsequent replacement by virus-free dogs does not appear to have
moderateed the prevalence of human rabies on Flores and a different
strategy will have to be devised.
