2006 West Nile Virus Activity in the United States
(Reported to CDC for the year through 27 Jun
2006)* [latest on website as of 8 July 2006]
--------------------------------------------------
*Data are being collected from state and local
health departments on a weekly basis and are
reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks,
human cases, veterinary cases, and mosquito
surveillance. Maps detailing county-level wild
bird, sentinel chicken flock, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance data
are published each week on the collaborative
USGS/CDC West Nile virus web site: <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov/>

As of 27 Jun 2006 avian, animal or mosquito WNV
infections have been reported to CDC ArboNET from
the following states: Arkansas, California,
Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New
York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Human cases have been reported from Colorado, Mississippi and Texas.

State / Neuroinvasion* / West Nile fever** / Other*** / Total **** / Fatalities

Colorado / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0
Mississippi / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Texas / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

** Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as
WN encephalitis, meningitis* and myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion.
*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness
reported to ArboNET by state and local health departments.

Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease
cases, particularly West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.

West Nile fever refers to typically less severe
cases that show no evidence of neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it
is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC. Click here
for further explanations of neuroinvasive West
Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.

Other Clinical includes persons with clinical
manifestations other than WN fever, WN
encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those
for which sufficient clinical information was not provided.

Total Human Cases Reported to CDC - These numbers
reflect both mild and severe human disease cases
occurring from 1 Jan 2005 through 23 Aug 2005
that have been reported to ArboNet by state and
local health departments. ArboNet is the
national, electronic surveillance system
established by CDC to assist states in tracking
West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2006 virus/disease activity
is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

WN virus antibody-positive sentinel animals
(birds and/or horses) have been found in Arkansas,
California and North Dakota.

WN equine infections have been reported from
Iowa, North Dakota, Wyoming and Wisconsin.

WN virus has been detected in dead wild birds in
Arkansas, California, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri,
Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin.

WN virus has been detected in mosquito pools
collected in California, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin.
