Scientists believe they have found the cause of the narcolepsy cases uncovered after Sweden's inoculation drive against swine flu [influenza H1N1 pdm09]. The jab may have set off an auto-immune response that caused brain damage.

The Pandemrix vaccine likely "fooled" the brain to attack cells in the brain that regulate sleeping patterns. The cells in question produce a protein called hypocretin, which regulates whether a person is awake or asleep.

Sweden offered its citizens the vaccine against swine flu during the epidemic in 2009-2010, which claimed between 9 to 31 Swedes' lives. Experts at the time said they feared the disease would be as big a killer as the Spanish flu in the late 1910s, when an estimated 3-5 percent of the world's population succumbed. Since the inoculation drive, however, more than 100 Swedes -- many of them teenagers -- have developed narcolepsy. The Swedish Medical Products Agency (Lakemedelsverket) ordered a massive study to determine whether the vaccine had any connection to narcolepsy. It compared 3.3 million vaccinated Swedes with 2.5 million who were not vaccinated.

"We can see that over the whole study period, we have 126 cases of those vaccinated getting narcolepsy," Ingemar Person, professor behind the study, said in a statement on Tuesday [17 Dec 2013]. "There were 20 cases among those not vaccinated. We're talking about a 3-fold increase in risk."

The scientists at the Stanford School of Medicine have now said that a part of the vaccine had some similarities to parts of hypocretin that trigger the immune system. The scientists said that the ensuing reaction meant the body's own immune system could not see the difference between the hypocretin and the parts of the flu virus that the body was meant to attack. The end result: The body attacked the part of the brain that regulates sleeping patterns. "We have long thought that auto-immune diseases don't afflict the brain, but that is obviously not correct," according to the Stanford researcher Emmanuel Mignot.

Narcolepsy is a chronic nervous system disorder that causes excessive drowsiness, often causing people to fall asleep uncontrollably and, in more severe cases, to suffer hallucinations or paralysing physical collapses called cataplexy.

Sweden was not alone in facing narcolepsy cases after the jab drive. In Finland, 79 children aged 4 to 19 developed narcolepsy after receiving the Pandemrix vaccine in 2009 and 2010, while in Sweden, the number was close to 200, according to figures in the 2 countries released last year [2012]. Sweden has more than 9 million citizens, while Finland has some 5 million, making the cases approximately proportionate to population size.

In the past years, the Finnish and Swedish governments have both agreed to provide financial compensation for the affected children after their own national research showed a link between the inoculation and narcolepsy.

[Previously, a British Medical Journal paper reported that: "Case notes for 245 children and young people were reviewed; 75 had narcolepsy (56 with cataplexy) and onset after 1 Jan 2008. Eleven had been vaccinated before onset; 7 within 6 months. In those with a diagnosis by July 2011, the odds ratio was 14.4 (95 percent confidence interval 4.3 to 48.5) for vaccination at any time before onset and 16.2 (3.1 to 84.5) for vaccination within 6 months before onset. The relative incidence from the self controlled cases series analysis in those with a diagnosis by July 2011 with onset from October 2008 to December 2010 was 9.9 (2.1 to 47.9). The attributable risk was estimated as between one in 57 500 and one in 52 000 doses." It was concluded that "the increased risk of narcolepsy after vaccination with AS03 adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 vaccine indicates a causal association, consistent with findings from Finland. Because of variable delay in diagnosis, however, the risk might be overestimated by more rapid referral of vaccinated children."

The CDC has issued a statement on narcolepsy following the Pandemrix influenza vaccination experience in Europe (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/h1n1_narcolepsy_pandemrix.html). An increased risk of narcolepsy was found following vaccination with Pandemrix, a monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine that was used in several European countries during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally. This risk was initially found in Finland, and then some other European countries also detected an association. Most recently, scientists at the United Kingdom's (UK) Health Protection Agency (HPA) have found evidence of an association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy in children in England. The findings are consistent with studies from Finland and other countries.

Pandemrix is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in Europe and was specifically produced for pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza [A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection]. It was not used before 2009 and has not been used since the influenza pandemic season (2009-2010). It contains an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant called AS03. Adjuvants are substances added to a vaccine to increase the body's immune response to that vaccine.

Pandemrix was not licensed for use in the United States. In fact, no adjuvanted influenza vaccines are licensed in the United States, and no adjuvanted influenza vaccines were used in the United States during the influenza pandemic or in any other influenza season.

In response to the events in Europe, CDC reviewed data from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and, to date, have found no indication of any association between US-licensed H1N1 or seasonal influenza vaccine and narcolepsy.

CDC is currently sponsoring an international study on the associations between adjuvanted monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines and narcolepsy. That study is expected to be completed in 2014.

It is unclear whether this new account refers to the previous investigations or merely restates previous findings. Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
