New Jersey Man Dies of Lassa Fever
-------------------------------------------
A New Jersey man who recently returned from a trip to Liberia has died of
an illness that had not been detected in the USA since 1989 but is common
in West Africa, state health officials said Thursday.
The 38-year-old man from the Trenton area died of Lassa fever, a virus
spread through rat droppings or urine that can be passed to other people
through bodily fluids but not through causal contact, officials said.
It is unlikely that other passengers on the man's flight back from Africa
or those who treated him were exposed, according to Dr. Clifton Lacy, state
health commissioner. An anti-viral drug is effective in treating most
cases of the disease, Lacy said. "It's only the high-risk individuals,
really, who have the chance of getting the illness,'' said Dr. Eddy
Bresnitz, state chief epidemiologist.
High risk is considered coming into contact with blood, vomit or other
bodily secretions from an infected person. It is believed no employees at
the hospital had high-risk contact, but some are still being questioned,
Bresnitz said.
The man was admitted to the hospital after arriving at the emergency room
24 Aug 2004. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died of massive
kidney and liver failure on 28 Aug 2004, said Dr. Nick Karabulut of Capital
Health System Mercer Medical Center, where the man was treated. "We are
comfortable that this case will remain an isolated case,'' Karabulut said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta diagnosed the
cause of death as Lassa fever Thursday afternoon. Authorities said they
were trying to identify the flight the man was on, which landed in Newark,
and that the CDC would attempt to contact those who were on the plane. [CDC
has since done that. - Mod.JW]. The man's family said he did not have
symptoms of the disease, such as diarrhea, vomiting or coughing while on
the flight, so there is little chance any other passengers were exposed,
Bresnitz said.
Between 100 000 and 300 000 people get Lassa fever in West Africa each
year, Lacy said. There are about 5000 deaths a year, but most people get
mild symptoms or none at all.

[The illness was first recorded in 1969 when two missionary nurses died in
Nigeria. The cause was found to be Lassa virus, named after the Nigerian
town where the cases originated. There is an ongoing outbreak of Lassa
fever across the border from Liberia in Sierra Leone -- see 1st ref. below.
