One person died and a further 7 were infected in a recent anthrax
outbreak in Guinea-Bissau that was apparently caused by eating bad
meat, the health ministry said on Monday [9 Apr 2007].
Between 24 Mar and 6 Apr 2007, 8 cases of the disease were recorded
in Bissaora, a town [70 km. (44 miles)] north of the capital Bissau,
said the ministry's director general, Placido Cardoso.
"The people affected by the disease had eaten contaminated meat
during a traditional mass circumcision ceremony," he said.
Cardoso did not say where the bad meat had come from but said a
veterinary team had been sent to the region.
He added that 5 [cases of anthrax infection in cows] had been
recorded in Quinhacam village, in the same area, and the local
population had been warned against eating meat of uncertain origin.
In 2005, 5 people died during an anthrax epidemic in several villages
in the Mansoa region, east of Bissau.
Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by the _Bacillus anthracis_
bacteria, found in wild cattle and domestic livestock. It can be
caught by humans through exposure to infected animals or their
undercooked meat.

[A review of the ProMED-mail reports of outbreaks involving both
humans and cattle indicates the wide geographic distribution. We know
that anthrax is a worldwide problem but it useful to remember that
zoonotic transmission occurs fairly frequently. The method of
transmission between cattle and humans may result in gastrointestinal
or cutaneous anthrax depending on the circumstances of the outbreak
and its location. In fact, this outbreak serves to remind us of the
potential of human gastrointestinal anthrax when cattle die suddenly
while appearing to be relatively healthy and therefore are regarded
as viable meat. - Mod.PC
