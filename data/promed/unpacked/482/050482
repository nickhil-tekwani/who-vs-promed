Outbreaks of bluetongue disease in several sheep flocks throughout Israel with severe, typical clinical signs and mortality were clinically diagnosed and reported on 9 Oct 2012 in posting 20121009.1333636. The following comment was added: "Laboratory confirmation and particularly serotype identification are anticipated with interest and will be posted when they become available."

We are very grateful for the following information, received today (15 Nov 2012) from the Viral Diagnosis Laboratory, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health, Beit-Dagan:

Samples derived from clinically affected sheep from several locations, obtained in September-October 2012, have been found PCR positive for bluetongue and have been serotyped BTV-2 and BTV-4.

The diagnostic methods applied were:

- realtime RT-PCR bluetongue group;
- virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs;
- serotyping of isolates by serotype-specific conventional RT-PCR.

[Bluetongue has been regarded endemic in Israel since its initial laboratory-confirmed identification in 1951, with clinical disease seen in the majority of years since 1964. Until recently, the disease affected mainly sheep of susceptible breeds (European mutton and dairy sheep breeds and, to a lesser extent, their crosses with local Awassi fat-tail sheep). The disease is strictly seasonal (August-December, peaking October-November). Five BTV serotypes were identified in Israel between 1951 and 1973, namely (year of 1st identification in brackets): BTV-4 (1951), BTV-16 (1968), BTV-6 (1972), BTV-2 (1973), and BTV-10 (1973). BTV-4 was, throughout these years, the most prevalent serotype.

Then, after 32 years of a seemingly stable situation, a new strain appeared, namely BTV-15 (2006), affecting sheep. This was followed by the reporting of 3 other new BTV strains which, surprisingly, caused clinical disease in cattle as well. These were BTV-24 (2008), BTV-8 (2008, eventually identified in early 2009), and BTV-5 (2009). A closely related, other new orbivirus affecting cattle, namely epizootic haemorrhagic disease, appeared for the 1st time in Israel in 2006.

The change observed since 2006, namely the appearance of 5 new culicoides-borne orbiviruses in ruminants in Israel remains to be explained (It may be assumed that the appearance of new vectorborne viruses is not restricted to Israel within the region).

The diagnosis of BT outbreaks caused by BTV serotypes that are regarded to be endemic does not require immediate notification to the OIE. These outbreaks are required, according to OIE guidelines, to be included in the semi- and annual reports; such reports become publicly available only after publication; this may take up to a year, and sometimes longer, after their actual occurrence. However, data on the identity of circulating serotypes, which may vary from year to year, are of epidemiological significance on national and international levels and may have impact upon preventive and control measures to be considered.

ProMED-mail has approached the Israeli Veterinary Services to provide the information on outbreaks of "endemic" BT serotypes as close to their laboratory confirmation as possible. Their willingness to do so is gratefully acknowledged. Their full details will be included, as prescribed, in the annual reports.

BTV-4 has recently been reported from the Eastern Mediterranean, namely Aegean Greek islands adjacent to the Turkish mainland. Coordinated studies of the dynamics of BTV and other orbiviruses throughout the region deserve encouragement. - Mod.AS
