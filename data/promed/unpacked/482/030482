Alert: Rust in another 3 Florida counties -- 9 total this week
--------------------------------
Asian soybean rust [ASR] was confirmed by PCR testing yesterday for 3 more
Florida counties: Taylor, Columbia and Hillsborough, according to
<http://www.sbrusa.net>. That makes 18 Florida counties that are affected
by ASR, with half of those confirmations reported just this week.
In Columbia County, which is bordered by ASR-positive counties Hamilton and
Alachua, the finding was soybean from a sentinel plot. ASR was found on
kudzu in both Taylor County (north-central Florida on the coast) and
Hillsborough County, which is the next county south from Pasco, the 1st
county in the state to have ASR this year. (Note: The official spelling for
the county is "Hillsborough," not "Hillsboro" as reported in the state
commentary provided on the USDA site.)
All findings were confirmed with microscopy and PCR. Santa Rosa, Okaloosa,
and Holmes were confirmed 10 Aug 2005, and they were all soybeans from
soybean sentinel plots, and on Monday, Florida reported positive findings
from last week in Alachua, Lee and Hamilton counties.
The 15 Florida counties with rust as of 12 Aug 2005 (see map from website)
are: Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Holmes, Gadsden, Leon, Jefferson,
Taylor, Madison, Hamilton, Columbia, Alachua, Marion, Hernando, Pasco,
Hillsborough, Lee, and Dade.

[ASR continues to spread. Some producers are spraying approved fungicides
in attempts to minimize disease development.
