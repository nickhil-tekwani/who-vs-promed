A 3-year-old horse in St James Parish was euthanized after
authorities discovered Monday [12 Jul 2010] that it had eastern
equine encephalitis [EEE] and West Nile virus, state agriculture
officials said Tuesday [13 Jul 2010].

The Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Baton Rouge
confirmed EEE and West Nile virus in the mare, officials with the
Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry said in a statement.

Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain said in the
statement that both illnesses are "very preventable diseases."

"All horse owners should keep their equine vaccinations up to date
and consult a veterinarian if their animals are displaying any
unusual neurological signs," Strain said in the statement.

He said horse owners, at a minimum, should vaccinate against tetanus,
EEE, western equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, and rabies.

Agriculture officials said the diseases affect the brain. Signs could
include depression, lack of coordination, walking in circles, facial
twitching, and other neurological anomalies.

An infected horse eventually collapses to the ground, agriculture
officials said.

[How sad for the owners of the horse and for the horse. It was
preventable with a vaccine. Mosquitoes need to be controlled in barns
and repellent used on the animals.

It is the season for eastern equine encephalitis, and if you have not
yet vaccinated your horses you are advised to do so at once. - Mod.TG]
