Romania confirmed cases of deadly avian flu in birds in 5 more villages in
and around the Danube delta on Thursday and warned migratory flocks could
carry the virus south to neighbouring Bulgaria.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has now been found in at least 9 Romanian
villages in the east of the country. The latest cases were confirmed after
tests at a British laboratory.
H5N1 is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia, where it has killed 71 people
since late 2003. Experts say a flu pandemic among humans could kill
millions around the globe and cause massive economic losses.
"Flocks of migratory birds are heading to the northern parts of Bulgaria,"
agriculture minister Gheorghe Flutur told reporters, citing latest
ornithologists' findings. "We sent a notification to the Bulgarian embassy."
Bulgarian officials said precautionary measures against were being taken
against the spread of the virus. Flutur said the virus appeared to be
edging westwards to poultry in more densely populated areas but was
unlikely to hit big cities like Bucharest because it spread only when
migratory birds came into contact with domestic fowl. "The flu can't
practically reach the capital," he said. The virus remains hard for people
to catch, but there are fears it could mutate into a form easily
transmissible among humans. There have been no cases in people outside Asia.
Following outbreaks in Romania and its southern neighbour Turkey in October
of the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus, Bulgaria has stepped up monitoring
in poultry farms and wetlands for possible cases. It has also banned
poultry imports from affected countries such as Romania and Ukraine.
Alexander Alexandrov, director of the state veterinarian office in northern
Bulgaria, said birds had yet to land at their usual winter stopover at 2
lakes near the Black Sea. "We can protect the country. The migration of
possibly infected birds is not that fatal [?]; what is important is to
prevent direct contact between domestic and wild fowl," he said. "We have
issued orders for farmers to keep domestic birds indoors... We have also
demanded higher sanitary standards at poultry farms to avoid the possible
spread of the disease."
Romania has set aside around $700 000 for compensation for farmers affected
by the virus. Some 60 000 domestic birds have been culled and farmers are
banned from selling live poultry anywhere in the country.
Farm ministers from Germany, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Moldova plan to meet in
Bucharest in early February 2006 to discuss joining forces to fight the
disease, Flutur said. The Danube delta is Europe's largest wetlands and
lies on a major migratory route for wild birds which travel south each
winter from Scandinavia and Russia to northern Africa.
Romania has found bird flu strains in 19 villages in and around the delta.
9 outbreaks have been confirmed as H5N1 while tests are still pending on
samples from other villages.
Authorities said on Monday they detected the H5 virus in several hens and
turkeys in the village of Braesti in Buzau county, about 130 km (80 miles)
west of the Danube delta and about 150 km northeast of the capital Bucharest.

Fecal samples taken from migratory birds in Guandu yesterday [14 Dec 2005]
tested positive for the HN virus responsible for the bird flu which has
swept across south eastern Asia.
This was the 3rd time this year that the HN-virus strain has been found in
Taiwan and with the infection "danger period" between January and March
coming up, Council of Agriculture (COA) officials warned the public to take
extra precautions to avoid catching the flu.
In a routine fecal sampling by the Wild Bird Federation, the H5N2 and H7N3
viruses -- low-pathogenic strains of the HN family of viruses -- were found
in marshlands in Guandu.
Head of the council's Animal Health division, Huang Guo-ching said,
"Luckily, these strains are of low pathogenicity so should pose no threat
to public health. It is also lucky that there are no poultry farms within a
3-km radius of Guandu."
This is the 2nd time that a strain of the HN family of viruses has been
found in Guandu in 2005. The H7N3 variant of the virus, also of low
pathogenicity, was found there in April. Just last month [November 2005],
the H7N3 strain of the virus was found for the 2nd time this year, in
marshlands near Tainan.
Huang speculated that the 2nd H7N3 virus found in Guandu originated from
the same flock of birds responsible for the virus found earlier in Tainan
and Guandu. This flock was probably from Siberia, as it arrived in Taiwan
earlier than other flocks of migratory birds.
Speculating that the next flock was due to arrive from China later in
December 2005, Huang said, "At that time all the different flocks of
migratory birds will be mixed together, which will increase the risk of
spreading the HN virus. That's why we are getting so nervous now and urging
the public to take serious precautions."
The COA has already contacted the Center for Disease Control, the
Department of Health and the Wild Bird Federation regarding the result of
the tests. The council urged poultry farmers to put up wire fencing to keep
migratory birds from mixing with their own birds and so minimize the risk
of bird flu spreading.
