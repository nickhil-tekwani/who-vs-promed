["Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by several species in the genus _Brucella_. Reproductive losses are the most common syndrome in animals, while humans may suffer from a debilitating nonspecific illness or localized involvement of various organs. Each species of _Brucella_ tends to be associated with a specific host, but other animals can be infected, especially when they are in close contact. Cattle are the usual hosts for _B. abortus_. This organism also causes brucellosis in bison, water buffalo, camels, and elk, and occasionally affects other species. Most people become infected by direct contact with infected animals or their tissues, or by ingesting contaminated dairy products.

"_B. abortus_ has been eradicated from some countries, but it continues to cause economic losses from abortions and lost trade in others". (Source: http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_abortus.pdf). - Mod.CRD
