High prevalence of Leishmaniasis in Afghanistan
-------------------------------------------
The Dutch non-governmental organization HealthNet International (HNI) has
carried out a cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) prevalence survey in the city of
Faizabad, Badakshan province, Afghanistan, which showed that 152/1832 (8.3
percent) of surveyed people had CL lesions.
Based on Faizabad population estimates of 65 000 people and observed CL
prevalence, it is estimated that there are approximately 5400 CL cases in
Faizabad. It was also shown that 142/1832 (7.8 percent) of surveyed people
had CL scars. The low prevalence of CL scars, compared with the high
prevalence of disease, shows that CL has been introduced into Faizabad only
recently; indeed, records by the local Ministry of Health show that the
disease was virtually unknown [<50 annual cases] in Badakshan in 2000.
Though no attempts were made to identify the species of circulating
Leishmania, it appears that current epidemic is due to _L. tropica_,
because of the clustering of cases and because both sexes are equally
affected. In Afghanistan, the majority of CL cases are caused by _L.
tropica_, which is transmitted anthroponoticically by the sandfly
_Phlebotomus sergenti_. Though non-fatal, CL can have devastating effects
on local communities due to its clinical symptoms, i.e., large and/or
multiple disfiguring lesions, which can lead to social ostracism of
affected individuals.
Recent data on the burden of CL in Afghanistan has only been available for
Kabul city, where studies carried out by the non-governmental organization
HealthNet International (HNI) have reported an estimated 67 500 cases. HNI
has now set up 3 leishmaniasis clinics in Faizabad (i) to increase the
total number of patients diagnosed and treated; (ii) to reduce the risk to
susceptible individuals through the distribution of insecticide-impregnated
bed-nets; (iii) to train and supervise the Ministry of Health staff in
diagnosis, treatment and prevention; and (iv) to implement health education
campaigns, both for patients attending the clinics as well as the community
at large.

[The report confirms the previous reports of a large epidemic of
Leishmaniasis in Afghanistan, which came to light after the fall of the
Taliban regime. In 2002, the WHO estimated 200 000 cases of cutaneous
Leishmaniasis in Kabul alone:

Whether the estimate of 35 000 cases in the present report represents a
true decline in prevalence -- or just the uncertainty of the estimates --
remains to be seen. - Mod.EP]
