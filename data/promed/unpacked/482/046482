A horse in the town of West Monroe [Oswego county] died last week [week of 6 Aug 2018] of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], a mosquito-borne virus, according to the Oswego County Health Department.

The diagnosis was confirmed by tests performed by the state Health Department.

While there is no EEE vaccine available for humans, there is a vaccine for horses. The health department said horse owners should talk to veterinarians about getting their horses vaccinated.

Horses cannot spread the disease to people, but it can be transmitted by infected mosquitoes to humans and horses.

Human cases of EEE are rare. About 1/3 of people who get EEE die from the disease and most survivors suffer brain damage. There have been 8 reported human EEE deaths in Central New York since 1971 -- 5 in Oswego and 3 in Onondaga.

Mosquitoes with EEE have been collected recently in the towns of West Monroe and Cicero. County health departments in Oswego and Onondaga plan to conduct aerial spraying of mosquitoes in the Toad Harbor Oswego county] and Cicero [Onondaga county] swamps.

Public health officials say people should use repellent, wear protective clothing outdoors, and remove standing water from their yards that can serve as mosquito breeding grounds.

[Sporadic cases of EEE continue to occur because owners are failing to vaccinate their animals. Mosquito control is also important in controlling this disease. - Mod.TG
