India: 26 cases of monkey-fever reported in Karnataka
--------------------------------------------
Monkey-fever [Kyasanur Forest disease] has made a comeback in some parts of
the State of Karnataka this summer, prompting the district administration
to go on a vaccination drive. Shimoga District Health Officer, Dr. S.H.
Satish, said that vaccination is given free to all villagers in the Malnad
area of Shimoga, Chikmagalur, parts of Uttara and Dakshina Kannada.

"The disease would prove fatal only when it affects the brain (viral
encephalitis). Once a person realizes that he has been bitten by a tick,
vaccination should be sought at the earliest opportunity. This lessens the
severity of the disease," he said. "Irritation, red rashes, and formation
of patches appear immediately after the tick bites. Some people are found
to be allergic, which makes it very obvious," Satish said.

According to health officials, the number of people affected and killed by
this disease has come down drastically. So far in 2004, only one fatal
case was reported. The remaining 26, reported at the Primary Health Centre
of Myshi village of Malur, recovered. "We had vaccinated 28 000 villagers
belonging to the Malnad area. The patient who died had refused to be
vaccinated," Satish said. The disease normally [appears] in the month of
Nov with the onset of the dry season and [declines] with the first
rainfall. "The dry season is also the time when villagers collect twigs and
other materials for their livelihood from forests," Satish explained.

High fever, accompanied by body-ache and bleeding of gums and intestines,
are some of the symptoms of this deadly disease. In extreme cases, coupled
with a lack of proper treatment, the disease obstructs the normal
functioning of the brain, from which there is no recovery. "The patient
would gradually become weak and might find it difficult to do daily
chores," Satish said. The disease that originated in 1954, in the Malnad
areas of Karnataka, is found only in forest areas. An interesting aspect of
the disease is that it has not been detected anywhere else in the world.
Explaining the process through which the disease enters human body, Satish
said that monkeys living in forest areas spread the disease to others
through the ticks living on them. Others who are prone to be bitten by the
ticks are cattle and human beings frequenting forest areas. "The disease
was 1st discovered among monkeys, hence the term monkey-fever. It is
restricted to rural and forest areas," Satish said. He said that the
chances of getting the disease is greater if a man is bitten by monkey.

[Monkey Fever is also known as Kyasanur Forest disease. The causative
virus, Kyasanur Forest virus, is a tick-borne alphavirus (genus
_Alphavirus_, family _Togaviridae_). Kyasanur Forest virus was 1st isolated
in 1957 during a fatal epizootic affecting free-living monkeys in the
region of India formerly known as Mysore (now Karnataka). Human infection
has occurred frequently among forest workers with a mortality reaching 10
percent. The principal tick vector is the species _Haemaphysalis
spinigera_. An effective inactivated vaccine is available for protection of
those at risk and for post-exposure treatment to moderate the course of
illness.

Recently, a closely-related, tick-borne virus (Alkhurma virus) associated
with hemorrhagic disease in humans, and exposure to camels and sheep, has
been discovered in Saudi Arabia. - Mod.CP]

Note: Post 20040425.1145 contains the following correction to this
moderator comment:
[In the moderator's comment to this report, Kyasanur Forest virus was
incorrectly identified as an alphavirus. The correct name of the virus is
Kyasanur Forest disease virus. Kyasanur Forest disease virus and Alkhurma
virus (sometimes given as Al Khurma virus) are in fact flaviviruses; i.e.
viruses classified in the genus _Flavivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_.
The moderator is indebted to several correspondents for pointing out the
error. - Mod.CP]
