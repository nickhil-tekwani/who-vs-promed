Primates die from anthrax, causing bush meat scare
------------------------------------------------
The government of Cameroon has warned people against eating monkey
meat after discovering that several chimpanzees and gorillas in a
game reserve near the capital had died of anthrax. The warning was
issued on Tuesday following medical tests on the bodies of 2
chimpanzees and 2 gorillas found dead in the Dja game reserve, 100 km
southeast of Yaounde. "Analysis of samples taken from the dead
animals indicates that the principal cause of their death is anthrax,
a highly contagious disease to humans," the Ministry of Forestry and
Wildlife said in a statement on Tuesday.
Law prohibits the killing of gorillas and chimpanzees, but the meat
of both primates is a prized delicacy for many Cameroonians, who
enjoy a wide variety of bush meat.
This is the first time that anthrax -- an acute and potentially fatal
disease usually found in cattle, sheep and goats -- has been detected
in gorillas and chimpanzees in Cameroon.
The government warned people living in and around the Dja reserve to
avoid touching or consuming any monkey found dead. It also urged them
to bury such animals without delay and to report their death to the
authorities.
The official statement did not say when the 4 primates who died of
anthrax were found, but a source in the Ministry of Forestry and
Wildlife told IRIN that they died between November and December 2004.
Samples from the dead animals had been sent to Germany for laboratory
analysis, he added.
Stephen Tarkang Ebai, the national director of wildlife, said the
government would soon launch a nationwide public awareness campaign
against the killing and consumption of protected endangered primates.
"Chimpanzees and gorillas fall in class "A" of protected animals. We
cannot deny that this highly valued species of animals which are
protected are equally being poached by individuals," Ebai said.
"Anyone caught either with a whole or part of these protected species
of animals is liable to at least one month imprisonment, or a fine of
between one and ten million CFA francs (US $2,000 to 20,000)," he
added.
The Last Great Ape Organization (LAGA), an Israeli-funded
non-governmental organisation, has taken at least 20 Cameroonian
poachers to court with the backing of the Ministry of Wildlife for
killing protected species. "The laws protecting wildlife in Cameroon
are there, but they need to be reinforced by organisations like us,"
said LAGA president Ofir Drori. "If endangered species like gorillas,
chimpanzees and elephants among others are not protected, they will
disappear in years to come," he added.

[Thank you Mary for forwarding this. With the increasing volumes of
bushmeat being eaten these days, it might cause a temporary drop in
local consumption. Of course, the industry being what it is, I would
not be surprised if contaminated bushmeat were to turn up in London
sometime in the next few days. If the UK Customs were to catch it en
route, that would be best. Otherwise one can only ask that physicians
caring for European communities given to eating these meats be aware
of the possible symptoms when examining a patient presenting unusual
gastro-enteric symptoms. - Mod.MHJ]
