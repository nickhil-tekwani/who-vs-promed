4 new outbreaks of (FMD) have been found in the State of Mato Grosso do
Sul in Brazil, following surveillance activities surrounding the original
outbreaks.
3 cases have been found in Mundo Novo municipality and one in Japora
municipality, Dr. Jorge Caetano Junior, Director, Department of Animal
Protection (DDA), Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply of
Brazil, told the World Animal Health Organization (OIE).
In Mundo Novo municipality, 2 of the affected holdings are situated very
close together, he said. They have a total of 36 head of cattle, used for
subsistence purposes. The 3rd holding has 333 animals for rearing and breeding.
In Japora municipality, the affected holding contains 1072 head of cattle
for rearing and breeding. 10 female animals aged between 12 and 24 months
showed clinical signs compatible with FMD, he added.
The source of new outbreaks is currently unknown or inconclusive, but
Brazilian authorities said that investigations are in progress. The control
measures that have been taken include stamping out, quarantine, movement
control inside the country, screening and zoning. The authorities are to
carry out a program of disinfection of infected premises.
To date, in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, 28 outbreaks have been
detected and 14 785 FMD-susceptible animals have been slaughtered and
destroyed.
The change in the weather in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul has enabled
stamping-out activities to be intensified.
The sanitation process is in progress in the holdings where all susceptible
animals have been destroyed.
Surveillance measures continue to be implemented, with the municipalities
of Eldorado, Iguatemi, Itaquiraï¿½Japora and Mundo Novo remaining under a
ban. In the last 2 municipalities, there continues to be a ban on the
movement and marketing of FMD-susceptible animals and their products and
by-products. The activities of disinfecting vehicles and raising farmers'
awareness are being maintained.
There are still 9 suspected outbreaks in the State of Parana -- 4 in
Loanda, 2 in Amapora, 2 in Maringa and one in Grandes Rios.
Since the 1st suspected outbreak was notified, 711 rural holdings have been
inspected and placed under a ban, involving the inspection of 97 430
FMD-susceptible animals. These holdings are being monitored by 15 mobile
teams. The ban on 32 municipalities with areas located within a 10-km
radius of suspected outbreaks in the State of Parana is being maintained.
