An Ebola patient died in western Uganda Tuesday [11 Dec 2007],
pushing the death toll from the current outbreak to 30 out of 116
people known to be infected with the lethal virus, the health
ministry said. The health authorities were still registering new
infections in Bundibugyo district, home to 250 000 people and the
outbreak's epicentre.

The US Centers for Disease Control pathogen experts continued to test
for the virus that was identified as a new strain of Ebola [virus],
which epidemiologists say erupted in September 2007 but was
identified only in late November 2007. Hundreds of villagers and
medics who had physical contact with the patients have been put
under observation, authorities said.

Spread by body fluids, the blood-borne disease was named after a
small river in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it was
discovered in 1976. It reemerged in Sudan later the same year. Other
outbreaks have been recorded in the past in Ivory Coast, Gabon and
Uganda.
