Duval County, in the northeast corner of Florida, has reported the state's 4th fatality due to infection with the bacterium, _Vibrio vulnificus_, according to new data released by the Florida Department of Health today, 26 Sep 2014. In addition to the fatal case, both Hillsborough and Pinellas counties reported vibriosis cases since the last update, bringing the state total to 21. Other fatal cases were reported from Dixie, Lee and Sarasota counties in 2014. This follows 2013, when the Sunshine State reported 41 cases and 11 deaths, the highest number of cases reported in the past 6 years.

_Vibrio vulnificus_ is an emerging pathogen of humans. It causes wound infections, gastroenteritis, or a syndrome known as primary septicemia. It was 1st recognized as an agent of disease in 1976. The 1st documented case of disease caused by the bacterium was in 1979. _V. vulnificus_ causes disease in individuals who eat contaminated seafood (usually raw or undercooked oysters) or have an open wound that is exposed to seawater. Among healthy people, ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Most _V. vulnificus_ infections are acute and have no long-term consequences.

In immunocompromised persons, particularly those with chronic liver disease, _V. vulnificus_ can invade the bloodstream from either a wound or from the GI tract, causing a severe and life-threatening illness called primary septicemia, characterized by fever, chills, septic shock and death. Blistering skin lesions accompany the disease in about 70 percent of the cases. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time. These individuals are 80-200 times more likely to develop _V. vulnificus_ primary septicemia than are healthy people. For this particular risk group, the infection carries one of the highest mortality rates of all bacterial infections.

[There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
