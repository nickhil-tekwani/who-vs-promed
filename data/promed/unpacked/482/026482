40 School students poisoned with gas in Kishinev, Moldavia
-------------------------------------------------
On Thursday, in Moldavia's capital, 40 schoolchildren were
hospitalized for exposure to a poisonous gas. The gas has neurological
effects resembling paralysis. Some unknown [person] from sport school
number 35 exposed pupils from 2 groups to the gas.
6 brigades of emergency medical, police, and local officials arrived
at the scene. Children with burning eyes and irritated throats were
given first aid. Police believe the container of gas was used by one of the
schoolchildren.
This is the second case of gas poisoning this school year in the
Kishinev schools. The case in the spring involved a young schoolgirl
who used a small gas container given to her by her parents for
self-protection.

[It is unlikely these 2 cases are related. The earlier event most
likely involved a hand-held canister for self-protection. However, the
exposure of 40 children is significant. This article does
not indicate the condition of the children. One paragraph indicates
they were hospitalized, while another says they were administered
first aid. Hospitalization implies a much more serious condition.
This article does not indicate whether the paralysis mentioned affects
breathing or motor skills. There are a number of irritants that can produce
coughing and tearing of the eyes, but without knowing more about the
condition of the children, it is difficult to speculate on the gas that may
have been involved. ­ Mod.TG]
