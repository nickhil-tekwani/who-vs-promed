Suspect chikungunya cases are rising in DJ Halli area. On Sunday [3
May 2009] around 100 new patients were treated at the BBMP [Greater
Bangalore Municipal Body] health camps and 28 new cases were reported
at the DJ Halli Hospital. On the whole 281 patients with fever have
visited camps and hospitals for their dose of paracetamol
[acetaminophen].

Deputy commissioner (Health) Venkateshappa visited DJ Halli and
surrounding areas and carried out cleaning work of garbage and drains
in the area. Additional workers were deployed to carry out intensive
cleaning work. Spraying and fogging were also carried out extensively
on Sunday [3 May 2009].

Hundreds of residents around DJ Halli, Kavalabyrasandra, and
surrounding areas have been having symptoms of chikungunya [virus
infection] for the past one week. Blood samples of patients have been
collected to verify the possible epidemic.

[Chikungunya virus has been circulating in Karnataka state for over a
year (see ProMED archives cited below). ProMED-mail will be
interested in receiving information about the results of the
laboratory tests confirming (or not) chikungunya virus infection in
this outbreak. One hopes that this outbreak can be halted before it
reaches the concentrated populations in central Bangalore city.
ProMED thanks Dr Ahmed for sending in the report above.

[The DJ Halli area is located 5 km (3 mi) north of the center of the
city of Bangalore (Bengaluru). A map of Bangalore can be accessed at
