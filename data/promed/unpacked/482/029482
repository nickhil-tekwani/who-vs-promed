Myiasis spreads in the North West
---------------------------------------
A skin-worm sickness [i.e. cutaneous myiasis due to the Tumbu fly,
_Cordylobia anthropophaga_], which broke out in the Mafikeng area in
North West last month [January 2006], has spread to other parts of
the province, the health department said on Monday [13 Feb 2006].
"People in some parts of Kgetleng in the Moses Kotane municipality,
Carltonville near Merafong, Potchefsroom and areas along the
Zeerust/Botswana border have also been infected," spokesperson Barba
Gaoganediwe said. "About 155 people have already been infected, and
the number of cases reported in these areas are quickly increasing."
On Monday [13 Feb 2006] morning, health MEC Nomonde Rasmeni visited
Disaneng near Mafikeng -- the hardest hit area -- to assess the
extent of the outbreak.
"I have ordered our outbreak task team to cover the entire province
with public education and surveillance. We are really worried, as
this is now spreading to other parts of the province," Rasmeni said.
"After studying reports from other sub-districts, I will be in a
position to determine whether we need help from the national team."
The sickness is known as cutaneous myiasis, a skin condition caused
by a Tumbu or Mango female fly, which lays eggs on clothes or soil
contaminated with urine or feces. Larvae that emerge from the eggs
penetrate the skin painlessly and cause an enlarging papule (small
pimple), resembling a boil, which develops over about 6 days.
Eventually, the larva is large enough for close examination to reveal
small dark lines with pus [in fact, there is rarely pus - Mod.MS] in
the center.
The department said treatment consisted of covering the lesion with
Vaseline or liquid paraffin, which suffocates the larva. Such
treatment should be left on for 30 minutes to an hour, and then the
larva should be pushed out via finger pressure. Attempted removal of
larvae by instruments may rupture the larva and cause severe inflammation.
Gaoganediwe said it was important that all people affected should
report to the nearest clinic to get personal assistance and advice.

[Although I have seen many cases of myiasis due to the Tumbu fly in
various African countries, I have never encountered an epidemic such
as this. In my experience, it is usually individual cases or cases
involving households, albeit a few households, but not such large
numbers of people infected (about 155) as reported in this report.
There is not usually pus associated with these larval infections
unless the scratching has resulted in secondary infections.
It seems that this epidemic of myiasis is spreading - Mod.MS]
