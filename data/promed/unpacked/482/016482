In one of the villages of the Gegarkuniq region of Armenia,
Tsovagyukh, several inhabitants have been diagnosed with tularemia,
an acute infectious disease transmitted from animals.
A. Asoyan, the head physician of the Republican Infectious Diseases
Hospital, informed the correspondent of Arminfo that the diagnosis is
confirmed in 6 patients. The emergency group of physicians and
epidemiologists have been working since 10 Mar 2007, and an alert was issued.
The doctors think that the infection will be confirmed in another 10
cases as well. The possibility of a water-borne outbreak is thought
not to be likely because of the relatively low number of cases.
An outbreak occurred in the village of Fontanka in 2004, and it was
subsequently confirmed that the source of infection in about 300
people was drinking water. This time, epidemiologists consider that
the source of infection is small mammals [hares? - Mod.JW], as
according to the statements of village inhabitants, "there is an
abundance of them in the village area."
Doctor Asoyan said also that tularemia is easily treated and they
have diagnosed only lymphatic forms of disease and not the pulmonary
form, which can be much more severe. He also said that more than 1000
people have been vaccinated, and all others (4500 inhabitants) are in
the process of being vaccinated.

An outbreak of tularemia has been reported in the village of
Tsovagyuk of the Gegarkuniq region of Armenia on 10 Mar 2007.
At this point, 40 people have presented themselves for medical care.
The source of infection has not been determined, but the water source
is a possibility. Oculoglandular, oro-glandular and glandular forms
of disease have been reported. The patients are receiving appropriate
treatment. New patients are being identified.

[These 2 reports do not agree on the numbers of cases registered
during this outbreak. After additional inquiry, it has been made
clear that the 40 cases are the cumulative incidence of tularemia
since January 2007. The 16 recent cases may be the result of more of
the continuing outbreak only. - Corr.AS]
[The postings report primary lesions in the mouth and conjunctivae
and not on the skin, which suggests an aerosolized and ingested
vehicle. Most individuals infected with _Francisella
tularensis_ [the causative coccobacillus - Mod.JW] by cuts, tick or
other insect bites or other forms of trauma develop glandular or
ulceroglandular disease (with the primary lesion on the skin). The
epidemiology of the outbreak remains unclear.

The area involved, however, could not be found on a map of the
country. - Mod.LL]
