A beef processing plant in Nebraska agreed to a federal request that it
recall hamburger because of bacteria contamination, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said Friday. Beef America Co. of Norfolk, Nebraska issued the
recall for 443,656 pounds. However, it is not expected to grow to the size
of the recent massive Hudson Foods Inc. recall that eventually ballooned
to 25 million pounds, a USDA spokeswoman said. Officials with USDA's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, after reviewing records at Beef America
plant, believe the current recall encompasses all the possibly contaminated
meat, the USDA spokeswoman said. There have been no reported illnesses
from the suspicious beef. At the USDA's request, Beef America one month
ago ordered a recall of about 200 pounds of ground beef shipped from the
plant to a Virginia grocery store.
In the Hudson case in August, the recall became so large because the firm
had a practice of reworking beef left over at the end of a shift into the
next day's production. That made possible a continuous chain of
contamination of the potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_ known as
0157:H7. Beef America does not appear to have followed the same procedure,
thus limiting the size of the recall, the spokeswoman said.
[How did FSIS-USDA find the contaminated ground beef when there have been
no human cases? In the Hudson Beef outbreak last August, an epidemiologist
from Colorado found that human cases were associated with the consumption
of beef produced at the Hudson packing plant. The plant was implicated on
the basis of traceback epidemiologic and strain typing information from
individuals who had gotten sick.
In the current instance (and the one a few weeks earlier in Virginia) there
have been no human cases. The beef involved in this recall was identified
through routine sampling program that monitors beef products. This active
surveillance sampling program for _E. coli_ has tested 16,500 samples over
the past 3 years from federal and state inspected slaughter plants, retail
outlets and import stations. In FY 1997 (October 1 - Sept. 30), two
samples were positive, while 4 were positive in FY 1996 and 3 positive in
FY 1995.This outbreak highlights the value of active surveillance programs
for foodborne disease at various levels throughout the food chain. The
developing FoodNet surveillance system for human cases will also make an
important contribution at the consumer node of the farm to table continuum
of food safety. - Mod.-pc
