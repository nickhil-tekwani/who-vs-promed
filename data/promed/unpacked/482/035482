-----------------------------------------------------------------
ProMED continues to play the laudable and much needed leading role highlighting how under-reporting blurs out the true incidence of rabies with adverse consequences on its control/elimination. Unreported outbreaks occur elsewhere. Since January 2019, we have, along with collaborators as well as the UK-based Physicians Across Continents (PAC), been monitoring a rabies outbreak in Maiduguri, Nigeria in the heart of the northeastern Nigeria insurgency. Mid-January [2019], a 67-year-old internally displaced person died of rabies a month after being bitten by a dog that bit 15 others. All of them did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis: RIG and anti-rabies vaccines are not available.

Another case of human rabies, imported from the Indian subcontinent to the Arab Peninsula, was described in a 2017 report (see reference below). It involved a patient from India who died in Kuwait. Rabies was discovered only after the deceased patient's organs were transplanted, and 2 recipients, in Kuwait and Riyadh, developed clinical rabies. If the permission to harvest her organs had been rejected, that rabies case would have been missed. As the Gulf region is still dependent on migrant workers from these areas where rabies is intensely endemic, it will be prudent for clinicians in the area to have a high level of suspicion and retrieve ante-mortem samples: autopsy is often denied or not carried out.

Finally, the site of the bite on the patient's body was not mentioned. A distal location, combined with lower virus concentration, could, among other factors, clarify the long incubation period. Although details are not provided for this case, aggressive wound washing serves to remove rabies-laden saliva from wounds.

[The abstract of the mentioned reference follows:

"Rabies is usually transmitted to humans through bites of infected animals; however, it can rarely be transmitted through deceased donor organs or tissues when not suspected. Here, we report a case of rabies transmission in a child. The child was a 5-year-old girl who was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with encephalitis of unexplained cause 3.5 months after she received a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. The laboratory and imaging studies did not reveal any explanation for her rapidly declining clinical and neurologic condition, which ended with death 4 days after admission. Death of another recipient from the same donor led to an investigation that revealed rabies as the cause. Both corneas were explanted from other recipients to prevent further death. Polymerase chain reaction sequence analysis of the corneas was consistent with a rabies virus from the same donor's state of residence. Rabies transmission, although rare, should be suspected when a donor comes from or has visited endemic countries. Donors with unclear causes of death should be rejected."

We are grateful to Dr. Fagbo for bringing the above complementary information to the knowledge of ProMED-mail's subscribers. The event in Nigeria is of particular concern. - Mod.AS
