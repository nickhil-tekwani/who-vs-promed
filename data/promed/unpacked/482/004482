CHANGE IN GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL
Experts agree to launch first-ever crusade against deadly, drug-resistant
strains of TB
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis-the deadly disease which has been called
"Ebola with wings" will for the first time be considered an urgent priority
in some resource-poor countries, according to participants at a recent
meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "We really need to strengthen therapy
and be much more aggressive in addressing multidrug-resistant TB," said
Arata Kochi, director of the Global Tuberculosis Programme (GTB) of the
World Health Organization.
The two-day meeting at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences-which drew
together members of WHO and distinguished TB experts from the public-health,
scientific, clinical, and business sectors-was an "important milestone" in
the fight against this deadly and highly transmissible disease, said Kochi.
TB is currently the world's single leading infectious cause of adult deaths.
Last year it killed three million people worldwide and it is expected to
kill a hundred million more over the next thirty years. Multidrug-resistant
strains of TB may be responsible for more than 20% of TB disease in some
"hot zones" in the world, according to estimates by WHO and the
International Union Against TB and Lung Disease. Their 1997 report on
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) prevalence in the world identified
MDR TB as a problem in 34 of the 35 countries studied. As many as 50 million
people are estimated to be infected with drug-resistant strains of the
organism that causes TB.

Meeting participants agreed that the current WHO-recommended TB-control
program-known as DOTS-has been extraordinarily effective in the treatment of
millions of drug-susceptible cases, reaching over 90% cure rates in some
countries. While DOTS has also substantially reduced the incidence of new
cases of MDR TB, DOTS alone will not eliminate already-existing cases of MDR
TB, experts concluded. They called for the formation of a task force to
develop a kind of "DOTS-PLUS" strategy to treat and prevent the further
spread of MDR TB. Without such an expansion of DOTS, the eradication of TB
is highly unlikely.
Participants at the meeting, convened on April 4th and 5th by the Program in
Infectious Disease and Social Change at Harvard Medical School, recognized
the need for additional resources to be committed to this growing scourge.
"TB is a global problem, indeed one of the great problems of our times,"
noted Dr. Howard Hiatt of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
"Significantly greater resources, particularly American resources, must now
be devoted to its control." Other major meeting sponsors, including the WHO,
Rockefeller Foundation, and Eli Lilly and Company, also stressed the
importance of devoting new resources to the treatment and control of MDR TB.
Because of the high cost of second- and third-line anti-tuberculosis drugs
required to treat resistant strains, MDR TB had previously been believed to
be untreatable in poor settings. At the meeting, representatives of Partners
In Health and Socios En Salud described their extraordinary success in
treating and curing patients with MDR TB in three poor districts in northern
Lima, Peru. Their unique, community-based program, which they have
undertaken with local Peruvian health authorities, employs members of the
local community to monitor and supervise drug administration in patients'
homes. Over the past year and a half, the program has achieved
treatment-success rates of over 80%, which are significantly higher than
those previously reported in the US, and at a significantly lower cost.
"We have to think about MDR TB in a new way," said Kochi. "In the past, we
have seen it as a virtual death sentence for the people in developing
countries, but now we can give people hope of a cure."
