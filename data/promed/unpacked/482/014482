Anthrax outbreak kills 2 people in West Bengal
----------------------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak has killed 2 people and affected more than 50 people at
a tribal village in West Bengal's Paschim Medinipur district in the past 2
days. This is the 1st outbreak of the disease in the district in recent
past, according to officials of the Health Department.

"About 150 people from 32 families of Chandmora village consumed a dead cow
on 18 Apr 2010. Soon after, several persons developed skin lesions and ran
high temperature. Instead of approaching the local health centre, they
sought treatment from a quack. Only after the condition of 2 persons turned
critical did they go to the Midnapore Medical College on Monday," Nripoti
Roy, chief medical officer of the district, told The Hindu on Wednesday [28
Apr 2010]. Both deaths occurred on Tuesday [27 Apr 2010], and another case
was critical.

"Primarily, it appears like an anthrax outbreak. We have sent medical teams
to the village to treat the affected. A pathological team visited the
village on Wednesday to collect samples, and it will submit a report
shortly," Dr Roy said. Health director Aniruddha Kar said a team from the
School of Tropical Medicine would visit the village on Thursday. "This
disease is caused in humans mainly by consumption of animal carcasses. We
have started an awareness drive," he said.

[Awareness drive? Why not put in place a state livestock anthrax control
and surveillance programme. It is cheaper, more cost effective, and it
automatically prevents humans getting this disease in spite of their
careless ways. Not every dead anthrax cow consumed produces human cases,
whether with cutaneous lesions or lethal gastroenteric infections. Thus the
disease is under-appreciated, and it is truly one of the very cheapest
animal diseases to control with vaccination. If you control the livestock
cases, you prevent the human cases.

The disease is enzootic in West Bengal: in 2005 (14 outbreaks killed 153
cattle); 2006 (14, 50); 2007 (16, 78); and 2008 (10, 43). There were 27
reported human cases in 2005 and 17 in 2006. This would seem to be
sufficient to justify having an effective proactive control programme.
