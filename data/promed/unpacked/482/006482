The Ministries of Agriculture and Viticulture, Rural Development and
Veterinary Service Administration have announced an outbreak of
myxomatosis in domestic rabbits in the east of the country.

They also suspect that wild rabbits in the south of the country are
carrying the disease too.

They have released information on a series of hygiene measures to be
taken to ensure that the disease is not spread. These include an
immediate ban on the import and export of all live rabbits, and
notification of all suspected cases to the Veterinary Administration.

In addition, the purchase of rabbits is to be avoided; owners should
take steps to combat mosquitoes and fleas on their animals; sick
animals should be isolated, and the Veterinary Administration informed.

Myxomatosis is contagious among rabbits. It is understood to be
transmitted by insects and fleas and is harmless to humans.

The Veterinary Administration can be contacted at tel: 2478-2539.

[Myxomatosis has not been reported in Luxembourg for at least 12
years, in contrast to its neighboring countries France, Germany and Belgium.

Myxomatosis is one of the 2 lagomorpha diseases on OIE's list of
reportable diseases (the other one is rabbit hemorrhagic disease).
Details on the etiological agent, relevant diagnostic techniques and
vaccines can be seen in chapter 2.6.1 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic
Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.06.01_MYXO.pdf>.
Modified live virus vaccines prepared from fibroma virus or modified
Myxoma virus strains are available for immunisation of rabbits.

For additional background on this viral disease, see Mod.PC's
