Singapore has no plans to lift a ban on Malaysian pig imports imposed after
a deadly viral outbreak earlier this year, a government statement said on
Thursday. "Although the disease situation in Malaysia has improved, the
Nipah virus is still being detected in pigs in Malaysia," the Primary
Production Department (PPD) said.
Experts were carrying out studies on the control and spread of Nipah virus
disease and the ban would only be reviewed when there was sufficient
scientific information available.
Singapore imposed the ban on March 19 after a viral outbreak in Malaysia,
which led to the death of one abattoir worker in Singapore and more than
100 people in Malaysia. Prior to the ban, Malaysia supplied 800 pigs a
day, or 18% of Singapore's requirements.

Congratulations and well done for your good work thus far. We really
appreciate all your help to us thus far regarding the Nipah outbreak recently.
We are very keen to develop an ELISA to test for IgM antibodies to Nipah
virus in animals. The animals we are interested in are: canine, feline,
goat, horse, mouse,
porcine, rabbit, rat, sheep, and bovine.
This is to establish whether the animals are carrier or at active infection
stage (we had already established IgG assays with the help of Dr John White
of CSIRO, Australia).
However, we are finding quite a problem to find a supplier for IgM
conjugates for the animals. We would be really obliged if anybody who is
interested can contact us over here. It doesn't matter whether the
conjugates are horse radish peroxidae or alkaline phosphatase.
If there is anything we can do for you here in return, please don't
hesitate to drop us a line.

[The best assays for IgM antibody are capture assays. That is, one coats
wells with an anti-species (whatever species is being tested) antibody, for
example goat anti-canine. The serum to be tested for IgM antibody is then
added and then, sequentially, Nipah virus antigen (inactivated or otherwise
noninfectious), antibody to Nipah virus (produced in something other than
goat or the species being tested; for example mouse anti-Nipah virus), and
then conjugated anti-species (in this example, anti-mouse) antibody.
Addition of substrate is the final step and we usually use many washes
between additions of each reagent. Thus, if for a capture IgM
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MACELISA), one need only have an
anti-species (being tested) antibody. These are what Dr. Hassan needs, not
IgM conjugates. Many are available commercially but some are not readily
available. Tom Ksiazek (CDC) is the likely expert in this area. - Mod.CHC
