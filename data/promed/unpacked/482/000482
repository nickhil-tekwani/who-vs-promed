[1] Sierra Leone: 9th doctor infected with Ebola

An official says a 9th Sierra Leonean doctor has been infected with Ebola, underscoring the devastating toll the disease is taking on health care workers. Abass Kamara, a Health Ministry spokesman, said that a top military doctor tested positive for Ebola on Wed [26 Nov 2014]. He was working at the Hastings Ebola treatment center in the east end of the capital [Monrovia]... more

[2] WHO Ebola response roadmap -- Situation report
Date: 26 Nov 2014
Source: WHO [excerpted, edited]
http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en


A total of 15 935 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 6 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States of America) and 2 previously affected countries (Nigeria and Senegal) up to the end of 23 Nov [2014]. There have been 5689 reported deaths.

Cases and deaths continue to be under-reported in this outbreak. Reported case incidence is stable in Guinea (148 confirmed cases reported in the week to 23 Nov 2014), stable or declining in Liberia (67 new confirmed cases in the week to 23 Nov 2014), and may still be rising in Sierra Leone (385 new confirmed cases in the week to 23 Nov 2014).

The total number of cases reported in Sierra Leone since the outbreak began will soon eclipse the number reported from Liberia. The case fatality rate [CFR] across the 3 most-affected countries in patients with a recorded definitive outcome is approximately 60 percent; 3 health-care workers were reported infected with EVD in Guinea in the week to 23 Nov 2014.

Response activities continue to intensify in line with the UNMEER aim to isolate 70 percent of EVD cases and safely bury 70 percent of EVD-related deaths by 1 Dec 2014. Guinea isolates over 70 percent of all reported cases of EVD, and has more than 80 percent of required safe burial teams. Progress on isolation and safe burials has apparently been slower in parts of Liberia and Sierra Leone, although uncertainties in data preclude firm conclusions. At a national level, both countries are apparently unable to isolate 70 percent of patients, although data on isolation is up to 3 weeks out of date.

Every EVD-affected district in the 3 intense-transmission countries has access to a laboratory for case confirmation within 24 hours of sample collection. All 3 countries report that more than 80 percent of registered contacts associated with known cases of EVD are traced, though the low mean number of contacts registered per case suggests that contact tracing is still a challenge in areas of intense transmission... - more

Kenya will send 300 health workers to West Africa to help fight the deadly Ebola virus, which killed thousands in the region, a Kenyan official has said.

"Kenya will soon be sending over 300 health workers to the West African countries affected by the Ebola epidemic," James Macharia, Cabinet Secretary for Health, said during the opening of the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) on Mon [24 Nov 2014] ... - more

[4] Why Congo conquered Ebola

Two outbreaks, 2 entirely different outcomes. The World Health Organization has declared an outbreak of Ebola over in the Democratic Republic of Congo after just 66 cases and 49 deaths. It lasted 3 months. Yet the epidemic in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea has been going on for 9 months, with more than 15 000 cases, 5000 deaths and no end in sight.

What's the difference? Experts say experience matters; it was the 7th outbreak in the former Zaire. But equally important is the fact that the village where it started was extremely remote, and the country has a rudimentary system of healthcare workers who know to look out for Ebola... - more

(1) For Community and Healthcare Settings in West Africa: Determining Risk of Ebola Transmission

(2) Management of Suspected Ebola Patients in General Healthcare Settings (Non-Ebola Treatment Units)
----------------------------------------
- Safely isolate and manage patients with suspected Ebola cases.
- Alert public health authorities about a suspected Ebola case.
- Educate family and the community about what they can do to stay healthy.
- All patients coming to the healthcare facility must be assessed for Ebola based on the screening flowchart.
- Any patient suspected of having Ebola should be immediately directed to the isolation area. Proper public health authorities should be immediately notified.
- Any patient suspected of having Ebola needs to be isolated while waiting for the ambulance to pick them up. If more than one patient is isolated in your facility, keep them at least one meter apart... - more

The African Union Support to the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa, ASEOWA, in Sierra Leone has received the go-ahead for the management of the newly completed Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Magbenteh, Bombali District of Sierra Leone. The coordination of the ETC will be in partnership with the Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone. President Ernest Bai Koroma, while commissioning the treatment centre on Sun 16 Nov 2014, commended the efforts of the African Union in providing medical personnel in fighting against the Ebola virus disease.

The Magbenteh treatment centre, with a bed space capacity of 100 was scheduled to receive its 1st 6 Ebola patients on Mon 24 Nov 2014. The treatment centre is expected to ease the backlog of sick patients at the Arab, Paramedic, Government and Kamakwe holding centres in Bombali District, where Ebola patients were held pending their transfer to Kailahun, a neighboring district, for treatment... - more

[8] Sierra Leone: burial workers strike
Date: Tue 25 Nov 2014

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30191938


Burial workers in the Sierra Leonean city of Kenema have dumped bodies in public in protest at non-payment of allowances for October and November 2014 handling of Ebola victims.

The workers, who went on strike over the issue, left 15 bodies abandoned at the city's main hospital. One body was reportedly left by the office of the hospital manager and 2 others by the hospital entrance. The bodies have now been taken away, but the workers have refused to end their strike. It has been reported that the striking workers have now been sacked. There has been no public comment by the hospital's management or the Sierra Leonean health ministry.

The burial workers' industrial action came 2 weeks after health workers went on strike for similar reasons at a clinic near Bo, the only facility in southern Sierra Leone treating Ebola victims... more
