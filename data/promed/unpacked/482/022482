Angiostrongylosis, fox - Switzerland 20010205.0236
Date: 5 Feb 2001
From: Hugh Whitney <HughWhitney@mail.gov.nf.ca>

Out of interest, this parasite [_Angiostrongylus vasorum_ is considered to
be endemic in parts of Europe. Its presence has also been identified in red
foxes and dogs in Newfoundland, apparently the only known North American
focus. I would be interested to know why this was reported to veterinary
public health authorities -- because it was a new disease and therefore
warranted reporting or because there was a perceived public health importance?
