16 Oct 2015 Guinea: Ebola crisis: 2 new cases confirmed in Guinea, WHO says
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34550615
[According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 2 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea. 1 of the cases is in the capital of Guinea (Conakry), and appears to be new. The other case is in Forecariah, and appears to be linked to a previous chain of infection. Previously, Guinea had been without an EVD case for 2 weeks.]

16 Oct 2015 Guinea: Ebola outbreak may enter 3rd year after new cases in Guinea
http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/025aff804a3b8d2c9630dfa53d9712f0/-
[According to the World Health Organization (WHO) on Fri [16 Oct 2015], because 2 people have fallen ill with Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea after a 2-week lack of the disease in West Africa, hopes of a likely end in the near future are unrealistic.]

11 Oct 2015 Liberia: NIC releases impact of Ebola on GDP
http://allafrica.com/stories/201510151834.html
[National Investment Commission (NIC) Executive Director George Wisner said the impact of the Ebola epidemic on the country's Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is placed at 17.4 percent. Wisner also said the NIC findings also placed the real economic value on revenue generation at 10.7 of GDP, a situation which, he said, posed serious constraints on government and it functionaries. He attributes Liberia's secure investment environment to the endorsement by America and other western countries.]

14 Oct 2015 Nigeria: How the "polio surge" in Nigeria helped stop Ebola
http://fortune.com/2015/10/14/polio-surge-ebola-gates-foundation/
[According to Susan Desmond-Hellmann, CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the reason Nigeria's Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak was limited to just 19 deaths was because Nigeria had a health infrastructure in place that was designed to eradicate polio.]

17 Oct 2015 Nigeria: Govt releases final lab result on Calabar Ebola scare
http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/10/govt-releases-final-lab-result-on-calabar-ebola-scare/
[According to Nigeria's Permanent Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Health, Linus Awute, "next-generation sequencing methods" were carried out at 1 of the Ministry's collaborating reference laboratories (Redeemers University African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases at Ede, Osun State) to confirm which virus must have caused the infection and death. The blood sample from the patient tested negative for all pathogenic viruses known to man. Further tests were conducted to establish any bacterial or fungal infection involvement; this was also negative. The possibility of poisoning or intoxication with a chemical cannot, at this stage, be ruled out. The Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) will continue with this investigation, working with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).]

[It would be helpful to know which "pathogenic viruses", bacteria and fungi were included in the testing. Did they test for malaria? - Mod.LK]

[The World Health Organization (WHO) has reduced travel restrictions as a result of a decrease in Ebola cases. Passengers at the Kigali International Airport in Rwanda can now use the automatic clearance system.]

15 Oct 2015 UK: Scottish nurse now 'critically ill' after she recovered from Ebola
http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/scottish-nurse-recovered-ebola-now-critically-ill/
[New information:
According to Dr. Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization (WHO), it is not exactly a reemergence of Ebola virus disease (EVD), but the health complications that occur when the virus has been lingering in the survivor's body. Dr. Aylward added, the virus wrecked the patient's (PC's) central nervous system.
He said traces of Ebola were found in PC's spinal fluid. The CDC has also emphasized that PC's case is rare, does not present a threat to other people, and "It's reminded people that the consequences go on so much longer for survivors."
"The huge concern everyone has is that this does not result in a new wave of stigmatization of survivors, because, of course, it's a very, very different risk, a personal risk," said Aylward.]

15 Oct 2015 UK: Critically ill Ebola nurse in UK may be rare case of relapse
http://www.komonews.com/news/national/Critically-ill-Ebola-nurse-in-UK-may-be-rare-case-of-relapse-333045381.html
[According to the World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson, Dr. Margaret Harris, in rare cases it is possible for patients who survived Ebola virus disease (EVD) to develop EVD again. This occurs when the virus remaining in the body starts to replicate at high levels. She said WHO has heard of several similar cases, but they are not well documented. Dr. Harris also said it's unclear whether those people might then be infectious to others.
Dr. Nathalie MacDermott, a clinical research fellow at Imperial College London, hypothesized that the relapse of the Royal Free London patient, PC, may have been triggered by her immune system. "If the immune system is distracted, say by fighting off another infection, that might give the virus a foothold to start replicating again out of control. It is unusual that it would be able to spiral out of control and (produce) an acute infection again but it's not impossible."]

15 Oct 2015 UK: How does the Ebola virus spread? Fresh fears after critically ill British nurse diagnosed twice
http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/how-ebola-virus-spread-fresh-6638939
[New Information: According to Dr. Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, the medical team treating patient PC was in "completely uncharted territory." Dr. Neuman told the BBC: "It may be that the virus has gotten into a place where the immune system can't root it out, and that what we are seeing right now is essentially a frustrated immune system overreacting and basically hurting some of the other organs. We don't know what Ebola looks like the 2nd time around or after a big relapse like this. Right now, she has had this virus about 3 times as long as the other previous record holder. It's bad news, but it is not hopeless news. As long as she is still there, and as long as she is still fighting, there is a chance."]

15 Oct 2015 UK: More contacts of Ebola nurse identified as she continues fight for life

15 Oct 2015 UK: Ebola Persistence in semen, eyes and nervous system portends trouble
http://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2015/10/15/ebola-persistence-in-semen-eyes-and-nervous-system-portends-trouble/
[New Information:
According to virologist Dr. Ian Mackay, Associate Professor, University of Queensland, regarding nurse "PC", "This may be the first documented time that the virus has re-emerged from an immune privileged site and returned to the blood, possibly causing EVD (Ebola virus disease) symptoms."
Dr. Mackay also said "It is unclear precisely what disease is being managed. Is it EVD or a different disease that is the result of damage done by the original Ebola virus infection? Is virus present in the blood? That level of clinical detail has not been forthcoming, leaving many to simply guess at this possibly new chapter in the history of Ebola virus."
According to Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, the medical team treating PC was in "completely uncharted territory".
Dr Neuman told the BBC: "It may be that the virus has gotten into a place where the immune system can't root it out, and that what we are seeing right now is essentially a frustrated immune system overreacting and basically hurting some of the other organs.]

15 Oct 2015: "PC" latest news: Experts believe there is little risk of further Ebola spread
http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/pauline-cafferkey-latest-news-experts-believe-there-little-risk-further-ebola-spread-1524125
[New Information:
According to Professor John Oxford of the University of London, "The risk of this virus spreading from her, either to people working in the unit, they're highly trained so they've got zero risk of catching it. But even to people who have been in contact with her, the risk will approach zero, so there's nothing to worry about for anyone who has been in contact with her in the last couple of weeks, there really is not."
According to Ebola expert, Dr Edward Wright of London's Westminster University, "We have no other documented evidence that anyone else who has survived infection has then had a relapse and the Ebola virus has started to cause disease again."]

15 Oct 2015: Parents demand answers after discovering Ebola nurse "PC" was unwell when she visited East Kilbride school

New information:
[Nurse PC was ill on the day she visited a primary school, 1 day before she was readmitted to the hospital in serious condition. Some parents are requesting information about the propriety of the visit.]

16 Oct 2015 UK: How [nurse "PC"] Ebola relapse tears up everything doctors thought they knew
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/16/how-pauline-cafferkeys-ebola-relapse-tears-up-everything-doctors-thought-they-knew
[Doctors and scientists are surprised and concerned at the patient PC's relapse, which has increased worries for the thousands of survivors in West Africa. A resurgence of illness not appearing similar to classic Ebola virus disease (EVD) in survivors would not have been recognized in countries with fragile health-care systems (such as those in West Africa). It is possible people have died from unnoticed EVD complications months after their initial recovery.
The discovery that the virus remains in semen and is capable of causing EVD months later is of concern, as well. In addition to the virus being hidden in gonads and in the eye's vitreous [humor], there are other places the virus is thought to be hidden: prostate gland, amniotic fluid, placenta, breast milk and the central nervous system (CNS). In PC's case, it is the Ebola virus hiding in the CNS which will be of concern.
A previous finding in studies of macaque monkeys demonstrated, on 2 occasions, 2 of the animals appeared to have recovered from the virus and then they had a relapse which involved the brain. It was reported as being very debilitating for them. The EVD probably would have been a life-threatening illness, but protocol dictates euthanasia for animals in such a situation. When scientists looked for any changes in the macaque's body, they didn't see any changes in the organs typically associated with the virus, such as the spleen and liver, which showed no traces of EVD. However, the brain and eyes were very heavily involved.]

17 Oct 2015: So it turns out there's a lot we don't know about Ebola
http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/10/17/448380921/so-it-turns-out-theres-a-lot-we-dont-know-about-ebola?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=world
[The current lengthy and lethal Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak has reinforced the old saying, "If you look for something you have a better chance of finding it." An example is the Ebola virus' lengthy presence in parts of the body, long after the virus is not detectable in blood samples.
According to Dr. Daniel Bausch, infectious disease specialist at Tulane University and a senior consultant to the World Health Organization (WHO), "If there's anything that this outbreak has taught me, it's that I'm often wrong."
There are now an estimated 17 000 survivors, and researchers are finding many different "twists and turns." Dr. Ilhem Messaoudi, a viral immunologist and professor of biomedical sciences at the University of California, Riverside, who is studying how the virus works in the human body, said "It's an explosive virus. It replicates like crazy ... and it destroys everything in its path. So, how is it just hanging out in the testes for like 9 months?"
According to Dr. Messaoudi, it's because the immune system, which is able to clear the Ebola virus in the blood stream, doesn't reach every part of the body. It also can be overly forceful at times. Dr. Messaoudi compares members of the immune system to the Navy SEALs. "They are trained killers, so if you drop them in the wrong place and they misread their orders, it could lead to really big damage."]

http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/articles/2015/10/addressing-ebola-waste-disposal-challenges-for-us-hospitals.aspx
[Because of how the Ebola virus disease (EVD) is transmitted, hospitals and municipalities must determine how to manage the massive amounts of waste that are inherent with just a single "suspect" EVD patient. Emory University estimates approximately 40 pounds of waste is generated per patient, per day.
It is important that reexamination be performed of waste treatment regulations, and the options available, when handling both solid waste and patient effluent (blood, body fluids, urine, vomitus, etc.]

Vaccines

[According to Peter Walsh, a primate ecologist at Cambrige University, the trials in the Republic of the Congo would be the 1st time an oral vaccine had been tested on an endangered species. According to Dr. Walsh, it is also thought that, although some gorillas die the same unpleasant death as humans with Ebola virus disease, others are carriers. Gorillas are also part of the bush-meat trade in areas of West Africa where the current Ebola virus disease outbreak is occurring.]

15 Oct 2015 Spain: New Ebola vaccine is tested on Spanish volunteers

[A new Ebola vaccine is being tested for the 1st time in Europe on volunteers at a Spanish hospital in Madrid. 40 health-care workers are being followed to see if they develop any side effects. When the same vaccine (VSV-EBOV) was used on 4000 people in Guinea the World Health Organization (WHO) said it had been 100 percent effective.]

17 Oct 2015 Sierra Leone: Chinese Ebola vaccine safe and responsive so far: Sierra Leone official

[A vaccine against the Ebola virus disease [EVD], developed by Chinese scientists and being tested in Sierra Leone, has proved to be "safe, responsive with very few complaints or side effects," as reported by China's Xinhua news agency regarding Phase II trials in Sierra Leone.]

Research

15 Oct 2015: Ebola study finds women in Guinea who appear immune to the virus
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/ebola-study-finds-women-guinea-appear-immune-virus
[A team of British and European scientists who are studying Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors in Guinea discovered a group of women who appear to be immune to infection by the Ebola virus.
According to Miles Carroll, a virologist at the UK government's biological and chemical weapons research facility, "They [the women] have had lots of contact with the virus, clearing up vomit, diarrhea, sleeping with children with Ebola overnight, and they never presented with Ebola symptoms and somehow they have an immune response to the virus."
Early data from the research also offers a theory as to why survivors have not contracted Ebola virus disease (EVD) for a 2nd time even when the virus lingers in places such as the testes, spinal cord and eye chamber.
The team found that the immune response in survivors is approximately 10 times stronger than in those who received a vaccine being tested in Guinea, and the strength of the immune response did not appear to decrease over the year they studied the individuals.
The project is on-going and has not yet been published in a scientific journal. The study will test the theory that survivors develop long-term immunity because, for a limited time, the virus remains in parts of the body the immune system cannot reach. He believes that when it leaches back into the blood it restimulates the immune response. According to Dr. Carroll, "What is likely to be happening is the virus is lingering around these immune-privileged sites like the gonads and the spinal cord but continually leaching into the body, but the survivor never experiences symptoms because it is instantly soaked up by antibodies and T cells.]

17 Oct 2015: Ebola upgraded to STD status, found to be infectious for longer than previously thought
http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1113409987/ebola-virus-persists-in-sperm-can-be-transmitted-sexually-101715/#pYr6IGKXb7hvAVtl.99
[A pair of studies published in the latest edition of the _New England Journal of Medicine_ revealed Ebola virus can remain in semen of male survivors much longer than previously thought (now has been in the sperm of 26 per cent of infected males after 7-9 months), and genomic analysis has confirmed that the disease can be sexually transmitted, confirming that Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a sexually transmitted disease.]

[The original papers from the _New England Journal of Medicine_ are:
[Mate SE, Kugelman JR, Nyenswah TG. 2015. Molecular Evidence of Sexual Transmission of Ebola Virus. NEJM. 14 Oct 2015. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1509773 http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1509773

Abstract. A suspected case of sexual transmission from a male survivor of Ebola virus disease (EVD) to his female partner (the patient in this report) occurred in Liberia in March 2015. Ebola virus (EBOV) genomes assembled from blood samples from the patient and a semen sample from the survivor were consistent with direct transmission. The genomes shared 3 substitutions that were absent from all other Western African EBOV sequences and that were distinct from the last documented transmission chain in Liberia before this case. Combined with epidemiologic data, the genomic analysis provides evidence of sexual transmission of EBOV and evidence of the persistence of infective EBOV in semen for 179 days or more after the onset of EVD.

NEJM. 14 Oct 2015. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1511410
Conclusions. These data showed the persistence of Ebola virus RNA in semen and declining persistence with increasing months since the onset of EVD. We do not yet have data on the extent to which positivity on RT-PCR is associated with virus infectivity. Although cases of suspected sexual transmission of Ebola have been reported, they are rare; hence the risk of sexual transmission of the Ebola virus is being investigated. - Mod.LK]

[Therefore Ebola survivors must either abstain from sex, or observe safe sex guidelines through correct and consistent condom use until their semen has tested negative. This may hinder control of Ebola. But it is important to note in the conclusions, that the level of infectious virus is not known; the results are based on viral nucleic acid. Nonetheless, sexual transmission has now been supported by data, although it appears to be rare. - Mod.LK]
