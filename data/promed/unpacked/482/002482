Root rotting disease deals a blow to gourd growers
--------------------------------------------------
Roots of gourd plants are rotting due to bacterial attack in Rajarhat and Kurigram Sadar upazilas [Kurigram district, Rangpur division], much to the worry of vegetable growers.

"The roots [of the gourd crop] began to decompose when the plants started flowering and fruiting. The gourd leaves started drying too," said a farmer. "The roots of 25 per cent of the plants showed signs of rotting when they were flowering," said another farmer.

"Usually the root rotting disease due to bacterial attack is seen in the rainy season if water or wetness prevails for several days in the plant roots. In such cases we advise farmers to supply air and sunshine to the roots and spray proper medicine," said an agriculture officer of Kurigram Sadar.

[Gourds include a range of species of _Cucurbita_. Young fruit are a popular vegetable in many Asian countries, mature fruit may be dried and used for various purposes ('bottle gourds').

'Bacteria' are named as the cause of the root rot problem above. While there is a bacterial wilt of cucurbits caused by _Erwinia tracheiphila_, this disease has been reported to affect leaves and vines, rather than the roots of the host. On the other hand, there are a number of soil borne cucurbit root rots caused by fungal pathogens, as well as fungus-like _Phytophthora_ species. It is possible that the term 'bacteria' may have been used indiscriminately in this report as a general name for a disease causing organism.

We would be most grateful for any additional information on this outbreak.
