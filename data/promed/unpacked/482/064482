Disease threat to home gardens; Queensland's citrus canker crisis threatens
to engulf suburban back yards.
-----------------------------------------------
The State Government is considering quarantine bans on the widely used
hedging plant murraya or "mock orange". Other states have been pressing for
restrictions on the sale of mock orange through nurseries and other retail
outlets, fearing it is a natural host for the disease.
As of today, movement of 1500 species of plants in the _Rutaceae_ family
will be banned, prompting concerns from the nursery industry that it will
be hit hard by the canker scare. At the same time Department of Primary
Industries (DPI) work crews will begin destroying another 40 000 citrus
trees on canker-affected Evergreen Farms at Emerald. And the National
Management Group, overseeing the program, will consider whether interstate
bans on Queensland citrus should be eased.
A spokesman for DPI Minister Henry Palaszczuk said Queensland was under
pressure to restrict the supply of plants because of their potential to
spread the so-far contained canker outbreak beyond Evergreen Farms. Mock
orange is in demand for hedge-growing by home gardeners and landscapers.
Leading Brisbane nursery Hawkins said mock orange was one of its most
popular lines, accounting for about 1/3 of all hedge plant sales.
Palaszczuk's spokesman said DPI experts were trying to reach a compromise
that would satisfy interstate demands for restrictions on the movement of
mock orange stock, while minimising the disruption to plant sellers and
consumers.
He confirmed that a temporary ban on the sale of mock orange was an option.
"Other states want to see us impose restrictions, so we are trying to put
in place a protocol that will satisfy them but also minimise the
disruption," he said.
Exhaustive testing of orchards in a 50 km-radius of Evergreen Farms has
found no spread of the disease beyond the $80-million [USD 5.8-million]
grape and citrus-growing operation controlled by Filipino businessman
Philip Cea. Orchards in the Mundub-bera-Gayndah district were clear of the
disease.
Queensland will apply today to the National Management Group -- comprising
all agricultural department chiefs and industry representatives -- to lift
the interstate bans on its citrus. The DPI is also expected to seek further
information from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS)
over the controversial access agreement with Mr Cea's Pacific Century
Production Pty Ltd.
The formerly confidential Deed of Arrangement shows that the company agreed
in October 2001 to destroy about 600 citrus plants on Evergreen Farms. An
AQIS spokesman said yesterday these had either been infected with citrus
tristeza virus or were the subject of allegations by former production
manager Wayne Gillies that Mr Cea had illegally imported overseas plant
stock. Mr Cea denied the claims, and no action was taken against him by
AQIS although the company had agreed to destroy the plants in 2001 "to take
care of any potential risk".
AQIS executive director Meryl Stanton has rejected claims that the secret
agreement hampered DPI efforts to monitor Evergreen and neighbouring
properties.

[The situation in Emerald is deteriorating into legal actions and
countersuits. Clearly, illegal importation of planting material into
Australia from abroad is a gross violation of the International Plant
Protection Convention. This is a classic example of circumventing the
rules. Unfortunately, the citrus growers in Queensland are strapped to find
ways to dispose of their crop through the usual routes. - Mod.DH]
