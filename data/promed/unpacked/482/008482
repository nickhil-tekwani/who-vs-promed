The report on gastrointestinal illness associated with holidays in the
Dominican Republic indicates the importance of foreign travel in the
acquisition of infections. The majority of UK tour operators have not
withdrawn their programme from the Dominican Republic but are actively
working with hoteliers and the DR government on hygiene and safety
programmes. Intensive programmes to develop the HACCP approach combined
with regular audit are under way. These programmes do not attract the media
headlines that are occasioned by five cases of typhoid fever. It is true
that over 50 % UK tourists visiting this country have subjective travellers
diarrhoea that is they respond positively to the question "If unwell during
your holiday, please specify - Stomach upset -Sunburn -Broken Limbs
-Infection -Other" This question is included in the market survey
questionnaire completed during the return flight home. Stomach upset can be
due to a wide variety of causes infective and non infective. The results
are analysed by resort and provide a pointer for further studies. Data from
these questionnaires is now available for over 15 years and provides a
continuous monitoring tool which has proved sufficient for the purpose for
which it is required. The results from the Dominican Republic this Summer
come from 38874 questionnaires completed by persons above 16 years of age.
The overall incidence of subjective travellers diarrhoea was 57. 5% with no
significant seasonal variation. What is significant however is that all the
resorts and the hotels had a similar illness incidence suggesting that the
problem was country associated rather than one resort or hotel. I have
visited the country on behalf of tour operators on many occasions and shared
the results with a succession of Ministers of Tourism and Health. I have
also inspected many hotels and in spite of widely different hygiene levels
the sickness rates are similar. It is important to remember that for the
majority of tourists the cause of the stomach upset is not known.
Following the typhoid fever incident in one hotel during June I obtained
information from over 300 UK guests who had stayed at the hotel during the
relevant period. 69% recorded a stomach upset but only 48% had diarrhoea
plus another abdominal symptom lasting for 2 or more days. The peak time of
onset was the first 5 days of the holiday and in most persons the illness
lasted 2-3 days. This pattern is consistent with other studies in the
Dominican Republic and other countries with a developing public health
infrastructure. It is important to consider the above information in
context with other countries. Data is only available in detail from one
major tour operator but similar results have been obtained by other
operators.

Subjective travellers' diarrhoea by country or region Summer 1997. % +ve

Dominican Republic 58 38612

Algarve, Portugal 13 17634
Malta 11 18620
Cyprus 11 36304
Minorca,Spain 12 38873
Florida 10 18464
These figures do not support or otherwise different destinations but are
indicators that the problem differs depending on location and that further
work is urgently needed to understand the cause of the illness and the
reasons why tourists are affected. It will then be possible to recommend
appropriate actions for prevention. It is pertinent that
improvements in tourist health are likely to require improvements in public
health hygiene which will be mainly beneficial to the indigenous population.
