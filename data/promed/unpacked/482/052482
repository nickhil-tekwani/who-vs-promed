A skin-eating fungus that has wiped out 95 per cent of the salamander population in Belgium and the Netherlands has arrived in the UK.

The fungus, _Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans_ (Bs), which was discovered in 2013, has infected and killed 4 salamanders imported to the UK. Researchers have warned that if it escapes into the wild, it could decimate the great crested newt population, a species native to the UK.

It is related to the chytrid fungus, _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ [Bd], which has been wiping out frogs and toads around the world. Chytrid has also been found in the UK but does not seem to have harmed native frogs and toads.

Given that Bs has already been shown to kill great crested newts, its arrival is potentially more serious. "It's critical that no animals potentially carrying [the fungus] are released into the wild, which is illegal anyway," says Matthew Fisher from Imperial College London.

"Likewise, water and organic matter from collectors and hobbyists shouldn't be dumped down sinks or in gardens without disinfection -- 1 per cent strength bleach will kill the fungus if it's there."

Fisher says that the great crested newt is relatively abundant in the UK. Ironically, that makes the species more vulnerable because the disease could potentially spread more easily than if only isolated colonies existed.

So far, he adds, there is no evidence that the imported fungus has been released into the environment.

_B. salamandrivorans_ causes erosive skin disease and rapid mortality in salamanders and was present in skin lesions of salamanders found dead during population declines. Compared to Bd, Bs has a lower thermal growth preference.

The emergence of the pathogenic _B. salamandrivorans_ chytrid fungus is worrying and warrants close monitoring of salamander populations worldwide and rigorous biosecurity measures.
