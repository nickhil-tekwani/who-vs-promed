A 47 year old man died on 1 Jan 2001 at the University Hospital in Giessen,
Germany, suffering from an unknown fever contracted in Africa [Kenya].
Tests for Lassa fever virus, Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus and Marburg
hemorrhagic fever virus were all negative.

The latter source suggests that a herpesvirus infection was responsible for
the death of this patient, which is not compatible with the hemorrhagic
fever suspicion. Further information is awaited to clarify this confused
situation. - Mod.CP]
