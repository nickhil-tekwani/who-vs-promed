A deadly outbreak of what appears to be flu is threatening a group of
bonobos in a sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)

Known also as pygmie chimpanzees, bonobos live exclusively in the DRC
and are listed as endangered on the IUCN red list. Researchers put
their total numbers somewhere between 29 500 and 50 000.

"Three days ago, there were 10 bonobos face-down in the building,
breathing really hard," says Vanessa Woods, a bonobo researcher at
Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who is currently at the
sanctuary. "We've never seen anything like it before."

At least 4 animals have died from the illness out of a total of 60
living in Lola Ya Bonobo reserve. The 40-hectare forest sanctuary is
just outside of the capital city of Kinshasa and houses bonobos
orphaned by the bush meat trade.

A flu outbreak raced through the human population of Kinshasa in
February 2009, and Woods suspects sanctuary visitors spread the
illness to the animals. "They get 30 000 Congolese visitors a year,
and most of them are school children," she says.

Scientists studying wild chimpanzees in Cote d'Ivoire's Tai National
Park have documented disease outbreaks there, including a respiratory
illness likely acquired from humans.

As a result, researchers at Tai now keep their distance from
chimpanzees and wear face masks to contain the spread of pathogens.

The bonobo sanctuary's animals are isolated from wild populations, so
there is no chance the disease will spread, Woods says.

She and her colleagues have quarantined some sick animals and are
keeping a close eye on the rest. "The worst seems to have passed, but
you just don't know."

[Bonobos (_Pan panicus_), similarly to the Common Chimpamzee (_Pan
troglodytes_) are members of the hominidae family and as such share
with humans common pathogens.

More information on this outbreak would be greatly appreciated.
