A deadly oyster disease that was first detected in Port Stephens a year ago [2021], has now returned and threatens to put several growers out of business.

QX disease is not harmful to humans, but the parasite infects Sydney Rock oysters, causing them to lose condition and die during winter.

[DB's] family farm has been operating in Port Stephens for more than 60 years and is one of the largest producers in the estuary.

He said the outbreak, on the back of months of rain that has prevented harvesting, would see some growers lose everything.

"It's very traumatic, some of those guys are smaller businesses with less resilience, or less resources to get through something like this," he said.

"I've heard there are 8 of the 41 farmers in Port Stephens, particularly around the Karuah area, who are looking to walk away, some of them after 5 generations of oyster farming".

Mr. [B] said he was determined to get his business through the outbreak, but his losses are significant.

"It kills up to 90 per cent of your crop and the ones that are left don't thrive either.

"So we've so far lost about [AUD 0.5 million/about USD 358 700] half a million dollars for us in our juveniles, and that includes some that were ready for harvest".

"The guys in Karuah, Oyster Cove, and Tilligerry Creek they've lost their saleable crop already. They're looking at 2 to 3 years trying to get back something that is ready to sell."

Port Stephens MP Kate Washington met with local growers this week, including [SC], whose operation has been hit hard.

She is worried for the future of the local industry, worth AUD 8 million [about USD 5.7 million] a year for Port Stephens.

"We've got an estuary in crisis, we've got oyster farmers looking to walk away from the industry, some are 5th generation farmers because they just cannot see a way forward," she said.

"We've got whole areas that have seen 100 per cent mortality of oysters due to this disease.

"It's taking an enormous toll on the local oyster farmers and the entire oyster industry here in Port Stephens."

Ms Washington confirmed several growers have already applied for grant assistance from the state government.

Agriculture Minister Dugald Saunders said the outbreak was significant and the Department of Primary Industries was providing advice and support to growers to manage and control the spread.

Mr Saunders said growers could apply for natural disaster grants and low interest loans, but he acknowledged that would not be suitable for some.

"For some people a low interest loan may not be what people are feeling like they want to do at this particular point, and I fully understand that," he said.

"What we need to do is ensure the industry feels supported, but there's no quick, easy fix."

[The parasitic protozoan _Marteilia sydneyi_ (Phylum Paramyxea) was recognized as the etiological agent of QX disease since the mid-1970's. It is the most pathogenic parasite of the Sydney rock oyster (_Saccostrea glomerata_) in estuaries of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, Australia. Outbreaks have a significant impact on oyster populations, reaching 95% of mortality or more. - Mod.PMB]
