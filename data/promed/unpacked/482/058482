Hospitals in Japan's 2nd largest city of Osaka are buckling under a huge wave of new coronavirus infections, running out of beds and ventilators as exhausted doctors warn of a "system collapse" and advise against holding the Olympics this summer [2021].

Japan's western region home to 9 million people is suffering the brunt of the 4th wave of the pandemic, accounting for one-third of the nation's death toll in May [2021], although it constitutes just 7% of its population. The speed at which Osaka's healthcare system was overwhelmed underscores the challenges of hosting a major global sports event in 2 months' time, particularly as only about half of Japan's medical staff have completed inoculations.

"Simply put, this is a collapse of the medical system," said Yuji Tohda, the director of Kindai University Hospital in Osaka. "The highly infectious [variant originating from the UK] and slipping alertness have led to this explosive growth in the number of patients."

Japan has avoided the large infections suffered by other nations, but the 4th pandemic wave took Osaka prefecture by storm, with 3849 new positive tests in the week to Thursday [20 May 2021]. That represents a more than 5-fold jump over the corresponding period 3 months ago.

Just 14% of the prefecture's 13 770 COVID-19 patients have been hospitalised, leaving the majority to fend for themselves. Tokyo's latest hospitalisation rate, in comparison, is 37%. A government advisory panel sees rates of less than 25% as a trigger to consider imposition of a state of emergency.

By Thursday [20 May 2021], 96% of the 348 hospital beds Osaka reserves for serious virus cases were in use. Since March [2021], 17 people have died from the disease outside the prefecture's hospitals, officials said this month [May 2021].

The variant can make even young people very sick quickly, and once seriously ill, patients find it tough to make a recovery, said Toshiaki Minami, director of the Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital (OMPUH). "I believe that until now many young people thought they were invincible. But that can't be the case this time around. Everyone is equally bearing the risk."

Minami said a supplier recently told him that stocks of propofol, a key drug used to sedate intubated patients, are running very low, while Tohda's hospital is running short of the ventilators vital for severely ill COVID-19 patients.

Caring for critically ill patients in the face of infection risk has taken a serious toll on staff, said Satsuki Nakayama, the head of the nursing department at OMPUH. "I've got some intensive care unit (ICU) staff saying they have reached a breaking point," she added. "I need to think of personnel change to bring in people from other hospital wings."

About 500 doctors and 950 nurses work at OMPUH, which manages 832 beds. Ten of its 16 ICU beds have been dedicated to virus patients. Twenty of the roughly 140 serious patients taken in by the hospital died in the ICU.

[2] Oxygen shortage
Date: Tue 25 May 2021 16:40 EDT
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/may/25/oxygen-shortages-threaten-total-collapse-of-dozens-of-health-systems


Dozens of countries are facing severe oxygen shortages because of surging COVID-19 cases, threatening the "total collapse" of health systems. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism analysed data provided by the Every Breath Counts Coalition, the NGO Path and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) to find the countries most at risk of running out of oxygen. It also studied data on global vaccination rates.

Nineteen countries around the world -- including India, Argentina, Iran, Nepal, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan, Costa Rica, Ecuador and South Africa -- are deemed most at risk after recording huge increases in demand since March [2021] -- at least a 20% rise -- while having vaccinated less than 20% of their populations.

There are concerns that other Asian countries like Laos are at risk, and African countries including Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi and Zimbabwe, which have less mature oxygen delivery systems, meaning a small increase in need could create big problems.

Many of these countries faced oxygen shortages before the pandemic, said Leith Greenslade, coordinator of the Every Breath Counts Coalition. The extra need is pushing health systems to the brink.

"The situation last year [2020], and again in January this year [2021] in Brazil and Peru, should have been the wakeup call," she said. "But the world did not wake up. We should have known India would happen after seeing what happened in Latin America. And now looking at Asia, we should know this will happen in some of the big cities in Africa."

Robert Matiru, who chairs the COVID-19 Oxygen Emergency Taskforce, told the bureau: "We could see the total collapse of health systems, especially in countries with very fragile systems."

Hospitals in India have reported significant shortages of oxygen as the country battles its 2nd wave. By the middle of May [2021], India needed an extra 15.5 million cubic metres [547 million cubic feet] of oxygen a day just for COVID-19 patients, more than 14 times what it needed in March, according to the bureau's analysis. In response, India has banned all exports of liquid and cylinder oxygen.

But experts are worried about India's neighbours -- Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar -- some of which rely on Indian-made oxygen and equipment. "You'd imagine if they start to see peaks of the same degree, then it could be even worse, because India needs all the supply," said Zachary Katz, vice-president of essential medicines at CHAI.

The bureau's data show that Nepal now needs more than 100 times as much oxygen as it did in March [2021]. Demand for oxygen in Sri Lanka has risen 7-fold since mid-March. In Pakistan, which is suffering its 3rd wave of cases, almost 60% more patients are on oxygen in hospital than during the country's previous peak last summer [2020], according to a government minister, who warned in late April [2021] that pressure on the oxygen supply was reaching dangerous levels.

"The mood is extremely grim," says Dr. Fyezah Jehan, a doctor in Karachi. "I think we are very scared of an India-like situation. We're hoping that some magic happens, and this [current] lockdown can prevent a new onslaught of cases."

"Rapidly rising need for oxygen puts pressure on the health system, which it can't meet, and we see patient deaths," said Greenslade. "And that will keep happening week after week, month after month, if the vaccine rollout is slow, because at this point, in many of these countries, it's only increases in vaccine coverage that will bend the curve on transmission."

The health systems of many poorer countries "could not be more ill-prepared," Greenslade said. "From the head of state, the health minister, the finance minister...these countries haven't prioritised oxygen as an essential medicine. As we see in India, many, many people have died and continue to die every day for lack of oxygen."

Several countries have demanded that companies which produce liquid oxygen divert products from their industrial clients to hospitals. Medical oxygen makes up just 1% of global liquid oxygen production. However, data from Gasworld Business Intelligence, which analyses the global industrial gases market, show that many of the countries most in need would still see shortages even if all local oxygen production was diverted to hospitals.

In Iraq, gas companies can produce about 64 000 cubic metres [2.26 million cubic feet] of liquid oxygen a day, one-third of what the country's COVID-19 patients need. In Colombia, the industry can only provide 450 000 cubic metres [15.9 million cubic feet] a day, less than two-thirds of what is needed.

In Peru, gas companies can only reach 80% of the oxygen it needs if all oxygen was diverted to healthcare. "Currently, Peru is registering a drop in [COVID] cases," said Dr. Jesus Valverde Huaman, who works in an ICU in Lima. "However, we are still in need of medical oxygen, especially for hospitals." It has been a constant struggle to find enough oxygen for patients, he said, apart from a short stretch in November and December last year [2020], when cases dipped.

Greenslade said: "We have to ask a very critical question: why such an essential resource as oxygen is locked up in mining, steel, oil and gas when the poor public hospital system can't provide enough to keep babies, adults and the elderly alive.

"These countries have to take a good look at how they're investing in medical oxygen in the health system. If oxygen capacity is there for mining companies to extract, the capacity must be there for the health system to save lives."

While liquid oxygen is a major source for medics in many countries, it does not account for all of the supply. Hospitals can also obtain oxygen from on-site factories that turn ambient air into oxygen, and from portable concentrator machines. The World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank and other donors and NGOs have shipped hundreds of thousands of concentrators to countries to help them deal with rises in oxygen needs, but manufacturers are running short of parts.

The World Bank has warned that many countries have not applied for emergency loans available to help them upgrade oxygen systems. Last year [2020] the World Bank made USD 160 billion (GBP 113 billion) available for countries to prepare for COVID-19 and added an additional USD 12 billion this month [May 2021]. The cash can be used to import oxygen or shore up production.

Unitaid and Wellcome have donated USD 20 million in emergency funding for oxygen in low-income countries. The Global Fund has also made USD 3.7 billion in grants available for countries to use on COVID-19 response programmes, including to buy oxygen concentrators and build public oxygen plants.

Campaigners want emergency, fast-tracked funding for oxygen supplies anywhere in the world. But Mickey Chopra, a senior official at the World Bank, said countries had applied for loans for ventilators and PPE but not for oxygen supplies. "The variants and the sudden spikes that we've seen now have caught people by surprise, to a large extent, and the weakest point in the system has turned out to be the oxygen supply system."

Looking ahead, Greenslade would like to see governments create comprehensive national medical oxygen strategies, with workers trained to give patients oxygen safely and maintain and fix equipment. Countries need to have plans in place for unexpected rises in demand, she said. "What they're doing at the moment is when a crisis hits, [governments] scramble to bring a group together to come up with some way of managing it. But they need to get ahead of the game."

Hong Kong may donate COVID-19 vaccines to countries more in need of them as local demand for Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE shots ebbs. Moderna Inc.'s vaccine was highly effective in younger teens in a large study, putting it on track to become the 2nd shot authorized in the USA for adolescents. [Of the approximately 2 million BioNTech doses that have been delivered to Hong Kong, the city has 840 000 unused doses in storage that will expire in mid-August 2021; it has procured 7.5 million doses in total.]

A White House official said that half of American adults will be fully vaccinated as of Tuesday [25 May 2021]. The nation's top airlines are seeing a rebound in travel.

In Europe, France is weighing whether to impose additional restrictions at its border with Britain to fend off the variant first identified in India. The British government warned people to avoid traveling to hot spots in England where the variant is spreading.

Maine Governor Janet Mills said 70% of state residents age 12 and older have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Five other states -- Vermont, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut -- have also reached that milestone, she said in a statement, citing CDC data.

British Columbia, whose economy weathered the pandemic better than much of Canada, said it foresees a return to "normal life" as it announced plans to lift most restrictions by the fall [2021]. The western province on Tuesday [25 May 2021] released a 4-stage plan that could see offices fully reopened, sporting events and concerts allowed, and constraints on travel lifted by September [2021]. The reopening will be based on data, and dates and rules could change depending on new outbreaks.

The rebound in US travel is gaining steam, according to the country's 3 biggest airlines. Corporate trips and long overseas flights -- the worst-hit segments during the pandemic -- are poised for improvement.

Harvard students will return to the classroom full time for the fall semester and campus housing will go back to its usual density after more than a year of remote learning. The university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is expecting the largest entering class in its history, Harvard said Tuesday [25 May 2021] in a statement on its website. All enrolled students, who must be vaccinated to attend, can expect full campus access, which includes libraries, archives, museums and research facilities.

As Russia struggles to get its population to take the coronavirus vaccines heralded by President Vladimir Putin, the far east region of Yakutia is passing the strictest inoculation requirements yet. All companies, both public-sector and private, are required to organize shots for their workers, according to a decree by the region's chief medical authority. Employers that fail to do so may face fines, Yakutia President Aisen Nikolaev's press service said separately. The target is to cover at least 70% of all adults by July [2021].

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will bring mobile vaccination units to beaches and parks starting during the Memorial Day weekend and lasting through the summer [2021], including the Rockaways, Coney Island, Central Park and Governors Island. De Blasio said that starting Tuesday [25 May 2021] there will be a vaccination site in front of Madison Square Garden, which will be offering people getting the shot a chance to win tickets to the next New York Knicks playoff game.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that as of 30 Apr 2021 there were 10 262 cases of vaccinated people who were later infected with COVID-19 out of approximately 101 million people who are fully inoculated. A small number of so-called breakthrough infections after full vaccination are to be expected because no vaccines are 100% effective. The CDC notes the reported cases are likely a substantial undercount since many people, especially those who are asymptomatic or have only mild illness, might not seek testing. In May [2021], health officials shifted to investigating only cases in which patients were hospitalized or died, drawing concern from some scientists who say that may mean missing needed data.

The British government warned people to avoid traveling to hot spots in England where the variant first identified in India is spreading, as officials in France consider further curbs on passengers arriving from the UK. The guidance applies to 8 areas including Hounslow in west London, the central England city of Leicester and the northwest towns of Blackburn and Bolton. People there should not meet up indoors or travel outside their districts, the government said.

Ireland is set to announce this week that it will remove the requirement for travelers arriving from the UK to self-quarantine for 14 days, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported, even amid increasing concern about the spread of the variant first identified in India. Authorities are watching the variant's spread in the UK "very carefully," Prime Minister Micheal Martin told reporters in Brussels. Irish officials declined to comment on the Telegraph report.

Moderna Inc.'s vaccine was highly effective in 12- to 17-year-olds in a large study, paving the way for regulatory submissions around the world by early June [2021]. In a news release, the company said its vaccine was between 93% and 100% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID in teenagers, depending on whether very mild cases are included in the count. The study met its primary goal of showing that immune responses to the vaccine were as good as those produced in adults, and no significant safety concerns were observed, according to the company.

[4] Gastrointestinal disruption in long COVID cases
Date: Mon 24 May 2021
Source: Medpage Today [edited]
https://bit.ly/3fqepmU


Italians who had COVID-19 during the early waves last year [2020] were at substantial risk of showing continued gastrointestinal symptoms long after recovering from the infection -- especially those who experienced diarrhea during the acute phase, a researcher reported.

Some 18% of COVID-19 survivors in the Lombardy region who responded to a survey said they were still having loose stools, and a number of other GI symptoms appeared more severe in these individuals than in controls who had avoided infection, said Daniele Noviello, MD, of the University of Milan.

Moreover, one-third of the COVID survivors reported chronic fatigue, compared with 14% of controls, Noviello told attendees at the virtual Digestive Disease Week annual meeting.

The report follows many others documenting persistent post-recovery symptoms in a significant minority of COVID survivors, which appear to run the gamut from respiratory difficulties to neurological and psychiatric abnormalities, and now gastrointestinal symptoms.

Because diarrhea and other GI complaints are among the hallmark non-respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, and because Italy was an early hotbed for the infection -- centered in the region around Milan -- Noviello and colleagues sought to examine how their patients were faring in terms of continued symptoms.

The group emailed a survey to patients treated for COVID-19 at Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan during the first 2 waves of the pandemic there, in March and May 2020, and also to workers at the hospital who had tested negative for COVID, who would serve as controls. The survey asked about the presence and severity of specific GI abnormalities, as well as others including neuropsychiatric and general symptoms.

After excluding respondents with pre-existing diagnoses of irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease, the researchers had 347 completed surveys for analysis (reflecting a response rate of 12%, a significant limitation of the study), of which 164 were from COVID survivors and 183 from uninfected controls. These were submitted a mean of 4.8 months after acute-phase recovery.

Mean ages of survivors and controls were 44 and 40, respectively. About 40% of survivors were women versus 61% of controls. Oddly, perhaps, nearly 20% of controls were current smokers, compared with 7% of the COVID survivors.

During the survivors' acute COVID phase, half had experienced diarrhea; about 25% reported having nausea, and 20% had had abdominal pain. Rates of other symptoms were similar to those reported elsewhere.

Loose stool was the predominant GI symptom that appeared more frequently among survivors versus controls -- numerically almost twice as common, in fact (adjusted relative risk 1.88, 95% CI 0.99-3.54). Noviello didn't report rates of other symptoms, but mean severity of abdominal pain/discomfort, diarrhea/incontinence, and gastroesophageal reflux on standard scoring instruments were all numerically greater by 50%, though these differences fell just short of statistical significance.

Among other domains analyzed, chronic fatigue was clearly more common in survivors, with an adjusted relative risk of 2.24 (95% CI 1.48-3.37). Also, so-called somatoform symptoms, as evaluated with questions derived from the 12-item Symptom Checklist, were reported more frequently, with total scores of 54.6 in survivors versus 50.5 for controls (P less than 0.05).

Noviello also reported that risks for persistent symptoms were greater in the subset of survivors who had diarrhea in the acute phase. Fully one-third of this group would qualify for a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome by Rome IV criteria at follow-up, based on the respondents' self-reports, and 21% were still having loose stools. Among survivors without acute-phase diarrhea, the corresponding figures were 19% and 10%, respectively.

"Key takeaways" from the study include that patients with diarrhea during acute COVID-19 are especially likely to show persistent symptoms after recovery, Noviello said. These findings suggest a 3-way interaction among SARS-CoV-2 and the GI and central nervous systems, he added.

Besides the low survey response rate, limitations to the analysis included the reliance on participant self-report and the sample's restriction to northern Italy.

[Enteric symptoms are common in COVID-19, and gastrointestinal symptoms can be the only symptom, or can be present before respiratory symptoms. The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is highly expressed in the gut, and SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in the colonic tissue and faeces of patients with COVID-19. Weng et al. examined the long-term gastrointestinal sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who were admitted for COVID-19 to 12 hospitals in the Hubei and Guangdong provinces, China, between 16 Jan and 7 Mar 2020, and subsequently discharged (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(21)00076-5/fulltext). They reported that "Decreased blood oxygen saturation, a symptom closely related to severe pneumonia, was found to be associated with gastrointestinal sequelae. This association might involve hypoxia mediating the multi-organ injuries frequently observed with COVID-19."

The North American Alliance for the Study of Digestive Manifestation of COVID-19 reported that while severe GI complications in COVID-19 admitted to the ICU were uncommon -- at only 5.1% -- they were associated with a death rate of 55.6%.

While the study showed a low incidence of intestinal ischemia, Emad Qayed, MD, MPH, of Emory University in Atlanta, and colleagues warned that COVID-19 is "a hypercoagulable disorder that is associated with a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism." And since it can infect the endothelial cells of different vascular beds in the heart, small bowel, and lungs, endotheliitis caused by COVID-19 can lead to microthrombus formation and organ ischemia.

As the GI checklist for COVID-19 symptoms strengthens, along with newer symptoms such as COVID-associated delirium, clinicians will have an increasing number of indicators to raise the index of suspicion and guide the diagnostic processes.

Prolonged fecal shedding in infected patients even after viral clearance in respiratory tract could suggest whether stool testing in patients with COVID-19 with appropriate transmission precautions for hospitalised patients who remain stool positive. Further research to determine the viability and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces is required to control the spread of the virus, especially in asymptomatic carriers (https://gut.bmj.com/content/69/6/973). - Mod.UBA]

Weekly epidemiological update on COVID-19 -- 25 May 2021 (edition 41)

Overview
--------
Globally, over the past week, the number of new cases and deaths reported continued to decrease, with over 4.1 million new cases and 84 000 new deaths reported. The European Region reported the largest decline in new cases and deaths this week, followed by the South-East Asia Region. The Region of the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, African, and Western Pacific Regions reported similar numbers of cases to the previous week.

In this edition, a special focus update is provided on SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest (VOIs) and variants of concern (VOCs) B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617. This includes updates on emerging evidence surrounding the phenotypic characteristics of VOCs (transmissibility, disease severity, risk of reinfection, and impacts on diagnostics and vaccine performance), as well as updates on the geographic distribution of VOCs.

Global overview (data as of 23 May 2021)
----------------------------------------
Over the past week, the number of new cases and deaths continued to decrease, with over 4.1 million new cases and 84 000 new deaths reported, a 14% and 2% decrease, respectively, compared to the previous week (Figure 1 [see source URL for all figures, tables, references, and additional notes]). The European Region reported the largest decline in new cases and deaths in the past week, followed by the South-East Asia Region (Table 1). The numbers of cases reported by the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, African, and Western Pacific Regions were similar to those reported in the previous week. The Western Pacific Region reported the largest increase in the number of deaths, while other regions reported decreases or similar numbers to the previous week. Despite a declining global trend over the past 4 weeks, incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths remain high, and substantial increases have been observed in many countries throughout the world.

The highest numbers of new cases in the last 7 days were reported from India (1 846 055 new cases; 23% decrease), Brazil (451 424 new cases; 3% increase), Argentina (213 046 new cases; 41% increase), the USA (188 410 new cases; 20% decrease), and Colombia (107 590 new cases; 7% decrease).

Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 VOIs and VOCs
-------------------------------------------------
WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions and researchers, routinely assesses if variants of SARS-CoV-2 result in changes in transmissibility, clinical presentation and severity, or if they result in changes in public health and social measures (PHSM) implementation by national health authorities. Globally, systems have been established and are being strengthened to detect "signals" of potential VOIs or VOCs and assess these based on the risk posed to global public health. Table 2 lists currently designated global VOCs and VOIs. National authorities may choose to designate other variants of local interest/concern. Here we provide an update on emerging evidence surrounding phenotypic characteristics (Table 3) and the geographical distribution of designated VOCs.

Phenotypic characteristics
Available evidence on phenotypic impacts of VOCs and vaccine performance against VOCs are summarised in Tables 3 and 4. Further discussion on impacts is also provided in previous editions of our COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update.

Further to our last detailed update published 2 weeks ago, new evidence is emerging that secondary attack rates for variant B.1.617.2 reported in the United Kingdom from 29 Mar to 28 Apr 2021 were higher than that of B.1.1.7, among travellers and non-travellers (19). Secondary attack rates for B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.7 were measured by the proportion of positive tests among contacts of confirmed or probable cases infected with variants.

A pre-print study of 3 outbreaks among kindergarten-aged children in Germany suggested that children aged 1 to 5 years who were infected with variant B.1.1.7 were as susceptible and infectious as adults infected with B.1.1.7 (measured by secondary attack rates) in both kindergarten (23% vs 30%; p = 0.15) and household (32% vs 39%; p = 0.27) settings (20).

A study of 7 European countries assessing disease severity of cases reported from 13 Sep 2020 to 13 Mar 2021 (n = 23 343) reported that a significantly higher proportion of cases infected with one of the 3 VOCs -- B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 -- were admitted to the hospital (11% for B.1.1.7/SGTF; 19% for B.1.351; 20% for P.1) compared to those infected with non-VOCs (7.5%, p less than 0.01 for all VOCs). Similarly, a higher proportion of cases infected with these VOCs were admitted to the ICU (1.4% for B.1.1.7/SGTF, p less than 0.01; 2.3% for B.1.351, p less than 0.01; 2.1% for P.1, p less than 0.01) compared to those infected with non-VOCs (0.6%).

Further to our last update on vaccine performance against VOCs, new Phase III efficacy results from the United Kingdom have been made available and provide evidence that Novavax-Covavax is highly efficacious at preventing COVID-19 disease due to B.1.1.7. Efficacy against B.1.1.7 symptomatic disease 7 days or more after the 2nd dose was 86.3% (95% CI: 71.3%-93.5%), similar to that against non-B.1.1.7 disease: 96.4% (95% CI: 73.8%-99.5%) (26).

In addition, 2 new preprint studies (not yet peer-reviewed) estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria vaccines against COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization among older adults in the United Kingdom. Both studies were conducted between December 2020 and April 2021 when B.1.1.7 accounted for the vast majority of sequenced viruses in the United Kingdom. The 1st study evaluated VE against mortality within 28 days of a positive PCR test among individuals 70 years or older who developed symptomatic disease and is the 1st peer-reviewed publication to estimate the effectiveness of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria against mortality. Results show a single dose of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria offers levels of protection against mortality among people who develop disease (VE: 55%, 95% CI: 41-66%) similar to a single dose of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty (VE: 44%, 95% CI: 3-53%). VE of 2 doses of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty against death among people who develop disease was 69% (95% CI: 31-86%). Data were insufficient to estimate effectiveness of 2 doses of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria. This study estimates the protection of vaccination against death (in addition to protection against symptomatic disease), and, taken together with VE estimates against symptomatic disease in the same age group, suggest approximately 80% protection of a single dose of either vaccine and approximately 97% protection for 2 doses of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty against mortality in older adults. A 2nd study estimated overall VE against hospitalization 28 or more [days] post 1st dose to be 73% (95% CI: 60-81%) for the AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria and 81% (95% CI: 76-85%) for Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty among individuals 80 years or older; VE against hospitalization 14 or more days post 2nd dose of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty was 93% (89-95%) (25). These studies provide real-world evidence that AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria and Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty vaccine provide good protection against severe disease in settings where B.1.1.7 are prevalent.

A test-negative, case-control pre-print study in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, among adults 70 years of age or older from mid-January through April 2021 found a VE of 41.6% (95% CI: 26.9-53.3%) against symptomatic COVID-19 14 days or more after the 2nd dose of Sinovac-CoronaVac during a period of widespread P.1 circulation (P.1 comprised 83% of genotyped isolates in March and April 2021). VE was reported as 49.4% (95% CI: 26.9-65.0%) at 21 days or more after the 2nd dose. These findings are consistent with clinical trial results conducted in health workers in Brazil when P.1 was not yet widespread.

A new pre-print study from the United Kingdom suggested slightly lower effectiveness for Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria vaccines against symptomatic disease caused by B.1.617.2 compared to symptomatic diseased caused by B.1.1.7. VE of 2 doses of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty was 93.4% (95% CI: 90.4-95.5%) against B.1.1.7 and 87.9% (95% CI: 78.2-93.2%) against B.1.617.2. VE of 2 doses of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria was 66.1% (95% CI: 54.0-75.0%) against B.1.1.7 and 59.8% (95% CI: 28.9-77.3%) against B.1.617.2.42 In a clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom between June and December 2020, efficacy of 2 doses of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria against symptomatic disease was 81.5% (67.9-89.4%) for non-B.1.1.7 lineages and 70.4% (43.6-84.5%) for B.1.1.7, a comparable result to that of the effectiveness study (27). Differences in point estimates for efficacy and effectiveness for AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria were not statistically significant, and therefore should not be over-interpreted.

Recent studies provide evidence of some loss of neutralization capacity of COVID-19 vaccines against B.1.617.1. One study found a 2-fold reduction in neutralization capacity against B.1.617.1 after 2 doses of SII-Covishield compared to the prototype B.1 lineage (n = 21). These findings excluded 10 samples that did not show neutralizing antibody titer against B.1 nor B.1.617.1, and 12 samples that showed neutralizing antibody titer only against B.1. Another study found a 7-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.617.1 among sera from vaccinees receiving 2 doses of Moderna-mRNA-1273 (n = 15) or Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty (n = 10); however, a majority of sera were still able to neutralize the variant. Two additional studies provided further evidence of modest to moderate loss of neutralization by Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty and Moderna-mRNA-1273 vaccines against the pseudotype virus bearing B.1.617.1 spike mutations that are shared with B.1.617.3. Finally, a 5th study showed a 2-fold loss of neutralization against B.1.617 for Bharat-Covaxin vaccine, a loss comparable to that seen with VOC 202012/01 (B.1.1.7); however, no information was available on the B.1.617 sublineages included in this study. Taken together, these early studies suggest some loss of neutralization capacity against B.1.617; however, it is unclear whether this loss translates into decreased vaccine efficacy/effectiveness. Vaccine efficacy and real-world effectiveness evidence for B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 or B.1.617.3 is limited.

Geographic distribution
-----------------------
As surveillance activities to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants are strengthened at local and national levels, including by strategic genomic sequencing, the number of countries/areas/territories (hereafter countries) reporting VOCs has continued to increase (Figures 3 and 4, Annex 2). This distribution should be interpreted with due consideration of surveillance limitations, including differences in sequencing capacities, sharing of sequencing data to publicly available platforms and sampling strategies between countries.

WHO recommendations
-------------------
Virus evolution is expected, and the more SARS-CoV-2 circulates, the more opportunities it has to evolve. Reducing transmission through established and proven disease control methods, such as those outlined in the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, as well as avoiding introductions into animal populations are crucial aspects of the global strategy to reduce the occurrence of mutations that have negative public health implications. PHSM remain critical to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Evidence from multiple countries with extensive transmission of VOCs has indicated that the PHSM, including infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in health facilities has been effective in reducing COVID-19 case incidence, which has led to a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among COVID-19 patients. National and local authorities are encouraged to continue strengthening existing PHSM, IPC and disease control activities. Authorities are also encouraged to strengthen surveillance and sequencing capacities and apply a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants based on the local context, and to detect unusual events.

Key weekly updates
------------------
WHO Director-General's key messages
Opening remarks at the World Health Assembly - 24 May 2021:
- Although we have lost so many health and care workers already, we will lose many more as long as the pandemic rages. Almost 18 months into the defining health crisis of our age, the world remains in a very fragile and dangerous situation.
- No country should assume it is out of the woods, no matter its vaccination rate.
- WHO's Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan sets out the 10 pillars that every country must apply in a tailored and dynamic way to reduce exposure, prevent infections, limit the spread, and save lives. Every country can do more:
* Increase surveillance, testing, sequencing, and sharing information;
* Surge supplies needed to protect health workers;
* Fight misinformation and disinformation;
* Empower people and communities to play their part;
* Support businesses and workplaces to take steps to open up safely, where appropriate;
* Implement national vaccination strategies, vaccinate those most at risk, and donate vaccines to COVAX.
- We must be very clear: the pandemic is not over, and it will not be over until and unless transmission is controlled in every last country.

Additional updates
------------------
On 21 May 2021, world leaders met at the Global Health Summit, co-hosted by the European Commission and Italy as part of its G20 presidency, to adopt an agenda to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, and develop and endorse a Rome Declaration of Principles.

[In the past 24 hours, India (208 886), Brazil (74 845), Argentina (24 601), and the USA (24 252) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 456 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 23 May 2021 to late 24 May 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (6 countries) include India, Brazil, Argentina, the USA, Colombia (21 181), and Iran (11 873). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 53 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 7 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 23.8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 22.7% decrease in daily reported cases and 12.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 168.51 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.49 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
