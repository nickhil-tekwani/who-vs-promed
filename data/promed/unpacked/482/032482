Viet Nam downplays bird flu but urges vigilance
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam said an emergence of bird flu in southern provinces did not mean a
return of the epidemic that killed 16 people earlier in 2004, but urged
farmers to remain on guard.
The bird flu has caused the cull or deaths of more than 10 000 chickens in
the Mekong Delta provinces of Bac Lieu and Tien Giang.
"The recent incident when chickens died was just an echo of the last bird
flu outbreak because there were still chickens from the infected flock,"
Bui Quang Anh, an agriculture ministry official, was quoted as saying by
Friday's Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper. "It cannot be called an outbreak," Anh
said.
Viet Nam was struck by bird flu earlier in 2004 involving the deadly H5N1
strain that also killed 8 people in Thailand. Hanoi declared the epidemic
over at the end of March.
Anh said the latest chicken deaths were from the H5 strain of bird flu, not
H5N1, Viet Nam News daily reported. Deputy prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung
issued an emergency directive, published in newspapers on Friday, outlining
measures to quell any recurrence of the bird flu, including immediately
destroying sick fowl.
The bird flu erupted across many parts of Asia from late in 2003 and killed
millions of chickens and devastated poultry industries in several
countries, particularly Thailand. People who got infected are believed to
have caught the disease from close contact with sick birds. There were no
confirmed cases of human to human transmissions. The United Nation's Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) urged caution and more detailed testing.
"Viet Nam doesn't have the capacity to analyze the samples," said Anton
Rychener, Viet Nam representative of the FAO. "I have urged him (Anh) to
send the samples to Hong Kong. Whether it's old or new (cases) I really do
not know," Rychener told Reuters. "I have said all along that the virus is
continuing to exist in Viet Nam."

Mekong bird flu may be spreading to nearby province
---------------------------------------------------
A day after agricultural officials said that bird flu had re-emerged in
Vietnam's Mekong Delta, officials yesterday announced another suspected
outbreak in a nearby province.
Test results have not yet confirmed that the relatively small number of
bird deaths were caused by the same virus that killed 16 people in Vietnam
earlier this year, but officials suspect the disease has returned to Tien
Giang province. "Resulting from poor decontamination after a bird flu
outbreak earlier this year, the virus returned," said Tao Van Hoa, vice
director of Tien Giang province's ministry of agriculture and rural
development.
Since last Thursday, 875 birds from 50 to 75 days old have died in 3 farms
in the province, and another 3600 have been culled, the ministry official
said from the province, some 70km south of Ho Chi Minh City. Samples from
the dead chickens have been sent for tests to a veterinary laboratory in Ho
Chi Minh City, with the results expected to be available next week, said an
official from the regional veterinary center in Vietnam's southern economic
hub.
Nguyen Quanh Anh, the deputy head of the agency's national veterinary
department, said that until the results come back, the previously reported
outbreak in Bac Lieu is the only confirmed reoccurrence of the virus. "The
small number of deaths do not constitute an epidemic in the southern
province," the local agency official said.
"We can't say that the bird flu is an epidemic in Tien Giang because the
birds did not die in large numbers," Hoa said. He added that efforts at
prevention have been dramatically intensified in order to limit the chances
of a recurrence of the disease. Tien Giang province was one of the first
provinces to announce large scale bird deaths in Vietnam last January. The
virus eventually spread to 57 of Vietnam's 67 provinces and cities,
claiming 16 lives.
When Vietnam's government announced that it had controlled the disease at
the end of March, international animal and human health experts criticized
the country. Agricultural experts warned that 2 or 3 years could be
required to successfully eradicate the virus.

[Anton Rychener's urged caution for more detailed testing speaks for
itself. It remains to be hoped that the (full) identity of the virus --
probably H5N1 -- be confirmed soon and officially reported. - Mod.AS]
