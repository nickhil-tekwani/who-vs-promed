The Angolan health authorities reported 4 deaths caused by rabies and
a total of 580 bites last week across the country. This was revealed
to the press today [7 Apr 2010] by Deputy Health Minister Carlos
Alberto Masseca at the end of the meeting of the inter-ministerial
committee for Influenza and Rabies.

Carlos Masseca said that the deaths occurred in the provinces of
Malanje (2 cases), Kwanza Norte (1 case) and Moxico (1 case), noting
that Luanda and Bie are the regions most affected by rabies.

"We still continue to report a large number of bites," stated a
spokesman at the meeting, stating that there is enough vaccine for
the national campaign that has been running since February this year [2010].

According to Carlos Alberto Masseca, rabies is fatal, so if bitten by
animals suspected of having the disease, victims should seek
attention at medical units quickly and be vaccinated with the human
rabies vaccine.

For this reason, there are calls for animal owners (of dogs, cats and
monkeys) to assume their responsibilities in the immunization of
these animals [against rabies] as well as greater compliance with the
campaign and intervention of community leaders and provincial
governments in raising public awareness so that together we can
address this public health problem.

Data from provincial departments of the Veterinary Institute indicate
that from [30 Mar 2010 to 6 Apr 2010], 124 692 animals were
vaccinated in the country. During the same period, Luanda had 362
bites, 148 of which were in the Cacuaco municipality.

Huambo, Moxico, Namibe, Uige and Zaire are the regions with
kennels/catteries in operation.

[It is too early to judge whether the animal vaccination campaign
initiated on 30 Mar 2010 will have any effect on the incidence of human cases.
