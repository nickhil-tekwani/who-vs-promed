Nina Pham, nurse who contracted Ebola, is now free of virus and leaves NIH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nina Pham, the 1st nurse diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, walked out of the National Institutes of Health on Friday morning [24 Oct 2014] after doctors there declared her free of the Ebola virus. Pham, 26, had cared for an infected Ebola patient in Dallas [Texas]. She was treated at the Bethesda, Maryland, USA facility, which has a special unit for patients who need advanced isolation and extended stays. "She has no virus in her," said Anthony S Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at a news conference. "She feels well." He said Pham "looks extraordinarily well." He described her as an "extraordinarily courageous and lovely person" and a "devoted nurse." ...

Pham later in the day met with President Obama at the White House. At his daily press briefing White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the president's decision to greet Pham was "an opportunity, 1st of all, to thank her for her service." Pham did not undergo any additional medical testing before greeting -- and hugging -- the president, Earnest said, noting that she had been shown to be free of the virus on 5 separate occasions before being released.

At the news conference in Bethesda, Pham said she is looking forward to returning to Texas and to a normal life with her dog, Bentley. Her King Charles spaniel was quarantined after Pham was diagnosed. He tested negative for Ebola but is still in his 21-day incubation period until the end of the month [October 2014], according to Texas officials.... -- more

[Evidence of infection of dogs with an ebolavirus in Africa was reported in ProMED-mail post Ebolavirus, animal reservoir (04): canine, control, comment 20141024.2895085. I do not know of any report of Ebola symptoms in dogs, and there are no reports of suspicious dog deaths in the 3 countries.

"To ultimately 'prove' that an animal is carrying a productive infection would be very difficult in a heavily contaminated environment. PCR, because of its sensitivity, could easily yield a false positive under these circumstances. So might virus isolation, unless proper procedures were strictly adhered to. Immunohistochemistry of target tissues might be considered, if specific reagents are available. Always, we need to be aware of the severe risks associated with detailed investigation of Ebola virus disease." (See Cor Lenghaus, BVSc (Hons) PhD, Australia <corlenghaus@bigpond.com> in the ProMED post referenced above).

It is interesting that as far as incubation period is concerned, authorities are treating the dog as a human -- without any experimental evidence to support that. It would be helpful if such evidence could be obtained. - Mod.JW]

China rules out Ebola cases
---------------------------
South China's Guangdong Province has ruled out possible Ebola cases as 43 people suspected of infection tested negative for the deadly virus, local health authorities said on Tuesday [21 Oct 2014]. A total of 8672 people from Ebola-ridden areas entered the province since 23 Aug 2014, said Chen Yuansheng, director with the provincial health and family planning commission. So far, 5437 people have been discharged from medical observation, Chen added. [On what criteria were they selected? - Mod.JW]

China's largest trade fair, Canton Fair, opened its 116th session in Guangdong on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014], drawing a huge influx of foreign visitors. Authorities have tightened examination to avoid possible spread of the disease. So far, no Ebola cases have been reported in China.

[3] USA: troop precautions

Health chief outlines precautions for Ebola response troops
-----------------------------------------------------------
Fighting the West Africa Ebola epidemic is immediately and strategically important to the United States, and the Defense Department is taking every precaution to minimize risk to deployed troops, the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs said in a recent interview.

In a 17 Oct 2014 DoD News interview, Dr Jonathan Woodson spoke about the deadly outbreak and the importance to global health security of the US military's contribution in support of the whole-of-government effort being led by the US Agency for International Development. Woodson said it's important for service members, their families and the American public to understand why troops are being sent to West Africa.

Best defense is to stop Ebola's spread in West Africa
-----------------------------------------------------
"It's important for the world community to respond to stop the spread of Ebola," the assistant secretary said. "As we've seen, it's reached our shore. It takes one person to get on a plane and [Ebola] is here, so our best defense ... is to stop the spread of that epidemic there."

In doing so, he added, troops working in West Africa must be protected. "The Military Health System has always been in the business of force health protection," Woodson said. "It goes all the way back to the colonial army, when we dealt with smallpox, and to Walter Reed's effort to find [the cause of] yellow fever." The effort to assure troops' safe deployment and return begins with predeployment training, during which they're educated about the West African environment and about what they need to do and what self-protection procedures they need to perform, gauged against their risk, the assistant secretary said. "We're going to train them in the use of personal protective equipment [and] vaccinate them against the known communicable diseases there, such as typhoid [and] yellow fever ... and give them medicines to protect them against malaria," he added.

The troops' mission
-------------------
The troops' mission is to build Ebola treatment units, Woodson said, not to directly treat Ebola victims. "While they're in theater, we will be actively monitoring them every day," he said. "We'll be taking their temperature twice a day, their supervisors will be asking them about any exposure history, and we'll be able, in real time, to monitor any exposures that might happen and monitor for any symptoms." One could rightly worry about inadvertent contact or a situation spawned by an emergency, Woodson said, so troops will have personal protective equipment and will be trained in how to don it and take it off. "They will be supervised, and ... battle buddies will be watching out for these exposures," he added. "I think we can minimize any chance of exposure or risk with that strategy."

[4] Ebola as a bioterror threat: discounted

Are we [Australia] at risk from Ebola-infected suicide bombers?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Senator Lambie [former soldier] asks defence chiefs if the nation [Australia] is at risk from Ebola infected 'suicide agents'. Defence chiefs say there is no evidence Australia is at risk from hypothetical militants. It comes as she called for 'M.A.S.H.-style' mobile military hospitals to fight the deadly virus here and abroad last week.... -- more

[Since the question of whether Ebola is an actual bioterror threat has been asked by some media (more than once), has anybody done the following experiment? Infected a 60 kg pig, fitted it with human clothing and a suicide vest, blown it up inside a bomb control tent containing a few pigskin-covered mannequins wearing human clothes (in a BL-4 chamber, of course) and after the explosion swabbed the mannequins exposed pigskin, their clothing, any bits and pieces and the inside of the tent, and tested them for RNA and live virus? Then we would have some evidence of whether the virus is incinerated by the explosion and the potential risk, rather than just speculation. (If a test has already been done, the results are probably classified). And of course, even if it is shown to be effective at contaminating surviving bystanders and their rescuers, it doesn't mean that it will ever happen. - Mod.JW]
