The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Tuesday [24 Jul 2018] that 5 people in Taiwan were recently diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis, bringing the number of cases in the country so far this year [2018] to 31.

Kuo Hung-wei, deputy head of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Center, said that in the period [15-21 Jul 2018], 5 people were confirmed as infected with the disease.

The patients, aged 34 to 56, were from Taoyuan's Bade and Pingzhen districts, New Taipei's Sanchong district, Nantou county's Ren'ai township, and Changhua's Fuxing township, he said.

CDC physician Huang Wan-ting said the patients developed symptoms of fever and suffered impaired consciousness or unconsciousness between [30 Jun and 16 Jul 2018].

Currently, the 5 patients are hospitalized and undergoing treatment, Huang said, adding that 4 of them had been living in areas near pig pens or rice fields, which are considered high risk for the transmission of Japanese encephalitis [virus] since they are prime breeding grounds for the mosquito that carries the virus.

The confirmation of the 5 infections brought the total number of cases in Taiwan this year to 31, the CDC said.

In Taiwan, Japanese encephalitis is usually prevalent from May to October each year and peaks between June and July, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang.

The disease is transmitted mainly by the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito, which breeds in rice fields, ponds, and irrigation canals, according to the CDC.

It has advised that people avoid visiting such places and animal farms, especially at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active, and use a government-approved mosquito repellent and wear light-colored clothing that cover their limbs if they must go to such areas.

According to the CDC website, the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis are often mild -- fever and headache -- but approximately 1 in 250 infections are characterized by a rapid onset of high fever, headache, stiff neck, disorientation, coma, seizure or spastic paralysis, and can result in death.

[The numbers of people with Japanese encephalitis continues to climb with these 5 new cases reported above. The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season is now well under way in Taiwan. We expect cases to occur sporadically until the transmission season ends in October 2018. The mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, is an efficient vector of JEV and breeds in wet areas such as rice paddies. These culex mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individuals above probably had not been vaccinated. The advice to ensure that children are vaccinated is prudent. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.
