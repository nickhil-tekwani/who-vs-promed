Following reports of an outbreak of diarrhoeal disease, a rapid-response
team has visited the district of Dabola located 450km from Conakry. Out of
7 patients found and examined, 5 were suffering from bloody diarrhoea. Of 7
samples sent to the laboratory at Donka hospital, 1 was identified as
_Shigella dysenteriae_ type 1 resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and
erythromycin; it was however sensitive to nalidixic acid. All 7 patients
have been treated with norfloxacin and have recovered. No new case has been
reported. On 2 July, 2 stool samples were sent to the Institut Pasteur in
Dakar (Senegal) for additional testing and to obtain confirmation of the
diagnosis. Other samples will be sent to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Atlanta, United States. Surveillance measures in the area
have been strengthened, and the Ministry of Health has requested additional
stocks of nalidixic acid.

The typhoid outbreak said to have been raging at the Coast in the last few
months is a hoax, medical authorities in the region have ruled. In a terse
statement, the Provincial Medical Officer of Health, Dr S. K. Sharif, said
the "epidemic", which has been given publicity in the print and electronic
media, has been found to be a result of faulty laboratory analysis. "It is
fictitious and non-existent," said Dr Sharif in a telephone interview on
Friday. According to the PMoH, the mushrooming of private laboratories and
unlicensed pharmacies coupled with sub-standard testing had led to the
present state of hysteria, giving the false impression of an epidemic. He
said government pathologists who conducted tests on blood samples which had
earlier been reported to have typhoid found them negative. The samples were
drawn from Lamu where a typhoid scare had been reported through the media.
In a letter sent to all medical officers of health in the province, Dr
Sharif dismissed the quality of tests conducted in private clinics saying
such tests were "unprofessional and dangerous." "I am requesting you to
closely monitor the quality of laboratory results from private clinics so
that patients are not put on dangerous and expensive drugs," he said in the
letter copied to Kilifi, Kwale, Malindi, Lamu, Tana River, Taita Taveta and
Mombasa medical officers of health. He said an incomplete typhoid test
would create a false impression of an outbreak. "If you do not carry out
the right test, everyone who is tested will be positive and thus be put on
a treatment course which is unnecessary and dangerous," he said. Last week,
a leading consulting physician in Mombasa urged the government to protect
the public from rumours created by some pharmaceutical firms that there was
an outbreak of typhoid. In a Press conference, Dr J. B. Okanga protested
that the scare caused by the pharmaceutical companies had prompted scared
wananchi to rush for vaccination. Such vaccinations, he said, would only be
necessary should it be proved that there was an outbreak. He challenged the
Director of Medical Services, Prof Julius Meme, to explain to Kenyans why
radio advertisements urging Kenyans to go for typhoid vaccinations
continued even when there was no outbreak.
