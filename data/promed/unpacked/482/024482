Until [very large numbers of vaccinations are given with an adequate
surveillance system, infrequent side effects are usually not noticed.
In 1976, 40 000 people participated in swine influenza vaccine field
trials of one sort or another, and the military had used a formulation
that included swine [flu vaccine for years. It was not until some 40
million doses were given in a short period of time, with a system set
up to detect adverse reactions, that Guillain-Barre syndrome was
detected.
Millions of doses of live attenuated polio vaccine were given before
vaccine associated cases of polio were noticed. (Actually the
incidence was about 8/1 000 000. Mortality in polio is not a fair
measure of adverse reaction.) Intussception [was only associated with
rotavirus [vaccine after large scale field trials. Etc.
Don't you think there might have been a low level of adverse reactions
to 17D that was just not put together?

[Yes, that sounds like the best explanation. - Mod.JW
