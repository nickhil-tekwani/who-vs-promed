Russia: 41 cases of CCHF and one fatality recorded in the Stavropol region
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forty-one cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), including one
fatality, have been recorded in 12 districts of the Stavropol region,
according to the Territorial Management of Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service
on Surveillance of Consumer Rights and Human Well-being) in Stavropol.
These figures are worse than those of the preceding year when 38 cases were
recorded in 15 areas of the region. Despite this, local epidemiologists
consider that the CCHF epidemic season is coming to an end.
As in previous years, tick bites are the main route of infection --
accounting for 61 per cent of all cases of CCHF. Of patients exposed to
infection by tick bite, 28 per cent were exposed as a consequence of their
employment in agriculture and animal husbandry.
A total of 7770 people in the region sought treatment for tick bites. This
number is 1500 fewer than during the corresponding period of 2005. But the
334 people admitted to hospital with suspected CCHF exceeded by 46 per cent
the number admitted to hospital in 2005 on suspicion of CCHF infection.
