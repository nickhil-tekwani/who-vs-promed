The fisheries ministry has warned the public not to consume oysters and mussels produced at Walvis Bay, due to an outbreak of diarrhectic [diarrhetic, diarrheal] shellfish poisoning (DSP). As part of the national shellfish sanitation program, the Namibian Standards Institution (NSI) recently tested oysters and mussels for biotoxins and discovered that the results revealed the presence of DSP, the ministry said in a media statement on Fri 11 Jan 2019. The ministry said it was not safe to consume oysters and mussels sourced from Walvis Bay because of to the unusual level of DSP found in tested samples.

The public should note that marine biotoxins are not destroyed by cooking or freezing, the ministry cautioned. The fisheries ministry also said DSP manifested itself with intense diarrhea, severe abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting. The condition sets in within about half an hour after ingesting infected shellfish and lasts for about one day. Although not known to be fatal, the condition causes profuse intense diarrhea with a high risk of dehydration, the ministry also said.

Should an individual experience any of the mentioned symptoms, they are urged to seek immediate medical assistance and should inform a medical practitioner that they consumed molluscan shellfish.

[Diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20020) is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates belonging to the genera _Dinophysis_ spp. (_D. fortii_, _D. mitra_, _D. rotundata_, _D. tripos_, _D. acuta_, _D. norvegica_, and _D. acuminata_) and _Prorocentrum_ spp. (_P. lima_, _P. maculosum_, _P. concavum_, and _P. hoffmannianum_).

The DSP toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3), belong to the larger group of lipophilic toxins that also includes the azaspiracid, yessotoxin, and pectenotoxin group toxins.

The term diarrhectic (usually diarrhetic) shellfish poisoning (DSP) was used in this report, but this moderator prefers to use diarrheal shellfish poisoning to avoid any confusion between the almost homophones of diarrhetic and diuretic.

DSP is often mistaken for norovirus-like disease. It is treated with rehydration, and affected individuals usually recover in 1 to 2 days. DSP is most commonly found in shellfish in Europe and Japan but can appear anywhere and bears consideration with the appropriate epidemiology. - Mod.LL
