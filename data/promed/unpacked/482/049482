Four adult members of the same family (age range: 26-58 years), were
exposed during a single night to numerous mosquito bites in a
semirural environment of Central Venezuela. Two days later, they
noticed the sudden onset of malaise, fever (up to 40 deg C),
retro-ocular pain, generalized headache, conjunctival suffusion,
flushing of the face and neck, myalgias and severe incapacitating
polyarthralgias, involving predominantly the small joints of the
hands, wrists, ankles and toes. Joints became swollen and tender, but
effusion did not ensue. Pain was intense and increased with motion.
Limbs felt weak and very sensitive to touch.
Joint stiffness in the morning and after inactivity was a prominent
complaint. On the fifth day of illness, a rapidly spreading
maculopapular rash developed, which involved neck, trunk, and limbs.
The rash lasted 2 days, being followed by desquamation. In 3 of the
patients, painful cervical, pre-auricular and retro-auricular
lymphadenopathies, lasting approximately 2 weeks, were noticed. After
2 weeks of illness, only severe joint symptoms and lower limbs
hyperesthesias persisted, which slowly resolved over a period of about
6 months.
Clinical laboratory results were unremarkable except for a transient
and mild increase in ESR, and in serum levels of ALT, as well as
moderate lymphocytosis.
Serum samples obtained 3 months after onset of symptoms (when patients
were first seen at consultation), and again 3 months later on follow
up, revealed high specific anti-Mayaro virus IgM titers (1:3200 to
1:6400) by an antibody capture ELISA in 3 patients, with
seroconversion in one of them. All 4 cases also showed high titers of
specific IgG Mayaro virus antibodies (1:6400 to 1:12800), but were
negative (titers of 1:10) for Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus
IgM.
Mayaro virus disease has not been identified in Venezuela before, but
isolates have been recovered from humans, wild vertebrates, and
mosquitoes in Colombia, Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, Peru,
and Bolivia. Serological surveys indicate that Mayaro virus infection
is relatively common in rural human populations of northern South
America and the Amazon Basin. Cases are usually sporadic, and occur in
persons in recent contact with humid tropical forests.

[ProMED-mail is grateful for this first-hand report. We assume the
date of onset was late 2000.
Mayaro virus is a mosquito-borne alphavirus, related to Venezuelan,
Eastern & Western equine encephalitis viruses which also occur in the
Americas -- but Mayaro virus does not cause encephalitis. The natural
host is forest wildlife. - Mod.JW
