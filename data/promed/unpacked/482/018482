2 more human deaths from avian influenza in Indonesia have been confirmed
by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a Health
Ministry official said on Thu 22 Dec 2005, bringing total known Indonesian
deaths to 11.
"We have received confirmation from CDC Atlanta that the 2, designated N
and M, are positive," Hariadi Wibisono, director of the department charged
with control of animal-borne diseases, told Reuters. He was referring to
the cases of a 39-year-old man and an 8-year-old boy who had previously
tested positive locally for the deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza.
Local tests are not considered definitive. The CDC laboratory tests are
among those recognised by the World Health Organisation, Wibisono said.
Both victims died earlier in December 2005.
In addition to the 11 deaths, 5 individuals in Indonesia have been
confirmed as having the disease but are still alive. Wibisono had said
earlier that it was unclear if the boy had contact with infected chickens.
In the case of the 39-year-old, a WHO official has said there were reports
of sick and dying poultry in the neighbourhood.
The latest Indonesian deaths would take the known global total to 73, while
cases including survivors would rise to 141. All the deaths so far have
been in Asia. Indonesia will launch house-to-house surveillance of poultry
in Jakarta in a bid to halt the spread of the flu, a minister said earlier
this week. Local communities, student volunteers and military forces will
be deployed to inspect poultry across the sprawling capital of some 12
million people. Several of the victims so far have come from the Jakarta
area. Since August 2003, 10 million poultry have died from the disease in
Indonesia or been killed to prevent its spread.
Indonesia, with 220 million people, has millions of chickens and ducks, the
majority in the yards of rural or urban homes, including many in Jakarta.
Such a close relationship between people and livestock has helped spread
the disease in humans and the virus has been found in poultry in 2/3 of the
nation's 33 provinces.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation has launched its own grass roots
scheme covering the island of Java. The U.N. agency says Indonesian efforts
to control bird flu should be stepped up and the government needs to draft
an effective national strategy. Indonesia is also preparing an early bird
flu warning system that will involve local governments setting up health
posts in all villages, where doctors and nurses would be on the lookout for
flu cases in birds and humans.
