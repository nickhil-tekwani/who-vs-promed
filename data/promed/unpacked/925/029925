2003/049 New data on quarantine pests and pests of the EPPO Alert List
The EPPO Secretariat has extracted the following new data concerning
quarantine pests and pests included on the EPPO Alert List. The situation
of the pest concerned is indicated in bold, using the terms of ISPM no. 8.
New geographical records:
Peach latent mosaic pelamoviroid (EU Annexes) is reported for the first
time from Uruguay. PLMVd was detected in 2001 during a survey in 3
locations in the Canelones Department, the main peach-growing producing
area (ProMED posting, 2003). Present, found in Canelones Department.
Peach latent mosaic pelamoviroid (EU Annexes) is reported as present in
Brazil, Nepal, Pakistan (Hadidi et al., 1997). Present; no details.
Tomato ringspot nepovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was detected on soybean
in Iran (Golnaraghi et al., 2002).
Detailed records:
During surveys carried out in Yucatan, Mexico, phytoplasmas related to but
distinct from Coconut lethal yellowing phytoplasma (EPPO A1 quarantine
pest) were detected. Samples had been collected from coconut trees showing
leaf yellowing in Oaxaca in 1997 and in Guerrero in 1998 (trees were then
destroyed for precautionary reasons). Nutfall and inflorescence necrosis
symptoms which usually precede foliar yellowing were atypically absent or
delayed on these trees (Harrison et al., 2002).
_Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _citri_ (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) was recently
found in 3 new small areas in Florida (US), in the counties of Sarasota
(first find in this county ­ in private gardens), Manatee (commercial
citrus grove where infections had already been found in other parts of it)
and Lee (private gardens). Eradication measures continue in Florida (DOACS
Press Release, 2003).
Taxonomy:
Considering morphological, molecular and serological characteristics,
Potato latent virus (EPPO Alert list) is proposed as a new species in the
genus Carlavirus (Brattey et al., 2002).

[Based on analysis of 16s rRNA gene sequences, the LY phytoplasma appears
to be distinct from all other known coconut phytoplasmas.
Potato latent virus was found in asymptomatic potatoes (_Solanum
tuberosum_cv. Red La Soda) imported from USA as in vitro plants. Detected
in 7 other potato cultivar accessions (Pembina Chipper, Pungo, Kanona, Red
Pontiac, Purple Chief, Denali, Tejon) at the Vancouver collection of
virus-free potatoes in Canada, and in 2 other cultivars in the US Varietal
collection (High Plains, Platte). - Mod.DH]
