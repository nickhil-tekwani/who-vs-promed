At least 6 people have died of Japanese encephalitis in 3 VDCs of Morang District since mid-July [2014]. [VDCs are village development committees, the lowest level units of districts. - Mod.TY] The deceased have been identified as one individual from Pathari VDC and 5 from Letang VDC. Meanwhile, 7 other persons with infection are in critical condition. They are undergoing treatment in different health facilities in Biratnagar and Siliguri of India. According to the District Public Health Office, Morang, the areas where a number of persons are involved in pig farming have been the victims of Japanese encephalitis.

Apart from in Morang, victims of the disease are increasing in Jhapa, Siraha and Saptari districts as well. To date we have 54 Japanese encephalitis patients and the number is increasing, said Narayan Dahal, Manager of Nobel Medical Hospital.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis are reported in Nepal occasionally, sometimes as part of reports from northeastern India. In this report, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the only etiological agent mentioned as responsible for these encephalitis cases. There is no indication whether JEV has been confirmed for these cases, nor if there have been any recent vaccination campaigns.

Pigs are mentioned in the above report because they can serve as amplifying hosts for JEV. Birds, and especially ardeids [herons], are reservoir hosts, and the mosquito vectors are several _Culex_ species.
