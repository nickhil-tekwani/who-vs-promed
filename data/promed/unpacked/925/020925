Reports in local Sindhi press reveal that at least 22 camels have so far died in different villages in Kachho and others areas.

Dr Pershotam Khatri, Associate Professor and Chairman, Department of Animal Reproduction at Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam, who has studied camels, confirmed that in Kachho and other districts of Sindh [province], the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), commonly known as camel flu, has been reported; however, its diagnosis and confirmation at official level has not been made.

It is a viral respiratory infection caused by the MERS-coronavirus [MERS-CoV]. Fever, cough, diarrhoea, and shortness of breath are common signs of this disease; such diseases are more severe in those areas where other health problems already exist. As of 2015 there is no specific vaccine or treatment reported for the disease. However, broad spectrum antibiotics like long acting oxytetracycline may give temporary relief and help avoid other secondary infections, Khatri said.

The World Health Organisation recommends that those who come in contact with camels wash their hands frequently and do not touch sick camels.

There are also reports of respiratory problems in camels from Achhro Thar (white desert) areas of Hathungo and Banko Chahnio affecting a large population. But no death has been reported so far.

Local camel herders liken this disease with peste des petits ruminants (PPR), which is most commonly seen in small animals like sheep and goats. It needs to be diagnosed and confirmed at the molecular level (PCR).

"It is the 1st time this disease has hit the strong animal. Normally, this specific disease affects the smaller animals, like goat and sheep," Dr Pershotam said.

"I have got information from Achro Thar (white desert) Sanghar, where camel farmers are really worried as a large number of animals are sick at their traditional farms. They usually apply old practices to keep their animals healthy. Mostly, camel farmers residing in these far flung areas do not have access to government veterinary officials," he said.

The doctor disclosed he had approached many local vets who were still clueless as to how exactly the camels came in contact with this disease. "I approached many veterinary practitioners in these areas, known as camel habitats, who are yet to ascertain the exact causes of this infection. That is why they cannot suggest the medicines immediately to save the animal," he said.

Dr Pershotam is familiar with this animal and had organised a 2-day international symposium quite recently at the Sindh Agriculture University, which attracted experts from Germany, US, and UAE, along with local scientists.

The persistent dry weather and droughts have further contributed to diminish shrubs and plants, which are valuable assets for not only humans, but also animals. In the arid areas, both humans and animals depend on this scrubby vegetation for sustenance.

Kharai camel breed in the coastal areas of Sindh -- Karachi, Thatta, Sujawal and some parts of Badin -- is also under threat due to the viral infection this summer.

Camels are heat tolerant because of their ability to minimise water loss. They can survive up to 14 days without water and can tolerate water losses of up to 30 percent. A camel may drink more than 1/3rd of its body weight as it rehydrates. The community reveals that due to the declining water resources, camels are forced to drink stagnant and polluted water from open ponds and sea lakes.

The other reason is deficiency of plant nutrients in the habitats of the camel. These herders believe that besides contaminated water, the shrinking plants and shrubs are also making the animals weaker, which is leading them to death. They cite the disappearing jaar (mustard tree -- _Salvadora persica_), which produce fruits and vegetables and provides fodder for animals, especially camels, as a particular case.

The camel is fond of this shrub's leaves and fruits, which have rich nutrients. But the greedy have cut this tree down for making traditional toothbrush, or miswak as it is referred to locally. It is even being exported, the locals lament.

Earlier, some local people used to collect the fruit of the jaar and sell it in the nearby towns, but in the past few years they started receiving orders for miswak on a mass level, which resulted in illegal logging.

Environmentalists fear this has also reduced the already thin forest cover and left the area more vulnerable to sea storms, cyclones, tsunamis, etc.

Sindh Agriculture University Tandojam Vice Chancellor Dr Mujeebuddin Memon Sehrai said the university is sending teams of experts to the affected areas for rescue, treatment, consultation, prevention, awareness and meetings about the diseases with camel herders.

However, the provincial Sindh government is yet to realise the situation to save this useful animal. The herders in the coastal areas of Sindh believe this viral infection killed several precious animals in 2016 as well, but the government as always could not take any steps to identify the causes of the deaths.

Researchers and farmers suggest establishing permanent accessible Camel Centres near the natural habitats to ensure availability of veterinary doctors. This will help the herders find treatment for their animals faster and also assist the experts in identifying the causes and symptoms for better diagnosis and treatment.

People of the desert areas around the world believe that the camel is the ship of the deserts. Wherever road is inaccessible, the people use camels for transport and travel hundreds of miles to reach their destinations. It is time now to save this ship of the desert from sinking.

[On top of environmental factors, the report mentions the possible involvement of 2 named disease agents in the described disease and mortality in Pakistani camels, namely MERS and PPR.

MERS-CoV, a zoonotic disease of which camels are suspected to be the reservoir or vector, has been reported mainly from the Arab peninsula. The clinical manifestation of the infection in camels is rather mild or subclinical. The disease has never been reported from Pakistan, but Iran attributed its diagnosed cases in imported camels to introduction from Pakistan (see 20141219.3039497). This warrants the performance of MERS-CoV surveillance in the Pakistani camel population.

Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a serious, highly infectious viral disease of goats and sheep. PPR is endemic in Pakistan, affecting goat and sheep. OIE's ad hoc group on camel disease regarded (2010) PPR as "a disease for which camelids are potential pathogen carriers" (group II diseases). According to information from Sudan, PPR may cause a serious disease in camels (see 20110106.0073 and Ref 1).

The dromedary camel diseases addressed by the OIE are the following:
Group I = known to produce significant diseases: camelpox, contagious ecthyma, papillomatosis, rabies, RVF [Rift Valley fever].
Group II = diseases for which camelids are potential pathogen carriers: African horse sickness, bluetongue, BVD [bovine viral diarrhea], PPR.
Group III = minor diseases: CCHF, herpesvirus infections (EHV, IBR), West Nile fever.

Further information on the health problems in Pakistani camels, in particular MERS-CoV and PPR, are anticipated.
