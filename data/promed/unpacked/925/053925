[We are grateful to Dr William Taylor for drawing our attention to
the recent spread of PPR into Tanzania, so far not reported by
ProMED-mail. The immediate OIE notification, dating back to 27 Jan
2009 and -- so far -- without follow-ups, is being posted with our
request for information on the current PPR situation in Tanzania. A
map accompanies the said notification.

The disease has, most likely, been introduced into Tanzania from
Kenya and/or Uganda.

In Kenya, PPR had reportedly been spreading since its 1st
introduction in August 2006 (see OIE notifications, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=4526>.
The disease was declared endemic in Kenya on 16 May 2007.

In Uganda, PPR had reportedly been spreading since its 1st
introduction in April 2007 (see OIE notifications, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5837>.
The disease was declared endemic in Uganda on 10 Aug 2007.

The only way to protect the animals, reduce losses and prevent spread
of PPR is the general mass vaccination of small ruminants. However,
no vaccination has, reportedly, been applied during 2007 in Uganda
and Kenya and no data, pertaining to 2008, is available.

An exemplary response to newly introduced PPR into an hitherto
uninfected country, by mass vaccinations, has been demonstrated in
Morocco in 2008 (see 20081203.3797).

For further background on PPR, including pictures, see FAO field
manual "Recognising PPR" at
<http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X1703E/X1703E00.HTM>.
