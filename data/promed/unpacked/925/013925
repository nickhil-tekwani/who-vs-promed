99/168 New data on quarantine pests [edited
--------------------------------------------
By browsing through the literature, the EPPO Secretariat has extracted the
following new data concerning quarantine pests.
New geographical record
------------------------------
KUWAIT: tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) has
been causing a devastating disease in field-grown tomatoes since 1993.
Major yield losses are observed. Review of Plant Pathology, 78(11), p 1043
Date: Wed, 19 Jan 2000 22:19:59 -0800(7877).
Detailed records
-------------------
BRAZIL: Bean golden mosaic begomovirus (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) occurs on
beans in the State of Bahia in Brazil. Bianchini, A. (1999) Resistance to
bean golden mosaic virus in bean genotypes. Plant Disease, 83(7), 615-620.
Citrus leprosis rhabdovirus (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) and its vector
_Brevipalpus phoenicis_ were found for the first time in the State of
Tocantins, Brazil. Review of Plant Pathology, 78(11), p 1053 (7947).
INDIA: Citrus ringspot virus (EU Annexes) is one of the major constraint of
citrus production in India. It is widely distributed in citrus-growing
areas in Punjab,
Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka with
incidence ranging from 10 to 100%. Review of Plant Pathology, 78(10), p 956
(7219).
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) is present on tomato in
Orissa, India. Review of Plant Pathology, 78(10), p 943 (7125).
New vector
--------------
USA/MEXICO: The glassy-winged sharpshooter, _Homalodisca coagulata_ is a
new vector of _Xylella fastidiosa_ (EPPO A1 quarantine pest). It occurs in
southern USA and northern Mexico. In Georgia, Florida and other southern
states it is considered as a major vector of _X. fastidiosa_ to peach and
grape. It has recently become established in California, and is perceived
as a very serious threat to vineyards and
almond orchards. It is also felt that it could play an important role in
the spread of oleander leaf scorch disease (also caused by _X.
fastidiosa_). Review of Plant Pathology, 78(10), p 902 (6825).
