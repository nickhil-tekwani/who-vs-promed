The Chemung County Health Department and [New York] State Health
Department are investigating a reported outbreak of Legionnaires'
disease that has sickened 3 people at the Edward Flannery Apartments
senior housing facility on South Main Street in Elmira, NY. All 3 are
hospitalized, but their conditions aren't available because of
privacy laws, said Melissa Klossner, Chemung County Heath Department
clinical coordinator for public health.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia that is caused by
_Legionella_, a bacterium found primarily in warm water environments.
Both the disease and the bacterium were discovered following an
outbreak traced to a 1976 American Legion convention in Philadelphia.
State law requires health care professionals to report any diagnosed
cases of Legionnaires' disease to local and state health authorities.

The bacterium is commonly found in the environment, Klossner said. It
is not spread person to person, but rather occurs when a susceptible
person inhales droplets containing the bacterium. "We're just
starting the investigation and we're taking samples in a lot of
different places in Elmira," Klossner said.

Besides living in Flannery, the 3 sickened people have other factors
in common such as age, health and activities, Klossner said. Robert
Page, Chemung County director of public health, said finding common
factors is major thrust of the investigation. "We're looking at the
building and potential sources and trying to identify if they can
find a cause or source of it," Page said. "We're also looking at
people who were ill, trying to find common factors. Everything is in
the very early stages. We just got started (Mon 11 Aug 2008). "We are
investigating anyone who in the past 30 days had any respiratory
illness," he said.

Each year, between 8000 and 18 000 people are hospitalized with
Legionnaires' disease in the United States, according to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The disease can be
very serious and can cause death in up to 30 percent of cases.
However, most cases can be treated successfully with antibiotics, and
healthy people usually recover from the infection, according to the CDC.

The disease poses the greatest threat to the elderly and people with
compromised immune systems, Page said. The health department issued
an informational release Tuesday [12 Aug 2008]. The illness has
symptoms that include high fever, chills and a cough. Medical
examination and testing are needed to determine whether someone has
pneumonia caused by the bacteria. The disease usually can be treated
with antibiotics.

[Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused
by _Legionella_, usually _Legionella pneumophila_. About 80-90
percent of cases are caused by _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1.
Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic illness also caused by _Legionella_.
Neither a clinical description of the 3 patients' illnesses, nor the
way their diagnosis was confirmed, is given in the news release.

Extracting from a prior ProMED posting (Legionnaires' disease -
Russia (Urals) 20070731.2455):
"Legionnaires' disease is acquired by inhalation by a susceptible
person of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Risk
factors include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking, diabetes,
chronic heart or lung disease, immunosuppression, and possibly
alcoholism. ... Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support
the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.
_Legionella_ are embedded in a bio-film that lines the inner walls of
the plumbing system's pipes and containers. Concentrations of the
organism can also be increased by disruption of this bio-film."

Infectious aerosols can be generated by a building's faulty air
conditioning systems, shower heads, misters, whirlpool spas, and
other such devices. We await further clinical and epidemiological data.

Elmira is the county seat of Chemung County, which is located north
of the Pennsylvania state line in the 'southern tier' of New York
State. A map of Chemung County can be found at
