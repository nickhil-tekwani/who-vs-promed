Dr. Carlos Ripoll, Head of Epidemiology from the Ministry of Health,
announced that because of 15 possible cases of typhoid fever in
Humahuaca community, it was considered that in Jujuy province there
is an outbreak of typhoid fever, since basic laboratory studies were
reported as positive; however, this is still to be confirmed, since
results for cultures are still in process and pending.
Material was placed in culture last Sat, 13 Jan 2007, so definitive
results are expected for this Wed, 17 Jan 2007.
Even though definitive results are not available yet, Jujuy Province
Health Ministry and Humahuaca Municipality will implement preventive
measures, and they are urging the community to take every precaution.
Work is being coordinated with Humahuaca Municipality, in order to
enforce actions and controls of foods sold in the streets, and they
are also trying to improve drinking water supplies and hygiene
conditions in public toilets and showers, so that the dissemination
of the disease is limited.
In this sense, Emergency Coordination from Jujuy Province sent 2
tankers in order to facilitate distribution and delivery of drinking
water, together with a large amount of bottled mineral water,
supplied by the Social Development Ministry in Jujuy Province.

[As appears to be the case here, outbreaks of typhoid fever are
primarily related to contaminated water.
Jujuy is a province of Argentina located in the extreme northwest of
the country, at the borders with Chile and Bolivia. The only
neighboring Argentine province is Salta to the east and south. Its
location on a map as well as further information can be found at:
