Abstract
--------
Control of many infectious diseases relies on the detection of
clinical cases and the isolation, removal, or treatment of cases and
their contacts.

The success of such "reactive" strategies is influenced by the
fraction of transmission occurring before signs appear. We performed
experimental studies of foot-and-mouth disease transmission in cattle
and estimated this fraction at less than half the value expected from
detecting virus in body fluids, the standard proxy measure of
infectiousness. This is because the infectious period is shorter (mean
1.7 days) than currently realized, and animals are not infectious
until, on average, 0.5 days after clinical signs appear. These results
imply that controversial preemptive control measures may be
unnecessary; instead, efforts should be directed at early detection of
infection and rapid intervention.

Foot-and-mouth disease detectable before it turns infectious,
scientists say
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Research suggests pre-emptive mass culling of cattle may not be
necessary

The mass culling of cattle and funeral pyres that blighted the
countryside during the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic may not be needed
if the disease comes back, according to scientists who have shown that
it is detectable in cattle up to 24 hours before they become
infectious.

This could provide a window to quarantine infected animals and stop
the spread of the disease to neighbouring farms. The researchers also
found that cattle infected with the foot-and-mouth virus remained
infectious for an average of only 1.7 days, much less than previously
thought.

At least 6 million animals were culled during the 2001 outbreak, most
of them sheep. The Royal Society estimated
[http://royalsociety.org/Royal-Society-Inquiry-commissioned-by-the-UK-Government-into-Infectious-Diseases-in-Livestock/]
losses of about GBP 3.1 billion [about USD 2.1 billion] to agriculture
and the food chain, and about GBP 2.5 billion [about USD 4 billion]
was spent by the government in compensation for slaughtered animals
and payments for disposal and cleaning up. There were only 2030
confirmed infections, but millions more animals were culled -- killed
preemptively because they lived near infected farms. Had government
advisers understood more about the disease, it might have been
possible to control it without mass culling.

"The reason those animals were culled was because they may already
have been infected by the time we knew they were at risk," said Mark
Woolhouse of the Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution
[http://ciie.bio.ed.ac.uk/centre] at the University of Edinburgh.
"What this suggests is a window where we can detect animals before
that has happened so there's no need, in that case, for the preemptive
culling."

Woolhouse added: "The new research shows there is this short window,
a day or 2, where we can tell a cow is infected with foot-and-mouth
disease but the animal is not yet infectious to other cows -- even
under ideal conditions it doesn't transmit the virus. If we could
detect and remove animals in that window of opportunity, then they
won't have the chance to infect to infect other animals."

The new research is published in the journal Science
[http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1199884; subscription required].
For the study, a team led by Bryan Charleston
[http://www.jenner.ac.uk/invest_biog_b_charleston.html] of the
Institute for Animal Health in Pirbright
[http://www.iah.ac.uk/about/lab_p.shtml] infected cows with
foot-and-mouth disease in the laboratory and then watched how the
virus spread to uninfected cows.

The time from infection to the onset of clinical signs was
approximately 4 days. The animals became infectious at around the same
time and stayed that way for, on average, 1.7 days. Until now,
scientists had thought that cattle became infectious up to 4 days
before they showed clinical signs, and then remained infectious for up
to 4 to 8 days afterwards.

But Charleston also found there was a point where virus detection was
possible before the animals became infectious. "After an animal
becomes infected, you can start to detect virus in blood and in nasal
samples approximately 2 to 3 days later, that's before they show
clinical signs and before they are able to transmit the virus," he
said. The government's chief vet, Nigel Gibbens, said: "While these
types of tests aren't currently practical for use on the ground during
an outbreak, we are continuing to fund their development and are
working with the Institute of Animal Health so the best possible tests
and equipment is available. Quick reporting of suspect cases of the
disease by farmers and veterinarians and selective culling of animals,
with vaccination where that can make an effective contribution to
control, remain the best way of stopping this disease."

The 24-hour window allows farmers and scientists to isolate and cull
the infected herd before they can spread the infection to neighbouring
herds. "It's not the animals that are infected that are saved, it's
the ones they might have put at risk, all the animals in the next-door
farms," said Woolhouse.

Joe Brownlie [http://www.rvc.ac.uk/Staff/jbrownlie.cfm], emeritus
professor of veterinary pathology at the Royal Veterinary College,
said the preemptive culling policy in 2001 was "quite draconian" and
the new research would prevent the death of large numbers of animals
in future. "Many of us have had difficult times justifying and living
with what happened. This is exciting and very important science."

A spokesperson for the National Farmers Union described the study as
an "important development". "The outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease
in 2001 and 2007 show just how devastating this disease is for farm
businesses and the wider rural economy.

"It's clear that the researchers are some way from developing a
reliable on-farm test and the protocols that may be needed in its
application. Nevertheless, this is a valuable development that could
help control FMDV spread during future outbreaks."

Translating the research into a practical technology for the field
will take some time. "This we can do in the laboratory, we can detect
infections before the animals are infectious -- it is going to be a
significant challenge to do that in the field during an epidemic,"
said Woolhouse. "As a result of the work we're reporting today, we
know that such an approach could be much more effective than we've
realised before, so this is definitely an avenue we should be
pursuing."

Apart from the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic, a smaller outbreak of
the disease in 2007 was localised to a farm near Guildford, when 60
animals tested positive.

[re: FMD detectable before it turns infectious, scientists say]
---------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists -- and British veterinary authorities involved in
controlling the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic -- have known since early
2001 that a real time PCR test can detect cattle, swine, and sheep
infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus 24 to 96 hours before they
show any clinical signs of disease and before foot-and-mouth disease
virus can be isolated from the animals by cell culture ("Use of a
portable real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
assay for rapid detection of foot and mouth disease virus," Callahan
JD et al, J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2002; 220(11): 1636-42, 2002; [abstract
available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12051502]). We have
also known for over a decade that this real time PCR test can be
performed at the site of the potential foot-and-mouth outbreak using
automated PCR analyzers that do not require a laboratory and that
scientific experts located anywhere in the world can follow the PCR
process as it is actually being performed at the site of the outbreak
by logging onto the PCR device via the internet. In recent years
advances in device automation have further simplified the PCR test
procedure such that the technical skill required to perform a state of
the art foot-and-mouth PCR test is far less than that required to bake
a loaf of bread in a kitchen bread machine.

And, of course, no one could argue with the statement that control
measures for foot-and-mouth disease should be properly validated. In
this respect, Dr Woolhouse and his colleagues deserve our
congratulations. He is quoted by Reuters as stating that, "This study
shows that what we thought we knew about foot-and-mouth disease is not
entirely true." What more fitting statement could be the epitaph for
the non-validated mathematical models that were the basis for the
slaughter of millions of uninfected animals and economic hardship for
hundreds of thousands in the countryside in 2001? It has the stark and
direct simplicity of a haiku and should be the motto on the DEFRA T
shirts.

Its quiet yet powerful understatement also brings to mind the words
of Japanese Emperor Hirohito in 1945 -- a sentiment equally applicable
to foot-and-mouth in Britain in 2001 -- "The war situation has
developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage."

[Roger makes an excellent point. Any such tests must be run cow-side.
There is no time for the delays inherent in sending off samples to a
distant laboratory. Just think a minute. There are, say, 10 herds
downwind of a known infected/affected herd. Each has, say 100 cows
plus heifers and calves. At each farm the animals have to be collected
up, bled, released, and samples run. Unless you have 10 test teams, it
is going to be 2-3 days before they have all been run. But some will
have developed lesions by then. And the stress of testing will
probably shorten the incubation period. This testing will tie up a
significant number of the available personnel. Secondly what is the
sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of this
testing in case DEFRA, or any other authority, is challenged in court.
Any testing has to be fast and efficient. As Roger indicates we are
getting there. Remember a basic rule: What works in a laboratory
setting seldom works as well in the field.

Way back when, Rolly Tinline and I published a paper on the serial
interval (between outbreaks) using the 1967-68 FMD epidemic data. We
showed that the serial interval between outbreaks is essentially 2
incubation periods. That is, one animal gets infected in the target
herd, and it then has to infect her herd mates before enough virus is
being produced to make that onward downwind trip. See: Hugh-Jones, ME
and RR Tinline 1976: Studies on the 1967-68 foot-and-mouth disease
epidemic: incubation period and herd serial interval. J Hyg (Lond).
1976; 77(2): 141-53 (available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129867/). So if you can
get ahead of the disease, time is on your side.

On the other hand there is a ground shift going on in Europe to
follow the South American lead and use vaccination, not slaughter, to
control this disease. - Mod.MHJ]
