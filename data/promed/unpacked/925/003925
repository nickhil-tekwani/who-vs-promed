Horse owners are urged to consider vaccinating their horses against
strangles after several cases of the disease have been diagnosed in
North Queensland.

Strangles is a highly contagious bacterial infection in horses.

Biosecurity Queensland veterinary officer Charlotte Williamson said
strangles could cause fever, loss of appetite, and a yellow-green
nasal discharge, which leads to abscesses in the lymph nodes of the
throat. "The abscesses are hot and painful and eventually burst and
leak pus," she said. "Enlarged lymph nodes may cause respiratory
distress and difficulty in swallowing. Occasionally, infection can
spread to other areas of the horse's body and form abscesses and
cause chronic illness and weight loss."

Dr Williamson said the disease mainly occurs in young horses less
than 5 years of age. "But horses of any age are susceptible if
there's no prior immunity," she said.

"The best form of protection is an annual vaccination, which can be
sourced through your local veterinarian."

Diseases such as strangles highlight the importance of good
biosecurity measures, including:
- keeping horse gear and equipment clean and disinfecting equipment between use
- washing hands before and after handling different horses
- monitoring visitor movements on your property and avoiding visitor
contact with your horses unless they have clean hands, clothing, and boots
- keeping records of horse movements on and off your property
- quarantining new horses to your property for at least 2 weeks
before introducing with others
- isolating sick horses from other horses on your property
- feeding and tending to sick horses after dealing with other horses.

Horse property owners are advised all Queensland properties with one
or more horses are required to have a property identification code (PIC).

[Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of _Equidae_
characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper
respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_,
is highly host-adapted and generally produces clinical disease only
in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive,
capsulated-hemolytic Lancefield group C streptococcus, which is an
obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious, and produces high morbidity and
low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via
fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals
are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and
initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease.
Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on
temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme
heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid
secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the
organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn
facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated
for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days, and the 1st sign of
infection is fever (103-106 deg F [39.4-41.1 deg C]). Within 24-48
hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs
typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal
discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with
retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty
swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal
pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with
residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the
disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever.
Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by
abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the
abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and
dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to
facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature
abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed
with dilute (3-5 percent) povidone-iodine solution for several days
until discharge ceases. NSAID [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]
can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve
appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that
initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide
temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression but ultimately
prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses.
Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia,
prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia [loss of
appetite]. Administration of penicillin during the early stage of
infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort
abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment
is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses
highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If
antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000
IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.

The affected horses are quite uncomfortable. Sharing of halters and
brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread
the disease to other horses. Those affiliated with the government
veterinary office are quite conscious of biosecurity and are able to
assist the track veterinarian and the owners with proper methods to
avoid spreading the disease.
