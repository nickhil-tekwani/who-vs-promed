Officials fighting the second severe wave of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
in Northumberland expanded the so-called red box zone into a vast tract of
6100 square miles across the Northeast, Cumbria, Yorkshire, and Lancashire.
This bans animal movements within this zone.
The controlled area was first established around Thirsk in North Yorkshire
in May, after the disease engulfed the Yorkshire Dales. The new enlarged
area includes a smaller blue box biosecurity zone in Northumberland, where
restrictions are marginally stricter.
In the red zone, livestock may be moved in the interests of welfare, but
all existing animal movement licenses will be rescinded and none will be
reissued for at least 21 days. The new restrictions were announced on the
day 2 fresh cases of the disease were confirmed in Northumberland's blue
box: one at Bolts Hope, near the isolated village of Blanchland, another at
Low Ardley, near Hexham. A total of 2200 sheep and 300 cattle from the
farms will be slaughtered and sent for rendering.
The latest cases take Northumberland's total in the past 2 weeks to 19. A
third outbreak was detected at Kirkby Stephen in Cumbria, bringing the
national total of cases to 2004.
The results of blood tests conducted on sheep kept in unfenced areas of the
fells above Allendale, where the latest outbreak started, were expected by
the weekend. These may explain why the disease has returned to
Northumberland, which had remained free of it for several months.

[The UK continues its efforts to destroy the disease. However, for whatever
reason, they have yet to be able to destroy infected animals within 24
hours of diagnosis. This appears to be critical to eliminating the disease.
This continued tailing of the disease, and perhaps a new upswing as the
country approaches winter, does not indicate that there is control of the
disease. ­ Mod.TG
