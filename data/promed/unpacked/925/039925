FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, BOVINE - ARGENTINA (03)

The European Commission is almost certain to impose a ban of imports
of beef from Argentina, following confirmation of an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease in the province of San Luis del Palmar
Corrientes, close to the borders with Paraguay and Brazil.
About 70 cattle were found to have clinical symptoms, but all 3500
head on the affected estancia have now been slaughtered. The
authorities in Buenos Aires are considering further measures,
including the culling of livestock on contiguous properties.
The news comes as a huge blow to the Argentine beef industry, which
is one of the largest in the world with exports last year worth GBP
920 million [USD 1.6 billion]. FMD is not new to Argentina, with
serious outbreaks in 2001 and 2003, both of which resulted in costly
suspensions of exports. However, in 2005 the country was officially
recognized as being free from the disease. All cattle are supposed to
be routinely vaccinated twice yearly, but exports to the US and
Canada are still banned.
In early October 2005 there was a major outbreak of FMD in 3
provinces in Brazil, which led to a ban on imports to many regions,
including the EU, Russia and North America. Those bans remain in
place. Brazil follows a vaccination program similar to Argentina's,
but the suspicion remains that the disease entered the country as a
result of illegal imports of live cattle from Paraguay, where prices
are appreciably lower. It is possible that Paraguay may be the source
of the outbreak in Argentina.
Helene Judge, of the Meat and Livestock Commission's office in
Brussels, said: "It seems likely that a ban will be imposed on
imports from the infected province and the 6 neighboring regions
slaughtered after 4 Feb 2006."
A spokesman for Coninagro, Argentina's equivalent to the NFU, said:
"Argentina's livestock production will be gravely affected by the
closure of international markets that were opened with so much effort."
Beef prices, which rose by 30 per cent in Argentina during 2005, are
likely to fall sharply, and the effect on the economy will be severe.
The value of beef exports has doubled over the past 5 years and has
been a significant contributor to total Argentine exports of GBP 23
billion [USD 40 billion].
Chile, the 3rd largest market for Argentine beef, is to ban all
imports for at least 6 months. Russia, the destination for 20 per
cent of all exports, is also likely following the EU's stance.
Within the EU, Germany is the biggest importer. Figures from the EU
agency Intrastat and Customs & Excise reveal that in the first 11
months of 2005 the UK imported 8419 tonnes of beef from Argentina --
an increase of 800 tonnes on the previous year. In addition, 5980
tonnes of corned beef entered the UK.
A prolonged ban on imports from Argentina and Brazil would certainly
have a major impact on the EU supply situation, where the forecast is
that during 2006 there will be a deficit of more than 400 000 tonnes
between domestic production and consumer demand.
With memories still vivid of the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK, which
was the biggest the world has seen, farmers will have some sympathy
for their colleagues in South America. However, the lifting of the
ban on exports from the UK, which has been in place for almost 10
years, probable in late spring, will undoubtedly bring opportunities
on mainland Europe, especially for cow-beef destined for manufacturing.

[Predictably, the bans will go into place. Any importing country is
interested in protecting itself from this disease.
However, both Brazil and Argentina have blamed Paraguay for the
outbreak, but Paraguay has yet to report any cases. Paraguay has not
reported any FMD cases in 3 years. Certainly, this would lead one to
suspect that Paraguay's record of reporting this disease is not perfect.
It is outstanding that Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay have entered
into an agreement to evaluate the sanitary measures in place on farms
within 25 km of the border. Despite this agreement, Paraguay has not
acknowledged a case of FMD. - Mod.TG]
