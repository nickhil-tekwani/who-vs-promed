A Brooke Army Medical Center staff member was confirmed to have [legionellosis] on [Tue 6 Feb 2018], BAMC spokesman Robert Whetstone said [Wed 7 Feb 2018].

The staff member works in Building 15 and follows 2 previous cases reported in August [2017]. Because there were 2 or more cases of Legionnaires' disease reported at the same facility within 365 days, it was considered an outbreak, per the Emerging and Acute Infectious Disease Guidelines, Whetstone said in a statement.

"The health and safety of our patients and staff is our top priority, and we are working diligently with local and regional public health officials to investigate this matter," Whetstone said. "We are not currently aware of any patients or clients who have moved through Building number 15 who are exhibiting symptoms." Whetstone said testing is ongoing to determine if the building is the source of the bacteria. He said BAMC officials are relocating staff members who work in that building to another location.

[ProMED-mail previously posted a report that Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) in San Antonio, Texas confirmed Legionnaires' disease in 2 staff members and a 3rd had testing pending during the week of 31 Jul 2017 and 200 employees working in the building next to the military hospital at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio were moved out of their workspace at that time (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (13): (TX) military medical center Archive Number: 20170813.5246605). There was no indication in that report of which building was evacuated and there was no follow-up report on results of the pending tests in the 3rd person.

The report above says that one additional staff member was confirmed to have legionnaires' disease on [Tue 6 Feb 2018]. Presumably this staff member who works in Building 15 is not the 3rd person with tests pending in the August 2017 report. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources to clarify the situation.

BAMC located at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) - Fort Sam Houston, is the United States Army's largest and busiest medical center; it includes the Army's largest in-patient hospital, the San Antonio Military Medical Center, a 425-bed facility, expandable to 653 beds in the event of disaster (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Army_Medical_Center#SAMMC_2). JBSA is located in the city of San Antonio. The city, located in the south-central portion of the U.S. state of Texas, is the state's 2nd-most populous city, with a population of almost 1.5 million residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio#Geography). A map of Texas showing the location of BAMC can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Antonio+Military+Medical+Center
