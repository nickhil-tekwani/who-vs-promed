According to a spokesperson for the Johnson County, IA, Health Department,
they have recorded 94 cases of pertussis since August 1, 1997. Of those 94
cases, 68 met the CDC definition based upon laboratory and/or
epidemiological data, 19 were "possible" and 7 were "suspect". "About 20
others" are "suspect, and waiting for the cough to continue for a full 2
weeks". The Health Department does not do typing of the cultures (4 out of
those 68 were cultured).
The spokesperson said they have had fewer cases this week than in previous
weeks, but she attributes it to the end of the semester and holiday
preparation activities which distract people from obtaining health care in
a timely fashion. Earlier reports in local newspapers have included
speculations that there may be many additional cases on the University
campus among students who have not sought health care. Normally,
approximately 5 cases of pertussis are seen per year, and these typically
occur among public school children. Local news media have also indicated
that officials from the CDC have been investigating this ongoing outbreak.

An employee of the University Hospital has indicated that the Emergency
Department is now routinely screening any patient who presents with a cough
[presumably by bacteriological culture procedures - Mod.ES.

[The case definition for pertussis used by most health departments in
reporting cases to the CDC is as follows. "A case of pertussis was defined
as either onset of a cough illness of any duration with isolation of
_Bordetella pertussis_ from a clinical
specimen or onset of an acute cough illness lasting greater than or equal
to 14 days plus at least one pertussis-associated symptom (i.e., paroxysms
of cough, inspiratory "whoop," or posttussive vomiting) with no other
apparent cause." Reference:
