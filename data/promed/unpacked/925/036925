BLUETONGUE, DOMESTIC RUMINANTS - SPAIN (04)

The update of 1 Dec 2004 reports an accumulated total of 239 premises
affected by Blue Tongue Virus [BTV] in cattle, sheep and goats. This
represents an increase of 38 infected premises since the last published
figures on 25 Nov 2004 [see ProMED-mail posting 20041126.3158].
Newly reported outbreaks by region:
Andalucia 32 (total 193)
Extremadura 3 (total 41)
Ceuta 2 (total 4)
In Extremadura, 2 of the new foci have been confirmed in 2 separate areas,
each situated around 150 km from the 1st cases detected on the east-central
area of this region. One focus, on the west (Olivenza), is situated a few
km from the Portuguese border, not far from the affected premises detected
in Portugal on 23 Nov 2004. The other outbreak (Jaraiz de la Vera) is the
northernmost detection of BT Virus to date (44 degrees north).
Further south in Andalucia, the main provinces affected are almost the
entire province of Cadiz, a good portion of the Malaga province and a
narrow strip on southeast Huelva near Cadiz. [Another outbreak] has been
detected in Aroche, a municipality situated on the mountainous area that
separates Andalucia from Extremadura, approximately 100 km equidistant from
the main affected areas in both regions.

Based on studies made on _C. sonorensis_, a species from North America, the
developmental threshold temperature for a laboratory colony is 10.5 degrees

No similar data have been found by this correspondent on midges of the
Iberian peninsula.

[MAPA's website includes the entire list of all premises found infected
with BTV in Spain since the 1st case (26 Oct 2004). The species reportedly
found infected are as follows:
Ovines only - 127.
Bovines only - 19.
Caprines only - 9.
Ovines and caprines - 45.
Bovines and ovines - 14.
Bovines and caprines - 10.
Bovines, ovines and caprines - 13.
Wildlife (excluding wild boars) - 1.
From the reports to the OIE and from MAPA's web-site, it is not clear
whether bovines, caprines and the single reported wild animal (what
species?!) were found to demonstrate clinical symptoms or were included in
the list solely on the basis of serological findings. Data pertaining to
this subject, as well as to observations on the susceptibility of different
sheep breeds, will be of particular interest.
With decreasing temperatures, this outbreak is expected to subside within
several weeks. Overwintering of the BT4 virus in Spain (and Portugal),
and/or the prospects of renewed introduction of infected culicoides next
year, remain crucial questions. - Mod.AS]
