Usutu virus in 4 dead blackbirds from the Mannheim area confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Usutu virus was confirmed for the 1st time in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 4
dead blackbirds from the city of Mannheim and from Dossenheim in the
Rhein-Neckar-Kreis," the department of Animal Health Ministry
responsible for Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection and the Ministry
of Labour and Social Order, Family, Women and Senior citizens
confirmed on Thursday (5 Sep 2011) in Stuttgart. The pathogen was
detected by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute on the island of Riems in
4 of the Baden-Wuerttemberg samples. Only last year [2010] the
pathogen was found for the 1st time in mosquitoes in the Rhine-Neckar
region.

"As the virus is present in the environment the public should continue
to be careful. Dead birds should be -- as usual -- not be touched with
bare hands. However, there is no reason for concern, because in
Europe, so far only sporadic cases have been detected in humans. In
addition, the disease is usually mild, characterized by fever and skin
lesions," said the Ministry of Social Affairs.

The Usutu virus (USUV) is a tropical virus that is transmitted by
mosquitoes and causes primarily disease and death among blackbirds and
other wild birds. The initial appearance in Austria in 2001 caused a
large bird die off. Until then, the virus had been detected only in
Africa. From Austria it is known that wild birds, after a certain
time, develop immunity against the virus. The pathogen was detected
on Wednesday (14 Sep 2011) in a dead blackbird from the Hessian
Birkenau.

Dead wild birds can be sent to the following diagnostic laboratories
in the country: Chemical and Veterinary Investigation Office in
Stuttgart.

[USUV 1st detection outside Africa took place in Vienna, Austria, in
2001, causing deaths in blackbirds (_Turdus merula_) and great gray
owls (_Strix nebulosa_).

In 2002, USUV was still circulating in Austria, demonstrating that
USUV has managed to overwinter in a local bird-mosquito cycle in
central Europe.

More recently, USUV-specific RNA or antigen was also detected in birds
or mosquitoes in Hungary, Switzerland, Italy and Spain. In the summer
of 2009, USUV-related illness were reported in 2 immunocompromised
patients in Italy. Antibodies were detected in UK in wild birds in
2002.

Information from other European countries is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
