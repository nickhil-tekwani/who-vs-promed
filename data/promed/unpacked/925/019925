A large number of mithuns have been affected by FMD (foot and mouth disease) in various parts of Arunachal Pradesh, and a few have died, said official sources on Monday [13 Apr 2021].

Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Department Deputy director Dr Taba Heli, a top mithun expert in North Eastern region, reported that the disease has taken a severe form in the entire Siang belt, particularly in East Siang, West Siang, and Upper Siang districts [map at https://tinyurl.com/tft28s3c].

Though the number of deaths is yet to be known, the disease has spread in scattered areas of Papum Pare district also. The Department has allocated district funds for procurement of medicines to take all possible steps to contain the disease, he said. Mithun deaths have been reported also from Itanagar and Jullang area.

Pointing out that mithuns are the pride of indigenous people in the state, Nyishi Elite Society president Bengia Tolum has urged the department to take all possible steps to save them.

[Mithun, also known as "Cattle of Mountain," is a bovine species of the northeastern hill region of India. This massive bovine is reared under free-range conditions in the hill forests at an altitude of 1000 to 3000 meters above mean sea level.

It is important to obtain information on the serotype and genotype of the virus strain involved, as well as of the vaccination history of the affected animals.

FMD is a disease of cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, buffalo, small ruminants, and swine. It is the most contagious disease of mammal animals, having a great potential for causing severe economic loss in susceptible animals. Mortality, generally, is up to 2-3% but may be significantly higher in young stock.

The disease is regarded as endemic in India; effective mass vaccination, applying potent vaccines -- which include matching vaccine strains -- is essential for its control. Continued circulation of the virus may affect India's exports, such as frozen buffalo meat, of which India is the largest producer and exporter, globally. An example of the said export issue is to be found at https://agriculture.govmu.org/Documents/Report/foot%20and%20mouth%20disease.pdf. - Mod.AS
