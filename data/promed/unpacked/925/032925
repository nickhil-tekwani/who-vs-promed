LEPTOSPIRORIS 2004 - RUSSIA: DISCUSSION

[The combination of] flooding and rodent urine are not always the main
origin of leptospirosis. In Uruguay (in general, in temperate regions, see
review by Levett, Clin Microbiol Rev. 14: 296, 2001 and Faine, S. et al:
Leptospira and Leptospirosis 2nd. Ed. MediSci. Melbourne, Australia 1999),
domestic animals or livestock may be the usual source of infection.
In 2002 and 2003, we have had an incidence of at least 7 confirmed
cases/100 000 persons. They were mainly male rural workers, 20-40 years
old, associated with bovine raising and dairy production. These were
confirmed cases with laboratory diagnosis, but we know that most infections
are benign and remain undiagnosed, so lethality is difficult to calculate.
[With reference to ProMED-mail posting 20050119.0178, referenced below, on
leptospirosis in the Krasnodar administration region of Russia, ] the 30
percent case-fatality rate in this Russian region may reflect severe cases
that required medical attention and diagnosis. It may be important to
report the type of weather, economic activity, population, etc, in this
zone of Russia, to help explain the situation.
