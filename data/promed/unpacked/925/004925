FEVER & BIRDWATCHING - SEYCHELLES, TANZANIA (6)
================================================
Several species of wild birds in Africa are the reservoir hosts
for two arboviruses: Sindbis (an alphavirus) and West Nile (a
flavivirus).
These are prevalent in Southern and Central Africa and the vector
is the Culex mosquito (various species but C. univittatus and
C.naevei are 2 in southern Africa). The geographic distribution of
both is similar. Both usually cause a febrile illness with or
without rash. They both can, less commonly, cause encephalitis.
Sindbis usually causes the moresevere clinical picture.
The incubation period for most arboviruses is a few days but in
Sindbis it is unknown. The illness usually lasts 3-10 days but can
be longer. The rash in Sindbis is distinct: mainly trunk, limbs,
palms and soles and is maculopapular. Papules are about 3mm in
diameter and have a broad areolar of pallor. They can become
vesicular with friction and may then be slightly haemorrhagic.
Viraemia is usually low but culture would have been possible during
the initial phase of illness. Serology is available for both and is
reliable.

[(1) All cases of those infections do not get a rash.
(2)My earlier comment concentrated on the possible results of close
contact with seabirds in breeding colonies. No close contact was
mentioned with land birds in Africa, but in that case, besides Sindbis
& West Nile viruses, there is also Quaranfil virus, recorded from cattle
egrets & pigeons & their ticks in Africa (Egypt, S.Africa & Nigeria),
M'Poko, Zingilamo, Yaounde, Uganda S, Ingwavuma, Batama, Arumowot,
Bobaya, Abadina, Gomoka, Sandjimba, Kolongo, Nasoule, Mossuril, Garba,
Ouango, Landjia, Bimbo (sic) and Bangoran, to name just a few bird-
associated viruses from Africa crying out to be associated with human
cases! - Jack Woodall, Moderator]
