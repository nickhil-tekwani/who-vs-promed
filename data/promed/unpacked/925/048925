The company Nestle said on Tuesday [22 Nov 2005] that it had recalled
more than 2 million liters of baby milk found to be contaminated with
the chemical substance isopropylthioxanthone (ITX) from Italy, Spain,
France and Portugal.
Most of the milk is in Italy, where about 30 million liters were
seized after tests showed some of it had been tainted by ITX from
printing ink on the packaging.

[ITX or isoproprylthioxanthone is
2-(1-methylethyl)-9H-Thioxanthen-9-one. It is a mixture of
2-Isopropylthioxanthen-9-one and 4-Isopropylthioxanthen-9-one. This
is a 2-mercaptobenzoic acid derivation.
The xanthene portion of this molecule has various uses. It's used as
a fungicide and is the base structure for chromophores which are part
of lumencent dyes. As a class, the Xanthene dyes include fluorenes,
pyronins, succineins, sacchareins, rosamines, rhodamines, rhodols and
fluorones. As xanthone is a xanthene ketone, it is used as an ovicide
and as a larvicide.
However, one of its most common uses is in inks related to the food
and food packaging industry. ITX is an important photoinitiator,
widely used in UV curable inks for food packaging applications. There
are no known by-products following UV curing.
There is very little information available on the toxic issues of
ITX. There was a 1999 observational case involving 6 workers who were
exposed to ITX who suffered skin rashes on the head and neck
following exposure to the sun. However, other circumstances
surrounding this case were not reported. These other circumstances
included such things as prolonged exposure to the sun or to sun
screens. Regardless of the outcome of the 1999 observation, the
industry has provided little information regarding the toxic effects
of exposure to ITX.
Babies are the most likely consumers of higher quantities of baby
milk (a product probably different in some ways than regular milk).
Since a baby's detoxification system may not be developed, there may
be later consequences to the consumption of this contaminated product
that are not well defined. - Mod.TG]
