The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is investigating 2 cases of Legionnaires' disease in patients possibly exposed at Mercy Hospital & Medical Center in Chicago, and a report of _Legionella_ in the facility's water system. The investigation is currently limited to this facility; the general public is not at risk.

IDPH, along with the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), were onsite Thursday [25 Apr 2019] to evaluate the reported presence of _Legionella_ in the hospital's water system and collect environmental samples for laboratory testing. Both agencies continue to collect information and investigate. IDPH has provided the facility with information to give to patients and families about _Legionella_. Additionally, the facility is conducting active surveillance to identify other potential cases and to ensure appropriate testing and clinical management.

Mercy Hospital & Medical Center is working with a water management team, IDPH and CDPH to strengthen its water management practices. The facility has already put protective measures in place like flushing the water system, altering or replacing water fixtures, and placing filters on sinks.

Legionnaires' disease is a respiratory infection caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. These bacteria can also cause a milder illness called Pontiac fever. The signs and symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, pneumonia, and sometimes diarrhea and abdominal pain. Pontiac fever has similar symptoms but does not progress to pneumonia. Antibiotics are highly effective against _Legionella_ bacteria.

_Legionella_ bacteria are commonly found in the environment (rivers, lakes, streams). It is a waterborne disease, usually spread by man-made water supplies that aerosolize water, such as showers, hot water tanks, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains. People can get Legionnaires' disease when they breathe in a mist containing the bacteria. People may also be exposed to _Legionella_ bacteria from water that "goes down the wrong pipe" (aspiration). In general, the bacteria are not spread from one person to another.

People who are at most risk of developing Legionnaires' disease are those who are older, smokers/former smokers, have a weakened immune system, and those who have other underlying or chronic health conditions.

[_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc1505356. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume sterile water only until _Legionella_ becomes undetectable by culture of the hospital water.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 2 cases of legionnaires' disease at Mercy Hospital in Chicago will help to establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Mercy Hospital and Medical Center is a 292-bed general medical and surgical Catholic teaching hospital in Chicago, Illinois with a Level 2 Trauma Center (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_Hospital_and_Medical_Center). - Mod.ML
