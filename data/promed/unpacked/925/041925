Commissioner of Agriculture Gus R. Douglass is warning West Virginia
sheep and cattle farmers to be on the lookout for signs of epizootic
hemorrhagic disease (EHD), which has been observed in cattle in Ohio
and West Virginia, although confirmatory testing is not yet complete.
It can also be contracted by sheep and has been observed in deer in
numerous states. However, the disease is spread by the bite of
blood-feeding midges (a gnat-like fly) not by animal-to-animal
transmission. Because of the similarity of signs, EHD is sometimes
mistaken for or misidentified as the more serious bluetongue,
although sheep are rarely symptomatic with exposure to the EHD virus
as they are with bluetongue.
Signs of the disease include hemorrhage and ulcers in the mouth,
tongue hanging out constantly, excessive salivation, cloudy nasal
discharge, lameness and poor appetite. Coupled with environmental
stress, EHD is thought capable of causing spontaneous abortion of
calves and death of mature cattle.
"There is no direct treatment for EHD, and we are advising farmers to
provide supportive therapy for sick animals and to step up insect
control around their herds," said Commissioner Douglass. "This has
been a particularly bad year, but the 1st hard frost should kill off
the gnats and bring an end to this outbreak."
Supportive therapies include extra food and water, medication and
intravenous fluids. Farmers are encouraged to consult their local
veterinarians for assistance in maintaining sick animals.
Anyone with sick cattle or sheep is asked to report it to the West
Virginia Department of Agriculture's (WVDA) Animal Health Division at
304-558-2214. Animal Health staff can also answer questions about
sampling and testing for EHD.

report on which type of EHD has spilled over into cattle in several
states, a not unexpected development. - Mod.TG]
