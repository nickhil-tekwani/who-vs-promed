Scientists have linked an outbreak of a flesh-eating bacterium [this is not
the "flesh-eating disease" also known as necrotizing fasciitis - Mod.LL] to
mosquitoes in Point Lonsdale.
Since it was detected in 2004, 18 Victorians, including football legend
David Parkin, have been infected with _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, also called
Bairnsdale ulcer. The disease erodes skin and fat and can cause serious
scarring. State Government-funded research, led by Associate Professor Paul
Johnson of Austin Health, found the bacteria in mosquitoes from around
Point Lonsdale.
Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Robert Hall, warned people in Point
Lonsdale to use insect repellent. "Residents and visitors to the Point
Lonsdale area should be aware that a small risk of infection remains," he said.
"If diagnosed and treated early, there is a high cure rate. If left
untreated, the ulcer can continue to enlarge, sometimes requiring extensive
removal and skin grafts. Although rare, Bairnsdale ulcer is a serious
condition if not diagnosed and treated early."

Dr. Paul Johnson, Infectious Diseases Professor: I personally don't use the
word flesh-eating bug.
Dr. John Carnie, Victoria Deputy Chief Health Officer: We try to avoid
terms like flesh-eating bug.
Reporter Mick Bunworth: Understandably, perhaps, health officials are wary
of such tabloid terms, but "eat flesh" is exactly what _Mycobacterium
ulcerans_, or Bairnsdale ulcer, does if left untreated. Last Jul 2004, the
7:30 Report brought you the story of the Victorian seaside town of Point
Lonsdale, where some residents had contracted Bairnsdale ulcer, so named
after the town with the first recorded outbreak, in 1948. Nationally, 35
people were diagnosed with the ulcer in 2004, but more than half of those
had visited or lived in Point Lonsdale, and the surrounding Bellarine
Peninsula, southwest of Melbourne.
Dr. Johnson: Transmission of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ occurs relatively
commonly in Far North Queensland in a very small area, north of
Mossman. There was a case in 2005 in Darwin and another case in 2004.
There have been a couple of cases in Rockhampton and along the tropical
north of Queensland. But much less common at the moment than we're seeing
down here in Victoria. For inexplicable reasons, it's not showing up in New
South Wales or South Australia, although things could change.
Mr. Bunworth: Dr Paul Johnson is with Austin Health's infectious diseases
department in Melbourne. He's a world-renowned authority on _Mycobacterium
ulcerans_ and helped to develop a diagnostic test. Dr Johnson has also
written a manual for those working with the disease in Africa, where it's
known as Buruli ulcer and can cripple sufferers if left untreated. In an
effort to pin down the cause of the disease, Dr Johnson's research team is
monitoring the Bellarine Peninsula's mosquito population. He believes they
may just have made a key discovery.
Dr. Johnson: This is really the 1st time that adult mosquitoes have been
shown to have any trace of this organism on them. But that doesn't mean
that it's how you get infected. We have to keep our eye on the ball and
make sure we consider all other options.
Mr. Bunworth: Dr Johnson's research has been enough for health authorities
to issue a warning to Bellarine Peninsula residents and visitors.
Dr. Carnie: We have new information to suggest that it has been found in
mosquitoes. We don't know what part mosquitoes play in the actual
transmission, but it would be prudent to try to avoid mosquito bites as far
as possible.
Mr. Bunworth: One of the Bairnsdale ulcer's highest-profile victims was
former AFL player, coach and now commentator David Parkin, whose family has
owned a beach house in Point Lonsdale for 30 years. When the 7:30 Report
interviewed him in 2004, he was recovering from a minor skin graft to
repair damage caused by an ulcer behind his knee.
Mr. Parkin: Mine was a very small hole that you could put the end of your
little finger in. 15 stitches in the back to take out a fair swag of stuff,
but the reality is it's not something that you might think was a spider
bite or a mosquito bite and take no notice of.
Mr. Bunworth: On hearing today's news of a possible link with mosquitoes,
David Parkin was just grateful that research into Bairnsdale ulcer is
continuing.
Mr. Parkin: I'm not in the position of panicking people, but just alerting
people that use my house, and my grandchildren and kids. etc., that we
should be careful, at least when we're in the outdoors and if there is some
-- even small and not yet confirmed -- relationship between march flies or
mosquitoes or whatever, then we should be aware of that and make sure we're
as well-protected as we can be when we're in that environment.
Mr. Bunworth: Dr Johnson will take his findings to a WHO Buruli ulcer
conference in Geneva in Apr 2005. He expects skepticism from other researchers.
Dr. Johnson: Our finding will be challenged because that's how science
works. You have to be able to defend your findings, but it opens new
possibilities, because there's still this mystery, even in Africa, where we
know that some large biting water bugs have this organism in their salivary
glands but that don't explain how people nearby, but not in the water,
actually become infected. So it may be what happens in Victoria is quite
different from west Africa, but it would certainly open people's minds, and
perhaps some more mosquitoes will be trapped over there and the same
experiments done.
Mr. Bunworth: Dr Johnson says more research will establish whether
mosquitoes carry the bacteria in their system, rather than just on their
bodies.
Dr. Johnson: It's in the mouth parts or in the salivary glands, that would
really increase the likelihood that it really is transmitting the
infection, but the key experiment will be to see whether we can get
artificially infected mosquitoes under laboratory conditions to actually
infect an animal such as a mouse.

[The mosquito now joins the fray regarding transmission of _M. ulcerans_
infection in humans.
_Mycobacterium ulcerans_ infection (Buruli ulcer) is the 3rd most common
mycobacterial disease worldwide in immunocompetent humans after leprosy and
tuberculosis. _M. ulcerans_ is an environmental mycobacterium and has been
recovered from water and soil in swampy areas. The disease is not known to
be contagious between humans, and epidemiological studies have not yet
established natural reservoirs or modes of transmission, though abrasions
of the dermis and minor skin trauma after contact with contaminated water,
soil, or vegetation could be likely routes of entry.
Various clinical forms may develop after _M. ulcerans_ enters through the
skin: localized necrotizing skin ulcers; contiguous dissemination over
extensive body surfaces; and metastatic spread of _M. ulcerans_ to distant
sites, usually skin and bone. Minor forms heal spontaneously, ordinarily in
3-6 months by a delayed-type hypersensitivity response, followed by
scarring. Devastating sequelae (scarring or amputations) often ensue from
tissue destruction and osteomyelitis.
There are a few preliminary reports on possible transmission by insects,
including the demonstration experimentally that _M. ulcerans_ could survive
and multiply exclusively within salivary glands of aquatic bugs (_Naucoris
sp._) [the creeping waterbug - Mod.LL], which were able to transmit _M.
ulcerans_ to mice by their bites, suggesting a possible mechanism for human
infection (1).
Another study reported a potential role for fish in transmission (2). Fish
were found positive for _M. ulcerans_ DNA, and all appeared to feed on
insects or plankton and were believed to concentrate _M. ulcerans_ from
this usual food source.
Endemic foci exist throughout the world, predominantly in tropical rain
forest areas. The peak incidence of the disease coincides with the rainfall
pattern and farming season in endemic districts. This lends credence to
speculation that disease onset is related to farming activities, which
predispose to injury and pricks.

2. Eddyani M, Ofori-Adjei D, Teugels G, et al: Potential role for fish in
transmission of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ disease (Buruli Ulcer): an
environmental study. Appl Environ Microbiol. 2004; 70:5679-81.
NABS is the North American Benthological Society. Benthology is the study
of organisms and ecological interactions associated with the bottom
(substrate-water interface) or other substrates -- such as plants or fallen
snags -- in any type of water body (rivers, streams, lakes, ponds,
wetlands, estuaries, oceans). - Mod.LL]
[As stated above, _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ has been found in fish and a few
insects, but it has also been found in snails, spiders and crayfish.
With regard to insects, the presence of this bacterium has been found in
aquatic bugs belonging to the genera _Naucoris_ and _Diplonychus_ in the
families Naucoridae (creeping water bugs) and Belastomidae (giant water
bugs, toe biters), respectively. These are predators on various aquatic
fauna and when handled or trod upon, can cause considerable discomfort by
biting. Other insects said to have been found infected are March
flies. This name is usually used for flies in the family Bibionidae
(adults being called Harlequin flies or Love bugs), adults of which feed on
pollen and nectar, while their larvae ingest soil and decaying vegetable
matter. But some call the large biting tabanid flies (2 common genera being
_Tabanus_ and _Chrysops_) March flies. There is therefore some confusion
when using this vernacular name as to what insects are being referred to.
At a guess, it would seem that tabanids would be a better vehicle for
transmission of _M. ulcerans_.
A research topic for "_Mycobacterium ulcerans_ in Victoria" posted on
<http://www.health.vic.gov.au/researchprograms/downloads/m_ulcerans_proj_brief>
says that previous research has shown that _M. ulcerans_ ingested by
mosquito larvae can be passed to adults. Clearly if -- as it seems from
the present post -- mosquitoes serve as vectors, it needs to be known
whether transmission is mechanical (such as by infected mosquito mouthparts
and/or by their feces being scratched into the skin or abrasions) or
whether the salivary glands are infected. If transmission is mechanical, or
mainly so, then it is likely that many mosquito species might be involved,
as well as other hematophagous insects.

Timothy Stinear, which has 155 references.
