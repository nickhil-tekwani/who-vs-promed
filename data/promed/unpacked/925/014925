re: avian influenza: China
--------------------------
Concerning the information regarding Qinghai Lake (China) in a recent
message (Avian influenza - worldwide (106): China, Pakistan, EU), a news
item in the 18 May 2006 issue of Nature (No. 441, p. 263) may be of interest.
From the article, by Declan Butler, "Blogger reveals China's migratory
goose farms near site of flu outbreak," I have briefly summarized the
following, with limited quotations:
It has been revealed that the Chinese government has been breeding
bar-headed geese near Qinghai Lake. The breeding farms have been part of an
experimental program, since 2003, intended to domesticate the birds and to
release some of them to repopulate wild stocks. Birds at Qinghai Lake, and
bar-headed geese in particular, are thought to have been an important early
source of H5N1 avian influenza infections in birds. News about the breeding
farms raises the possibility that these farms, rather than unfarmed flocks,
might have been major sites of H5N1 infection at Qinghai. Roy Wadia, a
World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Beijing, agrees that, if
confirmed, the finding is "important," as changing the breeding practice
might help control the infection. Yi Guan, a virologist at the University
of Hong Kong, co-authored a Nature paper last July [2005] that suggested
migrating birds caused the outbreak (Nature 436, 191-192; 2005
<http://dx.doi.org.ezproxy.undmedlibrary.org/10.1038/nature03974>).
Guan says he had heard rumors of the [farming] program when he submitted
his paper, but couldn't confirm them. There is no proof that China's
breeding program caused the Qinghai outbreak, but it does raise questions,
he says. "The cultivation of bar-headed geese increases the chance for
these birds to mix with infected domestic poultry."

[The above information, for which we thank Dr Wilsnack, is most interesting
and should be verified. China's official report on the Qinghai outbreak,
dated 27 May 2005, notified the deaths of 519 "migratory birds, including
bar-headed geese (_Anser indicus_), great black-headed gulls (_Larus
ichthyaetus_), brown-headed gulls (_Larus brunnicephalus_), ruddy shelducks
(_Tadorna ferruginea_) and great cormorants (_Phalacrocorax carbo_)." It
further indicated that the source of infection was under investigation,
adding that "the site is an important rendezvous of migratory birds on one
of their Asia-Europe routes."
According to Wikipedia encyclopedia, "the Bar-headed goose (_Anser
indicus_) breeds in Central Asia and migrates over the Himalayas to winter
in the wetlands of India, believed to be the highest flying bird, having
been seen at up to 30 000 feet. It lays 3-8 eggs in a nest near mountain
lakes. The Bar-headed Goose is often kept in captivity, from which it
sometimes escapes. The wild population is declining due to over-hunting."
For a picture, see <http://www.scz.org/animals/g/pic/bhgoose2.jpg>.
The Qinghai H5N1 virus was found later involved in HPAI outbreaks and
infections in wild birds in Asia, Europe and Africa.
If indeed a breeding project was involved, its possible impacts on applied
husbandry and genetic intervention upon the exceptional (clinical)
susceptibility of the geese to the H5N1 virus deserve to be thoroughly
investigated. Hopefully, more details will soon become available. Perhaps
this is a topic for discussion during the due FAO/OIE International
Scientific Conference on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds, Rome, 30-31 May
2006. - Mod.AS]

Laos finds 1st bird flu case since 2004
---------------------------------------
The H5N1 bird flu strain has been found in a duck in Laos, but there is no
sign that the virus is spreading, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) said on Wednesday [17 May 2006].
The isolated case in a backyard farm 20 km (12 miles) south of Vientiane is
the 1st since the South East Asian nation reported an outbreak among
poultry in early 2004.
"We are doing surveillance, and so far everything is negative," Ricarda
Mondry, the FAO's chief technical adviser on avian influenza in Laos, told
Reuters.
The duck was discovered in February 2006 by researchers on a surveillance
project in the area. The case was reported recently to the Paris-based
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Ducks can be carriers of the
disease without showing symptoms.

[OIE's website includes a single HPAI-related notification from Laos. This
emergency report, describing an outbreak on a farm in the village
Nonsavang, close to Vientiane, dates back to 27 Jan 2004.
The following information, derived from an FAO report from January 2005,
may help in understanding the seeming absence of significant HPAI incidence
in Laos: "Some 20 per cent of the national poultry flock is held in
commercial enterprises servicing the larger urban human populations around
the cities of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Champasack and Savannakhet. Of
these, egg producers obtain most of their replacements as "point-of-lay" 16
week old pullets from Thailand. Similarly, day-old commercial broiler
chicks are imported into farms and are available in small numbers at the
larger district markets. There is no commercial production of ducks or turkeys.
Village poultry in Lao PDR have close contact with each other, with pigs
and with children, creating a risk of inter-species transmission. There are
no large "wet" markets in Lao. Poultry are sold in the village or the local
district market. The system of selling poultry in the market in Lao is
unique: Consumers are offered live birds by traders in the market; birds
that are not sold that day are processed and offered as fresh or cooked
carcasses the following day. At the market level, this system effectively
works on an "all-in, all-out" basis. There are no large commercial poultry
slaughtering establishments in Lao. Rather, processing is done by owners or
traders with small basic facilities. Village poultry populations are
self-replacing with few introductions from outside the village. Thus, in
the event of HPAI outbreaks in the village, disease may be limited to the
locality, with little risk of further spread."
According to the January 2006 FAOAIDE's update No 38,
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//199484/AVIbull038x.pdf>, the
following visits have been carried out recently in Laos by the agency's
experts:
- Dr D Castellan (Canada) OSRO/RAS/505/USA (chief technical advisor), 20
Nov to 29 Dec 2005.
- Dr W Kalpravidh, FAO RAP (Bangkok), project coordinator, 26 Nov (?) to 20
Dec 2005.
- Dr C Bemigno, FAO RAP (Bangkok), animal health officer, USAID project, 16
to 21 Jan 2006.
1st-hand reports, if available, could be of interest. - Mod.AS]
