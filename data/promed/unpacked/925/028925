_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ (EPPO A2 List) is first reported from diseased potato plants and tubers (_Solanum tuberosum_). The bacterium caused severe outbreaks in the central and north west parts of the Russian Federation between 2011 and 2017 (Ignatov AN, et al. Plant Disease 2019; 103(1): 147; https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/full/10.1094/PDIS-04-18-0691-PDN).

[_Clavibacter michiganensis_ ssp. _michiganensis_ (Cmm) is known to cause bacterial canker of tomato. Natural infection with Cmm has also been reported from capsicum and some wild solanaceous species. In potato, the related ssp. _sepedonicus_ causes ring rot. Both diseases can lead to severe yield losses on their respective hosts. (For more information on the diseases see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

The source paper of the item above reports a new strain of Cmm that causes symptoms on potato of yellowing and necrosis of leaves, wilting of plants, and brown lines on tubers. 35 isolates from symptomatic potatoes in 5 regions of Russia were sequenced and shown to have 99 per cent homology to the Cmm type strain. In phylogenetic analysis, they grouped with Cmm strains from tomatoes with bacterial canker symptoms from the same regions. Inoculation studies with 4 isolates showed that these caused symptoms on both tomatoes and potatoes, while the type strain of Cmm used as control only caused symptoms on tomato, but not on potato.

This new strain is likely to have emerged some time ago since it was found to be already so widely distributed in Russia. It may have been spread from a centre of origin with tomato explants or potato seed tubers. The fact that it can affect both of these important crops makes it a threat to national producers and may also affect exports due to the biosecurity risk.

Other subspecies of _C. michiganensis_ affecting different hosts are found elsewhere, including ssp. _nebraskensis_ which causes Goss's wilt of maize.
