Four cases of cholera [have] been notified in Kheda district last week with patients having symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting. One has been discharged while the other 3 are stable in hospital, said Nadiad taluka health officer Vipul Amin. A 6-year-old boy, a 2-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy were diagnosed with the disease in Kanipura Bhilvas Amdavadi Bazar area in Nadiad, with the date of onset of symptoms between 26 and 28 Jun 2021.

According to Amin, the suspected cause is consumption of stale food containing meat while in the case of a 4th patient -- a 7-year-old girl from Saibabanagar, Manjipura Road area in Nadiad -- the suspected cause is contaminated water. The girl developed her symptoms on 26 Jun 2021 and has been discharged.

As part of general protocol of notifiable disease, a 10-kilometer [6.2-mile] radius has been declared as a "cholera-prone" zone, Amin said. As per publicly available data of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, in this calendar year up to 18 Apr 2021, West Bengal was the only state that had reported incidences of cholera with no deaths.

[Kheda, also known as Kaira, is a city and a municipality in the Indian state of Gujarat. The state, in northwestern India, can be found on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat#/media/File:IN-GJ.svg.

A number of cholera vaccines are available, but edible vaccine technology offers the potential for a cold chain-free method. The following recent Japanese publication reports on a phase 1 study actually performed in 2016 using MucoRice-CTB vaccine, a genetically modified rice strain that carries a cholera toxin B subunit antigen (the Methods section of the abstract, not included here, can be found at the URL, below):

Abstract
--------
"Background: There are an estimated 1.3-4.0 million cases of cholera and 20  000-140  000 cholera-related deaths worldwide each year. The rice-based cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) vaccine, MucoRice-CTB, is an oral candidate vaccine that does not require a cold chain, has shown efficacy in animal models, and could be of benefit in places where there is a paucity of medical infrastructure. We aim to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MucoRice-CTB in humans."

"Findings: Between 23 Jun 2015 and 31 May 2016, 226 participants were recruited and assessed for eligibility. 166 participants were excluded based on health condition or schedule. We then randomly selected 60 male volunteers aged 20-40 years who were enrolled and assigned to MucoRice-CTB (10 participants assigned to 1 g, 10 participants assigned to 3 g, and 10 participants assigned to 6 g), or placebo (10 participants assigned to 1 g, 10 participants assigned to 3 g, and 10 participants assigned to 6 g). All participants received at least one dose of study drug or placebo and were included in the safety analyses. Two participants given MucoRice-CTB 3 g and one participant given MucoRice-CTB 6 g were lost to follow-up and excluded from the efficacy analysis. Serum CTB-specific IgG and IgA antibody concentrations in participants who received 6 g MucoRice-CTB increased significantly in both a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner compared with those in the placebo groups (p for interaction = 0.002 for IgG, p = 0.004 for IgA). Genome analysis of subjects' faeces before vaccination revealed that compared to non-responders, responders had a gut microbiota of higher diversity with the presence of _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella_ spp. 28 (93%) of 30 participants who received MucoRice-CTB at any dose had at least one adverse event during the study period, compared with 30 (100%) of 30 participants given placebo. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 4 participants in the MucoRice-CTB group (5 events) and 4 participants in the placebo group (10 events). The most common serious adverse event was haemoglobin decreased (2 events in 2 participants in the pooled MucoRice-CTB group, 2 events in 2 participants in the placebo group; all grade 3).

"Interpretation: Participants given MucoRice-CTB showed increased CTB-specific serum IgG and IgA antibody concentrations without inducing serious adverse events, indicating that MucoRice-CTB could be a safe and potent vaccine to prevent diarrheal disease. MucoRice-CTB induced neutralizing antibodies against diarrhoeal toxins in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. A similar phase 1 trial will be done with participants of other ethnicities to substantiate our findings."
