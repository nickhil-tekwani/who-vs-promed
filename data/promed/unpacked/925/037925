A visiting scientist at the University of Jyvaskyla died on Monday last week [11 Aug 2014] after infection by Puumala virus. She got the infection while making laboratory and field studies on bank voles at the Konnevesi Research Station.

The virus is common in Central Finland in the bank vole, which is an important research target of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science. Because Puumala virus infections are common in Central Finland, the security arrangements of the research are very strict.

[According to the Israeli daily Yediot Acharonot, the female victim was a 36-year-old scientist from Israel engaged in animal behavioural ecology research (http://www.mynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4558471,00.html, in Hebrew).

Puumala virus, the most common Hantavirus (family Bunyaviridae) in Europe, is a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (PUUV-HFRS) or nephropathia epidemica (NE). It has been detected widely in Europe, excluding the British Isles, southern Mediterranean areas, and the very northernmost tundra regions. This parallels (except for the British Isles) the distribution of the main (symptomless) carrier of PUUV, the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_, previously known as _Clethrionomys glareolus_; picture at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_vole#mediaviewer/File:R%C3%B6telmaus.jpg). PUUV is very common in Finland.

The clinical course of NE caused by PUUV is generally regarded to be milder than haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by other hantaviruses. The current tragic case may indicate that the pathogenicity of this hantavirus may have been underestimated. - Mod.AS]

[Mod.CP commented, "hemorrhagic fever with renal failure syndrome (HFRS) occurs mainly in Europe and Asia and is characterized by fever and renal failure associated with hemorrhagic manifestations. [HFRS] is caused by airborne contact with secretions from rodent hosts infected with the group of viruses belonging to the genus _Hantavirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. In Europe, HFRS is caused by hantaviruses: Puumala virus (PUUV), carried by the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_); Dobrava virus (DOBV), carried by the yellow-necked mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_)." - Mod.LM
