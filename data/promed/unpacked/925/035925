We currently have a small colony of _Gopherus agassizii_ tortoises who are
positive for _Mycoplasma agassizii_, the etiologic agent of Upper Repiratory
Tract Disease (URTD) in desert tortoises. The symptoms include runny noses,
red swollen eyes, plugged nares, weight loss, edema and sloughing skin. I'm
not sure if this could be related to the gopher tortoise problem but we have
had some luck in treating the tortoises with clarithromycin (15 mg/kg) given
orally. Also, making soaking pans available for rehydration has allowed many
of our tortoises to recover from the respiratory symptoms. Additionally,
triple antibiotic eye and nose drops (e.g. Gentamycin durafilm) appear to
have made the animals more comfortable and better able to smell food, as
does suctioning the nares with a small syringe. I hope this will help, at
least with the tortoises that are in captivity.
