Between January and February [2019], 15 people died of Lassa fever in Ondo state, south west Nigeria, while 102 persons are infected, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) said. "As at Thursday [21 Feb 2019], 102 people have tested positive for Lassa fever this year [2019]," chairman of the medical association in Ondo, Dr Wale Oke, told NAN in Akure.

"82 people in January [2019], and 20 people so far in February [2019] [have tested positive], apart from 15 deaths recorded in January [2019] as a result of the fever; no death has been recorded so far in February [2019]. Most people that died either reported late or were already subjected to alternative treatment and doing self-medication before they eventually came to the hospital. Their kidneys and livers were affected as a result of the delay."

Oke, who is also a staff member at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, urged residents of the state to report early to the medical centre if they experience an upsurge of temperature in their bodies. "We have a contact tracing mechanism whereby we can place on surveillance for 21 days those who may have had contact with the infected persons," Oke said. "We continue to monitor their temperature; if it is above 37.8 deg C [100 deg F], we direct them for quick treatment."

[Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing as Nigeria, including Ondo state, is now in the period of the year when more Lassa fever cases usually occur. The situations under which the Ondo state patients acquired their infection is not stated. Transmission of Lassa fever virus (LFV) occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. As of 17 Feb 2019, 3 healthcare workers were infected with LFV, so presumably most of the other 99 infected individuals acquired their infection from contact with the excreta of infected rodent reservoirs.
