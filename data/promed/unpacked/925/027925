Russia is threatening to ban the imports of Armenian tomatoes. This follows the detection of _Pepino mosaic virus_ [PepMV] in a batch of tomatoes from Armenia. The [responsible Russian] department warned Armenia about a possible ban on the import of these vegetables, Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] reported.

Rosselkhoznadzor has carried out monitoring in Russian greenhouse complexes and farms that grow tomatoes in the open field. The virus was not detected anywhere, from which they concluded that it came from Armenia. "We asked the Armenian side to strengthen control over vegetables supplied to Russia. In case of the re-detection of the virus in regulated goods, we will be forced to apply restrictive measures against imports from Armenia,' they said.

Rosselkhoznadzor are extremely concerned about numerous findings of the dangerous PepMV in tomatoes coming from Belarus. The virus has been detected in batches shipped from 4 of Belarus' 6 regions (Grodno, Gomel, Minsk, Brest), which indicates its widespread distribution and uncontrolled spread throughout that country. Rosselkhoznadzor has previously banned the import of tomatoes from the Gomel, Grodno and Minsk regions. From 30 Oct 2020, they will also ban tomatoes and capsicum from the Brest region from entering Russia.

Rosselkhoznadzor stressed that the appropriate department of Belarus was warned of the situation and of the need to certify tomatoes and capsicum sent to Russia reliably for the absence of PepMV. However, the virus continued to be detected in Belarusian tomatoes during quarantine phytosanitary control in Russia. This confirms the use of ineffective methods of diagnosis of pathogens in products exported to Russia, they said. The virus' introduction into Russia could endanger agricultural production of vegetables.

[_Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV, genus _Potexvirus_) was first identified on pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) in South America. It is spreading in the Americas and Europe and has also been reported from a few locations in Asia and Africa. PepMV can also infect potato and aubergine, but serious symptoms appear to occur only in tomato. Symptoms may include blotches and scarification on fruit; mottling, distortion, necrosis on leaves and young shoots. The virus can cause significant economic losses, especially in glasshouse tomatoes, due mainly to reduction of fruit quality. PepMV has been added to the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

PepMV spreads very rapidly and is highly contagious. Specific insect vectors have not been identified. The virus is transmitted by mechanical means (including contaminated tools, human and insect activities, plant-to-plant contact), grafting, and with infected plant material (including insufficiently cleaned seed batches containing contaminated plant debris). True seed transmission (that is, via the embryo rather than the seed coat) is uncommon in potexviruses and appears unlikely for PepMV, but more studies are needed. Disease management is usually focused on phytosanitation and use of certified clean seed and tomato explants.

Different strains of the virus exist for pepino and tomato. Coinfections have earlier been reported with _Potato virus S_ (genus _Carlavirus_) and _Tomato torrado virus_ (genus _Torradovirus_). Most recently, coinfection with the newly identified _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (genus _Tobamovirus_) was reported (ProMED-mail post 20191029.6751082) and it was thought that the observed symptoms on tomatoes may have been due to either virus or to synergism. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of these interactions of PepMV with other viruses on crop damage.
