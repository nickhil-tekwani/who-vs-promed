Fiji: Dengue Fever Outbreak Alert
--------------------------------
There are fears an outbreak of dengue fever may spread in the western
part of Fiji. The Acting Director of the Western Health Services, Dr
Yo-gen-dra Narayan, says there is a very high risk of a major
outbreak of dengue fever in the coming weeks. Dr Narayan says 4
people admitted to hospital have been confirmed with dengue fever.
Several people died during a major dengue outbreak in Fiji in 1997.
