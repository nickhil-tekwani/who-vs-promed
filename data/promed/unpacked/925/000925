The Indonesian Government has closed down the popular Ragunan Zoo here for
21 days from Monday [19 Sep 2005], after 19 birds were confirmed to have
contracted the avian flu.
The order to close the 140 hectare zoo was made by Jakarta Governor
Sutiyoso, after 19 of the 27 samples taken from the birds tested positive
for bird flu, including peacocks, mynahs, wild ducks, pigmy chickens,
eagles, and herons.
Indonesian Agriculture Minister Anton Apriyantono and one zoo official were
quoted by the local daily Jakarta Post as saying the zoo had to be closed
to the public, as the infected animals needed treatment, and tests must be
conducted on other animals and the zoo employees.
Another daily, Republika, quoted Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari as
saying bird flu cases in this capital city of 12 million people were
extraordinary.
To keep the disease from spreading, she said her ministry would increase
its surveillance, focusing more on non-chicken birds, especially reared and
caged birds and water birds.

[This report adds peacocks, mynahs, wild ducks, and herons to the
previously reported infected eagle and pygmy chicken. An important question
is how did the virus get there? Was it spread from migratory birds; did
someone illegally bring and feed infected poultry carcasses to animals in
the collection? Was it spread mechanically from poultry either in Jakarta
or outside the city, as people do visit important zoos often and from
substantial distances?
The report also underscores the importance of including zoos in a
comprehensive surveillance strategy for avian influenza, and other
diseases. The inclusion of information derived from a zoo was critical in
unraveling the 1999 West Nile incursion into New York City in the United
States. No better example of the benefits of zoo surveillance could be
found than the key observations and subsequent isolation of West Nile virus
spearheaded by Tracy McNamara at the Bronx Zoo, when she noted that the
pattern of mortality in her zoo collection was not likely to be due to St
Louis encephalitis, the prevailing presumptive diagnosis for the human
cases early in the West Nile outbreak in New York City. Seeing the pattern
of occurrence in all animals can be very helpful. Zoos provide a wide range
of species, which may have varying susceptibilities for new agents or
strains. It is, therefore, imperative that surveillance at zoos be one
element, along with surveillance in humans, pet bird populations, backyard
poultry, commercial poultry and, of course, migratory birds, swine and
other species in a comprehensive surveillance strategy. How to optimize
surveillance in terms of cost, time and personnel is, of course, a key
decision for responsible human and animal health authorities.
Management of avian zoo population, now that avian influenza has been found
in the collection, presents real dilemmas and significant tradeoffs.
Although I don't know the status of the zoo collection presently, it is my
understanding that this zoo is likely to contain several species that are
very rare and qualify for special treatment under the CITES (Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species) treaty, which protects
endangered species. Birds such as Argus pheasants, Bali mynahs and Birds of
Paradise are likely to be included at a key zoo location such as the
Ragunan Zoo.
Depopulation, particularly as exemplified in Hong Kong in 1997, has been
one of the most effective public health measures taken when avian
influenza-infected live birds exist in urban markets. In this case,
however, depopulation should be a last resort, not a knee jerk reaction. A
plan for quarantining and testing selected rare, positive or exposed birds
in an enclosed aviary should be considered. Clearly, although an avian
influenza-infected resident population in zoos presents many problems,
optimal solutions, short of complete depopulation, that both protect public
health and rare endangered species should be sought. - Mod.PC]
