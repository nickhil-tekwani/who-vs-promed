Today [3 Mar 2011], the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural
Development, Fisheries and Food [Sagarpa by its Spanish initials],
through the department of Animal Health, slaughtered 114 birds
infected by velogenic Newcastle disease virus at the zoo in
Chilpancingo [Guerrero state] and ordered the temporary closure of the
park.

The local zoo has at least 5000 visitors every day and it is the
largest center in Chilpancingo for family congregations during
weekends. Federal authorities closed it today [3 Mar 2011] as a
preventive measure.

The director of Sagarpa, Wilfrido Najera Lomeli, reported that
slaughtering the birds was necessary to prevent the infection of more
birds of their kind in the city. Specialists from the federal agency
will carry out another inspection of the site by Friday [4 Mar 2011].

According to [official] information, the virus was transmitted by
peacocks. The [Newcastle disease] virus is a highly contagious viral
disease, which affects all species of birds.

Najera Lomeli urged the population of Chilpancingo to report
immediately to the Sagarpa authorities any abnormalities they detect
in birds, including domestic poultry.

[Mexico has had several cases of Newcastle disease virus and is
aggressively tackling the disease with an equally aggressive stamping
out program.

This disease can be particularly devastating to zoo populations. We
hope the remainder of the zoo birds do not come down with the
disease.

Newcastle disease is an acute viral disease of domestic poultry and
many other bird species. It is a worldwide problem that presents
primarily as a respiratory disease, but depression, nervous
manifestations, or diarrhea may be the predominant clinical form.
Mortality is variable. Occurrence of a virulent form of the disease is
reportable and may result in trade restrictions.

Virulent NDV (Newcastle disease virus) strains are endemic in poultry
in most of Asia, Africa, and some countries of North, Central, and
South America. Other countries, including the USA and Canada, are free
of those strains and maintain that status with import restrictions and
eradication by destroying diseased poultry. Cormorants, pigeons, and
imported psittacine species have also been sources of virulent NDV
infections of poultry. Low virulence NDV is prevalent in poultry and
wild birds, especially waterfowl. Infection of domestic poultry with
low virulence NDV contributes to lower productivity.

Infected birds shed virus in exhaled air, respiratory discharges, and
feces. Virus is shed during incubation, during the clinical stage, and
for a varying but limited period during convalescence. Virus may also
be present in eggs laid during clinical disease and in all parts of
the carcass during acute virulent infections. Chickens are readily
infected by aerosols and by ingesting contaminated water or food.
Infected chickens are the primary source of virus, but other domestic
and wild birds may be sources of NDV. Transfer of virus, especially in
infective feces, by the movement of people and contaminated equipment
is the main method of spread between poultry flocks.

Onset is rapid, and signs appear throughout the flock within 2-12
days (average 5) after aerosol exposure. Spread is slower if the
fecal-oral route is the primary means of transmission, particularly
for caged birds. Young birds are the most susceptible. Observed signs
depend on whether the infecting virus has a predilection for
respiratory, digestive, or nervous systems. Respiratory signs of
gasping, coughing, sneezing, and rales predominate in low virulence
infections. Nervous signs of tremors, paralyzed wings and legs,
twisted necks, circling, clonic spasms, and complete paralysis may
accompany, but usually follow, the respiratory signs in neurotropic
velogenic disease.

Nervous signs with diarrhea are typical in pigeons, and nervous signs
are frequently seen in cormorants and exotic bird species. Respiratory
signs with depression, watery-greenish diarrhea, and swelling of the
tissues of the head and neck are typical of the most virulent form of
the disease, viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease (VVND, also
called exotic Newcastle disease), although nervous signs may also be
seen. Varying degrees of depression and inappetence are observed.
