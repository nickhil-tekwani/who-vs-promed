An unidentified disease is affecting pepper cultivation in Wellawaya [Moneragala district, Uva province]. The area is at risk of a great harvest loss. Farmers said that they were in a difficult situation due to the spread of the unidentified disease in their fields near the time of the pepper harvest.

[Black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is known to be affected by a range of pathogens. Of concern in the region are quick wilt (also called foot rot; caused by the oomycete _Phytophthora capsici_), slow wilt (also called slow decline or yellows; caused by nematodes), fungal root rots (_Fusarium_ species), and bacterial leaf spot (_Pseudomonas_ and/or _Xanthomonas_ species). Reliable diagnosis is needed for successful disease management.
