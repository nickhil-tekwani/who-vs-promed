Norovirus has been confirmed in 3 people who became ill while swimming at Cowans Gap. The number of people who became ill after swimming in stream-fed mountain lake the weekend of 18-19 Jul 2015 has grown to more than 90.

"It was something [?] brought here by 1 of the visitors," park Manager Ryan Donovan said. "We highly suspect someone was sick when they came to the park. Norovirus is highly contagious."

When officials closed the Cowans Gap beach on 22 Jul 2015, they suspected 24 cases of norovirus [infection]. The gastrointestinal illness is passed from an infected person, contaminated food or water or by touching contaminated surfaces. Symptoms include stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. The virus has been confirmed in samples taken from 3 visitors, Donovan said.

Norovirus is among many pathogens that make swimming risky. More than half the U.S. recreational water-associated outbreaks in 2011 and 2012 were caused by _Cryptosporidium_, a parasite of the gut. [Cryptosporidiosis is a disease usually caused by the parasites _Cryptosporidium hominis_ and _C. parvum_. It is most commonly seen in children aged between 1 and 5 years. People with weak immune systems are likely to be more seriously affected. The most common symptom is mild to severe watery diarrhoea. - Mod.CP]. The parasites are resistant to chlorine. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been linked to drinking or swimming in contaminated water and contact with infected lambs and calves during visits to open farms.

During the same time span, Cowans Gap was closed for the season after _E.Coli_ sickened 16 people, 9 of whom were hospitalized. The source of the bacteria was never determined.

The park will begin educating visitors on the importance of personal hygiene, Donovan said:
- If you're sick, don't go swimming in the lake. Stay home and get better.
- Change diapers in the comfort station. Changing diapers is prohibited on the beach.

"You should not ingest the (lake) water," Donovan said. "Go home and shower. Anytime you swim in a lake there's going to be some risk. It's not a chlorinated pool."

The park tests its lake water on Monday and Tuesday, he said. The samples has tested negative for pathogens. "Looking at those tests we'd stay open," Donovan said. "We're closed until the Department of Health can complete its investigation. We hope in the next few days to have a better report. We definitely hope to have the beach open before the end of the season."

The park's water and sewer systems and the food concession stand have all been tested, and all with negative results.

"It's pretty clear it was brought from an outside source, and unfortunately people were affected by that," Donovan said. About 13 000 people visited the park during the weekend of 18-19 Jul 2015, Donovan said. With about 100 000 visitors, July is the park's busiest month.

Not so this past weekend, according to Donovan. "Other than the temperature, you'd think it would have been a fall weekend." People continue to camp, picnic, boat and fish at the park.

Norovirus is more common to hospitals and nursing homes than lakes, according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. In the U.S., it accounts for half the outbreaks of food-related illness. More than 90 percent of diarrheal disease outbreaks on cruise ships are caused by norovirus. It's most common in winter.

In the U.S., norovirus contributes to about 56 000 to 71 000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths [annually], mostly among young children and the elderly, according to the CDC.

[Cowans Gap State Park is a 1085-acre park in the beautiful Allens Valley of Fulton County. A 42-acre lake, large campground, rustic cabins and many hiking trails are prime attractions. For some of the reasons listed above, norovirus infection is perhaps the least likely source of the outbreak of gastrointestinal disease recorded at the Park.

Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both). About 1 in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhea and vomiting, is caused by norovirus (see http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/worldwide.html). Norovirus is more often the cause of acute gastroenteritis among people in developed countries. In developed countries, norovirus causes about 1 in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis; in developing countries, it's about 1 in 6 cases. Overall, developing countries have more cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by different pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. So, norovirus accounts for smaller fraction of all cases in these countries.

With the widespread use of rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has surpassed rotavirus as the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis for which children need medical care in some countries, like the United States and Nicaragua. This trend is likely to continue as other countries routinely vaccinate against rotavirus.

Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler, winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season, but may also be associated with the birth rate.

Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks. The most common norovirus strain (genogroup II genotype 4) is a major cause of outbreaks worldwide. New norovirus strains emerge about every 2 to 4 years. Often, but not always, these new strains lead to an increase in outbreaks worldwide. The CDC's Division of Viral Disease works with many global partners to identify the burden of acute gastroenteritis caused by norovirus and to prevent norovirus outbreaks throughout the world. - Mod.CP
