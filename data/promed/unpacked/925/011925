INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO COMBAT NEW INFLUENZA STRAIN STEPPED UP
Although there have been no new confirmed cases of infection in humans with
the avian influenza strain H5N1 beyond the six cases already announced,
international public health organizations have stepped up their joint
effort to combat the further spread of this virus in humans and its
possible consequences.
Two main thrusts of action by the international health community are the
preparation of seed virus for the eventual development of a vaccine for the
H5N1 strain and increased surveillance activities in humans and birds.
The World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centres for Influenza are
working with various H5 strains to prepare seed virus in case a vaccine is
needed. The eventual preparation of a vaccine strain may take several
months, but in the absence of human-to-human transmission and of any
documented outbreak, WHO is not recommending the development of a specific
H5N1 vaccine. Reagents for vaccine production could be ready, at the
earliest, in January 1998.
Influenza surveillance in humans has also been intensified and now includes
all hospitals and 63 public health clinics in Hong Kong, Special
Administrative Region of China. A team of five epidemiologists from the WHO
Collaborating Centre for Influenza Reference and Research at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA are on site for
investigations. Blood samples are being collected from family members of
the four people infected, nursing staff and other contacts.
The WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC has also prepared a kit of reagents
which will be despatched shortly to 110 National Influenza Centres in 82
countries for diagnosis of H5N1.
So far no case of human-to-human transmission has been identified but
further tests of blood specimens are required to ascertain the origin of
infection with greater precision. An additional suspected case in a human
is under investigation, in Hong Kong.
Influenza-like illness has been noted in some medical and nursing staff,
now on amantadine treatment, but tests so far have not shown any evidence
of H5N1 infection. The illness could be due to other viruses circulating in
Hong Kong. No current outbreak has been reported among animals but
surveillance is being established in wild and domestic birds. There is no
reason to impose travel restrictions or quarantine in Hong Kong and
elsewhere.
Prior to May 1997, the H5N1 virus was known to infect only various species
of birds, including chickens and ducks. It was first discovered in terns in
South Africa in 1961 and can be deadly to fowl: in spring 1997, thousands
of chickens died in Hong Kong after contracting it. Human infection with
H5N1 is believed to have come through direct contact with infected birds.
The WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies in the Ecology of Influenza in
Animals at St Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, USA, is establishing, in
close collaboration with national authorities and the University of Hong
Kong, a programme for intensive epidemiological studies of animal influenza
in Hong Kong. WHO is planning to send a veterinary epidemiologist from its
Division of Emerging and other Communicable Diseases Surveillance and
Control (EMC) to Hong Kong to assist in the implementation of this
programme, while other WHO staff will be called upon as needed.
