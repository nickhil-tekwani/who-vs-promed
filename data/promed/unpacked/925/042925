It was not long ago when a Royal Bengal tiger named Manikantan (male) along with Karthika (female) reached Nagaland Zoological Park (NZP) at Rangapahar [Nagaland]. But much to the disappointment of the visitors, the majestic male tiger was not seen for more than 2 months. It has emerged that the zoo staff found the dead body of the big cat on 31 Jul 2018, precisely one year and 9 months after arriving in the state.

The pair was brought to the state on 9 Jan 2017 from Kerala's Thiruvananthanpuram Zoo in exchange for 2 black Asiatic bears namely Kohima (male) and Dimapur (female) from NZP. Manikantan was 11 years old when he was brought to Nagaland.

Director of NZP, Obed Bohovi Swu, told Eastern Mirror that the death of Manikantan was a "suspected case of anthrax." The preliminary investigation of his carcass showed signs of anthrax such as bleeding from nose, mouth, eyes, and swollen stomach due to gas, he said. The zoo veterinary doctor too found symptoms [no, signs not symptoms. - Mod.MHJ] similar to the disease (anthrax) in his body.

Samples from Manikantan's body have been sent to places such as Guwahati and Shillong for testing to find out the exact cause of death and it should be out anytime soon, said Swu, adding that it takes a lot of time for confirmation of result. [Yes, all of 3 days. - Mod.MHJ] When asked the reason for not disclosing the death of Manikantan to the public for so long, he said that since it was a suspected case of anthrax, the nature of the disease itself was a very big issue for the government as well as for the welfare of the public. Another reason was due to the non-confirmation of the test result, he added.

According to the forester 1 at NZP, Vinoto, there were no signs of physical weakness, struggles, or external injuries on the day before Manikantan died. He was moving around freely, adhering to his Monday fasting as usual, and having food on regular basis in his enclosure.

The Central Zoo Authority of India inspected the NZP and assessed the death of Manikantan but nothing much was obtained from the inspection, said Vinoto. Protocols for safe disposal of carcasses were followed for the short-lived Manikantan and the grave was closely guarded by the zoo staff to avoid any kind of untoward incidents.

[A delay such as this, 2+ months, in confirming or not anthrax as a cause of the tiger's death could be due to it coming up negative and the diagnostic laboratory forgot to inform the NZP authorities, or the one laboratory had referred it to the other for reconfirmation or clarification and NZP had not been kept up to date with what was going on. Tigers are not one's usual host for this infection but anthrax is not uncommon in national park lions in Africa. It tends to be an oral-pharyngeal infection.

It should be noted that anthrax is rarely seen, if at all, in this part of far eastern India, near to Myanmar. On checking my data I can find no records of it thereabouts in OIE reports. On the other hand, zoos have a bad habit of using carcasses of dead animals to feed their carnivores, thus bringing the problem out into the open. Not dissimilar to human cases in areas nominally without anthrax. Hopefully this news report will stimulate action.
