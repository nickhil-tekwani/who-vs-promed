PARALYSIS (?TOXIC) - SCOTLAND: RFI
==================================
? Pelagic Paralysis in Scotland:
I am searching for potential leads on the epidemiology of pelagic
paralysis (ciguatera and/or paralytic shellfish poisoning) from
July 1995 to help me with a case of a 61 year old woman who
developed the acute onset of a gastrointestinal and neurological
illness several hours after the ingestion of mussels in a
restaurant in St. Andrew's. The patient has had bizarre neurological
symptoms over the past 5 months.
Have there been other reported cases of such an illness in
Scotland recently?
