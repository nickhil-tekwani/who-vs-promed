--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Pseudocercospora fijiensis_, the causal agent of black sigatoka disease of banana (Musa spp.) (BLSD), is considered to be the major economic threat for banana cultivated for export. The disease has a worldwide distribution throughout the humid tropical regions and has been previously reported in the southwest Indian Ocean area: in 1993 in Mayotte and Comoros islands, in Mauritius in 1996 and in Madagascar in 2000.

In December 2017, typical BLSD symptoms were observed in a Cavendish cv. Petite Naine crop located in the east-central area of Reunion Island. Typical early symptoms were 1-4 mm long brown streaks on the abaxial leaf surface, and typical older streaks were also observed. Banana leaves bearing leaf spot symptoms were collected in 4 sites. At each site, 4 leaf fragments from different banana plants were sampled resulting in 16 distinct samples. DNA extracts were used for a real-time PCR assay to specifically detect _P. fijiensis_. The presence of _P. eumusae_ and _P. musicola_, 2 related ascomycetous fungi causing other banana leaf spot diseases, was also assessed.

_P. fijiensis_ was detected in 3 of the 4 samples from one site. The positive PCR products were sequenced. No positive signal for _P. fijiensis_ was found in the other 3 sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of BLSD in Reunion Island. Interestingly, our results also showed co-infection with _P. eumusae_. This fungus causing eumusae leaf spot disease was identified on Reunion Island in 2000. Further investigation will be required to monitor the spread of BLSD on the island and to identify the origin of the populations responsible for the introduction of the disease from [the sites of] the first reports of BLSD in the southwest Indian Ocean area in the 1990's.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by the fungus _Pseudocercospora fijiensis_ (previously _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_), which affects only species and hybrids of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of bananas, with yield losses of 50 percent or more. It is present in the Americas, China, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. Infection occurs on the youngest leaves of the plant; older leaves are not readily infected.

BS seriously affects photosynthetic ability and fruit can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment, causing further losses. It is spread by water, wind and contaminated materials including suckers for planting. Disease management includes frequent applications of fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum and cultural practices, but the high costs of these measures make them essentially unavailable to smallholder farmers. Use of agrochemicals may also cause problems for fruit export, for example to Europe.

Yellow sigatoka (YS; sigatoka leaf spot) is caused by _Mycosphaerella musicola_ (synonym _Pseudocercospora musae_) and eumusae (or septoria) leaf spot (ELS) is caused by _P. eumusae_. Symptoms and epidemiology are similar for all 3 diseases. YS is more adapted to cooler temperatures, symptoms appear mainly on older leaves, and less damage is caused to photosynthetic tissue. There are more cultivars of banana and plantain with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS. A number of fungal pathogens in other genera can cause similar symptoms in different regions of the world. In areas where more than one leaf spot pathogen is present, laboratory analysis is needed for a clear diagnosis. BS is another example of a warm climate disease spreading due to global climate change (see links below).
