On Mon 20 Oct 2014, SLM, a medical doctor working with Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) was discharged from Oslo University Hospital, Ulleval. She was treated for Ebola hemorrhagic fever after having contracted the disease on Sat 4 Oct 2014, after working 2 weeks at an Ebola center in Bo, Sierra Leone... After testing positive for Ebola on Sun 5 Oct 2014, she was flown to Oslo in an incubator of sorts [sic], which was airtight and infection proof, and then transferred to Ulleval Hospital... She has now recovered and is no longer infectious...

[2] USA: quarantine controversy

Quarantines imposed on travelers coming from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa could discourage American health workers from going there to help fight the epidemic, a senior U.S. medical official said on Sun [26 Oct 2014]...

New York, New Jersey and Illinois imposed 21-day mandatory quarantines in the last 2 days for anyone arriving with a risk of having contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. They are the 3 West African countries that have borne the brunt of an epidemic that has killed nearly 5000 people. But critics worry the policies, going beyond federal regulations and intended to ease public concern over the spread of the disease, will just make matters worse. "I don't want to be directly criticizing the decision that was made, but we have to be careful that there are unintended consequences," said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "The best way to stop this epidemic is to help the people in West Africa, we do that by sending people over there, not only from the U.S.A. but from other places," Fauci told NBC's "Meet the Press." He called such quarantines "a little bit draconian."

The states' policies were abruptly imposed after a New York City doctor was diagnosed with the disease on Thu [23 Oct 2014] after coming home from treating patients in Guinea. A nurse who returned on Fri [24 Oct 2014] through New Jersey's Newark airport after working in Sierra Leone with Ebola patients strongly criticized the quarantine policy on Sat [25 Oct 2014], describing hours of questioning and then transfer to a hospital isolation tent. She called her treatment a "frenzy of disorganization."

Fauci reiterated what the medical officials have been stressing as Americans worry about Ebola: that it is spread only by contact with bodily fluids of people with symptoms. "The science tells us that people who are not sick, if you do not come into contact with body fluid, if someone comes back from wherever, Liberia, and they're well, they are no danger to anyone," Fauci said. But New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, asked to respond to Fauci's comment that it is not good science to quarantine people who are not symptomatic, said, "I don't believe that when you're dealing with something as serious as this that we can count on a voluntary system."

"This is government's job. If anything else, the government's job is to protect the safety and health of our citizens," he told the "Fox News Sunday" program. Asked whether the new rules would discourage health workers from going to West Africa, Christie added, "Folks that are willing to take that step and willing to volunteer also understand that it's in their interest and in the public health's interest to have a 21-day period thereafter if they've been directly exposed to people with the virus."... The governor is considered a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination...

[3] Rapid diagnostic test
Date: 22 Oct 2014

http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/oct/22/genalyte-ebola-test/?


Sprinting into the race to commercialize an Ebola diagnostic, San Diego's Genalyte says it has developed a 10-minute Ebola test. The company said its test uses one drop of blood from a finger prick and offers results in as fast as 10 minutes on its diagnostic platform. The test detects Ebola proteins, even at an early stage of infection before the person is showing obvious symptoms [This last feature could be a game changer - Mod.JW].

Genalyte says validation of the test "is only weeks away," and it wants to work with the federal government to make the test available as rapidly as possible. The test is based on a proprietary silicon chip technology and run on Genalyte's Maverick Detection System testing platform. The platform is being used now to test for immune system rejection of biologic drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies... For the Ebola test, the chip is coated with antibodies that bind to the viral proteins. Blood flows directly over the chip, Gunn said... The Maverick system can process up to 100 tests per hour per instrument. Each instrument costs around USD 120 000, and the chips will cost about USD 10 each, Gunn said. The system requires standard electrical power. But the power ... can come from a generator, he said...

[Cost will be a serious limitation. Also, if deployed in West Africa, experience with expensive electronic equipment in the tropics, even inside air-conditioned premises, shows short operational life and difficulty, time and expense of repairing and replacing parts; they have to be flown out with a repair technician, who will need salary, airfare and per diem, a visa and yellow fever vaccination certificate dated at least 10 days earlier, clear customs, etc. - Mod.JW]

[4] EU: 24.4 million euros to develop vaccine against Ebola

The European Union provides EUR 24.4 million euros [USD 31 million, GBP 19 million] for research to develop a vaccine against Ebola, outgoing European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said after the 1st day of the EU summit. The research will be aimed at containing the epidemic and protecting medical personnel, 1st of all developing vaccine, he said...

Smaller EU countries have said they are ready to send healthcare workers to West Africa but lack the resources to evacuate them if they caught the disease. The EU addressed this problem this week by providing a guarantee to international health workers that they would either be flown to Europe or receive high-quality treatment on the spot if they caught the disease in West Africa...

[5] Russia: vaccine trials

Russia has launched the production of a trial batch of the Ebola vaccine Triazavirin that will be sent to Africa in the coming days for efficiency tests, head of the vaccine producer Yunona (Juno) pharmaceutical holding Alexander Petrov said on Fri [24 Oct 2014]. EU provides EUR 24.4 million [USD 31 million] to develop vaccine against Ebola. The vaccine was created by the Ural Biopharmaceutical Technology Center.

Triazavirin has been approved by the Russian Health Ministry, Petrov said. "Studies have confirmed the medicine's high efficiency against a number of viral infections, influenza, tick-borne encephalitis and exotic viruses that are common in Africa and Asia," the scientist said. Tests of Triazavirin have shown the vaccine's high efficiency (70-90 percent) against various kinds of haemorrhagic fevers, including Marburg fever, which has a close relation to Ebola...

Russia and Guinea will ink a memorandum on the fight with the Ebola virus outbreak in the coming week, Golodets said on Fri [24 Oct 2014]...

[Presumably, this is to be tested in Guinea. A field trial will have the same problems mentioned before: unknown infection/incubating status of subjects unless isolated for at least 21 days before vaccination; unknown dose of subjects virus positive before even starting, risk of serious or even fatal side-effects discrediting the vaccine, all leading to allegations that the vaccine is transmitting the virus. Then, how would the research team know the date vaccinated persons were subsequently exposed to infection? There would be ethical constraints against requiring them to work in an Ebola Treatment Unit without PPE. - Mod.JW]

As fear of Ebola infections spreads to developed economies, U.S. and British insurance companies have begun writing Ebola exclusions into standard policies to cover hospitals, event organisers and other businesses vulnerable to local disruptions. As a result, new policies and renewals will become costlier for companies opting to insure business travel to West Africa or to cover the risk of losses from quarantine shutdowns at home, industry officials told Reuters...

ACE Ltd said on Wed [22 Oct 2014] that its global casualty unit, which offers coverage for U.S.-based companies whose employees travel or that have operations abroad, was using a policy endorsement to exclude Ebola on a "case-by-case basis" during the underwriting process on new policies and renewals. "Probably the biggest issue coming up is business interruption," said Tony DeFelice, managing director of Aon Risk Solutions' national casualty practice in the United States. A business interruption could be anything from the loss of key employees to sickness to the quarantine of an airliner or cruise ship used by a suspected patient suffering from Ebola or any other serious infectious disease.
