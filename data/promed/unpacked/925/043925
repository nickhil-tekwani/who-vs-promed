[I have included two postings on the cost and incidence of foodborne
diseases worldwide. Cost and cost of control are important subjects. The
second posting is from the GIDEON software and is an excellent reference.
It is great to have all that data in one place. Unfortunately, it is
extremely long, so set your screens to scan and beam it over to your saved
files. You will probably need it one day - Thanks much to Robert and Steve

GENEVA -- The World Health Organization was cited as saying on Wednesday
that hundreds of millions of people fall victim each year to diseases like
cholera and salmonella after eating contaminated food. The United Nations
agency added that foodborne diseases were vastly under-reported, especially
by developing countries, or by authorities fearing an outbreak will damage
tourism and trade.
WHO was quoted in its World Health Statistics Quarterly as stating that,
"It is estimated that the reported incidence of foodborne diseases
represents less than 10 per cent, or maybe even less than one per cent of
the real incidence,". Surveys in a few countries indicate that foodborne
diseases may be 300-350 times more frequent than the reported cases tend to
indicate," it added, without naming the countries.
The report added that Japan and Scotland, where E.coli O157:H7 caused a
rash of deaths last year, are among countries where cases are on the increase.
Jean Buzby and Tanya Roberts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture wrote in
an article in the report that in the United States alone, seven foodborne
pathogens found in animal products cause 3.3 million-12.3 million cases of
foodborne illness and 3,900 deaths each year, at an annual cost of human
illness at $6.5 billion to $34.9 billion.
"However, these estimates undervalue true societal costs, because they
focus on medical costs and productivity losses and omit or do not fully
include valuations of other costs to individuals (such as psychological
costs), costs to industry or costs to the public sector," said the authors.

Aeromonas and Vibrio infections
- The estimated incidence for foodborne Vibrio (all species) in the United
States
is 10,000 per year (50 to 100 fatal).
- As of 1997, Vibrio vulnificus infection acquired through ingestion of raw
oysters has been reported in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia,
Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, New York State, North Carolina,
Oklahoma and South Carolina.
- 72 cases of V. vulnificus infection from raw oysters were reported from
Florida during 1981 to 1992. 36 of these patients died, making this the
most common food-related death in the state. 302 cases of V. vulnificus
infection (36% fatal) were reported from the Gulf States during 1988 to
1995 - 42% from seafood (96% of these from raw oysters), and 42% from wound
infection.
- 24 cases of V. vulnificus infection were reported for California during
1983 to 1993. 11 cases were reported for Los Angeles alone during 1993 to
1995.
Amoebiasis:
- A massive outbreak occurred in Chicago in 1933 with 1,409 cases (98
fatal). 147,975 cases were reported during 1944 to 1983 (mean 3,699/year);
2,989 in 1991 (1,419 of these from California); 2,942 in 1992; 2,970 in
1993 (1,193 from California); 2,983 in 1994 (991 from California).
- Fatal cases decreased from 614 during 1961 to 1970, to 86 during 1982 to
1991. 28 fatalities below age 5 were registered during 1968 to 1991.
- The parasite is identified in 0.9% of stool specimens submitted to state
laboratories. The estimated true prevalence for the general population is 4%.
Anisakiasis
The disease is most common in Hawaii. Gulf Coast fish and North Atlantic cod
have been implicated.
Ascariasis
Highest rates occur among children in the rural Southeast. It is estimated
that
4 million are infested.
Bacillus cereus food poisoning
Most often occurs in small clusters following ingestion of reheated rice
or other vegetables. The disease accounts for 2% of food-related disease
outbreaks with confirmed etiology reported to CDC (58 outbreaks during 1973
to 1987).
Blastocystis hominis infection
The organism is identified in 2.6% of stool specimens submitted to state
laboratories. California accounts for 72.9% of reports (this is the most
commonly identified intestinal parasite in that state).
Botulism
- 1,354 cases were reported during 1947 to 1983 (mean 36.6/year); 88 cases
(65 infant) in 1990; 108 in 1991 (81 infant; 21 from Alaska, often
involving ingestion of fermented beaver tail); 87 in 1992 (66 infant); 92
(65 infant) in 1993; 85 infant (30 in California) and 50 foodborne in 1994;
54 infant (23 in California) and 24 foodborne in 1995.
- Wound botulism in California (all from heroin injection) accounted for
21% of adult botulism in 1994. 124 food-related outbreaks were registered
during 1976 to 1984.
- Fatal cases decreased from 66 during 1961 to 1970, to 29 during 1982 to
1991.
Brucellosis
- Human disease in this country is due to Brucella abortus, suis,
melitensis and canis. A marine pathogen (B. maris) has been isolated in
this country, and may be potentially pathogenic for humans.
- The peak reporting year was 1947 (6,321 cases).
- The mean incidence during 1944 to 1953 was 4,214 per year; 827 per year
during 1954 to 1963; 305 per year during 1964 to 1973; 221 per year during
1974
to 1983.
- Fatal cases decreased from 51 during 1961 to 1970, to 7 during 1982 to
1991.
- 85 cases were reported in 1990; 104 in 1991; 105 in 1992; 120 in 1993;
119 in 1994; 98 in 1995 (29 from California); 94 in 1996; 25 first half of
1997.
- 426 cases were reported from California during 1973 to 1992 (78.7% of
these due to B. melitensis). Infection trends in this state have shifted from
occupational to foodborne during this period.
Campylobacteriosis
- Campylobacter is the leading cause of fooborne infection in the United
States.
The estimated incidence is 4 million cases and 200 to 1,000 fatal cases per
year. Sporadic cases are most common during summer and often acquired from
poultry products. Outbreaks are most common during spring and fall and
associated with ingestion of contaminated milk or water. Three waterborne
outbreaks (223 cases) were reported during 1993 to 1994.
Cholera
- Shell fish is usually implicated in autochthonous cases (most often Gulf
Coast.
- No cases were reported during 1911 to 1965; 136 during 1965 to 1991 (3
fatal) -
93 of these locally-acquired. 26 (9 imported, 0 fatal) in 1991; 103 (100
imported, 1 fatal) in 1992 - including 64 from California and 75 passengers
on an airline flight from South America; 22 (19 imported) during 1993
(including one infection by V. cholerae O139 from India); 47 (45 imported -
2 V. cholerae 0139) in 1994; 23
(imported, nonfatal) in 1995; 4 (0 fatal) in 1996; 3 first half of 1997.
- Six cases (imported) of V. cholerae 0139 infection were reported during
1992 to
1994.
Clostridial food poisoning
190 food-related outbreaks were registered during 1973 to 1987.
Cryptosporidiosis
- In 1993, an outbreak of approximately 403,000 [!] cases (4,400
hospitalized) in
the Milwaukee area was traced to a contaminated water supply - this was the
largest American waterborne disease outbreak ever described.
- Four additional outbreaks were registered during 1993 to 1994, involving
271 cases. 2,361 cases were reported (not all states report) in 1996; 581
first half of 1997.
- The parasite is identified in 0.5% of stool specimens submitted to state
laboratories, and 65% to 97% of surface water sampled nationwide.
Cyclospora infection
- An outbreak in Chicago during 1990 affected 17 physicians and three
hospital employees, and was traced to contaminated drinking water.
- Outbreaks in at least 15 states during May to June 1996, involved 1,270
cases (978 laboratory-confirmed in the United Sates - including New York
307, Florida 220, Massachusetts 170, New Jersey 103) and were ascribed to
raspberries (imported
from Guatemala) and other fruit. The raspberries are thought to have been
contaminated by water used in pesticide sprays.
- An outbreak during March to April 1997 involved 220 clinical cases (four
of these laboratory confirmed)
- 21 event-associated case clusters were reported from eight states
(California,
Florida, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, New York and Texas) and
Canada (Ontario) during April to June 1997, and involved approximately 370
clinical cases (140 of these laboratory-confirmed). Fresh raspberries,
imported
from Guatemala, had been served in 19 of the 21 outbreaks. An additional 70
sporadic laboratory-confirmed sporadic cases were reported for the United
States
and Canada during this period.
- 26 clusters (239 cases) were reported during June to July 1997 from
Virginia,
Washington DC and Baltimore - fresh basil was implicated as the source
Dientamoebal diarrhea
The organism is identified in 0.5% of stool specimens submitted to state
laboratories. California accounts for 55.8% of reports.
Diphyllobothriasis
Most cases occur in Michigan, Minnesota, California, Florida and Alaska
(natives). Diphyllobothrium alascense is occasionally found in Eskimos.
Escherichia coli diarrhea
- Escherichia coli O157:H7 was isolated in 0.39% (range 0.07% to 2.13%) of
diarrheal stools in a multicenter survey conducted during 1990 to 1992 -
isolation rates were 0.13% in the South and 0.57% in the North. The true
national incidence is estimated at 725,000 per year, with 100 to 200
fatalities.
- A major outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis involving 501 cases (151
hospitalized, 4 fatal) in Washington State during 1992 to 1993 was traced
to hamburger.
- E. coli O157:H7 is a leading cause of bloody diarrhea and of
childhood renal failure in this country. 204 children below age 5 died of E.
coli diarrhea during 1968 to 1991.
- 10,000 to 20,000 annual infections are estimated. 16 outbreaks were
reported during 1993, and 11 during January to June 1994. 1,420 cases of E.
coli O157:H7 infection were reported in 1994; 2,139 in 1995; 2,705 in 1996;
615 first half of 1997.
- 21 cases of post-diarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome were reported
during the first half of 1997.
- Unpasteurized apple juice was implicated in three outbreaks (and one
fatality)
during 1996.
- Alfalfa sprouts were responsible for 60 cases in Michigan (25
hospitalized; 2 HUS; none fatal) and 48 cases (11 hospitalized) in Virginia
during 1997.
- An outbreak of 15 cases during 1997 resulted in a massive recall of
commercially-distributed frozen beef patties.
Fascioliasis
A single U.S. case (1984) was published in the world's literature during
1969 to 1989. The local reservoirs are Lymnaea collumella, Fossaria
bulimoides and Fo.
cubensis. Fo. cllula carries Fasciola gigantica in Hawaii.
Giardiasis
This is the most common water-borne pathogen identified in this country;
and as many as 60% of giardia infections are acquired from water (1987).
The organism is present in 7.2% of stools submitted to state laboratories.
Highest rates are reported from the Middle Atlantic states. Rates peak in
September in all regions. 90 outbreaks (23,500 cases) were registered
during 1965 to 1984. 100 water-related outbreaks were reported during 1972
to 1990, and 5 outbreaks (385 cases) during 1993 to 1994. It is estimated
that 4,600 were hospitalized for this disease annually during 1979 to 1988.
Hepatitis A
- Hepatitis A accounts for approximately 40% of viral hepatitis in this
country, and was the fifth leading reportable infectious disease in 1995.
Almost 40% of the population are seropositive (10% below age 5 years and
75% above age 50 years).
- 20 water-related outbreaks were registered during 1972 to 1990. A
multistate outbreak during March 1997 was related to imported (from Mexico)
strawberries.
- 270,385 cases were reported during 1974 to 1983; 25,280 in 1987; 28,507
in 1988; 35,821 in 1989; 31,441 in 1990; 24,378 in 1991; 23,112 in 1992;
24,238 in 1993; 26,796 in 1994; 31,582 in 1995 (21.3% from California);
28,507 in 1996; 13,347 first half of 1997.
- 769 fatal cases were reported during 1982 to 1991.
Hepatitis E
Outbreaks are occasionally reported. Antibody is present in 0.54% of healthy
blood donors.
Listeriosis
- The disease is found nationwide, and accounts for 2% to 3% of bacterial
meningitis episodes.
- The estimated incidence was 1,965 in 1989 (481 fatal) and 1,092 in 1993
(248 fatal).
- An outbreak in Massachusetts in 1983 involved 49 cases (4 fatal, 7
perinatal) - milk was implicated but not proven.
- An outbreak in California in 1985 involving 142 cases (48 fatal, 93
perinatal) was traced to contaminated soft cheese.
- An outbreak in Philadelphia during 1986 to 1987 involved 36 cases (16
fatal, 4
perinatal) - source unknown.
- Contaminated hommus (chickpea paste) was implicated in an outbreak during
1997.
- The rate of perinatal disease decreased from 17.4/100,000 births in 1989, to
8.6/100,000 in 1993.
Metorchiasis
Potential for human disease exists. The parasite is found in carnivores
from South Carolina to the Northwest Territories.
Nanophyetiasis
Sporadic cases are encountered in the Pacific Northwest coastal region.
This is the most common systemic trematode in North America.
Paragonimiasis
Two autochthonous cases were described (Georgia and Missouri) due to
Paragonimus
kellicotti.
Rotavirus infection

The disease is responsible for 70,000 to 120,000 infant hospitalizations
and 200
infant deaths yearly.
Salmonellosis
- 548,017 cases were reported during 1944 to 1983 (rates increasing from 5
to 20/100,000 during this period); 48,603 cases in 1990; 48,154 in 1991;
40,912 in 1992; 41,641 in 1993; 43,323 in 1994; 45,970 in 1995 (the 4th
leading reported infectious disease that year). The true incidence is 2
million cases (500 to 2,000 fatal cases) per year.
- During the 1,990's, Salmonella enteritidis was the most common human
pathogen, followed by S. typhimurium and S. heidelberg. S. enteritidis
accounted for 5% of isolates in 1976, 26% in 1994 and 25% in 1995.
- Grade-A eggs accounted for 82% of S. enteritidis infections during 1985
to 1991.
- S. typhimurium accounted for most human infections during the early
1960's, and less than 20% during the 1990's. Salmonella serotype
Typhimurium Definitive Type 104 (DT 104) has been emerging as a significant
pathogen since the first outbreak (Nebraska) was reported in 1996.
- 790 food-related outbreaks of salmonellosis were registered during 1973
to 1987. An outbreak (751 cases identified) of S. typhimurium infection in
Oregon during 1984 was ascribed to intentional contamination of restaurant
salad bars.
- A single water-borne outbreak (Salmonella typhimurium) was reported
during 1993
to 1994. The outbreak encompassed 625 cases (7 fatal) in Missouri.
- 721 deaths were ascribed to this disease during 1961 to 1970, and 883

32,080 in
1995 (making this the 6th leading reported infectious disease that year).
- 790 food-related outbreaks were registered during 1973 to 1987, and 25
water-related outbreaks during 1972 to 1990. Two waterborne outbreaks (260
cases)
were reported during 1993 to 1994.

implicated
in 10 cases in Idaho in 1995.
- 21% of Alaskan lynx (Felis lynx) are infested with Trichinella nativa.
Trichostrongyliasis
Cases are described in Hawaii.
Trichuriasis
The disease is most common in the rural southeast, and identified in 1.2%
of stool specimens submitted to state laboratories.
