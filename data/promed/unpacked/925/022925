Avian Flu Infection Now Affecting 25 Farms in B.C. as Slaughter
Continues - Canada
-------------------------
The number of farms infected with avian flu inside British
Columbia's Fraser Valley high-risk area has increased to 25,
officials said Mon 12 Apr 2004.

But the increase, with 3 new infected sites since Fri 9 Apr, is not a
surprise, said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).

Agency spokesman Blaine Thompson said a flock of 10 000 birds
was reported Mon 12 Apr to be infected.

The farm was outside the surveillance area around Abbotsford,
about 60 kilometers east of Vancouver, but inside the general
control zone, he said.

The infection was found as part of a pre-slaughter check.

"There's obviously still some active virus out there that's still
moving around and getting into these barns," Thompson said. "It's
not surprising we found this one. There may be a few more [found]
through the pre-slaughter surveillance."

Thompson said the disease's spread will slow as more birds are
slaughtered. 4 known infected flocks remain to be slaughtered, he
said. As of Mon 12 Apr, more than 500 000 birds had been
slaughtered.

Both the Fraser Valley and Lower Mainland area that covers
Vancouver's outlying suburbs have been established as a control
zone for the outbreak.

An order was signed Sat 10 Apr under the provincial Emergency
Program Act to allow officials to eradicate the infection and
dispose of carcasses either through burying in landfills, incineration
or biological decomposition at the Fraser Valley farms.

Producers seemed satisfied that the killing of some 19 million birds
will contain the outbreak.

Rick Thiessen, president of the B.C. Chicken Growers
Association, had not heard of the further infections until Mon 12
Apr but is hopeful the cull will halt any further spread of the disease.
"We need to keep on with aggressive depopulation in order to
contain and stamp out the disease," he said. "It's an enormous
task. We just have to stay the course."

That task includes separating the infected birds from the rest of the
population, with the healthy ones sent to market.

Carcasses of infected birds are being destroyed at incinerators at
the Greater Vancouver Regional District operation in suburban
Burnaby and the Similko Mine between Hope and Princeton, east
of Vancouver. Others are being biologically decomposed at farms,
while more are being shipped in sealed containers to landfills in
Chilliwack and Cache Creek.

Officials stressed that the movement of carcasses will be done in
accordance with strict agency protocols to ensure health concerns
are met. But, say Cache Creek Mayor John Ranta and nearby
Ashcroft Mayor Andy Kormendy, their landfill is not equipped to
deal with hazardous and special waste.

The highly pathogenic H7N3 virus infecting Fraser Valley flocks has
been found in large commercial poultry operations and in some
backyard flocks.

The proximity of the outbreak to Washington State's Sumas poultry,
cattle and dairy region has caught the attention of the United States'
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

"I've been told that CFIA at very high levels have been in contact
with high levels of the (United States Department of Agriculture),"
Thiessen said. Thompson said the U.S. Agriculture Department is
receiving daily briefings on the situation.

Fraser Valley and Lower Mainland poultry production represents
about 80 percent of the province's 600 poultry producers. The
industry generates about USD 1 billion per year in revenue and
employs more than 5000 people. While the crisis has cost the
industry in excess of USD 10 million so far, Thiessen said no
compensation package has yet been offered to producers.

"There have still been no specifics from the federal or provincial
governments," he said. "We're hopeful some word will come soon.
It's a trying time for everyone in the industry. We don't know how
long it's going to last and when we can re-populate."

Owners of Parrots and Pigeons Seek Stay of Execution in Canada
Bird Cull
-----------------------------------------------
Exotic bird owners are crying foul, as parrots, racing pigeons,
budgies, fancy hens, and ostriches are threatened by an order to
cull 19 million poultry in order to stamp out avian flu in western
Canada. "It's absolutely foolish, because these birds are all
endangered species, and you can't just go around hacking them to
death," said Wendy Huntbatch, president of For the Love of
Parrots rescue society.

The cull of turkeys, ducks, chickens and other birds was ordered on
Mon 12 Apr 2004, in a bid to halt the spread of highly contagious
bird-flu, which has now been found on 20 poultry farms. Exotic bird
owners say they will fight to have their birds excluded from the
execution order, arguing that it is over the top.

"The chance of the virus passing to parrots is very remote," said
Huntbatch, who looks after 400 parrots. "We've retained a lawyer,
and we'll fight them tooth and nail. There is no way I'll let (officials)
on my property," she said, pledging to block her gates with hundreds
of supporters from across North America.

Local racing pigeon owners have also hired a lawyer to defend
their 50 000 pigeons worth CAD 25 to 17 000 [USD 19 to 12 900]
each, some that have raced home from as far away as Alberta or
California in competitions. "The decision is totally unfair. We've got
documentation from vets that pigeons don't get this disease," said
Trey Coulson of the North Road Racing Pigeon Society which
represents over 200 pigeon owners who plan to lock down their
birds until the disease threat has passed.

Officials will consider exemptions if owners can prove that their
birds are not at risk of contracting and spreading avian influenza,
but say a billion-dollar poultry industry is at stake, and the
bird-flu must be contained.

"[We are] going to approach these specialty birds with an
abundance of caution and make sure that none of these birds
could possibly be harboring avian influenza virus and, down the
road, be a potential source of a future outbreak," said Cornelius
Kiley, of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

Family pets kept indoors will not be put down, he said.
