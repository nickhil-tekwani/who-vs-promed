During an inter-ministerial meeting with representatives of the Russian Federation today (13 Jan 2014), it was revealed that 2 cases of African swine fever [ASF] have been reported from the Luhansk oblast [region of Ukraine], near the border with Russia.

According to the press service of the regional State Service for Emergency Situations ["GSCHS"], units stationed in the border areas have been put on alert. "In the event of an outbreak of the plague [ASF], increased services will be provided by other units," said the administration.

The 1st ASF incident was reported on 5 Jan 2014. The specialised diagnostic laboratory of the State Scientific Research Institute confirmed the diagnosis of ASF after analyses of samples collected from the corpse of a dead wild boar, found in the river Derkul separating the territories of Ukraine and Russia. 3 villages in the region have been put under quarantine.

[Luhansk oblast (region) is situated in east Ukraine, bordering the Rostov oblast of the Russian Federation; see political map at http://www.mapsofworld.com/ukraine/ukraine-political-map.html. It is not clear if the new (suspected?) cases have been recorded in domestic swine or in wild boars.

On 8 Jan 2014, Ukraine reported to the OIE the discovery of an ASF-infected wild boar, in the river Derkul. The locations of the said case, of the previous ASF case in (south) Ukraine (September 2012), and of ASF outbreaks in the region and particularly in neighbouring Rostov oblast, since 2011, can be seen on OIE's map at http://tinyurl.com/q2pmbbb (click on eastern Ukraine; when centered, zoom in).

A confirmation -- or otherwise -- of new ASF cases in Luhansk will be appreciated. In case confirmed, additional information is requested, including the identity -- domestic pig or wild boars -- of the affected swine. - Mod.AS
