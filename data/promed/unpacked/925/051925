The Supreme Council of Health (SCH) said Friday [6 Sep 2013] that a patient with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) had recovered but reported the death of a national afflicted with the virus.

The 1st patient felt the symptoms while abroad. Upon his arrival on [15 Aug 2013], he was checked up upon and diagnosed with the disease, but later recovered, SCH said.

The 2nd patient, who suffers from one chronic disease and several risk factors, felt the symptoms on [17 Aug 2013]. He was in a critical condition in the intensive care unit and died today [Fri 6 Sep 2013], it added.

The SCH emphasized that surveillance and monitoring procedures are always being tightened up, and infection control for all cases of acute respiratory infections are also being tightened up, stressing continuing to check up on all those who have had exposure to confirmed cases in cooperation with Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and other medical service providers.

[4] Qatar - increase in febrile respiratory illness
Date: 8 Sep 2013

Doctors and clinics have seen a rise in the number of cases that exhibit "flu-like symptoms" in Doha. This comes within the backdrop of the reported spread of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the region.

The MERS-CoV, which can cause coughing, fever, and pneumonia, emerged in Saudi Arabia last year [2012] and has been reported in some other Gulf states, France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and Britain [all cases to date can be epidemiologically linked to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Jordan].

The MERS virus so far has killed 50 people out of 108 confirmed cases of infections worldwide.

"A noticeable number of patients are coming to the clinic with high fever nowadays," a general practitioner in Doha, said. "I usually prescribe medications or give an injection that will help stop the high temperature, but if I suspect that they have a viral infection, I could prescribe them with antibiotics [antibiotics are not effective in treating viral infections. - Mod.MPP] and ask them to come back for a follow-up the next day."

The doctor said that once a patient suffering from high fever shows no sign of improvement even after a 2nd visit, he refers the case to the Hamad General Hospital (HGH).

"Once I realise that the patient's condition is not improving, even after taking antibiotics [antibiotics are not effective in treating viral infections - Mod.MPP], I immediately refer them to HGH for further investigation in order to know the actual cause of their ill health, and I have had quite a number of cases," he said.

Another general practitioner in a private clinic, who preferred not to be named, said: "We see many cases of people of all ages falling sick with flu and common cold nowadays. While we treat those with mild symptoms, we usually refer those with very strong symptoms to the Infectious Diseases unit at Hamad Medical Corporation."

However, both doctors could not confirm whether the flu-like infection they see in their patients is MERS-CoV, as their clinics do not have the testing facility for the virus.

Qatar announced the 3rd death due to MERS-CoV on Friday [6 Sep 2013]. "I visited my clinic yesterday [7 Sep 2013] for a check up and medication refill and was surprised to see many people suffering from flu waiting to see the doctor at the reception. The scene really got me thinking about MERS-CoV for a moment," an expatriate said.

The Supreme Council of Health has set up hotline numbers 66740951 and 66740948 for anyone with questions regarding MERS-CoV.

[One suspects that this may be the beginning of the ILI (influenza-like illness) season in the Middle East. ProMED-mail has also received a comment from a reliable source that there is a similar observation in Saudi Arabia, an increase in ILI coming to the attention of the health sector. The challenge will be determining how much (if any) of this may be attributable to MERS-CoV infection. As clinically milder cases and asymptomatic infections are being identified (in contact tracing activities surrounding documented cases), it is apparent that not all infections with the MERS-CoV result in severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). - Mod.MPP]

[5] Global update - WHO

WHO has been informed of 4 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia.

The 1st case is a 41-year-old female healthcare worker from Riyadh with no known underlying medical conditions who became ill on [15 Aug 2013]. Her condition deteriorated, and she passed away at the end of August [2013]. No known exposure to animals or to a confirmed MERS-CoV case has been identified, and investigations into the source of infection are ongoing.

The 2nd case is a 30-year-old Saudi male healthcare worker from Riyadh, working in the same hospital as the above confirmed case. He developed severe pneumonia on [1 Sep 2013] and is currently in critical condition.

The 3rd case is a 79-year-old woman from Hafar al-Batin province who developed a respiratory illness on [21 Aug 2013]. She is a contact of a confirmed MERS-CoV case in a family cluster. Her condition deteriorated, and she passed away on [2 Sep 2013].

The 4th case is a 47-year-old Saudi man from Hafar al-Batin province with a chronic heart condition who became ill on [23 Aug 2013]. He is a contact of a confirmed MERS-CoV case in a family cluster. He is currently in critical condition.

Globally, from September 2012 to date [7 Sep 2013], WHO has been informed of a total of 114 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 54 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not, at present, been met.

[This moderator continues to face a challenge in keeping the tallies of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection "correct." The various sources of information announcing newly confirmed cases and deaths include the Ministries of Health, the WHO updates, and newswires. At times, it is next to impossible to reconcile the various sources, as the information is not always clear; sometimes early reports appear in Arabic and do not appear in English for a period of time afterwards, when more information may be available and may have changed from earlier reports.

This moderator (and colleagues) have found the most current line listing of confirmed cases/infection with the MERS-CoV has been publicly maintained by FluTrackers and can be found at: http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=205075. According to their most current count, there have now been a total of 124 laboratory confirmed infections with the MERS-CoV reported globally. Adding the newly reported deaths as mentioned in the reports from the Saudi MOH (3) and the Qatari Supreme Council of Health (1) to previous tallies, there have now been 59 deaths associated with MERS-CoV infection.

The newly reported cases in Saudi Arabia over the past week have indicated the existence of a "family" cluster of cases in Hafar al-Batin. There is mention of additional cases associated with contact with the family cluster, but it is not clear that these individuals were part of the family or perhaps had contact elsewhere such as in a health facility. In addition, in the Fri 6 Sep 2013 ProMED post (MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (67): Saudi Arabia, WHO 20130906.1928088, and reported in the WHO update above), there were 2 health care workers in Saudi Arabia who were confirmed to have SARI attributable to MERS-CoV infection, suggesting there may be nosocomial transmission in Riyadh.
