Ebola virus disease update -- West Africa
-----------------------------------------
As of 6 Aug 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 4 countries stands at 1779, including 961 deaths.
The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows:
- Guinea, 495 cases (355 confirmed, 133 probable, and 7 suspected), including 367 deaths;
- Liberia, 554 cases (148 confirmed, 274 probable, and 132 suspected), including 294 deaths;
- Nigeria, 13 cases (0 confirmed, 7 probable, and 6 suspected), including 2 deaths;
- Sierra Leone, 717 cases (631 confirmed, 38 probable, and 48 suspected), including 298 deaths.

[As far as Nigeria is concerned, they have confirmed several of their cases in their own labs, but apparently they can't convince any courier to take the specimens abroad to an international reference laboratory. - Mod.JW]

Between 5-6 Aug 2014, 68 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) of EVD [including] 29 deaths were reported from the 4 countries as follows:
- Guinea, 0 new cases and 4 deaths;
- Liberia, 38 new cases and 12 deaths;
- Nigeria, 4 new cases and 1 death;
- Sierra Leone, 26 new cases and 12 deaths.

On Mon 11 Aug 2014, WHO will convene a panel of medical ethics experts to begin looking at the use of experimental treatments in the ongoing EVD outbreak in West Africa. At this time, there are no registered medicines or vaccines against this deadly virus; several experimental options are currently under development, though. The recent treatment of 2 health workers from US faith-based aid organizations has raised questions about whether medicines that have never been tested or shown to be safe in humans should be used in outbreak situations. In the case of EVD, supplies are extremely limited, which then raises questions about who should receive it, if it's used.

[A table showing confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of 6 Aug 2014 is available at the source URL above.]

The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on best available information reported by Ministries of Health.

[3] Media reports
Uganda: false alarm
-------------------
8 Aug 2014: Uganda said Friday (8 Aug 2014) a man put in isolation with fever had tested negative for the deadly tropical disease Ebola. "The results came in and it is not a case," said health ministry spokeswoman Rukia Nakamatte. The patient was stopped as he arrived in Uganda's main Entebbe airport showing signs of fever, after arriving from neighbouring South Sudan, where no cases of the Ebola virus have been reported...

Ethiopia, Kenya boost anti-Ebola measures
------------------------------------------
3 Aug 2014: Kenya and Ethiopia, home to some of Africa's largest transport hubs, said Thursday [7 Aug 2014] they had boosted measures to combat possible EVD cases arriving in their countries... Ethiopia's national carrier is a major airline connecting countries across Africa, as well as flying to the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East...

Ghana: flights normal
---------------------
2 Aug 2014: "The Ghana Civil Aviation Authority's [GCAA] attention has been drawn to an online publication on the above subject on Sat 2 Aug 2014 [Ebola: Ghana bans all flight form Nigeria, others] and we wish to state emphatically that the publication is erroneous and misleading. GCAA, as the sole regulator of the air transport industry and provider of air navigation service in the country, has not banned any airline from Nigeria and other African countries from operating to Ghana because of suspicion that the flights might be carrying passengers with the Ebola virus. We can confirm that flight operations to and from Nigeria and other African countries are normal without any interruption. The Ghana Civil Aviation Authority wishes to assure passengers and the general public that it is working with all stakeholders to ensure that the Kotoka International Airport and all other airports in the country remain safe and secure."

Malawi: report officially denied
--------------------------------
8 Aug 2014: The Minister of Health has dismissed rumours hovering around in the social media that Ebola has been registered in Malawi. On Wednesday [6 Aug 2014], news was all over Facebook pages that Malawi has registered the 1st Ebola case with the patient being admitted to ABC Clinic in Lilongwe. Chief of Health Services in the Ministry of Health, Dr Charles Mwansambo, dismissed the rumours on Wednesday [6 Aug 2014] in Lilongwe during a press briefing. In his speech, Mwansambo said this is just a mere speculation and he further called for people to treat the matter with caution and seriousness as Ebola is not just an ordinary disease.

India: suspected contact being followed up
------------------------------------------
8 Aug 2014: Health officials are keeping a close watch on a Delhi resident who arrived from Ghana on a flight in which a passenger tested positive for the deadly ebolavirus ravaging west Africa. The man's 2 housemates are also under surveillance. The Dwarka resident ... is being monitored since 21 Jul 2014, 2 days after he reached the Capital, but has not shown any symptoms of the highly contagious haemorrhagic fever. "We were alerted by the WHO about him being exposed to the disease. His co-passenger on the flight had tested positive for EVD. Our surveillance units tracked him down and also examined people living with him," a health ministry official said. The man flew from the Ghanaian capital Accra to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and then to Delhi. No EVD cases have been reported from Ghana or Ethiopia, so far. "Since none of them have shown any symptoms so far, we didn't get them tested. We have asked them to watch out for any symptoms," said the official.

India: returning from Liberia
-----------------------------
8 Aug 2014: The situation in Liberia, where ebolavirus has claimed many lives, is grim. Gentle nods of the heads have replaced handshakes. Many people wash their hands once in 15 minutes. About 1000 Indians work in Liberia. Many are planning to return home by next week. Wilfred D'Souza, from Surathkal, who works for a Singapore-based timber company, is flying home from Monrovia on Monday night [11 Aug 2014]. "The situation is more than scary. All hospitals have closed since they are getting only EVD patients and none of the medical staff wants to treat them. People are queuing up at medical shops. Paracetamol formulations are being sold 10 times their price," he says.

India: 24-hour EVD helpline
---------------------------
8 Aug 2014: The 24-hour 'Emergency Operation Centre' will be functional from [9 Aug 2014] and its numbers are 011-23061469, 3205 and 1302, the ministry said.

[I just called the 1st number on 9 Aug 2014 and got a very quick reply. They say they are getting lots of calls. - Mod.JW]

Asia: precautions
-----------------
8 Aug 2014: China, there were no reports of EVD cases but hospitals have been told to report any suspected cases.

India, which has nearly 45 000 citizens living and working in the 4 affected countries, said it would screen travelers passing through, or starting journeys there, when they returned. "The surveillance system would be geared up to track these travelers for 4 weeks and detect them early, in case they develop symptoms," Health Minister Harsh Vardhan told parliament on Wed [6 Aug 2014].

Japan is ready to send suspected EVD victims to special isolation hospitals, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference.

In Australia authorities said they had not taken extra steps but airports were on alert for sick travelers, saying the risk of the disease reaching the country was "very low".

Officials in Singapore said the city state, praised for its tough measures against the SARS outbreak that claimed 33 lives in 2003, also faced only a low threat from the Ebola virus. "Measures are already in place to carry out contact tracing and quarantine all close contacts if there is a case," the health ministry said.

In Thailand, health official Opart said 21 travelers would stay under observation for the entire incubation period, which can last up to 21 days. "Even though Ebola is only a small risk to Thailand we are not taking any chances," he said.

Malaysia: no ban on pilgrimage to Mecca
---------------------------------------
8 Aug 2014: Muslims [in Malaysia] can still make their annual pilgrimage to Mecca despite the death of a suspected EVD patient in Saudi Arabia, minister Datuk Seri Jamil Khir Baharom confirmed today [8 Aug 2014]. When asked if the country's arrangements for the Haj or the Muslim pilgrimage would be affected, the minister in charge of Islamic affairs said: "No". Jamil Khir also dispelled fears over the possibility of Malaysians catching the Ebola virus in Saudi Arabia, saying the authorities there are already well-prepared to deal with and prevent the spread of the disease.
http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malaysians-can-still-perform-hajj-despite-suspected-ebola-death-minister-sa#sthash.d6cDRPU0.dpuf

[So far Malaysia has not reported a suspected case of EVD. But let us hope screening for symptoms in pilgrims is effective both on departure from West African countries and on arrival in Saudi Arabia. Are all nationals of the 4 affected West African countries being denied pilgrim visas, or are those who live abroad exempt from the ban? - Mod.JW]

Canada: suspected case
----------------------
8 Aug 2014: Doctors in a Toronto-area hospital are treating a man who was admitted Friday [8 Aug 2014] with EVD-like symptoms. The man, who recently returned from Nigeria, arrived at the emergency department of Brampton Civic Hospital with a fever and flu-like symptoms. His blood sample will likely go to Winnipeg to be tested at the National Microbiology Laboratory. Dr Eileen de Villa, the assistant medical officer of health for Peel Region, cautioned that there has been no diagnosis yet.
