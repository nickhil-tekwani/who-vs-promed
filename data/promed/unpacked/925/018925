Uganda's ministry of health on [Tue 24 Oct 2017] said 2 health workers in the eastern part of the country have developed signs of the deadly Marburg fever.

Jane Aceng, minister of health, told reporters that the health workers interacted with the index case which died on [11 Oct 2017] at Kapchorwa hospital. "Blood samples have been obtained and sent to Uganda Virus Research Institute for testing," said Aceng, noting that in the interim, the health workers have been isolated and are being monitored.

The number of cumulative cases currently stands at 2 - with one confirmed and one probable case, according to the ministry. The minister said a total of 155 people who got into contact with the index case are being monitored.

The last Marburg outbreak in Uganda was reported in central and western parts of the east African country in 2014.

Marburg is a severe and highly fatal disease caused by a virus from the same family as the one that causes Ebola hemorrhagic fever, according to the World Health Organization. According to the global health body, the illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with severe headache and malaise.

[The case numbers are now clear. The confirmed index case is the 50 year old woman who died. She had nursed her 42-year-old brother and was involved with preparation of his body for burial; he died on 25 Sep 2017 with similar signs and symptoms. He is a probable case. There are also 2 health care workers who had contact with the index cases and are now classified as suspected cases. These health care workers likely did not suspect Marburg virus disease early in the course of the index case's disease and did not use personal protective equipment. This is not surprising, since patients presenting with febrile disease in Africa are often presumed to have malaria. Isolation of these workers is prudent while laboratory test results are awaited.
