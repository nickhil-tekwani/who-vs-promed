[According to information found in the latest OIE 6-monthly report from Tunisia, January-June 2015 (see http://tinyurl.com/oly5ugo), West Nile fever was a disease that was reported as "suspected," that is, it was suspected to occur, but had not been confirmed until now.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, Chapter 2.1.20, West Nile fever at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.20_WEST_NILE.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans and horses, causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs, while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses.

WNV has a wide geographical range that includes portions of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia (Kunjin virus) and in North, Central and South America. Migratory birds are thought to be primarily responsible for virus dispersal, including reintroduction of WNV from endemic areas into regions that experience sporadic outbreaks. WNV is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle, whereas humans and horses are considered dead end hosts." - Mod.CRD
