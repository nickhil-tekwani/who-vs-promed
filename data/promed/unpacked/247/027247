<http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Hundreds%20of%20dead%20birds%20cause%20consternation%20in%20Turku%20Archipelago/1135219822281>

Hundreds of dead birds have turned up on the small island of Jurmo,
in the outer reaches of the Turku Archipelago.
The dead birds, which are predominantly wood pigeons and lapwings,
began appearing around Easter. Also among the dead are around 24
swans, but no other water birds appear to be affected, according to
islanders.
The deaths are unprecedented, according to islanders, but as yet
there is no certainty over the cause of the birds' demise: none of
the dead birds have been taken to the mainland for analysis.
The islanders have collected dozens of dead birds from their yards
and gardens and have either incinerated them or buried them.
Thus far the dead birds have not been sent anywhere for analysis,
since the postal service has refused to accept them and the locals
have had no opportunity to have them sent by courier for examination
on the mainland.
Naturally, in a climate where avian influenza remains a hot topic, in
spite of a lack of previous evidence that it has made landfall in
Finland, the local population would very much like to know what it is
that has caused the mass deaths of these birds.
It is quite possible that the birds succumbed to something quite
other than avian flu. According to statements from islanders, the
birds were so weak prior to their deaths that they were unable to
fly, and simply ran away from people as best they could.
The first bodies began to appear around Easter, and in the last week
or so no new carcasses have been found. Many of the dead birds are
nevertheless still to be seen where they died, including a large swan
that is visible close to the guest harbour on the remote little
island (see map).
Pirjo Matteson says she has lived on Jurmo for 27 years but has never
seen anything like this before. She claims to have counted 32 dead
pigeons and lapwings already before Easter.
Bjorn Lindstrom, another resident, says he has incinerated 49 birds.
He also offered a figure of 25 for the number of dead swans. The
regional veterinary officer was supposed to come to inspect the dead
birds, but could not get to the island because of the difficult
spring ice conditions.
On Monday, Pauli Kuoppamaki collected 2 fresh pigeon carcasses with a
view to taking them for analysis. Kuoppamaki said he would be taking
them directly to the Finnish Food Safety Authority EVIRA for study.
He expressed annoyance with the apparent indifference of the
authorities to the matter.
According to the regional veterinary officer Tapio Manninen, the
Finnish authorities are aware of the deaths of the pigeons and
lapwings, but the news of the swans came as a surprise. Manninen
believes the cause of death of the smaller birds is more likely to
have been extreme cold earlier in the spring -- when there were a
number of very sharp night-frosts. Such deaths are by no means
unheard of at this time of year.
