[This is the 1st time that low pathogenicity avian influenza subtype H5N2 has been identified in Belize.

Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds.

Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453.

The OIE Terrestrial Code Chapter 10.4 on Infection with Avian Influenza Viruses, Article 10.4.1 defines "poultry" as "all domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose. Birds that are kept in captivity for any reason other than those reasons referred to in the preceding paragraph, including those that are kept for shows, racing, exhibitions, competitions or for breeding or selling these categories of birds as well as pet birds, are not considered to be poultry." http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.4.htm. - Mod.CRD
