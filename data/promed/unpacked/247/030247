A mysterious disease [thought to be vectorborne] has gripped several
villages of Indian State of Orissa's coastal district Kendrapara and
doctors suspect migrant labourers and truck drivers to be the suspected
carriers. There have been widespread reports of the disease in all the 9
blocks of the district. Since the past one month, more than 1000 people,
including children, were infected by the mystery fever, Hindustan Times
reported quoting Health Department sources. Doctors said the disease
afflicting the people could either be chikungunya or dengue and it comes
under highly infectious category of fever. This region records annual
exodus of its human resources to country's other parts in search of employment.

[Since local physicians have speculated that the disease could be either
dengue or chikungunya, this is presumed to be a febrile disease, although
no symptoms are mentioned, nor is the basis for concluding that the disease
is vectorborne mentioned. Dengue is active in the adjacent state of West
Bengal (ProMED-mail archive no. 20081104.3459), and a chikungunya outbreak
occurred there last month (Oct 2008; ProMED archive no. 20081014.3248).
Highly mobile individuals such as itinerant laborers or truck drivers could
certainly disseminate either virus to areas where _Aedes_ mosquitoes,
vectors of both viruses, are abundant. ProMED-mail requests additional
information about the disease, results of diagnostic tests carried out, and
any control measure being implemented.
