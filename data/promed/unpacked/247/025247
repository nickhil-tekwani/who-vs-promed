20 new diseases of tuber, vegetable, and fruit crops have emerged in the country in the past 7 years. Most important are the ones affecting potato, quinoa, maize, and fruit trees.

Quinoa is affected by mildew and anthracnose, which reduce yield and quality of the produce.

Potato is affected by powdery scab, which damages the plant and makes the tubers rot, as well as by bacterial wilt, which blackens the leaves.

Maize, wheat, oat, and barley are affected by leaf blight, which leads to wilting, as well as [a disease] which damages the leaves.

Fruit rot was detected in tomato, and mildew in onions.

Carrots, lucerne [alfalfa], and some cut flower crops are also affected by mildews which damage the plant and the blossoms.

In fruit trees, _Oidium_ fungi are causing white spots on peach fruit as well as [a range of] rotting diseases.

In tropical fruit crops, sigatoka of banana, pod rot of cocoa, citrus tristeza, stunting of papaya due to ringspot virus, as well as soft and black rots of pineapple have been detected, among other diseases.

[Pathogens associated with some of the diseases mentioned above are likely to be:
Powdery scab of potato -- _Spongospora subterranea_ (recently reclassified from fungus to protozoan);
Bacterial wilt (or brown rot) of potato -- _Ralstonia solanacearum_;
Bacterial leaf blight of cereals -- different species or pathovars of _Pseudomonas_;
Sigatoka leaf spot diseases of banana -- _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ (black sigatoka) or _M. musicola_ (yellow sigatoka);
Pod rot of cocoa -- _Moniliophthora roreri_ (frosty pod rot) or _Phytophthora_ species (black pod);
Tristeza disease of citrus -- _Citrus tristeza virus_;
Ringspot disease of papaya -- _Papaya ringspot virus_.

Fruit rots of pineapple and tomato may be caused by a range of fungal and bacterial pathogens; powdery or downy mildews of the crops are caused by host specific fungal species, and the fungal genus _Oidium_ includes some powdery mildews of fruit trees; anthracnose diseases are mainly caused by fungi in the genera of _Colletotrichum_ or _Glomerella_.

(For information on some of the diseases, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)

It is not clear whether "new" diseases in the report above is meant to implicate recent introductions into the country, or whether some of the pathogens may have been present but were only recently detected. In either case, valuable information has been provided for managing national agriculture to increase food security, as well as for national and international biosecurity. The data may also serve as a base for epidemiological studies under the local conditions.
