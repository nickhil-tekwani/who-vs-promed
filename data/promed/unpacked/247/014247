Outbreaks of Cholera in Colombia, 1996: Report from the Colombian
National Institute of Health/Field Epidemiology Training Program
==================================================================
Cholera transmission has resumed during 1996 in Colombia, South America,
in the Atlantic Coast, the Upper Magdalena, and Upper Cauca rivers. As
of March 22, more than 1,300 cases have been reported mainly from
Barranquilla, Bolivar, Choco, Cordova, Magdalena, Sucre in the Atlantic
Coast, in Tolima, Cundinamarca and Caldas in the Upper Magdalena basin.
During February there was an outbreak in a military base in La Guajira
affecting 30 soldiers. In the last two weeks another outbreak
occurred in the Upper Cauca, among Guambiano Indians (57 cases
and nine fatalities); a field study of the Colombian MOH/NIH/FETP
found attendance at the funeral of one case to be associated
with transmission.
The National Institute of Health cholera lab confirmed 103
V. cholerae isolates identified as 01 serotype Ogawa, most
of them from Barranquilla and surrounding areas (31), Cordova (11),
Magdalena (7), La Guajira (5), in the Atlantic Coast. Thirteen
isolates of V. cholerae had been confirmed from probable
cases in Tolima.
The MOH has launched health education campaigns and updated its cholera
preparedness logistics. Colombian NIH and the Colombian Field
Epidemiologic Training Program have offered epidemiologic
assistance to local health services to establish cholera
active surveillance and outbreak investigations to guide control efforts.
Editorial Comment: Cholera eltor was first reported in Colombia
on March 3, 1991. By December 1991, 11,979 cases had been reported
in this country of about 33 million inhabitants. The cholera
epidemic peaked during 1992 when 15,129 cases were reported.
Then, unlike most other countries, without any major change in
reporting criteria (cases are still either clinically/epidemiologically
confirmed, as well as laboratory confirmed), Colombia experienced
a remarkable decrease in cholera transmission within three years
of the pandemic, thought to be due to increased use of bleach
chlorine to disinfect drinking water. In 1994 a total of 1,282 cases
were reported, most of them occurring at the end of the year
in the Pacific Coast (Guapi, Micay and Barbacoas in Narino
State, Buenaventura in Valle State, and San Juan River in Choco
State). Field investigations in Choco in 1995 by Colombian FETP
pointed to person-to-person transmission and attendance
at funerals in one large outbreak in Munguido, and did not
find evidence of water borne, or any other common source during
the 1994 outbreak in Buenaventura. In 1995 cholera increased
again by the end of the year, again in the Pacific (Choco had 610
cases), but further spread: south to Cauca State (339 cases),
and reached the Atlantic Coast (Barranquilla/Atlantico with 179,
Boliivar/Cartagena with 63 cases). Except for few cases in Choco,
most cholera transmission seems to be occurring during 1996 in
the Atlantic Coast and the Upper Magdalena and Cauca rivers,
where there were very few reported cases during 1993-1994.
