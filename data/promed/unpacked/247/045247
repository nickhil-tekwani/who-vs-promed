Re: Undiagnosed die-off, antelopes - Kazakhstan: (West) RFI
-----------------------------------------------------------
In response to ProMED-mail's repeated requests for information
regarding a die-off in Saiga antelopes in West Kazakhstan, we have
received from a reliable source the following report, derived from a
local Internet website in Kazakhstan:

"In an interview with Kazakhstan's media a hunter from West Kazakhstan
region declared that the official version of pasteurellosis is
unlikely, while there is an obvious poisoning of saiga. During visual
examination of dead animals, sanitary doctors discovered a swollen
belly, and on the faces of the animals -- green-coloured foam. The
reason, according to Rangers, could have been poisonous chemicals,
scattered from helicopters over the fields.

People of Zhanibek district of West Kazakhstan region, who first
discovered the cases in animals, are confident that the real reason is
the Russian missile military training ground "Kapustin Yar", which is
located nearby. Villagers told that the local steppe was strewn with
white powder, and just before the death of the animals a black gray
cloud appeared in the air, although the weather was clear and
cloudless. At the same time people felt, during these days, sharply
deteriorated [acutely ill?] and villagers were seeking for medical
help."

We have further noted from reliable sources as follows. The Western
Kazakhstan lab diagnosed _Pasteurella_ and ruled out both FMD
(foot-and-mouth disease) and PPR (peste des petits ruminants). The
National Monitoring Centre and Reference lab for diagnosis and
veterinary medicine in Astana, Kazakhstan is pursuing tests of samples
but no definitive infectious agent has yet been isolated.

It has also been pointed out that wildlife diseases are primarily
within the responsibility of the Hunting and Forestry Committee and
not that of the Veterinary Services. but a close collaboration between
the 2 departments exists.

[Interestingly, mass mortality of saigas in 1988 that was attributed
to pasteurellosis was, reportedly, thought by some senior scientists
at the Kazakh Veterinary Science Research Institute (KazNIVI) to have
been caused by something the saigas encountered when grazing close to
a military base. The whole area was closed off after the saigas died,
and senior officials from Moscow were flown in to take part in the
investigation. Scientists at KazNIVI felt the incident was 'hushed up'
and too quickly attributed to pasteurellosis (see page 17 in: Monica
Lundervold: Infectious diseases of saiga antelopes and domestic
livestock in Kazakhstan. Thesis, University of Warwick, UK June 2001.
<http://www.iccs.org.uk/papers/lundervold-thesis.pdf>).

Though pasteurella has, reportedly, been isolated from samples from
dead saigas, the significance of this finding is arguable. On top of
detailed laboratory results, including toxicological, it will be
interesting to note if the mortality continues and to obtain
descriptions of observed clinical signs and their duration, recovery
rate, as well as further epidemiological data, such as age
distribution and spatial spread.

The definitive etiology, infectious, toxicological or otherwise, of
the observed mass mortality in the Ural saigas remains to be
established. - Mod.AS]

[Toxic plants are always a possibility. As the plants are in a green
and rapidly growing season, animals hungry for the lush green may
consume plants that can result in death. The green foam is most
likely only regurgitation from the rumen.

_Pasteurella_ may be an opportunistic species taking advantage of an
immune system perhaps weakened by a chemical. White powder could be
any number of things from a powdered pesticide (insecticide) such as
an organophosphate or a carbamate, which could produce excess
salivation, to even a herbicide in concentrated wettable powder form.
Adequate necropsy specimens in a diagnostic laboratory would be
helpful to determine the cause of death.
