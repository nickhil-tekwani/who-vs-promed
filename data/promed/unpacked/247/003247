Vermont health officials report investigating a cluster of legionnaires' disease in Franklin County. Officials identified 5 confirmed cases, including one death of an individual in their 70's, but the source of the infections remains unknown.

The cases, reported to the Health Department between 12 and 29 Aug 2022, appear to be clustered in the St Albans area. Although no common source of the infections has been found, officials said the general risk to residents of St Albans and Franklin County is very low, as most healthy people exposed to the bacteria that cause legionnaires' disease do not get sick.

Legionnaires' disease is a form of pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. The bacteria can be found in natural, freshwater environments, but generally not enough to cause illness. In the water systems of buildings where water sits stagnant, _Legionella_ can multiply and infect people if they breathe in mist or vapor containing the bacteria. Common sources of infection are air-conditioning units for large buildings (cooling towers), hot tubs, cooling misters, decorative fountains, or plumbing systems. Home air-conditioning units do not use water to cool, so they are not a risk for _Legionella_ growth.

Legionnaires' disease is not contagious and almost never spreads from person to person. People at increased risk of serious illness include those aged 50 and older who currently smoke or formerly smoked, have chronic lung disease, or have a weakened immune system. While most individuals infected will get better with antibiotic treatment, the disease can be fatal in about one in 10 people.

The Health Department recommends that people who live or work in Franklin County contact a healthcare professional if they experience symptoms of legionnaires' disease. Symptoms usually begin 2 to 14 days after being exposed and can include cough, muscle aches, fever, shortness of breath, and headache.

"Illness from legionnaires' disease can be successfully treated with antibiotics. But it can also result in very serious illness, so it's important to reach out to your doctor if you have symptoms," said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, MD. "We are also asking building owners to check their water systems, and make sure they are properly maintained to help prevent _Legionella_ growth and transmission."

The Health Department strongly recommends that owners and managers of commercial and office buildings, hotels, and vacation rentals, as well as public hot tub operators and health care facilities, develop and maintain water management programs to prevent the growth and transmission of _Legionella_ in their water systems. Buildings with specific features -- such as cooling towers, hot tubs, pools, decorative water fountains and features, fire sprinkler systems, showers, and large complex plumbing systems -- may need additional steps to keep these features clean and well-maintained.

[On 14 Sep 2022, ProMED posted a report that the Vermont Health Department was investigating a cluster of 5 cases of legionnaires' disease who lived in 2 adjacent Vermont counties (Franklin or Grand Isle), but spent time in Franklin County during their incubation periods in August 2022 (ProMED post Legionellosis - USA (12): (VT) cluster, RFI 20220914.8705584). The news article above reports Vermont health officials are now investigating a cluster of 5 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease, including one death, in Franklin County, between 12 and 29 Aug 2022, clustered in the St Albans area. The city of St Albans (pop., 6877 residents) is the county seat of Franklin County, 29 miles [about 47 km] north of Burlington, the state's capital. A map showing the location of St Albans can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/St+Albans+City,+VT.

We are not told if the current 5 cases are the same as the previously reported 5 cases, or an additional 5 cases in Franklin County. For discussions of legionnaires' disease, please see my moderator's comments in prior ProMED posts: Legionellosis - USA (02): (CA) fatal, RFI 20220313.8701956; Legionellosis - USA (03): (HI) hotel 20220328.8702268; and Legionellosis - Australia: (NS) 20220527.8703505.

We are also not told if genotyping of clinical or environmental (water) isolates has been done. Genotyping the isolates of _Legionella_ from patients will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if their genotypes match each other. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Also, the environmental source for the individual cases will be identified, if the genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from the water sample match the genotypes of clinical _Legionella_ isolates.

More information on the cases of legionellosis in Franklin County, Vermont would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
