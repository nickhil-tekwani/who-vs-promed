A second elk from a Philipsburg game farm recently diagnosed with
chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Oklahoma raises concerns
about public health as well as risks to Montana's wild deer and elk,
according to the Montana Wildlife Federation.
Two elk traced to the Kesler Game Farm [in Montana have been
diagnosed with CWD at an Oklahoma game farm. The most recent
case of the deadly brain disease was diagnosed in May.
The disease is similar to "mad cow disease'' (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, BSE) that has affected cattle in Great Britain. It
has been found in wild deer and elk in Wyoming and Colorado. It is
always fatal. It has been linked by some scientists to the fatal
human brain ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
Montana Department of Livestock officials have said no CWD has
been found in the state, either in the wild, or in game farm animals.
But transfer documents make it appear very unlikely the infected
Oklahoma elk contracted the disease after being shipped from the
Kesler Game Farm, a Wildlife Federation spokesman said this
week.
"We did some digging and found some interesting things we think
need to be brought to the public's attention,'' said John Kober, a
western Montana field representative of the Wildlife Federation.
Kober examined records of Kesler Game Farm elk from Montana
Fish, Wildlife and Parks and Montana Department of Livestock.
The 2 agencies share regulatory responsibility for game farms.
The records show that the most recent elk diagnosed with CWD in
Oklahoma was born and raised on the Kesler Game Farm. It was
shipped directly to a game farm in Oklahoma City owned by Don
Kaspereit in April 1997. CWD can only be diagnosed through a
necropsy. The elk, which died after it was gored by another elk, had
no clinical signs of the disease.David Kesler, who owns Kesler
Game Farm, said in an earlier interview he has no idea where the
elk he sold to the Oklahoma farm may have contracted CWD. He
added no animals at his game farm have ever shown signs of the
disease.
But according to Oklahoma state veterinarian Gene Eskew, Kesler
supplied all of Kaspereit's elk. Kaspereit's game farm has been
quarantined with the only cases of CWD yet found in the state. No
additional animals have been added to the herd.
Of the 84 elk that were sold to Kaspereit by Kesler, the Wildlife
Federation's research showed, only one animal, a bull elk from
Utah, did not originate from Kesler's Montana herd. Fifty of those
animals were shipped to Oklahoma directly from Montana; while 33
of the elk were shipped from Montana to Idaho, where they spent
about 2 months before being shipped to Oklahoma. All of those
animals, except the bull from Utah, came from the Kesler Game
Farm. The Utah bull is still alive.
"To act responsibly, and protect wildlife,'' said Kober, the Livestock
Department "should absolutely admit that this animal did come
directly from Montana, and that the possibility exists this infection
occurred in Montana is actually likely, more likely than anywhere
else.''
Tom Linfield, a veterinarian for the Montana Department of
Livestock, said "it's certainly a possibility'' the CWD was present in
Kesler's Montana elk herd.
"The difficulty for us,'' Linfield said, "is to determine where the
source of the problem is. If it's here, where did it come from?
Kesler's game farm was under quarantine for 5 years for TB.
There's been no introduction of elk there.''
The Montana Wildlife Federation believes more thorough testing
for CWD should be done by the Livestock Department on Montana
game farms, Kober said.
Linfield said CWD has not been found on the Kesler Game Farm,
which has been under quarantine since June 1998, after the first
elk from there was diagnosed with the disease in Oklahoma. He
said the quarantine means no elk can be shipped from the game
farm except for slaughter. Any elk from the Kesler Game Farm that
dies or is killed for slaughter will be tested for the disease, Linfield
said. Any animal that shows neurological signs of the disease also
will be tested, he said.
Linfield said at least 3 elk have been tested for CWD at the Kesler
Game Farm. None tested positive.But records show that since
1995, 29 elk have died of causes other than for slaughter or
market on the Kesler Game Farm, including 7 since 1998, Kober
said.
"That's an inordinate number of game farm animals dead,'' Kober
said. "Something is going on.''
Recent studies indicate that there is a real possibility that CWD, or
its related brain diseases, can be transmitted between species,
according to the Federation.
