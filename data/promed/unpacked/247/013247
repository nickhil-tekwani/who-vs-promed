Vulnerable South Australians are reminded to avoid eating uncooked oysters after dozens of food-related illnesses linked to the consumption of raw oysters were reported in the past 2 months. SA Health's Acting Director of Food and Controlled Drugs Branch, Joanne Cammans, said 36 cases of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infections linked to eating raw oysters have been notified since September 2021, compared to no cases in 2020 and 8 cases in 2019.

"This increase in cases reported to us in such a short period of time is very concerning, as food-borne illnesses can be quite serious for more vulnerable people in our community, such as older South Australians, pregnant people and people with compromised immune systems," Ms. Cammans said. "People with lowered gastric acidity, such as those who are taking antacids, and people with liver disease are particularly vulnerable to _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ and so should avoid eating raw oysters.

"Food borne _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection causes symptoms of gastroenteritis, including watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever and headache, and usually occurs within 24 hours of eating the contaminated food. The infection can be acquired by eating undercooked shellfish and fish; however, raw oysters are often the most common cause."

Executive Director, Biosecurity at the Department of Primary Industries and Regions (PIRSA), Nathan Rhodes, said the department was working closely with industry to ensure best practice management tools were available and being utilized.

"The number of cases can vary substantially from year to year, and it is difficult to pinpoint the potential cause," Mr. Rhodes said. "We are looking at potential factors that may have an influence on the recent cases, but the best international science has yet to determine a likely cause. Inspections by PIRSA officers have found that food safety practices are being appropriately applied on farm. Raw unshucked oysters should be stored at less than 10째C [50째F] and shucked oysters at less than 5째C [41째F] to minimize the risk of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection."

Seafood eaten raw or ready-to-eat cold cooked prawns or cold smoked salmon are not recommended for pregnant people, people with reduced immune systems or older people because of the risk of bacterial infections such as _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_.

[_V. parahaemolyticus_ causes a gastrointestinal illness, primarily with diarrhea. It is important to stress that _V. parahaemolyticus_ as well as other vibrios are naturally present in marine waters and do not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of, in the western hemisphere, the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska, and British Columbia, clearly accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Indeed, eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease the chances of acquiring a case of foodborne illness compared with eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the northern hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator as in Australia). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the adage is not very helpful anymore. - Mod.LL
