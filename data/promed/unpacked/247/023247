[The susceptibility demonstrated by the animals involved in the above
event (extremely low morbidity, no mortality) seems to be unusually
low, generally, for PPR, and particularly when compared to the data
pertaining to the previous outbreak in Tibet during February 2008,
when the apparent case fatality rate reportedly exceeded 70 percent.
It will be interesting to obtain epidemiological details concerning
both outbreaks in Tibet, in particular the age and breed of the
affected goat populations. - Mod.AS]
