The number of people confirmed to have fallen ill after eating raw or
half-cooked snails contaminated with parasites at a Beijing restaurant has
risen from 70 to 87, the Beijing Health Bureau reported yesterday.
Meanwhile, the Beijing restaurant that sold parasite-contaminated snails
made an official apology to customers yesterday.
Qu Chuangang, spokesman for Shuguoyanyi Restaurant, which serves
Sichuan-style dishes, said it will assume responsibility for the incident
and try to deal with the problems caused.
The restaurant admitted that the snails had not been processed correctly,
which was the main reason customers had fallen sick.
The spokesman said his restaurant is ready to compensate those who fell ill
after eating the snails.

[Angiostrongyliasis is caused by _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_. In the
previous report, "fushouluo" was erroneously used to refer to the giant
African snail. Instead, it refers to the Amazonian snail, which is
distinctly smaller. This moderator apologizes for the mistake. Also,
fushouluo lays bright pinkish, round, hard-shelled eggs that cling to the
lower parts of aquatic plants, while the giant African snail lays beige
hard-shelled eggs in a shallow pit on land.
