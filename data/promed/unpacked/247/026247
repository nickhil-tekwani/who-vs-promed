Government officials are testing for bird flu after a sick chicken at
a smallholding near Chard showed telltale symptoms of the disease.
Vets from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,
took away blood, feces and saliva samples from 12 hens at Stony
Knaps, Winsham on Wednesday [30 May 2007]. The birds are being tested
for bird flu and Newcastle disease, which is lethal to poultry but
harmless to humans. The results were due yesterday [Thu 31 May 2007]
but are now expected on Monday [4 Jun 2007]. DEFRA says this is
because laboratory officials are still stretched by a confirmed
outbreak of bird flu in north Wales.
The owner of the Winsham hens, Melanie Johnson, alerted officials
after discovering one sick on Tuesday [29 May 2007] evening. She
said: "She had a swollen head and a huge blood clot in the roof of
her mouth. I have had sick birds before, but I've never seen anything
like that." Mrs. Johnson explained the symptoms to a vet, who
referred the matter to DEFRA. A vet from the department visited
within an hour, and the hen was put to sleep and taken to Starcross
laboratory in Exeter for testing.
Two vets returned on Wednesday [30 May 2007] to test more of Mrs.
Johnson's hens, which have not been destroyed. Mrs. Johnson said:
"I've got about 20 hens in isolation in a barn. They are showing
respiratory distress -- coughing and sneezing -- but they are not
sick enough to be put down."
A DEFRA spokesman said that until the test results were available, no
restrictions would be placed on the movement of people or animals to
and from Mrs. Johnson's property, a farmhouse and half an acre of
land on the outskirts of the village. He said: "We carry out about 20
tests for suspected avian flu in the Somerset area every year. At
this stage, there is nothing to raise concerns."

The UK authorities deserve to be commended for the attention and
diagnostic efforts paid even to the slightest suspicions related to
single birds. - Mod.AS]

Test results for the H7N2 strain of avian flu from poultry on a farm
on the Llyn Peninsula have proved negative. The final results
received today [29 May 2007] by the Welsh Assembly Government confirm
that birds on the farm are not infected with this virus.
Birds on the farm were tested because of a connection with Chelford
Market on 7 May 2007, which is linked to the Corwen outbreak where
H7N2 was confirmed in poultry on 24 May 2007. All birds on this site
were slaughtered by 5 p.m. on Fri 25 May 2007, and cleansing and
disinfection of the site has now been completed.
Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Christianne Glossop said: "We are very
pleased with today's [29 May 2007] results but must not be complacent
so early in our investigations into the source of this outbreak.
Considerable efforts continue in this complicated tracings exercise.
I repeat my request to any people in Wales who either bought or sold
poultry at Chelford Market in Cheshire on Mon 7 May 2007 or any
poultry keeper in Wales who visited Chelford Market on this date
whose birds have subsequently become ill to contact their local
Animal Health office. All bird keepers throughout Wales should
continue to be vigilant and maintain strict biosecurity precautions,
monitoring their birds for any signs of infectious disease. Again, if
anyone is concerned about the health of their birds, they should
contact Animal Health. The Welsh Assembly Government is working
closely with Animal Health (formerly the State Veterinary Service)
and the National Public Health Service (NPHS) on operations to
control the outbreak in North Wales. The NPHS is managing the human
health side of the outbreak, dealing with issues at a local and
national level, while the Welsh Assembly Government and Animal Health
have a joint team dealing with the bird flu aspects from its base in
Caernarfon."
Chief Medical Officer Tony Jewell said: "The NPHS has provided very
effective operational management of the human health side, working
closely with the NHS in North Wales, local school and community. They
are playing an exemplary role in communicating public health
information and messages and taking proactive action in managing this
outbreak. The Welsh Assembly Government continues to coordinate the
operation, working closely with Whitehall Departments.

A ban on showing chickens and ducks at the South of England Show next
week after a case of bird flu in Wales has been lifted.
The show is held every year at Ardingly, West Sussex by the South of
England Agricultural Society, which was founded in 1967. Organizers
of the show had said chickens and ducks would not be shown after a
ruling from Defra. But Defra has now said the restriction has been lifted.
A spokeswoman for Defra said: "There are now no restrictions.
Organizers will be under the general conditions of their license."
[For the conditions, see commentary further].
In Wales, bird flu has been confirmed on a Conwy smallholding, but
tests have since proved negative on a Llyn peninsula farm.
The 1st case of avian flu in Wales was confirmed on 24 May 2007 among
chickens on a smallholding near Corwen in Denbighshire.
The National Public Health Service for Wales (NPHSW) has said the
health risk to the general public is low. In its latest bulletin on
Saturday [2 Jun 2007], it said the number of people -- 252 -- who may
have had contact with the avian flu remained unchanged for the
previous 2 days. Most were now outside of the incubation period.
Dr Marion Lyons, consultant in communicable disease control for the
NPHSW said they remained vigilant. "There are 237 people where there
is now no risk at all of infection or further infection with this
avian flu virus," she said. "This is very reassuring to them. It is
also very reassuring to us, because it demonstrates that the already
low risk of spread is confirmed."

[The final, negative results of tested samples from the Llyn
peninsula farm, which, reportedly, "had links with the Chelford
Market" (where the birds in the H7N2-infected farm in Conwy had
originated), mean that the identification of the said market as the
source of infection is still in need of confirmation.
DEFRA's updated (1 Jun 2007) guidelines and licensing procedures for
bird gatherings ("arranging the collection together of poultry or
other captive birds from different epidemiological groups at one
location"), including shows, pigeon races and falconry events, are available at
