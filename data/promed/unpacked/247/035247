A [74 year old man], presumably infected with a hantavirus, remains
in the Concepcion [Bio-Bio region] Regional Hospital sharing a room
with other ill individuals after health authorities discounted the
possibility of oral transmission of the disease.

The patient's son indicated to La Radio that his father presented
with symptoms of the disease [after] returning from an excursion in
the Hualqui rural area. The son indicated that on arrival to the
hospital he was attended to "in a corridor of the emergency unit", and
after hours of just waiting, was taken to a common ward without any
type of isolation.

However, the SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat]
epidemiologist, Cecilia Soto, stated that there is no risk of
person-to-person infection, despite the fact that there have been
cases of [interpersonal] transmission, although very rare, according
to the professional's statement.

[If this case is confirmed as a hantavirus infection, this will be
the 2nd in the Bio-Bio region this year (2011), the earlier one being
fatal (see ProMED-mail archive number 20110122.0262). If confirmed,
the hantavirus involved is, no doubt, Andes virus. Person-to-person
transmission of Andes virus has occurred among people in very close
physical contact, such as family members in the same household.
Transmission among patients in a common hospital ward is very
unlikely, but the risk is not zero. ProMED-mail would be interested in
knowing whether the current case is confirmed as a hantavirus
infection or not.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
