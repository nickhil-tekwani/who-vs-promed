In the last few days, seven adults were treated at the Rossi hospital with
symptoms of trichinosis and another three children were seen at the
Children's Hospital.
The affected persons had eaten locally made sausages acquired in an
establishment in the Plata neighborhood called Altos de San Lorenzo,
according to information from the authorities of the Ministry of Health in
Buenos Aires. The latter, together with other authorities and the affected
municipalities - such as Villarino, San Vicente, San Andres de Giles and
Baradero - have developed the necessary actions to control the outbreak,
specifically early diagnosis and treatment of the human cases.
Officials of the Provincial Secretariat of Ganaderia [livestock] yesterday
sequestered animals that belonged to a clandestine slaughterhouse operator
from the locality of Arana, who did not carry out the obligatory controls.
The Director of Health of La Plata, Juan Mainetti, asked the population to
take precautions when buying meat products and recommended that they ask to
see the necessary quality certificates.

is probably from garbage fed pigs, until informed otherwise. - MHJ]
