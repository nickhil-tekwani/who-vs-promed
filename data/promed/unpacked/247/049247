[This Health Alert to health care providers was released 10 Feb 2005
by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) of New York
City. ProMED-mail was given permission to post this alert by the
DOHMH. - Mod.MPP]

2005 Health Alert #6: Investigation of Tainted Heroin
------------------
Beginning 28 Jan 2005 several male heroin users presented to
hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania complaining of unusual
effects including agitation, nausea, headache, and weakness after
nasal insufflation of heroin. Initial findings by health care
providers were notable for hypotension, tachycardia, hypokalemia and
severe lactic acidosis with an elevated pVO2. Although these findings
were suggestive of cyanide poisoning, subsequent testing failed to
identify cyanide and confirmed clenbuterol in several specimens.
Clenbuterol is an illicit, long-acting beta adrenergic agonist that
is used primarily for increasing lean body mass in cattle. Humans
occasionally use clenbuterol as part of exercise training to increase
endurance and reduce body fat.
A working case definition includes hypokalemia, hyperglycemia ,
metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate and an elevated venous
PO2. To date multiple cases have been confirmed in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania and several cases are suspected in Connecticut.
The NYC DOHMH now has reports of several patients in NYC meeting the
case definition. A total of 6 cases have reported as of 9 Feb 2005 in
New York City. Since 6 Feb 2005, 4 adult male patients were
evaluated at a hospital in Brooklyn, NY, for hypotension, tachycardia
and hypokalemia. All were attempting to use heroin intranasally.
Shortly after use, all developed anxiety and palpitations; one
developed chest pain. 2 cases were also reported on 8 Feb 2005 from
a Bronx, NY hospital with tachycardia, hypotension, hypokalemia and
palpitations. Most patients can be treated with volume replacement,
but when symptoms are severe and there are no contraindications (such
as recent cocaine use or reversible airways disease) short-acting
parenteral beta adrenergic antagonists can be administered.
For technical assistance in the management of such patients 24 hours
a day, contact the DOHMH's poison control center at 1-800-222-1222.
To assist us in this investigation:
- Report all patients who might meet the case definition to the New
York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene pursuant to Section
11.03 of the New York City Health Code by calling the Poison Control
Center at 212-764-7667 or 1-800-222-1222.
- Submit any suspect material found on patients to the New York City
Police Department for further testing by calling 911 or the local
precinct.

Drug addicts beware
-----------------
3 apparent heroin overdose deaths in New Britain [Connecticut]
prompted a statewide health alert Thursday about a possible bad batch
of the drug in New Jersey and elsewhere in the Northeast.
The Connecticut Poison Control Center, which tracks drug deaths,
issued the advisory after learning 2 men had been found dead in a New
Britain home 3 Feb 2005 and a 3rd in a parking lot on Saturday. The 3
were between the ages of 30 and 50.
"It's unusual to see a clump of heroin deaths, because typically
people who do heroin know how much to give themselves to make
themselves high," said Amy Hanoian-Fontana, a community education
specialist with the center, which is based at the University of
Connecticut Health Center.
New Britain officials have asked workers at hospitals, methadone
clinics and homeless shelters to alert users about the possible bad
heroin.
"The concern is that this is connected to contamination in the
heroin, not just a routine heroin overdose, although we don't know
that yet," said Dr. Eugene Ciccone, director of the New Britain
Health Department. "Once this information gets disseminated to places
like the methadone clinic, word of mouth will spread it pretty
quickly."
Health experts said they were concerned because a batch of heroin
made several people critically ill in New Jersey 2 weeks ago. 10
people who had snorted the drug showed up at hospitals in Warren,
Middlesex and Monmouth counties with the same symptoms, including
headaches and racing hearts.
Dr. Steven Marcus, executive director of the New Jersey Poison
Information and Education System said it was possible it all came
from the same place. He said he sent alerts to health departments
along the East Coast.
"It's still early in the investigation," Marcus said. "We're not 100
percent sure that it's all linked together."

[In an earlier ProMED-mail posting (Cyanide poisoning, contaminated
heroin - USA (PA, NJ): alert 20050203.0371), cyanide was postulated
as the most likely contaminant in the heroin responsible for the
events in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In the above Health Alert
from the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene, there
is mention of identification of clenbuterol in some specimens, not
cyanide as previously suspected.
As mentioned above, clenbuterol is an illicit, long-acting beta
adrenergic agonist that is used primarily for increasing lean body
mass in cattle (note that its use in cattle is illicit and not an
accepted practice). People occasionally use clenbuterol as part of
exercise training to increase endurance and reduce body fat. There
have been reports of food poisoning associated with
clenbuterol-contaminated meat (see refs 1, 2, 3, 4). Similarly,
there have been case reports of toxicity associated with illicit use
in exercise training (see ref. 5 and 6 for reviews).
The above alert mentions probable cases in New Jersey, New York City,
Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, suggesting that the contamination of
heroin occurred prior to local distribution. It is possible that
other areas are also being affected by contaminated heroin if the
point of contamination was either prior to entry to the USA or
immediately after entry, before further distribution. ProMED-mail
would be interested to learn if compatible cases have been seen
outside of the northeast of the USA.
