The Department of Public Health [DPH] said 2 Connecticut residents have tested positive for a tick infection known as the Powassan virus.

Officials said these are the 1st 2 cases identified this year [2021]. DPH officials said the 2 individuals are between the ages of 50 and 79 and are from Fairfield and New Haven counties. They became infected during the 3rd week of April [2021]. Lab testing in Colorado [CDC] confirmed the presence of virus antibodies.

From 2016 to 2020, a total of 10 cases were reported in the state, including 2 in 2020; 2 of these infections were deadly, officials said.

Both people were hospitalized with central nervous system disease. They've since been discharged and are recovering.

"The identification of 2 Connecticut residents with Powassan virus associated illness emphasizes the need to take actions to prevent tick bites while ticks are most active, from now through the late fall," said DPH Acting Commissioner Deidre Gifford. "Using insect repellent, avoiding areas where ticks are likely, and checking carefully for ticks after being outside can reduce the chance of you or your children being infected with this virus."

The virus can be spread through the bite of an infected black-legged or 'deer' tick [_Ixodes scapularis_]. It takes one week to a month after the bite to develop symptoms and the virus can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes after the tick first attaches, according to officials.

Most people infected with the virus likely won't experience any symptoms or a mild flu-like illness. Others will develop severe illness affecting their central nervous system.

About one in 10 cases of severe illness result in death and about half of survivors will experience long-term health problems.

Severe cases consist of fever, vomiting, headache, or weakness and rapidly progress to confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, or seizures.

Officials say there is no vaccine or treatment with the exception of supportive therapy which could include hospitalization, respiratory support, IV fluids, and prevention of other infections.

Powassan virus is typically reported between early spring and late fall.

[Powassan virus (POWV) transmission is active in Connecticut again this year (2021) as it has been in recent years. Cases of Powassan virus infection have been reported every year in recent years from one or more of the eastern and northeastern or midwestern states of the USA including Connecticut. An important point of this report is that POWV can be rapidly transmitted to humans a short time following the bite of infected deer ticks (black legged ticks, _Ixodes scapularis_). In areas where this tick is common, inspection for the presence of this tick and their swift removal are important.

Ticks become infected when they feed on groundhogs, squirrels, mice, or other rodents that have the virus in their blood. Infected ticks can then spread POW virus to people and other animals by biting them. People do not develop high enough levels of the virus in their blood to infect biting ticks. As a result, people are considered "dead-end" hosts for Powassan virus. There is no vaccine for POW virus, so avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure. - Mod.TY
