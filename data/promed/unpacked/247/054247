-----------
Nigeria is currently responding to an outbreak of yellow fever in people who are either resident in or have visited Alkaleri Local Government Area (LGA) in Bauchi since [1 Aug 2019]. Suspected and confirmed cases with an epidemiological link to Bauchi have been reported in Borno, Kano, Gombe and Katsina states. Of the cases with an epidemiological link to Bauchi, [the] current [epidemiological] summary is as follows:

- 243 suspected cases
- 10 presumptive positives cases (IgM positive on serology)
- 28 confirmed cases by RT-PCR
- 34 deaths
- 5 states affected
- 42 LGAs affected

The National Yellow Fever technical working group (TWG) activated the national Incident Management System (IMS) to coordinate the response activities on [5 Sep 2019].

- Number of presumptive positives is 10 (IgM positive on serology) and 1 inconclusive was recorded (Borno, 6; Kano, 1; Katsina, 3; and 1 inconclusive from Borno). All have been sent to the Institut Pasteur Dakar (IP Dakar) for further testing.
- A total of 28 (14.9%) cases have been confirmed in the Nigerian testing laboratories using RT-PCR from:
-- NCDC National Reference Laboratory Gaduwa, 27 (Bauchi, 20; Katsina, 4; Gombe, 3)
-- Lagos University Teaching Hospital, 1 (Kano, 1)

[The graph in Figure 1 shows a fairly steady number of cases during weeks 27-33 at 10-20 cases, a dip in week 34, and then a peak to around 50 cases each in weeks 35 and 36, with a decline to about 20 cases the following week. Figures 2 and 3 show that Bauchi and Borno states had relatively low numbers of cases until weeks 35-37, when they spiked to about 20-30 cases each week. We do not know if the 16 college girls who also visited this game reserve and became ill, 4 of whom died, are included in these cases. Samples were sent for laboratory diagnosis of these girls' illnesses but no results have been announced, so it is still not known if YF was involved. However, the occurrence of a YF case and possibly another in the Yankari Game Reserve in Borno state that the students also visited, indicates that YF virus was circulating there and there were additional YF cases in the state. A vaccination campaign to cover 500 000 people in Borno state is planned.
