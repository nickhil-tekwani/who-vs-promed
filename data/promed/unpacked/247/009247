Mortality of sheep has been recorded on 5 farms in the Kyzylorda [Qyzylorda] region; 1007 sheep affected, according to the head of the regional department of agriculture, Bakhyt Zhahanov. The head of the Zhanakorgan district administration decided to impose emergency measures.

"Veterinarians have collected samples for laboratory tests. At the moment, we know that the background for the losses was pasteurellosis, while the high temperatures were behind the rapid spread of he disease," said Zhahanov.

The sheep began to die a month ago, when the air temperature in the region exceeded 45 centigrade. Currently, according to Zhahanov, there is a vaccination of cattle, and sick animals are treated. More than 600 infected sheep were rescued, reports IA REGNUM.

It may be reminded that more 85 000 saiga antelopes died at the end of May 2015 in the Kostanai [Qostanay] region of Kazakhstan; the reason was considered to be an outbreak of pasteurellosis.

[Zhanakorgan (map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhanakorgan_District#/media/File:Zhanakorgan_District_Kazakhstan.png) is a district of Kyzylorda Region in southern Kazakhstan (map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyzylorda_Region#/media/File:Kyzylorda_in_Kazakhstan.svg).

The above report is somewhat confusing; translation issues may contribute to the confusion. Reliable, accurate information on the event, ideally from an official animal-health authority, including clinical, epidemiological, gross-pathological and laboratory-derived information, is requested.

The mentioned recent mass mortality of saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan has been attributed by the authorities, in an OIE notification, to hemorrhagic septicemia (_Pasteurella multocida_). The exclusiveness of this bacterium as the sole causative agent of the unusual event has been debated and final confirmation requested. This is similarly applicable to the current event in sheep. According to other recent media reports, cattle and goats have apparently also been affected. This deserves confirmation or otherwise. - Mod.AS
