Badminton tournament norovirus outbreak traced to caterer
--------------------------------------------------------------
As of late Fri 13 Apr 2007, a stomach bug that forced the suspension
of a junior badminton tournament in Christchurch has been sourced to
a caterer working at the opening dinner. Vomiting and diarrhoea
affected more than 90 people at the Australasian under-17 Junior
Badminton Championships at Cowles Stadium. Players, coaches and
officials were all affected, while the caterer became ill the night
after the dinner, within a few hours of preparing a rice salad.
Public health officials called to identify the source of the outbreak
said on Tuesday [10 Apr 2007] the gut-wrenching, highly infectious
norovirus was the most likely cause. The Canterbury medical officer
of health, Alistair Humphrey, confirmed today that the norovirus had
been traced to a caterer. The Canterbury District Health Board's
community and public health division identified the source as one of
the contract workers working in the kitchen during the shared dinner
held as part of the tournament's opening ceremonies.
"Though the worker could not have known it at the time, [the person
concerned was] likely to have been shedding virus during the
preparation of the food," Dr. Humphrey said. He said the pattern of
illness -- a short incubation period, with short-lived symptoms of
vomiting and diarrhoea -- was consistent with a norovirus outbreak.
Norovirus was spread directly from person to person, but could
involve an "intermediate vector, such as food." Computer analysis of
data from questionnaires completed by tournament competitors and
officials pointed to the rice salad as the most striking risk factor.
Dr. Humphrey said the tournament organising committee's decision to
suspend play for 24 hours on Wednesday [11 Apr 2007] helped bring the
outbreak to an end, with no further cases reported since then. The
public health investigation team inspected the kitchen facilities and
was satisfied catering was provided to a high standard. No action
would be taken against the firm. "It was unfortunate that one worker,
who did not have symptoms until shortly after the dinner, was
shedding norovirus during food preparation," he said. No punitive
action was required.
Tournament director Lyndsay Dick, who also became ill during the
outbreak, said play was back to normal today. "There's absolutely no
effects today," she said. "Some of the kids are not back to full
eating yet, but you wouldn't know (people had been sick) if you
walked in here now." Ms. Dick said a few teams events had been
cancelled but she doubted it would affect overall results. The
tournament is scheduled to end tomorrow night. "It's good that we can
finish. Our scheduling is a bit tight, but we'll get through it okay," she said

[This report confirms that an outbreak of norovirus infection
emanating from a single source (a catering firm employee) was
responsible for disruption of an international badminton contest in
New Zealand. Outbreaks of norovirus infection are not unusual in
situations such as sporting events and gatherings of tourists where
people from different communities congregate together. An unusual
feature of this outbreak is its apparent association with a single
individual who was excreting sufficient amounts of virus prior to
exhibiting signs of infection to be responsible for gross
contamination of a single item of food. This individual was
inadvertently responsible for simultaneous infection of a large
proportion of those attending a pre-contest social event. What is
surprising is that little illness was observed following the 1st wave
of infection which might have been expected on the basis of
person-to-person transmission of infection after the initial wave of
infection. It must be presumed that most susceptible individuals were
casualties of the initial exposure. This press report, however, does
not confirm that the diagnosis of norovirus infection has been
confirmed by laboratory investigation. - Mod.CP]
