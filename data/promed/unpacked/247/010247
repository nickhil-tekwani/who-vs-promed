Do you find it hard to resist gobbling up a piece of raw dough when making cookies, or letting your children scrape the bowl? Do your kids use raw dough to make ornaments or homemade "play" clay? Do you eat at family restaurants that give kids raw dough to play with while you're waiting for the food?

If your answer to any of those questions is yes, that could be a problem. Eating raw dough or batter--whether it's for bread, cookies, pizza or tortillas--could make you, and your kids, sick, says Jenny Scott, a senior advisor in FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. According to Scott, the bottom line for you and your kids is don't eat raw dough. And even though there are websites devoted to "flour crafts," don't give your kids raw dough or baking mixes that contain flour to play with.

Why? Flour, regardless of the brand, can contain bacteria that cause disease. In 2016, the FDA, along with the CDC and state and local officials, investigated an outbreak of infections that illustrated the dangers of eating raw dough. Dozens of people across the country were sickened by a strain of bacteria called Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O121.N. The investigation found that raw dough eaten or handled by some of the patients was made with flour found in subsequent tests by the FDA to have the same bacterium that was making people sick. Ten million pounds of flour were recalled, including unbleached, all-purpose, and self-rising varieties.

Some of the recalled flours had been sold to restaurants that allow children to play with dough made from the raw flour while waiting for their meals. CDC advises restaurants not to give customers raw dough.

Why Flour?
People often understand the dangers of eating raw dough due to the presence of raw eggs and the associated risk of salmonellosis. However, consumers should be aware that there are additional risks associated with the consumption of raw dough, such as particularly harmful strains of _E. coli_ in a product like flour.

"Flour is derived from a grain that comes directly from the field and typically is not treated to kill bacteria," says Leslie Smoot, Ph.D., a senior advisor in FDA's Office of Food Safety and a specialist in the microbiological safety of processed foods. So if an animal heeds the call of nature in the field, bacteria from the animal waste could contaminate the grain, which is then harvested and milled into flour.

Common "kill steps" applied during food preparation and/or processing (so-called because they kill bacteria that cause infections) include boiling, baking, roasting, microwaving, and frying. But with raw dough, no kill step has been used. And don't make homemade cookie dough ice cream either. If that's your favorite flavor, buy commercially made products. Manufacturers should use ingredients that include treated flour and pasteurized eggs.

Symptoms and Who Gets Sick
Common symptoms for Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ are diarrhea (often bloody) and abdominal cramps, although most people recover within a week. But some illnesses last longer and can be more severe, resulting in a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS can occur in people of any age, but is most common in young children under 5 years, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.

Parents of young children should be particularly aware. For instance, if your child is in day care or kindergarten, a common pastime may be art using "play" clay that is homemade from raw dough. Even if they're not munching on the dough, they're putting their hands in their mouth after handling the dough. Childcare facilities and preschools should discourage the practice of playing with raw dough.

Handle Foods Safely
FDA offers these tips for safe food handling to keep you and your family healthy:
- Do not eat any raw cookie dough, cake mix, batter, or any other raw dough or batter product that is supposed to be cooked or baked.
- Follow package directions for cooking products containing flour at proper temperatures and for specified times.
- Wash hands, work surfaces, and utensils thoroughly after contact with flour and raw dough products.
- Keep raw foods separate from other foods while preparing them to prevent any contamination that may be present from spreading. Be aware that flour may spread easily due to its powdery nature.
- Follow label directions to chill products containing raw dough promptly after purchase until baked.

[This warning coincided with the publication in the New England Journal of Medicine regarding EHEC and flour:

Crowe SJ, Bottichio L, Shade LN, et al: Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections associated with flour. N Engl J Med 2017; 377: 2036-2043
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background: In 2016, a multijurisdictional team investigated an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) [or EHEC] serogroup O121 and O26 infections linked to contaminated flour from a large domestic producer.

Methods: A case was defined as infection with an outbreak strain in which illness onset was between 21 Dec 2015, and 5 Sep 2016. To identify exposures associated with the outbreak, outbreak cases were compared with non-EHEC enteric illness cases, matched according to age group, sex, and state of residence. Products suspected to be related to the outbreak were collected for EHEC testing, and a common point of contamination was sought. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on isolates from clinical and food samples.

Results: A total of 56 cases were identified in 24 states. Univariable exact conditional logistic-regression models of 22 matched sets showed that infection was significantly associated with the use of one brand of flour (odds ratio, 21.04; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 4.69 to 94.37) and with tasting unbaked homemade dough or batter (odds ratio, 36.02; 95 percent CI, 4.63 to 280.17). Laboratory testing isolated the outbreak strains from flour samples, and whole-genome sequencing revealed that the isolates from clinical and food samples were closely related to one another genetically. Trace-back investigation identified a common flour-production facility.

Conclusions: This investigation implicated raw flour as the source of an outbreak of EHEC infections. Although it is a low-moisture food, raw flour can be a vehicle for foodborne pathogens.

A number of EHEC outbreaks in North America have been linked to raw flour or dough before and after the outbreak above as shown in the see also's below. - Mod.LL
