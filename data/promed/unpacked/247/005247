[County fairs and similar events that bring the general public into
close contact with farm animals present special problems with food
hygiene and drinking water quality because of the informality of the
environment in which large numbers of people are served. Local health
authorities face serious challenges in these circumstances. Perhaps
national guidelines should be established to assist them in designing
their precautionary measures. It is noteworthy that the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC have taken the first step by
publishing a press release offering basic precautionary measures on 20
Apr 2001
