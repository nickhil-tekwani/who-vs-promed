PI [Piaui state] has been following with attention and care the developments regarding the 3rd confirmed case of West Nile fever in Piaui. Since 2013, all suspected cases admitted to the municipal public network have been subjected to an investigation protocol implemented by the FMS [Fundacao Municipal de Saude de Teresina; Teresina Municipal Health Foundation] that includes West Nile virus, among several others of important relevance.

The patient in question, a victim of encephalitis, coming from Piripiri in Piaui, received all possible assistance in the intensive care unit of the Teresina Emergency Hospital, but suffered several clinical complications that, due to her advanced age and the presence of comorbidities, led to her death.

The coast and the interior of the state of Piaui are located on migratory bird routes, identified as important links in the spread of the disease [virus], according to the National Center for Research for the Conservation of Wild Birds (CEMAVE / ICMBIO). The virus was also detected in the state of Espirito Santo in 2018 and in the state of Ceara in 2019.

From 2014 to 2019, the FMS investigated 399 suspected human cases of severe West Nile fever disease from various cities in Piaui and neighboring states: 319 were discarded, 35 had "undetermined" results, and 42 remain under investigation. All hospitals in the municipality are trained to investigate and treat any new suspicious cases.

[West Nile virus transmission has been active in several spots in Brazil this year [2019]. There have been recent equine cases in Ceara and Espirito Santo states, so it is not surprising that a human case has occurred in Piaui state as well. As Mod.CRD noted in a previous ProMED-mail post (West Nile virus (19): Americas (Brazil) horse, OIE; archive no. 20190725.6586397), "West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans, and horses causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication" (see Source:http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.24_WEST_NILE.pdf).

Hosts are birds, some of which may succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans, but they are dead-end hosts and cannot infect mosquitoes. There is a vaccine available for equine animals but not for humans. The best preventive measure is to avoid mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
