It is with great sadness that we announce that the eminent parasitologist and [LSHTM] School alumnus Professor Ralph Lainson FRS OBE died this Tuesday, 5 May 2015, in the Hospital Beneficente Portuguesa near his home in Belem, northern Brazil.

Professor Lainson devoted his working life to gaining a greater understanding of the parasitic disease leishmaniasis in Central and South America -- and particularly Brazil, a country he passionately loved. After completing his PhD at the School in 1959, he went to Belize as Director of the Dermal Leishmaniasis Unit. In 1965 he moved to establish the Wellcome Trust Parasitology Unit at the Evandro Chagas Institute in Belem. Under his direction over 5 decades, the unit made a number of significant discoveries about leishmaniasis and parasitic diseases, and together with his collaborators he described hundreds of new species of protozoan parasites.

Born in 1927, he served in the army in World War II before studying biology and joining the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; he studied and worked as a lecturer under the supervision of the renowned Professor Cyril Garnham, FRS. Professor Lainson was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1982 and in the same year he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship, the School's most prestigious honour. According to the Wellcome Trust, he holds the record as their longest-serving grant-holder at 47 years! Probably even more welcome recognition for such a dedicated scientist, a new species of his beloved parasite, discovered in 1987, was named after him: _Leishmania (Viannia) lainsoni_.

Professor Lainson will be sadly missed by all who are lucky enough to have worked with him and known him, and he will be remembered affectionately by colleagues and former students around the world. Messages of condolence can be sent via the Director Peter Piot's office to <director@lshtm.ac.uk>.

[I was another British scientist working at the Institute Evandro Chagas at the mouth of the Amazon in those early days, and a contemporary of Ralph's. He was a good friend and excellent scientist, who received many well-deserved honours for his important work on leishmaniasis.
