Rabies is spreading intensively in Chelyabinskaya oblast among wild foxes.
During the last 3 weeks alone, rabid foxes were discovered in 7 populated
locations. During the last year, rabies was detected in 30 localities
within the region.
According to the Ural News Agency, rabid foxes are most prevalent in the
regions of Argayashskiy, Chebarkulskiy, and Etkulskiy. During January 2004
so far, 4 people have been bitten by wild foxes, and timely treated by
post-exposure vaccinations.
According to press information, wild foxes have become unafraid to approach
people, a behaviour not seen previously, which increases the risk of
infection spread by attacking domestic animals or even people. Rabies is a
lethal disease.

6 cases of animal rabies were registered in the Republic of Udmurtskaya
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rabies cases were registered in domestic animals in 2 regions of the
Republic of Udmurtskaya [situated in the Privolzhsky Federal District [one
of the 7 Federal districts included in the Russian Federation; southeast of
the Central Federal district. - Mod.AS].
In one of the regions, a rabid dog bit a child. According to the chief of
the Department of Veterinary Management, the reason that rabies has spread
among domestic animals is the migration of rabid foxes from the neighboring
regions of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan.

[Chelyabinskaya is in the South Urals, Udmurtskaya is west of the Urals, but
not bordering Chelyabinskaya. The intervening region probably has the same
problem with rabid foxes, since there is no geographical barrier. - Mod.JW]
