Second rabies fatality in Gelephu
---------------------------------
Gelephu saw its 2nd rabies fatality in the past 2 months with
the death of an 11-year-old girl on 24 Jul 2009. She had been bitten
by her pet dog, which died after a week, in June last year [month?].

The girl, a class V student of Pelrithang higher secondary school,
was brought to the Gelephu regional referral hospital at around 7:30
am. Clinical findings revealed that, after she had been bitten, she
had not taken the anti-rabies vaccine. She received only a tetanus
toxoid (TT) injection. The girl's parents told doctors that their pet
dog had bitten her hand and died after 7 days. Around 10:30 am, the
girl's father took her home although the hospital had arranged for a
cabin. "He took her home against medical advice," said the
officiating medical superintendent, Karma Yeshi. She was brought back
to hospital at around 6:30 pm. "She was showing signs of
encephalitis, brain inflammation caused by a virus, hydrophobia (fear
of water) and was restless when she was brought to us," said
pediatrician Dr Lily Win. The girl died at 12:30 am.

Karma Yeshi said that Gelephu residents still lack awareness of
rabies. "They still don't know that they have to seek medical help
after a dog bite or that rabies can be fatal," he said. 2 months
earlier, a 9-year-old boy studying in class III at Gelephu lower
secondary school died of rabies.

Rabies is caused by a virus and transmitted to humans from animals.
It is spread by infected saliva that enters the body through a bite
or broken skin. The virus travels from the wound to the brain, where
it causes swelling or inflammation.

An estimated 31 000 people die from dog rabies in Asia each year,
reports the World Health Organisation. Once signs and symptoms of
rabies start to appear, there is no treatment and the disease is
almost always fatal. According to health records, Bhutan recorded 57
cases of [human] rabies from 2004 to 2008.

[Ignorance of the nature and consequence of rabies virus infection in
this instance, rather than the non-availability of vaccine or medical
facilities, appears to have been responsible for the death of this
unfortunate girl. The immediate priority must be dissemination of
information about the disease and the role of dogs in its
transmission. Subsequently an attempt should be made to achieve
comprehensive vaccination of domestic dogs.

Travelers should be aware of the hazard of rabies in Bhutan and
should avoid contact with feral and domestic dogs.
