PENGUIN & ALBATROSS MORTALITY - NEW ZEALAND (02)

I have been studying malaria, babesiosis and (occasional)
leucocytozoonosis in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) for the
past 5-odd years together with others (including Graczyk in
Baltimore who did a large number of ELISA tests on specimens we sent
him) and have a good database on the (considerable) mortality
caused, especially by malaria (Plasmodium relictum). Others here have
also documented outbreaks of "cholera" and of Newcastle disease among
the penguins. These also can be devastating.
We would be willing to supply either references or some of the data we
have if you could indicate what particular line you are taking and
maybe you already have enough info on the above (There has been a
great deal of literature in the USA, eg. from Stoskopf (Univ. of N.
Carolina) on these diseases.
