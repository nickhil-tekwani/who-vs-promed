Although babies of women infected with COVID-19 during their pregnancies have been born with antibodies, it remains unclear if this means the baby is immune to the coronavirus or how long the immunity would last.

Earlier this month, [a 31-year old woman], gave birth to her 2nd child and was told by her son's paediatrician that he has antibodies against the virus. [The woman], a private tutor, is one of the few women in Singapore who were infected with COVID-19 during their pregnancies to have given birth here so far. In such cases, it is not clear if the antibodies were passed from the mother or the baby developed them for him or herself.

In a paper published in October [2020] by the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [see ref. 1 below], of the 11 infants who were born to women with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, all had detectable levels of IgG antibodies at birth, while 5 had detectable IgM antibodies.

IgM is the initial antibody that is produced in response to an infection. However, it is usually not transferred from mother to fetus through the placenta because of its large size. On the other hand, smaller IgG antibodies can be transferred passively from mother to fetus through the placenta, the paper noted. The duration of immunity from the maternal IgG antibodies is unclear.

Checks with the KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) found similar conclusions. Associate Professor Tan Hak Koon, KKH's chairman at the division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, said that there is evidence of antibodies among infants born to mothers with COVID-19. "However, it is still unknown whether the presence of these antibodies in a newborn baby confers a degree of protection against COVID-19 infection, much less the duration of protection," he said.

Meanwhile, both the National University Hospital (NUH) and the KKH are part of a larger ongoing study involving several public hospitals in Singapore to investigate how COVID-19 may potentially impact the well-being and health of pregnant women and their babies. A NUH spokesman said: "We hope that findings from the study can help inform clinical guidance for the care of affected pregnant women and their infants, and help safeguard their health and well-being."

A Singaporean woman who was pregnant when she was infected with coronavirus in March [2020] has reportedly given birth to a baby with antibodies against the disease, offering a new clue as to whether the infection can be transferred from mother to child. The baby, who was born this month [November 2020], does not have COVID-19 but has the virus antibodies, the Straits Times newspaper reported on Sunday [29 Nov 2020], citing the mother. "My doctor suspects I have transferred my COVID-19 antibodies to him during my pregnancy," [the mother] told the paper.

[The mother] had been mildly ill from the disease and was discharged from hospital after 2 and a half weeks, it said.

Rare transmission
-----------------
The World Health Organization says it is not yet known whether a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her fetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the active virus has not been found in samples of fluid around babies in the womb or in breast milk.

Doctors in China have reported the detection and decline over time of COVID-19 antibodies in babies born to women with coronavirus, according to an article published in October in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [see ref. 1 below].

Transmission of the coronavirus from mothers to newborns is rare, doctors from New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center reported in October in JAMA Pediatrics [see ref. 2 below].

[The body of literature focused on pregnancy outcomes and management of COVID-19 disease in pregnant women is growing. But, like other areas surrounding COVID-19, there are more questions than answers. A large bulk of the literature comes from China, where the 1st identified major outbreak occurred and involves studies through April 2020. Actual antibody transfer is still in the speculative phase, although in the incident mentioned above, the infection occurred in March 2020, in the 1st trimester of the pregnancy with the infant delivered 8 months later, suggesting there may well have been antibody transfer.

[2] Rethinking duration of isolation
Date: Fri 27 Nov 2020

People with COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, are most infectious about 2 days before symptoms begin and for 5 days afterward, according to a new analysis of previous research (see ref. 1 below, and discussed in COVID-19 update (497): baricitinib, viral load dynamics, Samoa, WHO, global 20201120.7958200].

A few patients who are extremely ill or have impaired immune systems may expel -- or "shed" -- the virus for as long as 20 days, other studies have suggested. Even in mild cases, some patients may shed live virus for about a week, the new analysis found. The accumulating data presents a quandary: Should public health officials shorten the recommended isolation time if it means more infected people will cooperate? Or should officials opt for longer periods in order to prevent transmission in virtually all cases, even if doing so takes a harsher toll on the economy?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that infected people isolate for a minimum of 10 days from the beginning of their illness. The agency is considering shortening the recommended isolation period and may issue new guidelines as early as next week, according to 2 federal officials with knowledge of the discussions.

In September [2020], France dropped its required period of isolation to 7 days from 14 days, and Germany is considering shortening it to 5 days. (Isolation refers to people who are ill; quarantine refers to people who have been exposed to the virus and may become ill.)

Setting the isolation period at 5 days is likely to be much more palatable and may encourage more infected people to comply, said Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St Andrews in Scotland who led the new analysis, published in the journal The Lancet Microbe [see ref. 1 below]

A recent survey in the United Kingdom showed that only 1 in 5 people were able to isolate for 10 days after developing symptoms [see ref. 2 below]. "Even if we do more testing, if we can't ensure people self-isolate, I don't think we'll be able to control the spread," Dr Cevik said.

In the United States, many people don't get tested for the infection until a day or 2 after they begin to feel ill. With the current delays, many receive results 2 or 3 days later, toward the end of the period during which they are infectious. "Even if you were to get the PCR test right on the very 1st day that you could, by the time you get the results back, 90 percent of your shedding has been completed," said Dr Michael Mina, a virologist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. "This meta-analysis shows just how short your transmission window is."

Dr Cevik and her colleagues set out to analyze the so-called kinetics of the coronavirus over the course of an infection and to compare the pathogen to the closely related SARS and MERS viruses. The researchers considered nearly 1500 studies published from 2003 to June 2020 on the timing of infection in thousands of people, most of whom were sick enough to be hospitalized. The team drew data from 79 studies of the new coronavirus, 11 studies of MERS, and 8 studies of SARS. People who never develop symptoms seem to carry about the same amount of the new coronavirus as symptomatic patients, Dr Cevik and her colleagues found. But asymptomatic people seem to clear the virus more quickly from their bodies.

People with COVID-19 usually are most infectious a day or 2 before the onset of symptoms until about 5 days after, the analysis concluded. Yet patients may carry genetic fragments from the virus in their noses and throats for an average of 17 days, and, in some cases, for up to 3 months.

A few patients may carry infectious virus in their lungs -- as opposed to the nose and throat -- for as long as 8 days after symptoms begin, noted Dr Megan Ranney, an emergency physician at Brown University. For these patients, at least, isolation periods should probably be longer than 5 days, if only they could be identified. "The trouble is, who has COVID pneumonia versus who doesn't is not always fully apparent just based on physical exam," she said. "They wouldn't know it on their own."

Older people tend to be infectious for longer than younger people, but no study in the analysis detected live virus beyond 9 days of symptom onset. The results suggest that positive tests after that point find only genetic fragments, rather than whole live virus, Dr Cevik said. Because the infectious period seems to peak relatively quickly in the course of the illness, health care workers at community clinics may be at higher risk of becoming infected than those working in ICU units, where patients tend to be in the later stages, Dr Cevik added.

The analysis underscores data that has accumulated since March [2020]. In July [2002], based on similar evidence, the CDC truncated its recommendation for isolation to 10 days from 14 days. But even at 10 days, the isolation period may be too long for many people, experts said. Patients may be financially unable to isolate for so long, or they may not feel sick enough to want to do so.

"If you could make that shorter for people, I think that would really help people comply with the public health guidelines," said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, referring to the recommended isolation period. But the new analysis is limited by the fact that only a few of the included studies looked at live virus, she added.

Some people who are older or very sick may be infectious for longer than a week. But if a shorter recommended period encourages more people to isolate, the benefit will more than offset any risk to the community from the small amount of virus that a few patients may still carry after 5 days, said Dr Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.

But some doctors said that they were not convinced by the analysis that 5 days of isolation would prevent transmission from a majority of people. "There's a sweet spot there, I would imagine, but I haven't figured out where that is," said Dr Taison Bell, a critical care and infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia.

Dr Cevik and other experts suggest that people can isolate as soon as they experience even mild symptoms, such as a sore throat or head and body aches -- without venturing out for a PCR test right when they are most infectious. But Dr Bell said he was unsure how this would work in practice, because these early symptoms were similar to those from other viral infections, including the common cold.

Dr Cevik said a PCR test could be performed after isolation ended to confirm the diagnosis. Alternately, it may make sense to take a rapid antigen test -- which can detect high amounts of virus -- while isolating, so as to confirm an active coronavirus infection. Other experts also endorsed the use of at-home rapid tests. "I think that's a lovely solution," Dr Ranney said. "If you have symptoms, and you have a reliable test that you can do at home, stay home, test at home, and isolate for 5 days."

Overall, the new analysis underscores how quickly the coronavirus blooms in the body and the speed with which both patients and doctors must respond to keep it contained, Dr Baral said. Levels of the MERS virus peak at 7 to 10 days from symptom onset, and those of the SARS virus peak at days 10 to 14. By contrast, the new coronavirus "moves quick," Dr Baral said. "It's a very difficult virus to control, as compared to SARS."

Home isolation is safe for most of those newly infected with the coronavirus, he added -- essentially the model of care that doctors use for patients suspected of having influenza.

Some countries already have adopted policies to make it easier for people to isolate. Viet Nam provides income support to people who need to take time off work. Until May [2020], the Japanese government asked patients who were young and had mild symptoms to stay home for 4 days before seeking testing. Japan's guidelines now ask patients to consult by phone with their doctors and to seek testing only if they seem likely to be infected. Anyone who tests positive is admitted to a hospital or a hotel to isolate. In the United States, New York City and Vermont have made similar accommodations available to infected patients.

Even if the rest of the country doesn't implement such policies, having patients isolate at home -- while wearing a mask, keeping windows open, cleaning high-touch surfaces, and staying far from other household members -- is more feasible for 5 days than for 10, Dr Baral said. "I do think there's an element of diminishing returns with those last 4 or 5 days," he said. "An intense amount of isolation during that 1st 5 to 7 days would avert a ton of infections -- a ton."

[The media report above mentions how a number of countries are handling the isolation stage where they are hospitalized (some in overflow hospitals), receive monetary supplement and food. That has resulted in higher levels of compliance and less stress on the infected individuals. The challenges are further complicated when an asymptomatic infection is identified as part of contact tracing or personal concern after a probable exposure. What is day 1 of the infectious period? And how does one determine the end of the infectious period?

These are legitimate concerns, especially in areas where the NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) have become politicized and people do not adhere to mask wearing, social distancing, or hand washing.

[Note that weekend artifact is noticeable in today's report with significant drops in the 24 hour newly confirmed cases and deaths from yesterday's report (28 Nov 2020). The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added).

Data by country, area, or territory for 29 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov29_1606692768.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 45.7% of daily case numbers and 35.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 26.2 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Peru, Chile, Panama, Ecuador and Costa Rica. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Paraguay.

- The European region reported 37.2% of daily case numbers and 46.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 18.4 million. Countries not reporting cases today (29 Nov 2020) include Spain, Israel, Switzerland, Sweden, Kazakhstan, and Norway, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Russia, Italy, UK, Poland, Germany, Ukraine, and France. There are 22 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.8% of daily case numbers and 7.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.04 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Morocco, Jordan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Iraq, Palestinian Authority, UAE, and Tunisia. Oman, Libya, Djibouti, Sudan, Yemen, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.49 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Algeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.87 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, China, Mongolia, and Guam.

- The South East Asia region reported 8.9% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.7 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Maldives. Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases include Sri Lanka and Myanmar, among others.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours, even with reduced reports over the weekend. At the country level, Japan is the dominant country in the Western Pacific region; Italy and Russia are dominant in the European region. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (140 047), India (41 284), Turkey (29 281), and Russia (26 683) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 6945 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (28-29 Nov 2020). Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Costa Rica among others.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, India, Turkey, Russia, Brazil (24 468), Italy (20 646), Germany (13 637), Ukraine (12 978), Iran (12 950), UK (12 155), and Poland (11 482). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (down from 64 on Fri 27 Nov 2020); 26 of the 56 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 2.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.3%. The USA has decreased both newly confirmed cases (-5.0%) and reported deaths (-4.5%) which may be a function of the weekend decreased reporting.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase -- it took 24 hours to go from 61.9 million cases to 62.6 million cases and another 24 hours to go to 63.1 million cases, even though the daily cases reported were almost 1/3 less than the preceding day. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. - Mod.MPP]
