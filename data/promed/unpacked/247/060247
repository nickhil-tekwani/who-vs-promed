Approximately 300 people have been afflicted with buruli ulcers in the
Kakamoeka district, Kouilou region, in south Congo-Brazzaville, the weekly
"Tam-Tam of Africa" reported Monday.
"The illness is not well-understood among the Congolais" stated Dr.
Stanislas Ebata-Mongo, director of the struggle against buruli ulcers and
minister of health. The disease begins with the appearance of pimples
which, after several days, begin to ulcerate. The open sores follow.
The first cases were discovered 3 months ago in Louaka, a village in
Kakamoeka, before they spread to other villages. The illness is very
contagious and infection occurs with contacts with the patient.
The first team of health workers for the regional health office of Kouilou
are already at the site. Indications are that others will be coming from
Brazzaville.
The disease is very damaging because the patient may be afflicted with it
for some 30 years. "There isn't a specific treatment. We treat the
patients with antibiotics," but the presence of the sores in certain parts
of the body limit activities during the illness, explains Dr. Ebata-Mongo.
