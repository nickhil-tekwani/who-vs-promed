-------------------------------------------------------------------
The episode in Brescia is the latest of several recent outbreaks of
viral gastroenteritis in Italy. The following background information
is abstracted from Gideon at the URL above.

Prevalence surveys
------------------
Adenoviruses account for 6 percent of pediatric hospitalizations in
Sicily for diarrhea, rotavirus 25.1 percent, astrovirus 7 percent,
norovirus 18.6 percent (2003).

Adenoviruses are found in 6.2 percent of pediatric patients with acute
diarrhea (2005).

Noroviruses account for 10.4 percent of hospitalized pediatric
gastroenteritis cases in northern Italy (2002).

Noroviruses were the most frequently involved viruses (23.7 percent)
in sporadic acute diarrhea among hospitalized children and were more
common in children older than 5 years (37 percent) than in children
younger than 5 years (10 percent). The frequency of rotavirus, enteric
adenovirus and astrovirus was 12.2 percent, 1.6 percent and 2.4
percent, respectively (Brescia, 2007 publication).

Noroviruses account for 48.4 percent of pediatric (below age 3)
hospitalizations for diarrhea in Palermo (2004).

18.2 percent of retail bivalve mollusks in Rome are contaminated with
astrovirus, and 2.1 percent with norovirus (2007 publication).

Norovirus infection was confirmed in a captive lion cub (_Panthera
leo_) in Pistoia in 2004.

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
- 2000: 344 cases of norovirus gastroenteritis occurred at a tourist
resort in the Gulf of Taranto. Presumed source drinking water. This
was the 1st confirmed outbreak of NLV [Norwalk-like virus?] infection
in Italy.
