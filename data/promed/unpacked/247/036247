A Calilegua city councilman of the Partido Justicialista [political party] died due to a hantavirus [infection], as reported this Tuesday [1 Jan 2013].

The [victim] is a 53-year-old man who was diagnosed by physicians as having this disease, although his disease has not yet been confirmed by the provincial Ministry of Health.

The man died this past Sunday [30 Dec 2012] in a private clinic in Libertador General San Martin city, where he had been admitted, but the death was reported this Tuesday [1 Jan 2012] by his relatives.

The councilman was from Calilegua, 112 km (69 mi) east of San Salvador city in Jujuy province.

[This case appears to be part of an outbreak of hantavirus disease (presumably hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) that was ongoing in 2012. In 2012, there were about 260 suspected hantavirus infection cases, of which 22 were laboratory confirmed. Deaths now total 7 with the above fatality.

Because Jujuy is in the far northwest part of Argentina, adjacent to the border with Chile, one would suspect Andes virus to be the hantavirus involved in these cases, but the report of 27 Dec 2012 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20121229.1473724) indicated that Andes virus is not present in this province. The previous post and the above report do not indicate which hantavirus is involved.

As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like virus Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana virus (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran virus (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo virus (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case or which rodent species were implicated as reservoirs.
