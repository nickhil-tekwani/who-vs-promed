Bad medical practices could have led to outbreak
------------------------------------------------
State health minister Jay Narayan Vyas on Thursday [20 Feb 2009] indicated
that spread of the hepatitis B outbreak could get bigger. Already 7 doctors
in Sabarkantha have been booked for bad medical practices.

Responding to the issue raised by BJP MLA Dilipsinh Parmar in the state
Assembly on Thursday [19 Feb 2009], Vyas said of the 150 642 people checked
in 227 villages in the district, it was found that 459 people had taken
injections, 1883 people had undergone surgeries, another 152 had taken
dental treatment and 25 people had under gone blood transfusion. All of
these could cause transmission of the deadly virus if care was not taken by
medical practitioners. Vyas indicated that these could be the possible
reason for the outbreak.

He said that 11 medical teams are in the area and are collecting blood
samples for further analysis. In addition, 2 members from National
Institute of Virology, Pune, are also camping here studying the outbreak.

[Previously ProMED-mail requested information justifying diagnosis of
hepatitis D virus infection (which can only occur in the presence of
hepatitis B virus infection) as the cause of deaths in the hepatitis
outbreak in Gujarat. The above report mentioned only hepatitis B virus
infection as the the cause of additional deaths. Now the outbreak and the
fatalities are being attributed to transmission of hepatitis B virus
infection by improper medical procedures.

It is unclear whether hepatitis D virus infection or hepatitis B virus
infection alone is responsible for the deaths of some patients. As a large
number of people have been identified as possible recipients of
contaminated blood through lax medical procedures, further deaths are to be
expected. Information on the progress of the outbreak and confirmation, or
not, of involvement of heatitis D virus is requested from any informed
source. - Mod.CP
