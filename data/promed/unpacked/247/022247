[The latest Rapid Risk Assessment on HPAIV H5 in Germany on 26 Apr 2021, pages 12 and 13, (available at Rapid Risk Assessment HPAIV H5 in Germany, Friedrich-Loeffler Institute, 26 Apr 2021. https://www.openagrar.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/openagrar_derivate_00037034/FLI-Risikoeinschaetzung_HPAIV_H5_2021-04-26_en-bf.pdf) says,

"An analysis of the genome sequences confirms the high genetic variability of the currently circulating viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b. In Europe, at least 14 different reassortant viruses of different subtypes were determined. Viruses of the H5N8 subtype are dominant, as is the case in Germany: 3 different H5N8 reassortants, as well as viruses of the subtypes H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, and H5N5 have been genetically characterized. These viruses also show a distinct neurotropism with partially very high viral loads in the brain.

"In Germany, 245 outbreaks have occurred so far in poultry, including captive birds in zoological facilities. Wherever there are potential contacts between wild birds and domestic poultry, especially waterfowl, infections can be introduced, and new sources of infection can emerge unless an escape of virus from affected flocks can be prevented. Virus-contaminated material (footwear, vehicles, objects, litter) is considered the most likely source of infection. Poultry farms that share and move litter or other materials or tools, or even batches of birds, between units are particularly at risk.

"Between 21 Dec 2020 and 16 Jan 2021, a series of 18 HPAI H5 outbreaks occurred in turkeys (mostly fatteners) and one in ducks in the district of Cloppenburg, a region with high poultry density. The sources of infection are unknown. However, the full genome sequences of the viruses from the affected holdings are almost identical, so that secondary spread between the flocks can be assumed.

"Another series of outbreaks relating to HPAIV H5N8 occurred since the end of February [2021] in the district of Cloppenburg that recorded 18 outbreaks, including 16 turkey fattening farms. Here, the full genome sequences of the analyzed viruses demonstrated genetically clearly distinguishable viruses compared to the viruses of the outbreaks in December [2020] and January [2021] in the same county. In this case, too, there are indications, based on the closely matching full-genome sequences, that there must have been spread between some flocks.

"A series of secondary infections, affecting several federal states, was caused by the distribution of infected live poultry in mobile trade. Approximately 100 new outbreaks in poultry, mostly in small holdings, especially in Thuringia and Baden-Wurttemberg, were caused as described above in a short period between the end of March and the beginning of April [2021]. However, all outbreaks were controlled quickly and effectively, although it is of concern that potential disease spread due to mobile trade of poultry remains a threat."
