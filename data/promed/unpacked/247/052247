A suspected virulent avian influenza (AI) case has been reported in Asan, South Chungcheong Province, authorities announced [Sun 20 Oct 2019], as South Korea has been struggling to curb the spread of African swine fever for months.

A case of AI H5 virus has been confirmed in wild bird feces, sampled near a creek last Tuesday [15 Oct 2019], according to the National Institute of Environmental Research, which is affiliated with the environment ministry.

The agency said the case is suspected to be a virulent bird flu virus, adding it's expected to take a day or 2 to confirm whether it's highly pathogenic. Asan is located some 90 kilometers [56 mi] south of Seoul.

The agency has notified the agriculture ministry and local authorities of the findings for swift quarantine measures.

[Highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks have occurred in South Korea since 2003, with 4 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in 2003-2004, 2006-2007, 2008 and 2010-2011. Since 2014, a new HPAI subtype, H5N8, caused outbreaks in South Korean poultry farms. The introduction of the HPAI subtype H5N8 in South Korea was associated with wild water birds in winter. In 2017, an outbreak in poultry was found to be caused by a H5N6 virus, a novel reassortant of at least 5 different subtypes (H5N8, H7N7, H5N1, H10N7, and H3N6) from the natural gene pool in Eurasian avian influenza viruses. - Mod.PMB

In South Korea, novel reassortants of HPAIVs such as H5N6 and H5N8 were circulating in poultry.

The researchers isolated new reassortant avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses from feces of wild waterfowl in South Korea during 2017-18. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that reassortment occurred between clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 and Eurasian low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses circulating in wild birds. Dissemination to South Korea during the 2017 fall migratory season followed [1].

Outbreaks of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have caused economic losses for the poultry industries and constitute a threat to public health. Avian influenza is a disease listed under the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code.
