The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is investigating a sporadic case of legionnaires' disease (LD) affecting a man aged 87.

The patient, with underlying illnesses, lives in Zhuhai, Guangdong. He has presented with shortness of breath, fever, and cough with sputum since [25 Aug 2015]. He came to Hong Kong for medical consultation on [27 Aug 2015] and was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital [QEH] on the same day. The clinical diagnosis is pneumonia and he is now in serious condition.

His urine specimen tested positive for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen upon testing by QEH.

Initial inquiries revealed that, during the incubation period, the patient had traveled to Hong Kong from [19 to 21 Aug 2015] and then stayed in the Mainland before onset. His home contact has remained asymptomatic.

"We are conducting epidemiological investigations into the possible source of infection. We have provided health advice on LD to his family," a spokesman for the CHP said. "As _Legionella_ bacteria can be widely found in the environment, investigations are ongoing," the spokesman remarked.

This is the 40th LD case reported to the CHP this year [2015]. In 2014 and 2013, 41 and 28 cases were recorded respectively.

[ProMED-mail posted in January 2015 a report of the 6th case of legionnaires' disease in Hong Kong in 2015. We are now told there have been 40 cases reported so far this year (2015) in Hong Kong. In 2014 and 2013, 41 and 28 cases were recorded, respectively. The current patient lives in Guangdong, China, but is said to have travelled to Hong Kong from 19 to 21 Aug 2015, and first became symptomatic on 25 Aug 2015 after returning home, 4 days later, in the city of Zhuhai, Guangdong, China. Legionnaires' disease has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days after exposure (http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians.html), which implies that he could have been exposed to a source of _Legionella_ in Hong Kong or in Zhuhai.

We don't know if this case is an isolated case or part of an outbreak from a common source. The news report does not say if there are any cases of legionnaires' disease in the patient's hometown or if there are epidemiological links between the current case and the other 39 cases that have occurred so far this year (2015) in Hong Kong. More information concerning Legionnaires' disease in Hong Kong from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Genotyping of isolates is a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, genotyping is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing (as occurred in the current case described in the news report above) or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

For discussions of legionnaires' disease, see my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed in the see also's below.

Zhuhai is a city on the southern coast of Guangdong province in China, bordering Macau to the south and is part of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen region, with more than 44 million residents in 2010 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai). - Mod.ML
