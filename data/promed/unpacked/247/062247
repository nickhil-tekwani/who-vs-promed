The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) reports, based on preliminary data, the number of iGAS [invasive Group A streptococcal infection] cases reported in November [2022] was twice the number of cases in other months (46 cases in November to date compared to an average of 20 cases/month in 2022).

The data is based on statewide surveillance for iGAS infections defined as GAS [Group A streptococci, also called _Streptococcus pyogenes_] isolated from a sterile body site (such as blood, CSF, pleural fluid, bone, joint, muscle), streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, or necrotizing fasciitis.

To date, cases occurring in the community are not known to be epidemiologically linked and there are no obvious geographic patterns of illness. Case increases have been observed in all age groups but the increase is notable in pediatric and elderly patients and may be related to increasing respiratory viral activity.

Group A streptococcal infections can cause a range of illnesses from mild or moderate (e.g., pharyngitis and skin and soft tissue infections) to severe disease (e.g., pneumonia, bacteremia, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [STSS], and necrotizing fasciitis). These severe infections have a high case fatality rate. Individuals at higher risk for severe or invasive GAS (iGAS) disease include elderly or immunocompromised persons, persons with medical conditions including diabetes, malignancy, or chronic kidney, cardiac, or respiratory disease, those with skin disease, trauma, surgical wounds, injection drug use, or varicella infection, and people experiencing homelessness.

GAS infections can spread rapidly in congregate settings including long-term care facilities, shelters for people who are experiencing homelessness, and others. In these settings, when an iGAS case is identified, there are frequently unrecognized non-invasive GAS infections.

[For a discussion of group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, please see my moderator comments in ProMED posts Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918 and Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - UK: (England) seasonal increased cases 20220424.8702816.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) commonly causes pharyngitis, local suppurative extensions to involve the middle ear (otitis media) and sinuses (mastoiditis), and superficial skin infections, but can also cause invasive infections, including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur after GAS pharyngitis.

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person.

Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html). Over 200 emm types have been identified. Molecular analysis of the isolates emm aids in documenting a common source of an outbreak.

ProMED has posted several reports of outbreaks of invasive GAS infection (iGAS) in the past in the UK and in Canada among homeless people and people who inject drugs, due to particular emm types (see the See Also section below). There is a current outbreak in the UK of iGAS (see ProMED posts Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918; Streptococcus, group A - UK (03): scarlet fever, iGAS, fatal, RFI 20221209.8707158; and Streptococcus, group A - UK (02): (England) children, fatal, RFI 20221206.8707105) and in Spain (see ProMED post Streptococcus, group A - Spain: (MD) invasive, children, fatal, RFI 20221210.8707189). Molecular emm typing would be important to document relatedness of the outbreaks in the USA, Spain, and the UK.

In the UK, in 2016, 84% of all emm1 strains isolated upper respiratory GAS isolates had a distinctive emm type 1 (designated M1UK) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838661/). The iGAS isolates collected in the same period in the UK were also M1UK (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext). M1UK was found to produce 9 times more streptococcal exotoxin than previous versions of emm type 1 isolates.

More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML
