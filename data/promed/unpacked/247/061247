Residents of Haripora, Kangan in Ganderbal district [Jammu and Kashmir] today [18 Feb 2018] complained of an "outbreak of jaundice" in the area, claiming "several people including children have contracted the water borne disease." As per locals scores of people including children of the area have fallen sick showing symptoms [of jaundice].

"We are living in a constant fear of an epidemic outbreak as many people in our area are suffering of jaundice due to the consumption of contaminated water," said [a local resident].

They complained that [water pipes were laid decades ago and have] gathered rust and mud that comes with water. Locals told Greater Kashmir that they are forced to use filthy drinking water despite having informed the PHE [Public Health Engineering department] authorities about the problem.

Meanwhile health authorities expressed ignorance about the issue. "I have no reports about any outbreak. I will check and will send a team to the area tomorrow," BMO Kangan, Dr Shabir told Greater Kashmir. Executive Engineer, PHE, Ganderbal could not be contacted for his comment in this regard.

[The 2 most relevant causes of waterborne viral hepatitis are types A and E. Outbreaks of type A tend to be in underdeveloped areas and tend to be in children while type E tends to be in adults. They can be distinguished by serological testing.

Jammu and Kashmir is a state in northern India, often denoted by the acronym J&K. It is located mostly in the Himalayan mountains, and shares borders with the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south. The Line of Control separates it from the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north respectively, and a Line of Actual Control separates it from the Chinese-administered territory of Aksai Chin in the east.
