A man and a woman have been hospitalized in Caracal in Olt County and in the Pitesti hospital in Arges showing symptoms of anthrax infection.

The 1st case is a woman from the village of Colonesti who was admitted to hospital in Pitesti. Most likely, she contracted the bacteria from the carcass of an animal brought by floods last week.

The other case of anthrax disease is a man from the village of Dobrosloveni. It seems that he slaughtered an animal in the household and was cut by one of the bones. The man was admitted to the hospital in Caracal.

"I'm suspicious. Nothing confirmed yet. For now, the patients are hospitalized, one in Pitesti and the other in Caracal. The laboratory has yet to confirm the initial diagnoses. The patients are in hospital in a controlled environment. They are in good condition," said Dr. Victorita Diaconescu, DSP manager Olt.

Doctors took samples and sent them Cantacuzino Institute in Bucharest, which will announce the results of analyzes Mon 11 Aug 2014. Meanwhile, River Health Department inspectors are investigating the sources of infection.

Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. This microbe's spores are found in the soil and can be ingested by sheep, cows, horses and goats (livestock grazing). Anthrax most commonly occurs in warm-blooded animals but can also infect humans. When inhaled by people, bacteria cause respiratory failure and death of the patient in less than one week.

Transmission to humans is usually through contact with infected animals but may also occur as a result of breathing air filled with the bacillus spores. The disease mainly affects individuals who handle animal hides (farmers, butchers and veterinarians) or spin wool. There are 3 types of anthrax [disease]: cutaneous, respiratory and intestinal.

At the end of last week, it was announced that there are 2 suspected [cases in] Olt [of] anthrax infection.

Yesterday [10 Aug 2014], another man in the same county was found suspected of having anthrax, leading to 3 the number of potential patients, according to TVR. He was admitted to hospital in Caracal, where there is already another patient. Both were isolated in the Department of Infectious Diseases. Their families have been advised by doctors to come to the hospital for [monitoring]. The 3rd suspect is a woman who has, since last Wednesday [6 Aug 2014], been admitted to a hospital in Pitesti.

[Our thanks to Sabine for this report.

Being exposed to a carcass in floodwater sounds strange, but dumping a carcass into a flooded river is a convenient way used by the careless to get rid of it. One of my students once told me that his dad, a dairy farmer, once hauled a dead cow out of the Red River and skinned it. It didn't come free, as he subsequently lost some 8 cows grazing that riverside field to anthrax; presumably, they visited the carcass and the spilt blood. I doubt whether this Romanian woman could have similarly dragged a carcass out of their flooded river. It was probably done by a neighbour, which would imply that others would have been exposed.

The fellow's story is typical of slaughtering and butchering a sick animal. To be "cut by a bone" while butchering is uncommon, unless the animal had a broken limb or some other trauma. Or maybe he was just careless, cut himself, and blamed the cow.

Both cases have yet to be confirmed.

The man's village, Dobrossloveni, is at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RO/00/Dobrosloveni.html, and Caracal, his hospital, is nearby at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RO/00/Caracal2.html. - Mod.MHJ
