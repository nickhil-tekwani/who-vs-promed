Diseases affecting coffee plants worry growers
-----------------------------------------------
In the coffee-growing district of Kodagu [Karnataka], heavy rainfall
affects the coffee with 'koleroga' [black rot]. With the region
receiving rainfall in June [2010], the coffee plants started
flowering and bearing fruit.

The shortage of labourers has affected the trimming of the trees. The
increasing shade has resulted in rainwater getting collected in one
particular place, thus affecting the coffee with 'koleroga' disease.
Coffee leaves have started withering and fruit has started falling.
The 'koleroga' has affected coffee in 2 villages.

Coffee growers had trimmed the trees, however, with the decline in
rainfall several coffee plants have died. If the growers fail to
pluck the fruit, 'Kai Koraka' insects [mites] may eat the fruit.
There is [also] a problem of white borer, 'Kanda Koraka', which has
affected coffee for the last decade but could not be controlled
despite pesticide sprays.

[The fungus _Corticium koleroga_ (previously _Pellicularia koleroga_,
_Ceratobasidium noxium_) causes thread blight (also called black rot)
of coffee and some other tropical or subtropical woody plants,
including cocoa, tea, and citrus species. Symptoms include dark brown
or black decay and rot of leaves (see photos provided with the story
above), twigs, and berries followed by defoliation, berry drop, and
dieback. Affected leaves may hang from strong fungal mycelial threads
that can be seen on twigs and petioles. Whole plantings can be
affected resulting in severe crop damage.

Disease development is favoured by heavy rainfall, high atmospheric
humidity (95-100 percent), shade, and overhanging branches. Spread
occurs by wind, water, plant, and other material, and mechanical
means (including insect activities). Disease management is difficult
and may include cultural practices (trimming of vegetation to improve
air flow, minimising human activities during monsoon season to reduce
the risk of pathogen spread), phytosanitation (removal of infected
plant material) to reduce available inoculum, and copper sprays
whenever weather conditions permit.

Occasionally, the term 'koleroga' appears to be used in India also to
refer to pink disease caused by _Phanerochaete salmonicolor_
(previously _Corticium salmonicolor_), which has a similar host range
and also affects coffee. It is a serious disease affecting mainly the
bark, and branches may have a covering of pink fungal hyphae.
