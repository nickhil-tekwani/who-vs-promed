Rat poison added to Ecstasy for more kick
-----------------------------------------
Drug traffickers are adulterating Ecstasy pills with rat poison to make it
affordable for school children, says Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA)
president Ling Liong Sik. Dr Ling said the rat poison in the locally
produced Ecstasy pills could give a bigger kick to techno music-crazed pill
poppers.
He said the police anti-narcotics chief told him that analysis of the pills
had shown that some contained highly toxic rat poison. "Ecstasy pills are
getting more and more contaminated while the price is going down quickly to
lure more victims. Very soon, it will be RM5 (US$1.30) or RM6 per pill
against the initial RM100 (US$26) to RM150 each," he said.
Dr Ling, who is Transport Minister, added that police in almost all states
were stepping up raids on discos and pubs to halt the menace. He said the
police welcomed tip-offs on places peddling Ecstasy pills.
The MCA, a senior member of the ruling Barisan Nasional, has declared war on
Ecstasy abuse after finding nearly 200 000 Chinese youths affected. Anyone
with more than 50 gm of Ecstasy is deemed to be a trafficker and faces a
mandatory death penalty. Health Ministry Parliamentary Secretary S.
Sothinathan said the authorities were considering reducing the amount of
Ecstasy which could constitute a trafficking offence [eligible for the death
penalty].

[I suppose nobody is going to pop enough pills at one time to die from the
rat poison in them, but this is posted as an alert that this type of
adulterated cheap Ecstasy may soon emerge as a problem in other countries.
