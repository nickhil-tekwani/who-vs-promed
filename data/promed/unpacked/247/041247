Further outbreaks of Bluetongue Virus (BTV) have been reported in France, Hungary and Romania in the past week.

10 outbreaks were reported this week to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) from France [see comment].

The outbreaks in France appear to be spreading further south and west, with outbreaks now detected in the regions of Indre and Cantal. The outbreak was initially identified in Allier, which this week reported 2 outbreaks.

13 cattle and 1 sheep or goat were the latest cases, with over 1300 cattle now declared as susceptible in France.

Some of the cases were identified as part of a national surveillance programme, whilst others were identified after clinical suspicion.

BTV appeared on 2 more farms in southern Hungary, in Somogy and Baranya provinces near the border with Croatia.

Although there were only 4 cases, 1634 cattle were put at risk, with most of these cattle situated on the larger Baranya farm.

2 backyard holdings were affected by the disease in the Botosani region of Romania, on the border with Ukraine. There were 2 cases, with 9 susceptible cattle.

The outbreaks in Romania and Hungary were of serotype 4, whilst in France the virus was of serotype 8.

[According to OIE's most recent summary, the total number of BTV-8 outbreaks in central France, since the start of the event on 21 Aug 2015 and as of 9 Oct 2015, is 55 (submitted).

A presentation on this epizootic, submitted by France on 8 Oct 2015 during the meeting in Brussels of EU's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed ( Section Animal Health & Welfare), is available on-line at
http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/ag_2015100708-bt-france_en.pdf.

Genotyping of the BTV-8 strain will enable its recognition either as a flare-up of residual virus from the previous epizootic (2006-2009) or a (less likely) new introduction. Results are anticipated with interest.

BTV-4 is currently circulating in Romania and Hungary (the serotyping of the Hungarian strain as BTV-4 was expected but not yet reported by ProMED-mail).
