5 deaths from Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) have been confirmed in
recent weeks from the cities of Campinas, Piracicaba, and Pedreira in Sao
Paulo state, Brazil. [Also known as Sao Paulo fever, RMSF is endemic in Sao
Paulo state but rarely reported. - Mod.JW] The disease is transmitted by
the tick _Amblyomma cajennense_, which is abundant during the current dry
season. Main hosts of the tick are rodents such as the aquatic capybara
and horses, according to veterinarian Eliane de Carvalho, of the Zoonoses
Center in Piracicaba.
One 54-year-old victim lived in the Monte Alegre district, on the banks of
the Rio Piracicaba, where capybaras are found.
In Campinas, 2 retirees aged 59 and 65 years, neighbors in the Jardim Santa
Eudoxia, also died of the infection. They had been fishing in Valinhos the
month before. One of them died on 24 Jun 2003 and the other 2 days
later. [The incubation period is 3-14 days, so the fishing trip probably
had nothing to do with it. - Mod.JW]
The other 2 fatal cases were in Pedreira, according to the State secretary
for Health.
Household visits to explain the disease are being made, and ticks are being
collected by the Superintendency for the Control of Endemics (Sucen) to
test for rickettsia, the type of bacteria which causes the infection.

[Although originally described in the Rocky Mountains of the western USA,
RMSF is most commonly reported in the USA in the middle Atlantic states
such as North Carolina. A focus has also been reported in the borough of
the Bronx in New York City. As seen in this posting, the disease is also
found in South and Central America with _Amblyomma_ instead of
_Dermacentor_ as the tick vector. - Mod.LL]
