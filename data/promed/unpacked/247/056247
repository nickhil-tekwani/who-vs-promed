The Iowa-based Swine Health Information Center (SHIC) announced last week an outbreak of Seneca Valley [virus] A (SVA) in Brazil. The disease has been found in pigs of all ages, but initial cases were located in finishing pigs, said the SHIC.

A previous outbreak of the disease in Brazil in the autumn and winter of 2014-15 preceded an occurrence of the disease in the US in 2015, the center said.

The center is working to understand the risk presented from the outbreak in Brazil, said Paul Sundberg, executive director with SHIC.

"What we do know is that SVA will be able to survive the trip from Brazil in soybean meal and other feed components," he told us. "We are going to continue to work on getting sufficient data to quantify the risk." SVA is one of several diseases the SHIC has examined for potential ability to survive transport conditions for a period in feed and feed ingredients.

The SHIC research project tracking the potential for diseases to live in feed and remain infectious followed an initial study examining the potential of the porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus to survive the process of being imported from Asia in feed, feed ingredients, and other products.

The new outbreak of SVA in Brazil has presented with severe lesions in animals and a delayed healing process, the SHIC said. Mortality rates in young piglets have approached 30 percent at some locations.

The disease was initially reported at swine finishing facilities before being found at nurseries and farrowing sites, the center said. However, it also has been located in feed mill supplies and feed ingredients including mixed meat and bone meal and soybean meal. It also was determined to be in feed for finishing pigs.

Efforts are being made to compare the current disease to a strain that was present in Brazil in 2014-15, the center said. However, there is a concern that the disease is a mutant strain with increased pathogenicity.

[Senecavirus A - SVA (Seneca Valley virus) belongs to the genus _Senecavirus_ within the Picornaviridae family. The clinical signs are characterized by vesicles and coalescing erosions on the snouts and coronary bands in infected sows, nursery, and finishing pigs [Lesions such as this must be differentiated from other diseases such as foot and mouth disease virus. - Mod.TG]. Acute mortality in neonatal piglets has also been sporadically reported.

Previous attempts to fulfill Koch postulates with SVA have been unsuccessful, and data is lacking on modes of transmission, incubation period, and duration of viral shedding. Viremia associated with SVA is unknown, but the lab has retrieved whole genome sequences of SVA from sow serum. The majority of SVA sequences available from GenBank consist of VP1 gene.

SVA has been identified by real time PCR from snouts, hooves, lymph nodes, and serum from affected sows that tested negative for FMDV, VSV, SVDV, and VESV. In addition, the virus has been detected in several tissues including brain, liver, spleen, lung, intestine, and heart from acutely dead piglets born from clinically infected sows [Detection referred to here was by the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (MNVDL). - Mod.TG; https://www.vdl.umn.edu/disease-information-resources/seneca-valley-virus].

The issue of this virus surviving in feed is troubling. However, knowing that fact and knowing where the feed came from may help with control of the situation if it reaches other swine that consume infected grain. It also brings up the issue of what other viruses survive in grains. Clearly, any country receiving these grain imports needs to be on high alert for signs of this and/or similar diseases. - Mod.TG
