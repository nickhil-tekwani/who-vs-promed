Officials from the Alabama Department of Public Health report that at least 99 people have been sickened by salmonella-tainted food served at a wedding in Colbert County. The Decatur Daily has reported that the wedding happened on 12 Nov 2016 in Sheffield. The number of people who required hospitalization has grown to 22, although most have been discharged according to a health department statement released today, 21 Nov 2016.

About 150 people attended the wedding. Indelible Catering of Moulton provided food for the event and has since had its permit suspended by emergency order. The same catering company was linked to an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in 2014 that sickened 19, according to the Decatur Daily. The Alabama Department of Public Health could not determine whether the catered food caused the outbreak, according to the paper. A 71 year old woman who fell ill died 6 days after the 2014 luncheon.

Preliminary results from a health department investigation found _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis in specimens of cooked chicken and green beans served at the 12 Nov 2016 wedding. _Salmonella_ is often found in poultry that has not been cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees. The green beans could have picked up the bacteria through cross-contamination from using the same utensils, according to the health department statement.

The investigation into the salmonella outbreak is ongoing, according to health officials.
