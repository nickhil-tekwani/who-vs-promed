Documents about the introduction of control measures
----------------------------------------------------
The full consultation document about the proposal to introduce a 20 day
standstill period following movements of cattle and sheep is available on
MAFF's website at
<http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/20daycd.PDF>
A background section describes the current foot and mouth disease outbreak.
It says that it is likely the source farm, from which the current disease
outbreak spread, was the fourth infected premises to be discovered, a pig
farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall in Tyne and Wear. The subsequent spread of
infection is traceable to some extent. Virus from the source farm spread to
other farms in Tyne and Wear. Sheep from one of these farms were sent to
Hexham market on 13 February. Sheep from the 13 February market at Hexham
were sent to markets at Longtown over the period 14-24 February.
From Longtown market, sheep were sent to markets at Carlisle on 16
February, Welshpool on 19 February, to dealers at Highampton in Devon,
Lockerbie in Dumfries and Galloway, Dearham in Cumbria and Nantwich in
Cheshire, and indirectly to markets at Hatherleigh on 20 February, Hereford
on 21 February, Northampton on 22 February and Ross-on-Wye on 23 February.
While tracing movements of pigs from the source farm has proved relatively
straightforward, tracking movements of sheep has proved difficult and in
some cases impossible. This is partly due to farmers' inadequate movement
records and partly due to unrecorded sales of sheep, which it seems took
place around the edges of the various livestock markets without passing
through the markets' books.
Key factors in the rapid and wide spread of infection in the current FMD
oubreak, compared to the last major outbreak in 1967, are the time that
elapsed before the infection at the probable source farm was discovered,
and the larger scale of animal movements compared to 1967, with some
animals moving several times in quick succession.
The suspicious lesions found on pigs at Heddon-on-the-Wall on 22 February
suggest that they had been incubating the disease for at least two and
possibly up to 3 weeks. By 23 February when infection was confirmed at
Heddon-on-the-Wall, infected animals had already spread through markets and
dealers to Cumbria, Dumfries and Galloway, Devon, Cheshire, Herefordshire,
and Northamptonshire.
A further factor was the the infection spread quickly to sheep, and then
among sheep, which, because of the nature of sheep flocks and the way they
are traded, made the course of the infection more difficult to trace. The
1967 outbreak was mainly in pigs and cattle. The strain of the virus in the
current outbreak does not manifest itself clearly in sheep, which has made
detection difficult. Apparently healthy animals may be disease carriers.
