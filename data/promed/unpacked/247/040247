With 2 more deaths due to leptospirosis, one each in Valsad and
Navsari, the total number of deaths due to the deadly disease reached
46 on Saturday [27 Aug 2011]. The number of patients reached 228 with
the addition of 6 new patients on Saturday. The patient from Valsad
was under treatment in Surat's New Civil Hospital [for the past
week].

In south Gujarat, leptospirosis cases are reported in rural areas
among those working in farms. The cases are reported during monsoon
and in the 3 months of the rainy season. The disease kills more than
100 people of working age every year. According to experts, a human
gets leptospirosis [by contact with urine of infected cattle and rats
that has contaminated water-logged farms] during monsoon. Medical
research reveals that leptospirosis infection spreads to humans though
wounds, eyes, and mouth. Rats and cattle are permanent carriers of
leptospira bacteria. Medical science observed some effects of
leptospira bacteria on cattle, but it recovers without medication in a
majority of cases.

According to experts working on leptospirosis, currently there is no
accurate preventive method to stop the infection of the disease in
humans, but it is possible to vaccinate cattle. Along with rats,
cattle are major carrier of leptospira bacteria in the south Gujarat
region and vaccines are available in foreign countries, but not yet
used in India. Surat city became victim of leptospirosis within a week
after August 2006 floods when 100 people died of leptospirosis in the
city area.

The disease was reported for the 1st time within city limits in south
Gujarat as it spreads mostly in rural areas. It is believed that the
infection spreads across the city [during the 5 days that the entire
city was flooded]. Due to flooding, urine of rats, which normally live
in drainage ditches or underground, infected humans.

[Bacteria of the genus _Leptospira_ cause leptospirosis. More than 200
pathogenic leptospiral serovars, distinguished on the basis of
bacterial surface antigens, have been identified. Different
leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions.
The disease is transmitted to humans from wildlife species, such as
rats, sometimes domestic animals, such as dogs, and livestock, such as
cattle and pigs. When these animals are infected, they may have no or
minimal symptoms of the disease, but develop a renal carrier state
associated with long term urinary shedding. The infection is
transmitted to humans by contact with water, soil, or food
contaminated with the urine of these chronically infected animals.
Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually associated with exposure to
contaminated floodwater. Leptospira survive for weeks to months in
warm, fresh water or soil flooded with fresh water. The bacteria can
enter the body through skin or mucous membranes, especially if the
skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water or
food can also cause infection. Person to person transmission is rare.

The symptoms in humans appear after a 3-14 day incubation period.
Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical
presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made
confidently without laboratory confirmation. For further discussion of
leptopsirosis, see ProMED-mail post: Leptospirosis - India: (KA,KL) 20110709.2079.

The southern districts of Surat, Valsad, and Navsari are 3 of the 26
districts in the western Indian state of Gujarat. The city of Surat is
the commercial capital of the Indian state of Gujarat and is one of
the fastest growing cities in India with a population now of about 5
million, which has nearly doubled in the past 10 years
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat). The rainy summer monsoon
season begins in Gujarat in late June and lasts until the end of
September, with flooding every year, the worst being the flood of
August 2006 (http://www.mapsofindia.com/surat/flood.html).

Serovars of leptospira associated with disease in cattle include
hardjo, pomona, grippotyphosa, canicola,and ictero-haemorrhagiae.

Leptospirosis vaccines are available for pigs, cattle, and dogs.
Leptospiral vaccines for veterinary use are suspensions of one or more
strains of pathogenic leptospira inactivated in such a manner that
immunogenic activity is retained. While experimental vaccines based on
cellular extracts have been tested, commercial vaccines are, with few
exceptions, whole-cell products.

Although the vaccines prevent disease in the vaccinated animals, they
do not completely prevent infection or the shedding of the organisms;
a percentage of vaccinated animals will become infected with the
relevant serovar and may shed the organism in their urine despite a
lack of clinical signs of disease. Immunity is largely serovar
specific: vaccines are protective only against the included serovars
or closely related serovars.

Information on the requirements for leptospira animal vaccines are
available in OIE's Terrestrial Manual, Chapter 2.1.9."Leptospirosis"
at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.09_LEPTO.pdf
(pp. 255-8).

According to India's annual OIE report for 2010, vaccination is not
included among the measures applied to control leptospirosis in farm
animals. - Mod.AS]
