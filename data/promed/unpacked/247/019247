A new report has shown just how transmissible the omicron strain of coronavirus is after a man jogging through a park infected 39 people on his run.

The report by China CDC Weekly [see citation below] revealed how 'Patient zero' in the Chongqing municipality jogged for 35 minutes at a local park while also unmasked, and potentially exposed the virus to approximately 2836 people at the park, with 38 out of the 39 people testing positive not wearing masks.

The man went running on [16 Aug 2022] after flying back to Chongqing on [13 Aug 2022]. On his initial flight to Hohhot city on [11 Aug 2022], there were 4 positive passengers and he had only felt fatigue on [15 Aug 2022], not thinking much of it.

The report stated in total 39 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 33 visitors and 2 park cleaners. The 2 cleaners then passed the virus on to 4 colleagues.

None of the people at the park had been previously exposed to reported cases or travelled to regions with COVID cases.

Summary
-------
"What is already known about this topic?
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron subvariant has a stronger transmission capacity and faster transmission speed than the previous strain.

"What is added by this report?
The 1st coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case infected with the SARS-CoV-2 omicron subvariant BA.2.76 who caused local transmission was reported in Chongqing Municipality on [16 Aug 2022]. For 35 minutes, Patient Zero jogged along a lake at a local park without wearing a mask. Among the 2836 people potentially exposed at the time, 39 tested positive. Overall, 38 out of 39 cases did not wear a mask on the morning of [16 Aug 2022]. All 39 cases lacked any previous exposure to the variant before testing positive on their nucleic acid test.

"What are the implications for public health practice?
It is essential to maintain personal wellbeing by ensuring one maintains personal protection and follows regulated guidelines such as maintaining safe distances from others both indoors and outdoors."

----
Although outdoor transmission of COVID-19 can occur through droplet or aerosol transmission, there were very few documented transmission chains from outdoor settings up until recently, with the emergence of more transmissible omicron subvariants. In this case report, the reported viral load of the index patient was high and the transmission chain was established through genomic sequencing and thorough outbreak investigation, which include examination of surveillance footage, interviews, and other means of location ascertainment.

Of 2836 people that were potentially exposed to the virus in the park, 39 (1.5%) tested positive and 38 were reported as not wearing masks at the time of exposure. It was, however, unknown if the rest of the exposed persons were masked. - Mod.WWL
