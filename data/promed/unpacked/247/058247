Agents of the Environmental Services of Alava [province, Pais Vasco/Basque Country] are investigating a possible avian botulism outbreak in ponds of Arriaga and Salburua. About 20 ducks showed up dead in Arriaga and many others in Salburua, triggering the usual response protocol. After ruling out avian influenza, samples have been sent to reference laboratories to test for avian botulism toxin.

Carcasses are being removed, and the ponds are being cleaned. Affected birds showing clinical signs will be taken to a wildlife rescue center for treatment.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.
