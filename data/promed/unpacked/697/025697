Novel coronavirus infection - update [30 Nov 2012]
---------------------
In addition to the fatal case of novel coronavirus in Saudi Arabia reported to WHO on [28 Nov 2012], 2 fatal cases in Jordan have been reported to WHO today, bringing the total of laboratory-confirmed cases to 9.

The latest confirmed case from Saudi Arabia occurred in October 2012 and is from the family cluster of the 2 cases confirmed earlier.

The 2 cases from Jordan occurred in April 2012. At that time, a number of severe pneumonia cases occurred in the country and the Ministry of Health (MOH) Jordan promptly requested a WHO Collaborating Centre for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (NAMRU - 3) team to immediately assist in the laboratory investigation. The NAMRU-3 team went to Jordan and tested samples from this cluster of cases.

On [24 Apr 2012] the NAMRU-3 team informed the MOH that all samples had tested negative for known coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses. As the novel coronavirus had not yet been discovered, no specific tests for it were available.

In October 2012, after the discovery of the novel coronavirus, stored samples were sent by MOH Jordan to NAMRU-3. In November 2012 NAMRU-3 provided laboratory results that confirmed 2 cases of infection with the novel coronavirus.

The MOH Jordan has requested WHO assistance in investigating these infections. A mission from WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) and headquarters arrived in Amman on 28 November 2012 to assist in further epidemiological surveillance and to strengthen the sentinel surveillance systems for severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs).

In summary, to date a total of 9 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with the novel coronavirus have been reported to WHO - 5 cases (including 3 deaths) from Saudi Arabia, 2 cases from Qatar and 2 cases (both fatal) from Jordan.

Background and summary of novel coronavirus infection - as of [30 Nov 2012]
-------------------------
Over the past 2 months, WHO has received reports of 9 cases of human infection with a novel coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses; different members of this family cause illness in humans and animals. In humans, these illnesses range from the common cold to infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS CoV).

Thus far, the cases reported have come from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. All patients were severely ill, and 5 have died.

The 2 Qatari patients are not linked. Both had severe pneumonia and acute renal failure. Both are now recovering.

A total of 5 confirmed cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia. The 1st 2 are not linked to each other; one of these has died. Three other confirmed cases are epidemiologically linked and occurred in one family living within the same household; 2 of these have died. One additional family member in this household also became ill, with symptoms similar to those of the confirmed cases. This person has recovered and tested negative, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, for the virus.

Two confirmed cases have been reported in Jordan. Both of these patients have died. These cases were discovered through testing of stored samples from a cluster of pneumonia cases that occurred in April 2012.

The 2 clusters (Saudi Arabia, Jordan) raise the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission or, alternatively, exposure to a common source. Ongoing investigation may or may not be able to distinguish between these possibilities.

The current understanding of this novel virus is that it can cause a severe, acute respiratory infection presenting as pneumonia. Acute renal failure has also occurred in 5 cases.

WHO recognizes that the emergence of a new coronavirus capable of causing severe disease raises concerns because of experience with SARS. Although this novel coronavirus is distantly related to the SARS CoV, they are different. Based on current information, it does not appear to transmit easily between people, unlike the SARS virus.

WHO has closely monitored the situation since detection of the 1st case and has been working with partners to ensure a high degree of preparedness should the new virus be found to be sufficiently transmissible to cause community outbreaks. Some viruses are able to cause limited human-to-human transmission under condition of close contact, as occurs in families, but are not transmissible enough to cause larger community outbreaks. Actions taken by WHO in coordination with national authorities and technical partners include the following:

Investigations are ongoing to determine the likely source of infection and the route of exposure. Close contacts of confirmed cases are being identified and followed up.
An interim surveillance recommendation has been updated to assist clinicians to determine which patients should undergo laboratory testing for the presence of novel coronavirus.

Laboratory assays for the virus have been developed. Reagents and other materials for testing are available, as are protocols, algorithms and reference laboratory services. WHO has activated its laboratory network to assist in testing and other services. WHO has also issued preliminary guidance for laboratory biorisk management.
Guidance is available for infection control.

Based on the current situation and available information:

- WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.
Further, testing for the new coronavirus of patients with unexplained pneumonias should be considered, especially in persons residing in or returning from the Arabian peninsula and neighboring countries. Any new cases should be promptly reported both to national health authorities and to WHO.

- In addition, any clusters of SARI or SARI in health care workers should be thoroughly investigated, regardless of where in the world they occur. These investigations will help determine whether the virus is distributed more widely in the human population beyond the 3 countries that have identified cases.

- WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

- WHO continues to work with Member States and international health partners to gain a better understanding of the novel coronavirus and the disease in humans and will continue to provide updated information. As the situation evolves, WHO will reassess its guidance and revise it accordingly.

[The above WHO report now increases the official number of laboratory confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) due to infection with the novel coronavirus (nCoV) to 9, with 5 fatalities.

In a prior ProMED-mail report on this nCoV, Dr. Irene Lai had reported on an as yet undiagnosed outbreak of SARI in Jordan, querying if that outbreak would be reviewed to see if perhaps this nCoV was the etiology of the outbreak.

Information available at that time came from an ECDC report from May 2012 available at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/CDTR%20online%20version%204%20May%202012.pdf:

"Severe respiratory disease of unknown origin - Jordan - Outbreak in ICU
Opening date: 26 April 2012 Latest update: 3 May 2012

An outbreak of a respiratory illness was reported on 19 April 2012 by the Ministry of Health in Jordan in an intensive care unit in a hospital in Zarqa. Seven nurses and one doctor were among the 11 affected. One of the nurses died. The cause of this
outbreak remains unknown to date."

From the above reports it appears as though the outbreak in Jordan in April 2012 was due to this nCoV, and most likely does represent limited human-to-human transmission -- involving the ICU healthcare personnel caring for a patient with SARI. With respect to the family cluster reported in Saudi Arabia, more information on the epidemiology of this outbreak including dates of onsets of cases, locations of contact between the family members (were they all from a common household, were any caretakers for earlier onset illness cases) might help in ascertaining if that cluster involved person-to-person transmission or if there had been a common source exposure in the household setting.

More information on results of testing of the other members of this cluster of cases in Jordan would be greatly appreciated. If the recovered cases are negative through currently available laboratory tests, it would add to an observation that milder cases are not "detected" through the currently available laboratory techniques.

If one looks at a map of the region (see the HealthMap/ProMED map available at: http://healthmap.org/r/1HAJ) one sees that Saudi Arabia shares a border with Jordan to the Northwest and Qatar to the Southeast. - Mod.MPP]
