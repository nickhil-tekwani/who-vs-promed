Anthrax has been confirmed in a cow approximately 10 miles north of Premont, TX, in Jim Wells County. This is the 1st documented case in the county since the late 1950's. This is also the 1st case of anthrax confirmed in cattle this year [2014] in the state of Texas.

Anthrax cases in Texas are often confined to a triangular area bounded by the towns of Uvalde, Ozona and Eagle Pass. This area includes portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney and Maverick counties.

The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses and vaccination of livestock on the premises prior to release of the quarantine. "The TAHC will continue to work cooperatively with local veterinary practitioners and livestock producers to monitor the situation for possible new cases across the state. Producers are encouraged to consult their veterinary practitioner or local TAHC office if they have questions about the disease," said Dr. T.R. Lansford, TAHC Assistant Executive Director for Animal Health Programs.

[I first heard of this outbreak on Sun 5 Oct 2014, via a phone call while at mass. My informant was the diagnosing veterinarian who was in the process of getting ready for a weeklong series of AHC [Animal Health Commission] meetings in Austin. It was a short discussion. He is now back at his clinic having dealt with urgent client needs. Basically, this is a 4000 acre ranch with some 400 head, including heifers. There had been a series of singular acute deaths, and when diagnosed on 30 Oct 2014, some 5 animals had dropped dead. A quick field necropsy revealed the probable cause, and anthrax was confirmed by CDC on 3 Oct 2014, along with the fact that it was for CDC an unusual strain. The stock have since been vaccinated.

The history of the ranch is that there was a record of an anthrax outbreak in the 1950s but not since. Some 12 years ago, the property was purchased and the cattle transferred to Florida to be replaced by exotic African game, wildebeest, kudu, etc. Six months ago, with a new ranch owner, the exotics were cleared out and replaced by cattle. There are a number of such exotic ranches in Texas and a healthy market for such stock and for trophies; it is probably more accurate to say that they are shot, not hunted, and at a pretty price. While it is tempting to propose some exotic source of this outbreak, it is more likely that there were sporadic but ignored anthrax cases over the past 12 years, but in settling in these cattle, more attention was paid.

This is the 4th anthrax outbreak in Texas. In late September 2014, there was a small outbreak involving white-tail deer in Kinney county, 20 miles north of Bracketville, see: http://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/pr/2014/2014-09-26_AnthraxUpdate.pdf, and in deer in Edwards County in August 2014. In June 2014, it had been diagnosed in a goat herd in Kinney County. With only 4 outbreaks, all limited in number, it has been a quiet anthrax season.
