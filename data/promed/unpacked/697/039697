31 primary school pupils down with food poisoning
---------------------
Thirty one pupils of SK Taman Seri Wang here came
down with food poisoning after eating fried rice
at the school's canteen this morning.

It is learned that a pupil was admitted to the
Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Hospital here
while the rest received outpatient treatment.

The Year 4 to Year 6 pupils started to fall ill
about an hour after they had their breakfast
during school's recess hour at 10 AM.

No candidates contesting for the Bukit Selambau
State seat by-election were present as the school
is located outside the constituency.
State Health department deputy director Dr
Shahidan Hashim, when contacted, declined to
comment as he is still waiting for the Kuala Muda
district health department report on the matter.

[The short time between consumption and clinical
signs (1 hour according to the above newswire) is
suggestive of a chemical intoxication rather than
one of bacterial origin. One possibility is that
nitrates were used in the food preparation rather
than table salt (sodium chloride).

Contaminated foodstuffs, prepared baby foods, and
sausage preserved with nitrates and nitrites have
caused exposure in children Although vegetables
are seldom a source of acute toxicity, they
account for more than 70 percent of the nitrates
in a typical human diet. Cauliflower, spinach,
collard greens, broccoli, and root vegetables
have naturally greater nitrate content than other
plant foods do. The remainder of the nitrate in a
typical diet comes from drinking water (about 21
percent) and from meat and meat products (about 6
percent) in which sodium nitrate is used as a
preservative and color-enhancing agent For
infants who are bottle-fed, however, the major
source of nitrate exposure is drinking water used to dilute formula.

Sodium nitrate has on a number of occasions been
mistaken for table salt. Clinical signs of
ingestion may include gastroenteritis, abdominal
pains, dizziness, bloody diarrhea, convulsions,
and collapse. Purging and diuresis are expected.
If the victim receives small, repeated doses
there may be headache and mental
impairment. Generally in the case of mistaking
sodium nitrate for sodium chloride, the dose may
be larger for large meals typical
of celebrations. Rare cases of nitrates being
converted to the more toxic nitrites have been reported.

Sodium nitrate has been used in curing meat for
centuries. Bacterial action converts the nitrate
to nitrite, which kills the organism responsible
for botulism poisoning. Generally sodium nitrite
has replaced sodium nitrate, except in slow-cured hams.

Nitrite is added to certain foods to prevent the
growth of the spore-forming bacterium
_Clostridium botulinum_, whose toxin causes
botulism, leading to paralysis and, potentially,
death. The word botulinum comes from the Latin
word botulus, meaning sausage, which was
responsible for many deaths centuries ago before
curing with nitrite was used. In addition to
serving as an antimicrobial, nitrite is used to
produce the characteristic flavor, texture, and pink color of cured meats.

At significant blood levels, the nitrite's
oxidation of the iron in hemoglobin from the
ferrous to the ferric state yields methemoglobin,
which does not carry oxygen and imparts a brown
hue to the blood. Symptoms of methemoglobinemia
include headaches, fatigue, tachycardia (fast
heart rate), weakness, and dizziness. As
oxygenation of tissues decreases to the point of
becoming truly inadequate, dyspnea (shortness of
breath), acidosis, arrhythmias (irregular heart
rhythms), coma, convulsions, and a blue color to
the lips and light skinned areas and even death may occur.
