Environment: 4
Others: 0

HEADLINES
- Following the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the GPEI paid tribute to Her leadership, steadfastness and commitment to service and recognized His Royal Highness King Charles III's support for polio eradication.
- For the last 2 decades, the prospect of sending 16 visiting polio experts out across the provinces of Afghanistan would have been impossible but from 6 to [19 Jun 2022], WHO Afghanistan's polio eradication programme did just that. Their mission? To review the country's polio surveillance system, assess its functionality at all levels and make specific recommendations for maintaining and improving surveillance quality.

Summary of new polioviruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 1 WPV1 case
- Pakistan: 2 WPV1 cases and 1 positive environmental sample
- Mozambique : 1 WPV1 case
- Benin: 2 cVDPV2 cases and 1 positive environmental sample
- DR Congo: 1 cVDPV2 case
- Ghana: 1 cVDPV2 positive environmental sample
- Madagascar: 1 cVDPV1 positive environmental sample
- Malawi: 2 cVDPV1 cases
- Nigeria : 1 cVDPV2 positive environmental sample

Afghanistan
- 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in Kunar making it the 2nd case reported in 2022. There were 4 cases in 2021.
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in the country remain 43.
- Kunar, along with the rest of the country's Eastern Region, is part of 1 of 3, critical cross-border epidemiological corridors with Pakistan, the northern corridor specifically comprising of Eastern Region and central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. Case response is currently being planned in the immediate area and the broader corridor. The other 2 cross-border epidemiological corridors are the southern corridor, comprising Quetta Block of Pakistan and Southern Region, Afghanistan; and, the central corridor, comprising southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and South-East Region in Afghanistan.
- Of note, in 2022, the central corridor had multiple WPV1 detections from polio cases and environmental samples, mainly from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
- Districts along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the 3 epidemiological corridors are at high-risk for poliovirus transmission, given the high proportion of zero-dose children and inconsistent quality of polio vaccination campaigns in some areas.
- The Pakistan and Afghanistan polio programmes continue to coordinate on surveillance and vaccination activities through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Support Hub, based in Amman, Jordan.

[Poliovirus, both the wild virus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, continues to be identified globally. The cases of WPV1 associated AFP in Afghanistan and Pakistan were covered in yesterday's post (Poliomyelitis update (39): WPV1 AFP, cVDPV1 AFP, cVDPV2 AFP, ES, WHO 20220922.8705721). The WPV1 associated case in Mozambique is new. Of concern is the continued identification of WPV1 cases in Mozambique along with cVDPV1 cases in Malawi and positive ES in Madagasvar. cVDPV2 is active with AFP cases in Benin and the DR Congo and positive ES in Ghana and Nigeria.

2022 to date has been a good year for the viruses but not for eradication efforts. The toll of back-to-back (now concurrent) pandemics of COVID-19 and Monkeypox along with civil unrest and natural disasters is showing more and more as public health infrastructures have been hard hit.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

[2] PAHO concerns
[A] PAHO press release
Date: Wed 21 Sep 2021

As COVID-19 continues to impact the Americas, dwindling vaccination rates leave countries susceptible to polio and other preventable diseases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While COVID-19 continues to take around 4000 lives each week in the Americas, and monkeypox cases rise, the polio virus has now been detected among unvaccinated communities in New York. In light of this, the Pan American Health Organization Director (PAHO) has called on countries to urgently strengthen surveillance and routine vaccination campaigns.

Although the United States has mounted a swift public health response following the detection, polio is a disease that "I never expected to see in our region again," Dr. Etienne said during a media briefing today [Wed 21 Sep 2021].

"It's been nearly 30 years since the Americas became the first global region to wipe out wild polio," but "dwindling vaccination rates, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, have left many of our populations unprotected."

Polio, which can spread quickly among communities with insufficient vaccination coverage is not a treatable disease but is fully preventable with vaccines. Yet today, vaccination coverage has fallen below 80% in nearly all of South America, and 12 countries in the region are at High or Very High risk of experiencing an outbreak.

PAHO has been working closely with the United States and has issued several alerts to Member States to remain vigilant and take measures to proactively reach unvaccinated populations with a polio vaccine. "We must not take the lifesaving power of vaccines for granted," said Dr. Etienne.

As PAHO prepares to meet with Ministers of Health from across the region at the Pan American Sanitary Conference, Dr. Etienne highlighted the opportunity to discuss challenges towards ensuring health in the region and make agreements on how to move forward. This landmark event is not only a chance to look back and learn from the past but also an "opportunity to look towards the future and our vision of a more equitable region, in which we work together to improve health for all," she said.

[B] Media coverage

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on Wednesday [21 Sep 2022] said Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Peru are at very high risk for the reintroduction of polio, as dwindling vaccination rates during the coronavirus pandemic has led to historic lows in protection against the illness. Regional vaccine coverage for polio has fallen to about 79%, the lowest since 1994, PAHO said.

Earlier this month [September 2022], New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a disaster emergency in a bid to accelerate efforts to vaccinate residents against polio after the virus was detected in wastewater samples taken in 4 counties. Cases also have been detected in London and Jerusalem.

"Let's be very clear," PAHO director Carissa Etienne told reporters. "Polio is not a treatable disease. Prevention is the only option, and prevention is only possible with vaccines." Polio can cause irreversible paralysis in some cases, but can be prevented by a vaccine first made available in 1955. While there is no known cure, 3 injections of the vaccine provide nearly 100% immunity.

Etienne said dwindling vaccination caused by the coronavirus pandemic had left many unprotected from polio, after vaccines had eradicated the disease in the region 30 years earlier.

She added that Argentina, the Bahamas, Ecuador, Panama, Suriname and Venezuela also had been identified as high-risk countries, and that nearly all of South America currently has vaccine coverage below 80%.

There are currently no confirmed polio cases in Latin America and the Caribbean, but PAHO urged all countries in the region to strengthen surveillance and proactively reach unvaccinated communities.

"I really cannot state this strongly enough," Etienne said. "As we saw in New York state, the polio virus can appear and spread quickly and quietly in communities with insufficient vaccine coverage."

Polio terrified parents around the world for the 1st half of the 20th century. Affecting mainly children under 5, it is often asymptomatic but can also cause symptoms including fever and vomiting. Around 1 in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis, and among those patients, up to 10% die.

[Having been very involved in the launching of the eradication effort in the Americas, it saddens me to see the decline in vaccination coverages in the region. A confluence of factors including the pandemics of COVID-19 and monkeypox, the absence of disease giving the false impression there is no longer a threat, and the increased misinformation leading to vaccine hesitancy.

Hopefully, the AFP case in the USA with continued evidence of transmission as seen in wastewater sampling in a larger geographic area associated with areas of lower vaccination coverages is serving as a wakeup call in the region. I do fear that with the implicated virus being a cVDPV, there may be an increase in misinformation circulating about the vaccine, leading to increased vaccine hesitancy. The outbreak of WPV1-associated paralytic disease in Malawi/Mozambique should serve as a good example of the increased risk of WPV disease when coverages are low. - Mod.MPP
