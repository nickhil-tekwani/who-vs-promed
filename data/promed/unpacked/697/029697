During 20 May - 31 Jul 2006, New York City, New York State, Oregon,
and Washington health departments reported a total of 177 cases of
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection, of which 122 have been
associated with 17 clusters. A cluster has been defined as a group of
2 or more ill persons who were linked to the same shellfish source
(e.g., shared a meal at the same restaurant or obtained shellfish
from the same seafood market). Certain clusters were associated with
restaurants, certain clusters with seafood markets, and certain
clusters with recreational harvesting. Three patients were
hospitalized; no fatalities have been reported. No demographic (e.g.,
age, sex, or race) or medical history (e.g., predisposing conditions)
information is yet available regarding affected persons.
A confirmed case of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection is defined as an
infection confirmed by isolation of the organism from a patient's
stool. A probable case is defined as gastroenteritis in a person who
can be epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case. Of the 177 _V.
parahaemolyticus_ cases reported, 72 are confirmed, and 105 are
probable: New York City (2 confirmed, 74 probable), New York State (7
confirmed), Oregon (8 confirmed, 8 probable), and Washington (55
confirmed, 23 probable). This incidence of infection is much higher
than expected; during May, June, and July 2000-2004, these
jurisdictions reported an annual average of 16 laboratory-confirmed
_V. parahaemolyticus_ cases to CDC [Figure: for figure, see original
URL. - Mod.LL]. The number of confirmed cases in this report (72) is
more than the average number reported during May, June, and July,
during 2000-2004, in the entire USA.
Subtyping of _V. parahaemolyticus_ isolates has indicated that 18 of
23 isolates tested are serotype O4:K12, which is unrelated to the
pandemic strain that was 1st identified in Asia in 1996 and later
emerged in the USA in 1998 (1, 2). Traceback investigations have
linked contaminated oysters and contaminated clams to harvest areas
in Washington and British Columbia, Canada; shellfish from these
sources was distributed to seafood markets and restaurants
nationwide. Ongoing investigations are being conducted by state and
local health departments and regional Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) shellfish-control offices to identify additional sources of
infection. Additional infections likely have been undetected,
under-reported, or both.
_V. parahaemolyticus_ infection causes acute, self-limited
gastroenteritis typically characterized by diarrhea, abdominal
cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills of 1-3 days duration,
with onset usually within 24 hours after eating contaminated food.
Cases are most commonly reported during warmer months and are often
associated with eating raw or under-cooked shellfish or other cooked
foods that have been cross-contaminated by raw shellfish. Previous
local _V. parahaemolyticus_ outbreaks have coincided with large
increases in sporadic cases nationally, suggesting that identified
clusters are most often manifestations of a wider increase in illness
(1). Studies suggest that approximately 20 _V. parahaemolyticus_
illnesses exist for each laboratory-confirmed case reported to CDC
(3, 4), underscoring the need for enhanced national surveillance and
control measures.
Shellfish harvest areas in the USA and Canada that were previously
implicated in _V. parahaemolyticus_ outbreaks are routinely monitored
by state shellfish- control agencies to control transmission of these
illnesses. Despite acceptable _V. parahaemolyticus_ levels detected
by routine testing of shellfish in these areas, as of 31 Jul 2006, 8
shellfish harvest areas in Washington had been closed to harvesting
because their oysters were associated with this illness outbreak.
Oysters from these areas have been recalled by Washington State
shellfish-control authorities. Shellfish bed monitoring is an
important element of food-safety control but is not sufficient to
prevent illnesses caused by Vibrio organisms. Because vibrios
multiply rapidly, even low levels of _V. parahaemolyticus_ in
harvested products can rapidly increase to infectious levels if not
rapidly refrigerated after harvest and maintained at proper
temperatures during transport, processing, and storage (i.e., <50 F [<10 C]).
Medical providers should request stool specimens from patients with
acute gastroenteritis and a history of recent shellfish consumption.
The microbiology laboratory analyzing the sample should be notified
that Vibrio illness, or vibriosis, is suspected so that appropriate
methods (ideally, culture in the selective medium
thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose [TCBS] agar) can be used to
isolate the organisms. Vibrio species grow readily in blood agar, but
primary isolation of the organisms from stool samples is problematic
because extensive screening is required to differentiate vibrios from
other enteric organisms (5).
Vibrio species infections should be reported to the appropriate
health jurisdiction. Although infection with _V. parahaemolyticus_ is
not currently a nationally notifiable disease (as is cholera, the
disease caused by cholerigenic strains of _Vibrio cholerae_), CDC has
conducted voluntary case surveillance for laboratory-confirmed
noncholera Vibrio species infection since 1988. In June 2006, the
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists recommended that all
Vibrio species infections be classified as nationally notifiable
diseases. The current outbreak underscores the benefits of
coordinated national surveillance.
Consumption of raw or under-cooked shellfish is a recurrent source of
human illness, including sporadic infections and widespread
outbreaks. In recent years, the most commonly reported pathogens
associated with these infections have been _V. parahaemolyticus_,
_Vibrio vulnificus_, and norovirus, but outbreaks of hepatitis A and
cholera also have been reported. To decrease the risk for _V.
parahaemolyticus_ infection, shellfish should be thoroughly cooked to
kill illness-causing pathogens. In 2 of the New York City clusters in
this report, vibriosis was associated with cooked seafood (e.g.,
cooked lobster, scallops, crab, or shrimp) that was eaten in a
restaurant, suggesting that the food might have been
cross-contaminated by raw shellfish after cooking. Some commercially
available oysters have been treated after harvest to reduce the
levels of Vibrio bacteria. Improved surveillance for _V.
parahaemolyticus_, in addition to increased use of postharvest
treatment to decrease Vibrio species levels, and careful postharvest
temperature control of shellfish during transport, processing, and
storage are critical to limiting _V. parahaemolyticus_ infections.
