Marin County has been hit by a recent spike in cases of pertussis, better known as whooping cough. Marin County Health Department says there have been 241 confirmed cases of the sickness, which is the highest number the county's seen in 8 years.

"It's bad. Luckily, my kids are vaccinated, but that doesn't mean other kids aren't at risk," said SG, a parent in the area. The contagious respiratory infection primarily affects young children.

Whooping cough starts out like a cold, but the bouts of coughing are much worse. Doctors say the bouts often leave kids gasping for air in between fits, hence that name. "The problem with pertussis is when young babies are exposed, the effects can be very serious. In 2010, there was an outbreak of pertussis and 10 infants died of the disease that year," said Dr. Matt Willi, Public Health Officer for Marin County.

The health department says almost every single school in the county has had at least one confirmed case of whooping cough. At Sir Francis Drake High School, 56 cases were confirmed. "It's probably been about half of the kids in each class," said Sir Francis Drake sophomore Isaac Dorfmaan. "It's been really common this year (2018)." The health department says any child with a confirmed case immediately gets sent home from school for 3 days and is put on antibiotics before notifying the child's parents.

The department says low vaccination rates in the county are partly to blame for the high number of cases. Officials suggest parents keep a close eye on their kids' coughs. If you hear that distinctive, high-pitched "whooping" sound, take your child to the doctor immediately.

Health officials in Panama are reporting an outbreak of pertussis, or whooping cough in the Ngäbe Buglé region since mid-December (2018), according to an El Siglo report (computer translated). To date, 81 confirmed cases have been reported, including 9 fatalities in children under 2 years of age.

According to the head of the Department of Epidemiological Surveillance Ministry of Health, Israel Cedeno, the children died due to complications and were registered in the Loma Yuca sector of the region.

Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious respiratory illness that spreads by coughing and sneezing while in close contact with others. Left untreated, it can spread from a single infected person for several weeks, with people in the early stage of illness being the most contagious.

Whooping cough can be a serious illness. Symptoms usually begin appearing as cold symptoms such as a cough, runny nose, sore throat and usually little or no fever. After several days, the cough may become more severe; it may come in spasms or as a series of coughs without a chance to breathe between coughs. There may be a gasp or "whoop" and/or gagging or vomiting at the end of the coughing spasm. Infants, particularly those less than 6 months of age, who contract whooping cough are at increased risk of complications, hospitalization and death.

[Ngäbe-Buglé is the largest and most populous of Panama's 3 'comarcas indígenas' (Emberá-Wounaan, Guna Yala, Ngäbe-Buglé) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngäbe-Buglé_Comarca). 'Comarcas indígenas' are administrative regions, equivalent to provinces, for an area with a substantial Amerindian population; 2 smaller 'comarcas' (Kuna de Madugandí and Kuna de Wargandí) are subordinate to a province and considered equivalent to a 'corregimiento' (municipality) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comarca#Panama).
Loma Yuca, with a population of 544 residents in 2010, is a municipality in the Ngäbe-Buglé 'comarca' (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loma_Yuca).
