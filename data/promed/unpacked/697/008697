_Iris yellow spot virus_ in onion seed crops in South Africa
------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2006, symptoms typical of iris yellow spot caused by _Iris
yellow spot virus_ (IYSV; genus _Tospovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_) were
observed on scapes (seed stalks) in an onion (_Allium cepa_ L.) seed crop
in the Klein Karoo of the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Symptoms
included diamond-shaped chlorotic or necrotic lesions on the scapes, some
of which had 'green islands' with nested diamond-shaped lesions, as well as
indistinct, circular to irregular, chlorotic or necrotic lesions of various
sizes. At the time symptoms were observed, approximately 5 per cent of the
scapes had lodged [fallen over] as a result of extensive lesions resembling
those caused by IYSV. The crop was 2 to 3 weeks from harvest.
Symptomatic tissue from 2 plants (2 samples from one plant and 4 samples
from the other plant) was tested for IYSV by reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR
[polymerase chain reaction]. Total RNA was extracted from symptomatic scape
tissue and RT-PCR was carried out amplifying the nucleocapsid (NP) gene of
IYSV. An amplicon of expected size (approximately 750 bp) was observed for
each of the symptomatic plants assayed and was sequenced revealing 95 per
cent sequence identity with the NP gene of IYSV published in the GenBank
database, with 8 amino acid differences. The known geographic distribution
of IYSV in onion bulb or seed crops has increased rapidly in recent years
in many areas of the world (1). To our knowledge, this is the 1st
confirmation of IYSV in South Africa.
About 6100 ha [about 15 100 acres] of onion bulb crops are grown annually
in South Africa in the Western Cape, KwaZulu Natal, Limpopo, and Northern
Cape provinces, and 600 ha [about 1500 acres] of onion seed crops are grown
primarily in the semi-arid regions of the Western Cape. Examination of an
additional 10 onion seed crops in the Klein Karoo during January 2007
revealed the presence of iris yellow spot in 3 more crops at about 5 per
cent incidence in each crop. The 4 symptomatic crops had all been planted
as bulb-to-seed crops, using vernalized bulbs produced on the same farm.
This suggests that IYSV may have been disseminated into the seed crops on
the vernalized bulbs, either as infected bulb tissue or in viruliferous
thrips on the bulbs.

[IYSV has only recently been confirmed as a member of the genus
_Tospovirus_ by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV). It has been included in the Alert List of the European Plant
Pathology Organisation (EPPO). Known hosts include onion, leek, iris,
amaryllis, ornamental lisianthus (sporadically), and weeds including wild
relatives of onion (_Allium_ species). IYSV has been reported from a number
of locations in North and southern America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
The economic impact is low in some areas, but up to 100 per cent loss has
been observed in onion crops, for example in Brazil. The virus is
transmitted by the thrips species _Thrips tabaci_, which is widespread.
Spread occurs via infected plant material and viruliferous vector insects.
The virus appears not to be seed transmitted. Disease management includes
the use of clean propagative material and vector control.
The isolate of IYSV reported above appears to be a different strain with
some variation in nucleotide sequence compared to previously recorded
isolates from other parts of the world.
Tospoviruses are an extremely important group of plant viruses capable of
infecting a large range of important crops. The type member, _Tomato
spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV), has had a serious impact on many crop species
worldwide. New tospoviruses are being found frequently. Tospovirus
epidemiology is complex and natural resistance appears to be rare amongst
their plant hosts. For more information on tospoviruses see ProMED-mail
posts 20070608.1872 and 20070524.1670.
