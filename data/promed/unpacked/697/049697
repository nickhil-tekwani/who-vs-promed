More than 60 cases of foodborne illness and 2 deaths are being investigated by the Malaysian Ministry of Health (KKM). A total of 61 infections have been reported with 24 cases in Kedah, including 16 from Baling district, 5 from Sik, and 3 from Kulim, 21 cases in Hulu Langat in Selangor, and 16 cases from Hulu Perak district. 21 people have been hospitalized. Stool samples of 2 cases were positive _Salmonella_ spp.

Investigations so far have found patients had a history of eating laksa purchased at one location in Kupang, a town in Kedah in the Baling district. Laksa is a type of noodle soup. The Kedah State Health Department (JKN) has examined the premises that sold the laksa, which has been temporarily closed while investigations continue.

KKM is waiting for results from the food samples that have been sent to the laboratory for analysis. KKM advised people to seek immediate treatment if they experience symptoms of foodborne illness. The agency said food should be stored at the appropriate temperature and heated to a sufficient temperature to prevent illness.

There were 14 433 cases of food poisoning in the country in 2016, according to the Ministry of Health.

Salmonellosis is a disease caused by the bacterium _Salmonella_. Symptoms of infection usually appear 12 to 72 hours after infection and include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. In otherwise healthy adults, the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days.

[The exact ingredient behind this outbreak is unclear, but, as noted, inadequate cooking and a lack of kitchen hygiene are always risk factors for most foodborne illnesses.

Laksa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laksa) consists of rice noodles or rice vermicelli with chicken, prawn, or fish served in spicy soup based on either rich and spicy curry coconut milk or on sour asam (tamarind or gelugur). Laksa is found in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Southern Thailand. - Mod.LL
