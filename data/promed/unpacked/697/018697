[According to the report above, a total of 82 947 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths, representing an increase of 6 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (15 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases include 5 new cases of confirmed infections (3 indigenous cases in Jilin province and 2 imported cases, 1 in Tianjin municipality and 1 in Guangdong province and verification of 1 case from 1 Jilin province.

In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no new cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau and Taiwan have reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1700 imported cases reported.

There were 12 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 11 locally acquired cases and 1 imported case. There was no case with conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 515, and 30 of these are importations from abroad. I realize it is repetitious mentioning this on a daily basis, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown. The worrisome observation vis a vis the cluster in Wuhan is that the virus had most likely been circulating there undetected until the cluster was identified.

From the 17 May 2020 update in the English language page: https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030

- Of the 13 new cases, 7 are imported cases and 6 are locally transmitted cases.
- Out of the 6 locally transmitted cases, 5 are related to the nightclub cluster and 1 case is from Daegu.
1 local case was confirmed after testing all the related personnel to employment project for seniors in Daegu. Further epidemiological investigation and measures to prevent further spread is ongoing.
All 5 new cases are contacts of previously confirmed cases related to nightclubs.
- 2 additional confirmed cases have been reported between 0:00 and 12:00 today [17 May 2020], bringing the total related to the nightclub cluster to 168.
- By region: Seoul City=93, Gyeonggi Province=33, Incheon City=23, Chungbuk Province=9, Busan City=4, Chungnam Province=1, Jeonbuk Province=1, Gyeongnam Province=1, Gangwon Province=1, Jeju Province=1
- By chain of transmission: Club visitors=89; Contacts (family/acquaintance/coworkers/etc)=79
- By age group: [0-18]=17; [19-29]=102; [30-39]=27; [40-49]=11; [50-59]=6; [60+]=5
- Male=136; Female=32
- KCDC asked anyone who visited any of the nightlife entertainment venues in Itaewon area including any clubs or bars from 24 Apr to 6 May 2020 to:
(1) Stay home and refrain from going to other places.
(2) Contact a local public health center or dial 1339 (KCDC call center).
(3) Visit a screening clinic and get tested, regardless of symptoms.
- KCDC also emphasized that for those who work in education, places of worship, indoor sports/gym facilities, or other places that are used by many people should especially report to the public health center if they have been to nightlife entertainment venues in Itaewon area, since their work environment creates a high risk of transmission.
- Even if a test result is negative, it is still possible for the person to have been infected but in the 14-day incubation period before the virus activates. Therefore, those who have been instructed to self-quarantine should strictly follow the self-quarantine protocol. Persons who are not subject to self-quarantine should still minimize contact with others. They should carefully practice personal hygiene measures including mask wearing and hand washing and get retested immediately if symptoms later appear.
- From 18 May 2020, KCDC and the Ministry of Defense will test all the trainees who will join the military, to prevent infection within the military and to evaluate the risk of community infection.
- It will be done by a pooled test method (ratio of 1:5) for 8 weeks, testing 6300 people per week.
- As the weather is getting warmer and people tend not to wear face masks properly, KCDC emphasized the importance of proper mask wearing for it to be effective on preventing infection.
- The face mask should be adjusted to fit to your face, covering both your nose and mouth. You should wash your hands before wearing a face mask to prevent contamination.
- When wearing, you should not touch your mask as much as possible to limit the contamination through hands.
- When removing, you should take it off without touching the front of the mask. If you place tissues or other things inside of your mask, it will be less effective as there may be some gaps created and between the face and the mask.
- Strict hand washing is needed even if you wear a mask, since you can get infected when you touch your eyes/nose/mouth with contaminated hands.
- In light of the recent rise in local transmission from club cluster cases to others in bars, karaoke rooms, after-school private academies, KCDC urged people to refrain from social gathering or visiting any enclosed/confined/crowded spaces that are frequented by many people.
* New cases in the last 2 weeks by chain of transmission (0:00 3 May - 0:00 17 May 2020, 257 reported cases): imported cases 76(29.6%), local clusters 165(64.2%), under investigation 10(3.9%), and etc.
- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded space for an essential reason should carefully follow personal hygiene measures including keeping 2 meters of distance from other people, wearing a facemask, avoiding handshakes, washing hands, and not touching eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands.
- Persons belonging to high-risk groups (including elderly, pregnant women, persons with chronic illness) should especially avoid any poorly ventilated enclosed space frequented by many people. If such a situation cannot be avoided for an essential reason, it is highly important to wear a facemask.
- Anyone who has come in close contact with a large number of unspecified persons in an enclosed/confined space such as clubs or bars need to be tested at a screening clinic through public health center or 1339 call center.
- KCDC urged people to visit a screening clinic and get tested, especially if 2 or more persons within a household or social group develop COVID-19 suspected symptoms.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 13 cases with no deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (15 to 16 May 2020) when there were 19 newly confirmed cases and 2 deaths. A total of 11 050 confirmed cases and 262 deaths were reported today (17 May 2020), up from 11 037 cases and 262 deaths yesterday (16 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 44 consecutive days and below 50 for 37 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 9 days. In today's (16 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 7 of the cases were import related, and 6 were locally transmitted. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (4) and 1 each in Daegu and Daejeon. Imported cases were in Quarantine (4) and Gyeongnam (2).

Figure 1: Daily confirmed cases by chain of transmission covers the period 1 Apr 2020 through 14 May 2020 on the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) and is striking with the 10-day period with minimal local transmission and predominant importation, and the recent shift (5-16 May 2020) when local transmission replaced the majority imported cases.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be a main problem, but the growing Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of next steps.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 224 760 cases, including 31 763 deaths, up from 223 885 cases and 31 610 deaths reported on 15 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 15 and 16 May 2020 was 875 newly confirmed cases, compared with 789 newly confirmed cases between 14 and 15 May 2020, an increase from yesterday's (15 May 2020) change. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 67.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 45.6% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Piedmont is the only other province reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Eight provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (2 provinces, Bolzano and Umbria, reported no new cases), and another 7 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Emilia-Romagna and Liguria are the 2 provinces reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 63 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 62 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out. See section [7] from COVID-19-update (157): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local transm, Italy phase 2 20200505.7300349 for details on phase 2 opening.

Iran reported over 17 000 new cases and 35 deaths on Saturday [16 May 2020]. It now has over 118 000 cases and 6900 deaths. The country has been trying to reopen its economy while fighting the pandemic. Tourist sites in Iran's central province of Isfahan have been allowed to reopen with strict sanitary and social distancing requirements. Its trade borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan have also reopened under strict observance of health protocols.

[In the 24 hours from 15 to 16 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 116 635 to 118 392 total cases, an increase of 1757 compared with 2102 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (15 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6902 to 6937, an increase of 35 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Russia, the UK, Italy, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 16 May 2020; 16:15 GMT. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature as daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 507 773, including 90 113 deaths, an increase from 1 484 285 cases and 88 507 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 358 099 (24.0%) cumulative case reports and 2083 (8.8%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.

Daily reported case counts are high in New York (2083 - 8.8%), Illinois (2088 - 8.8%), California (1866 -- 7.9%), Massachusetts (1512 - 6.4%), Pennsylvania (1046 - 4.4%), Maryland (982 -- 4.2%), New Jersey (899 - 3.8%) and Texas (885 - 3.7%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, Florida, and Maryland.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1, followed by Spain, Russia, UK, Italy, Brazil, France, Turkey, and New Jersey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 Illinois, 13 India, 14 Peru, 15 Massachusetts, 16 China, 17 California, 18 Canada, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. China has moved down to 16th place. Six US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL).

The US military has confirmed 8374 cumulative cases, with no newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 11 996 cumulative cases and 99 new cases today (16 May 2020). There have been 3629 cases reported from federal prisons (no new cases in the past 24 hours) and 3912 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (280 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 2589 cases (47 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Florida with 673 newly confirmed cases, Virginia with 1011 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, Minnesota with 729 newly confirmed cases, Georgia with 440 newly confirmed cases, Connecticut with 618 newly confirmed cases, and Indiana with 625 newly confirmed cases. 29 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody-based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The antibody-confirmed cases are now available in Table 4, which presents all cases including all tests performed. There were 539 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 549 in the preceding 24-hour period [from 13 to 14 May 2020], bringing the PCR- [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 230 698 [276 505] cases as compared with 230 183 [274 367] confirmed cases on 15 May 2020. Daily death reports are decreasing as well, with 27 563 deaths reported today (16 May 2020) and 27 459 deaths reported on 15 May 2020, an increase of 104 deaths in 24 hours.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 21.34, a continual slow decrease over the past 25 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 21.34 today (15 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 230 698 [276 505] cases, an additional 258 cases have been hospitalized, and an additional 10 cases were admitted to ICU. 3.8% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
