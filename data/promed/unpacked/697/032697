Time and place
--------------
Visceral leishmaniasis is most common in the southern region, notably Andalusia, Palma de Mallorca, Valencia, and Catalonia.
- Seroprevalence among dogs in this region is lowest during April, peaking during October.
- A restricted focus has been identified in the Piorat region of northeastern Spain.
- A single autochthonous case has been reported from Menorca.

As depicted in the following graph, disease rates have changed little during the past 3 decades: http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Leish-Spain.png

Incidence, additional notes
---------------------------
- 2028 [people] were hospitalized for leishmaniasis during 1997 to 2008 (0.41 per 100 000 population; 3.35 percent fatal; 37 percent HIV-positive)
- 1180 [people] were hospitalized during 1999 to 2003 (0.4 per 100 000 population)
- 11 cases (0 fatal) were identified among immunocompetent children in southern Madrid during 1994 to 2007.
- 60 deaths were ascribed to leishmaniasis during 1980 to 1994.

Exported cases
--------------
- 2005: 3 cases were reported among Romanian workers returning from Spain.
- 2011 (publication year): a Norwegian child acquired visceral leishmaniasis in Spain.
- 2012: an infected dog was imported from Spain into Singapore.

Leishmaniasis and HIV infection
-------------------------------
- 450 cases of HIV/leishmania coinfection were reported nationwide during 1990 to 1995 (52.4 percent of the world's total coinfections); 1099 during January 1990 to January 2001; 130 during January 2001 to December 2006; 412 during 1996 to 1998; 1099 as of 2001.
- Spain accounted for 58 percent of all such coinfections in southwestern Europe during 1990 to 1998.
- 2.49 percent of AIDS patients in the Madrid region are coinfected with visceral leishmaniasis.
- 228 episodes of visceral leishmaniasis were diagnosed in 155 HIV-infected patients in Valencia and Murcia during 1988 to 2001.

Transmission through sharing of needles by injecting drug abusers has been reported.
- Approximately 30 percent of IVDA [intravenous drug abusers] in southern Spain are seropositive.
- Evidence for _Leishmania_ is found in 52 percent of discarded syringes collected in southern Madrid (1998) and 34 percent from southwestern Madrid (2000 to 2001).
_Leishmania infantum_ has been identified in some cases of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis.
