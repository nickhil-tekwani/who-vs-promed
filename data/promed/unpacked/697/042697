Algeria: first detected avian flu case
--------------------------------------
The 1st case of avian flu was detected in a hen from a domestic
breeding site in the locality of Sidi El Bachir in the Oran Wilaya
[governorate] (432 Km to the west of Algiers).
It is suspected to be the 1st case detected in Algeria, and in the
Maghreb [North Africa]. The diagnosis has been confirmed by analyses
performed by the regional laboratory of veterinary services at
Tlemcen (580 Kms to the west of Algiers). The carcass was sent to the
regional laboratory in Tlemcen to detect the presence of the H5N1
virus, responsible for avian flu.
The authorities increased controls and preventive measures in order
to prevent the propagation of the disease in humans.

[This piece of news, initially published by a Francophone daily in
neighbouring Morocco, has come to our attention belatedly; so far, it
has not been confirmed by other sources, particularly Algerian ones.
The mentioned Tlemcen laboratory is adjacent to the Moroccan border.
Further information, confirmatory or otherwise, is requested. - Mod.AS].
