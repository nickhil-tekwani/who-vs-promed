The village of Palanca, on Moldova's extreme south-east, is directly bordering Ukraine's Odessa oblast (Lower Dniester National Park). In fact, its territory interrupts Odessa oblast in such a way as to make it impossible to drive from one bit of Ukraine to the other without crossing Moldovan territory.

[ASF has been spreading in Europe extensively during the recent decade, spreading from Georgia, its 1st foothold, northwards and westwards affecting the wild boar population and consequently many domestic pig farms. For a map showing the outbreaks reported during the recent 6 months (since 1 May 2017), please refer to http://tinyurl.com/y7h2ejft (click on the European cluster, zoom in).

No vaccine is available to prevent ASF infection, and the control provisions applied in case of an outbreak are based on classical disease control measures. In the 2 countries addressed in the above reports, Moldova and Ukraine, as in all European countries, stamping out is applied when the disease is reported in domestic swine. Unfortunately, these measures, have not been found, so far, sufficient to prevent the observed vast spread of the virus.

Efforts to develop an ASF vaccine have been initiated. (see 20171022.5396595).

ASF does not affect humans. - Mod. AS
