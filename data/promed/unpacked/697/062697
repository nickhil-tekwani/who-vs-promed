Investigations of the 4 H5N1 influenza cases observed to date show that the
initial
clinical presentation is not different from ordinary influenza cases.
However, complications like viral pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome
and renal failure set in rapidly in three cases. Hence, doctors taking
care of influenza patients are advised to watch for symptoms and signs of
complications, and early hospitalization is advised once the clinical
conditions warrant.

There has been concern about the availability of laboratory services to
diagnose H5N1 infections. Doctors are advised that they should not wait
for the laboratory diagnosis of H5N1 infection before they start
appropriate treatment. The laboratory diagnosis would usually take 7 to 10
days because of the time needed for viral culture and sending of specimens
to Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, USA. It is
prudent to note that treatment for H5N1 infection is essentially the same
as for other influenza viruses. Appropriate treatment, including the use
of amantadine, should be guided by the clinical assessment and should be
started
immediately once influenza with complications is clinically diagnosed.
[Note that earlier in this paragraph it is implied that initiation of
therapy prior to the onset of complications is appropriate. - Mods.PC/ES
As recommended by the Special Investigation Group on H5N1 Influenza, the
surveillance system for influenza has been extended to all the general
out-patient clinics under the Department of Health. These centres would
undertake the surveillance functions including laboratory investigation of
specimens taken from surveillance subjects. This would yield useful
information about the incidence and time trend of the H5N1 infection in the
local community. At this stage, the laboratory facilities in the
Government Virus Unit would be conserved for surveillance activities and
for providing
support to hospitals.
