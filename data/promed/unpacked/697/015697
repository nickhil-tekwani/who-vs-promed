Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection:
- unknown or inconclusive
- introduction of new live animals
- illegal movement of animals
- fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.)

Epidemiological comments:
In the framework of an official programme of the Ministry of Agriculture,
most of the dairy cattle in Lebanon were vaccinated, free of charge, in
2008, using a trivalent vaccine (O1, A 22, Asia 1) twice (in spring and
autumn 2008).

Some cattle newly illegally introduced into Lebanon and not previously
vaccinated or vaccinated using different serotypes showed clinical signs.

Some private veterinarians in Lebanon use also different serotypes in
vaccination, which may be giving partial protection. [It would be
surprising if serotype O, the most prevalent FMDV serotype in the Middle
East for decades, is not included in vaccines applied by professionals in
Lebanon. They could, however, have applied inadequate vaccines which
include non-regional strains of the O serotype. - Mod.AS]

Samples taken from clinical cases shall be sent soon to the OIE Reference
Laboratory of Pirbright for serotyping and matching test.

Control measures
Measures applied
- quarantine
- vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
- treatment of affected animals (Symptomatic treatment in all mild cases.
Only in one outbreak, where the clinical signs were severe, the owner
decided to slaughter all the animals.)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted

[Serotyping of the current epizootic in Lebanon is anticipated soon. It
will not be surprising if the causative agent is the same FMDV serotype
involved in the recent cases in Israel, namely serotype O which is the most
prevalent FMDV in the Middle East. The virus seems to be widely
disseminated, in large parts of Lebanon (see the map included in the
notification). This is particularly underlined in outbreaks 2, 5, 8, 9, 10,
and 11, where single unvaccinated animals, newly introduced into vaccinated
herds, were the only animals in the herd showing clinical disease thus --
in fact -- playing sentinels. This observation demonstrates also the
efficacy of the vaccine applied in these herds.

It is interesting to note that wild boars sampled on Israel's borders with
Lebanon in early 2007 were found FMD-positive by ELISA NSP tests. These
tests demonstrate the presence of antibodies against nonstructural 3ABC
protein, regarded to be indicative that FMD virus multiplication has taken
place. It was argued that these results, which are similar to earlier
observations, indicated the presence of FMD virus within the wild boar
population in the FMD-affected regions (see posting 20070517.1571). The
wild boar population in Lebanon is rife (Lebanon is known to have one of
the world's highest trichinellosis incidence in humans). It would be
interesting to test boars in Lebanon; it would be interesting also to
investigate if the virus might have been introduced into some of the
affected farms by means of live or consumed boars.

Our recent request for information on the FMD situation in countries in the
region, such as Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Turkey (postings 20090208.0577,
20090218.0680), is hereby repeated; obviously, now omitting Lebanon from
where the detailed OIE report deserves to be commended. - Mod.AS]
