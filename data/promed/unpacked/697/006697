San Diego hepatitis A outbreak, 2017
------------------------------------
Since early 2017, the Public Health Services Division, in the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, has been investigating a local hepatitis A outbreak. The majority of people who have contracted hepatitis A are homeless and/or illicit drug users, although some cases have been neither. The outbreak is being spread person-to-person and through contact with a fecally contaminated environment. No common sources of food, beverage or drugs have been identified that have contributed to this outbreak, though investigation is ongoing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that person-to-person transmission through close contact is the primary way people get hepatitis A in the USA.

Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by county staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection, before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office.

[The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A (HAV) in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase.

Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)
--------------------------------------------------------------
5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)
4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)
31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)
12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5)
27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)
26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2.5)
1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3.4)
8 Aug 2017 / 312 / 215 (69) / 10 (3.2)
15 Aug 2017 / 333 / 232 (70) / 11 (3.3)
22 Aug 2017 / 352 / 264 (70) / 14 (4)

In the past week [week ending 20 Aug 2017], 19 cases have been reported with 3 more deaths. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. The epicurve published last week (Hepatitis A - USA (20): (CA) fatal 20170817.5256184) showed that the outbreak is continuing at a relatively stable rate of 15-20 new onset cases/week.

The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the deaths occurred in those individuals. Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM [men who have sex with men] practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading.
