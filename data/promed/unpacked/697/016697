Lumpy skin disease [LSD], Malaysia
----------------------------------

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Started: 9 May 2021
Confirmed: 7 Jun 2021
Reported: 21 Jun 2021
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence in the country
Causal agent: Lumpy skin disease virus
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (23)
[Since 10 May 2021, 23 outbreaks of lumpy skin disease (LSD) have occurred in the states of Perak, Kedah, Pahang, Perlis, Melaka and Terengganu. See details of each outbreak at the source URL above. - Mod.CRD]

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (23)
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 1955 / 54 / 0 / 0 / 6 / -
Affected population: LSD affected small holder cattle farms in the village. The clinical signs in some of the animals included severe skin nodules, high fever, and swollen lymph nodes.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive, illegal movement of animals
Epidemiological comments: LSD has never been reported in Malaysia before, and the recent event is categorized as an emerging disease. The incident is likely due to the illegal movement of smuggled animals from infected neighboring countries. The 1st outbreak was detected in a dairy farm in Perak with a population of 11 dairy cattle, but only 3 animals were showing clinical signs with nodules spotted on the skin of the animals. Following this outbreak, surveillance activity was intensified to cover the ruminant farms all over Malaysia, including Sabah and Sarawak. From the surveillance program, the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) observed that there were other farms in the states of Perak, Kedah, Pahang, Perlis, Melaka and Terengganu that were having LSD-like lesions affecting some of the cattle population. Samples such as skin lesions, scabs, saliva/nasal swabs, EDTA and whole blood were taken from some of the animals in the infected farms and submitted to Veterinary Research Institute (VRI), Ipoh for analysis. The results from VRI were obtained on 8 Jun 2021 and confirmed positive for LSD. Currently, stamping out policy is practiced by slaughtering the animals that are showing clinical signs as well as serologically LSD-positive animals. Vaccination is permitted and the industry is encouraged to vaccinate their susceptible animals against LSD. Importation of live animals from LSD-infected countries is temporarily suspended until further notice. Currently, the states of Sabah and Sarawak that are located at East Malaysia (Island of Borneo) are still free from LSD. Up to now, the LSD event in Malaysia is under control and confined only in 6 states in Peninsular Malaysia as mentioned above. However, the event is continuing, and follow-up reports to the OIE will be submitted accordingly.

Control measures at event level
Control measures applied, domestic: Ante- and post-mortem inspections; control of vectors; disinfection; disinfestation; movement control inside the country; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; quarantine; screening; selective killing and disposal; traceability; zoning; slaughter; stamping out; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone
Control measures to be applied, domestic: Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); vector surveillance

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: VRI Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Outbreaks / Test date / Result
