The FDA has learned that the ConAgra plant in Sylvester, GA, sent bulk
Peter Pan peanut butter to its plant in Humboldt, TN. The 3 brands
described below are part of the original Peter Pan recall. These brands
have been recalled and are no longer being sold. However, some consumers
may still have these products in their home.
Consumers who have any of the products listed below should discard them.
Individuals who are not sure if the purchased product contains the recalled
peanut butter topping should contact the store where the product was purchased.
The bulk peanut butter was used to make the following toppings:
Sonic Brand Ready-To-Use Peanut Butter Topping in 6 lb 10.5 oz cans. Sonic
outlets used the topping until 16 Feb 2007, when the product was recalled.
The topping was used in the following Sonic products:
- Peanut Butter Shake
- Peanut Butter Fudge Shake
- Peanut Butter Sundae
- Peanut Butter Fudge Sundae
Carvel Peanut Butter Topping in 6 lb 10 oz cans. Carvel used the topping
until 16 Feb 2007, when the product was recalled. The topping was used in
the following Carvel ice cream products:
- Chocolate Peanut Butter
- Peanut Butter Treasure
- Peanut Butter & Jelly
- Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Sundae Dasher
- any other customized products containing the Peanut Butter Topping,
including peanut butter flavored ice cream in ice cream cakes
J Hungerford Smith Peanut Butter Dessert Topping in 6 lb 10 oz cans: this
topping may be used by retail and restaurant outlets throughout the United
States but is not available for direct purchase by the public.
ConAgra informed the public that it is recalling all Peter Pan peanut
butter and all Great Value peanut butter beginning with product code
"2111". The company's recall extends to products made since December 2005.
FDA's advice to consumers continues to be not to eat any Peter Pan peanut
butter or any Great Value peanut butter beginning with the "2111" product code.

[2] Possible 1st case outside USA (Colombia)

Today, 2 Mar 2007, brought the first indications that contaminated food
from the Georgia plant may have caused disease in other countries.
A Colombian man said he bought a jar of Peter Pan peanut butter on 10 Feb
2007 because his 5 year old daughter was fond of peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches. She became ill with diarrhea and other symptoms last week and
the family stopped feeding her peanut butter.
"To my surprise I was watching CNN news in English when I heard that the
FDA was warning consumers about the salmonella in Peter Pan peanut butter,"
said the girl's father. "And to add to this surprise the lid of the jar I
still have has the number "2111."
The father said he contacted the store where he bought the peanut butter
and was put in touch with the importer, which told him that any laboratory
tests would be at his own expense.

[It would not be surprising at all if cases are found outside the USA. This
report, however, does not include any evidence that the girl or the peanut
butter were cultured. - Mod.LL
The report says that the girl's father is Colombian. It implies, but does
not state, that they are in Colombia. - Mod.SH]
