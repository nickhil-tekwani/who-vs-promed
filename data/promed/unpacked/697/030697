[The 2006 outbreak involved 5 or 6 bovine deaths (accounts vary), 2 laboratory confirmed, on a farm in Rhonnda Cynon Taff , South Wales; 7 cows had died of anthrax on this farm in 1971. OIE Handistatus II reported a single outbreak in the UK in 2002, but with no other details, but subsequently noted as "10/2002," presumably in October 2002. ProMED reported a suspect case in Scotland in December of that year (2002) which was not confirmed. Otherwise the disease essentially stopped in 1997, benefiting from the controls implemented to stop "Mad Cow" disease.

If a previous outbreak was on this farm "20" years ago, that would be approximately 1995. At that time, and from personal experience with outbreaks in the UK (granted in 1972 in Hampshire, the next door county), the carcasses were efficiently and promptly burned using butane torches.

For a meaningful long-term risk, the prior anthrax carcass would have had to have been buried, not burnt, and the farm would have had to have recently indulged, this autumn, in some earth shifting, digging, or trenching into that burial site. Fortunately, there are now better culture techniques for demonstrating viable anthrax spores in soil. If they are successful, there will be lessons to be learnt from this UK experience. We look forward to the next DEFRA report. - Mod.MHJ
