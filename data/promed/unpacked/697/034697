A 51 year old UK resident presented to our clinic on 5 May 2015 with a 21-day history of daily rigors, profuse sweating attacks and high fever starting in mid-March 2015, followed by malaise, weight loss of 13 kg and intermittent fever and sweats for the next 4 weeks. This was associated with pain and swelling in his left knee, in which he had an uncomplicated total knee replacement 5 years previously for early-onset osteoarthritis following a motorcycling accident. There were no systemic abnormalities other than fever and there was an effusion in the symptomatic knee. Blood cultures yielded Gram negative coccobacilli after 3 days incubation (BioMerieux Bact/ALERT blood culture system), identified as _Brucella melitensis_ by MALDI-TOF (Bruker microflex LT), but not before 2 laboratory scientists had been exposed to open culture plates. Aspirate of cloudy fluid from the knee showed over 6000 lymphocytes and brucella organisms were cultured after 7 days' incubation. The patient has commenced a 3-month course of doxycycline and rifampin, together with parenteral gentamicin for the first 14 days. The exposed laboratory scientists were given doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 21 days as postexposure prophylaxis according to UK guidelines (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brucella-reference-unit-bru-managing-laboratory-exposure).

The patient made frequent visits to Thailand, where he had stayed with a friend on his farm in Nakom Pathom province from 11 Dec 2014 to 8 Jan 2015. During that time he helped deliver several parturient goats and handled newly born kids and other products of conception with his bare hands. He had not consumed unpasteurized dairy products and had no contact with cattle or buffaloes. When his diagnosis was established, he informed us that a farm laborer was simultaneously being investigated in a Thai hospital for a mysterious fever. After the UK diagnosis was relayed to the physicians in Thailand, a diagnosis of brucellosis was thought likely and empiric treatment was commenced pending test results, with clinical improvement. The friend who owns the farm has now also been admitted with a similar illness, and investigations for suspected brucellosis are under way.

Despite our local interest in brucellosis (1,2), this is not a diagnosis we would normally consider in a traveler returning from Thailand. As a contributing center, we reported this case within the GeoSentinel network and interrogated the GeoSentinel database, which now includes over 235 000 returning travellers (3). It includes only 82 patients with brucellosis. Only 22 from Asia: 2 cases from Thailand, 16 from South Central Asia (India 11, Iran 2, Nepal 2, Afghanistan 1) and 4 from North East Asia (China 2, Taiwan 1, 1 not specified).

Foci in China, Mongolia and Central Eurasia are well recognised but the range of other countries newly affected by brucellosis continues to expand (4-6). Human infections seem to be grossly underreported compared to the patchy knowledge of its increasing incidence in livestock in South Asia (7). An outbreak of caprine and related human brucellosis in Ratchaburi Province in Thailand was reported in ProMed in 2003. The only other ProMed reports of brucellosis from this region included a boy who acquired brucellosis from raw goat's milk in Penang, Malaysia in 2010 and a German visitor who acquired brucellosis more recently in Myanmar, probably from drinking lassi. There have been sporadic case reports and 2 more detailed reviews of emerging brucellosis endemicity in Thailand over the past decade (8,9). As demonstrated by our patient, the highest risk to humans in Thailand is exposure to parturient goats (_B. melitensis_) but there is a separate risk of _B. abortus_ transmission from buffaloes. The areas of highest incidence appear to be Nakhon Si Thammarat Province and Kanchanaburi Province (8), which borders Nakom Pathom Province.

Clinicians should consider brucellosis as well as more commonly encountered causes of fever in returnees from Thailand and neighboring countries, such as dengue, scrub typhus, murine typhus, leptospirosis and malaria, and rarer bacterial infections such as melioidosis. A detailed risk exposure history will provide useful clues, and diagnosis of illness in travellers may aid diagnosis of unexplained illness in the country of origin.

We thank Elena Axelrod, David Hamer and Patricia Schlagenhauf for providing data from the GeoSentinel database and for helpful comments and we acknowledge our colleagues from the other 56 centres currently contributing data to the GeoSentinel network.

Brucellosis is zoonotic infection that can be spread not only by direct contact with the animal carrier but also by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese. The infection is also known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile periods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with _B. melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle) and _B. suis_ (swine).

The infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is generally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be diagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow quite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the microbiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis.

Localized infection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system (1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). Genitourinary [GU] brucellosis may present identically to GU tuberculosis. Psychiatric manifestations such as depression and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5), so-called chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active brucella infection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can, however, include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).
