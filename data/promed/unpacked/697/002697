North Korea is grappling with a strain of the deadly lung disease
tuberculosis that is resistant to conventional treatment. Humanitarian
workers say the impoverished communist country, which already has one
of the highest rates of tuberculosis outside of sub-Saharan Africa, is
unable to cope with the outbreak. Most victims could die of the
disease within years. But some help is coming from an outside
foundation.

The disease is known as multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. It
resists treatment by the 2 most powerful front-line TB drugs
[isoniazid and rifampin].

Stephen Linton, chairman of the Eugene Bell Foundation in Seoul,
recently returned from North Korea, which he has visited nearly 70
times for humanitarian work since 1979. "North Koreans have told me
that tuberculosis is their number one, number 2 and number 3 primary
public health concern," he said.

Conditions in North Korea are ideal for the spread of TB. The climate
is cold. Most citizens live and work in small spaces and lack proper
nutrition to maintain a strong immune system.

Linton says his foundation is now primarily focused on combating the
multi-drug resistant TB outbreaks in North Korea. It is treating 600
patients in the country at a cost of USD 2000 annually per case. It is
an intense multi-year regimen of several 2nd-line drugs that produce
severe side effects.

Linton says the prognosis is grim for those who cannot get access to
the expensive program. "It's the fate of a resistant patient anywhere
who doesn't get medication. I think their average life expectancy
would be no more than 5 years. To make matters worse, there's a very
good chance that they would pass this resistant form of TB on to their
families, to their co-workers, to whoever comes in contact with them,"
he noted. "So it becomes not only a personal tragedy but a serious
social problem at the same time."

Linton, who suffered himself from TB as a child in South Korea, says
it is difficult to know how widespread the epidemic is in the North.
"I don't think anybody knows because the primary research hasn't been
done. And all we're doing is looking at it through these keyholes of 6
different institutions. But, for instance, the North Koreans can
identify patients that they suspect are MDR. And when we test them, 95
to 98 percent are MDR. They have enough patients already on waiting
lists to double this program," said Linton. "So I would imagine that
MDR patients in the thousands would be quite easy given their present
situation."

As a South Korea-based American citizen devoted to assisting ill North
Koreans, Linton tries to avoid the political sensitivities in all 3
countries that affect the aid flow. But his foundation does insist on
visiting any facility in North Korea to which it provides assistance.

The authorities in Pyongyang, who tightly control visits to the
country, have welcomed Linton perhaps more times than any other
American citizen. However, even he has not been allowed to take up
residence there to supervise his life-saving work. Linton says,
instead, the foundation has focused on training North Korean
caregivers to manage the program themselves.

The Washington DC-based Korea Economic Institute says North Korea's
diplomatic isolation hinders its access to large-scale,
internationally funded programs to fight MDR tuberculosis. That is
partly due to economic sanctions imposed on the country by the
international community for its nuclear weapons and missile
development programs. The institute says the sanctions have had the
unintended consequence of exacerbating North Korea's public health
crisis.

[The annual incidence rate of tuberculosis (TB) for North Korea in
2009 was among the highest in the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa,
estimated at almost 350 per 100 000, more than 3 times the rates for
China and South Korea, which approach 100 per 100 000
(http://www.keia.org/sites/default/files/publications/perry.pdf).
Rates of drug resistant TB in North Korea are unknown because of the
absence of laboratories capable of drug susceptibility testing in this
country
(http://www.keia.org/sites/default/files/publications/perry.pdf);
however, drug resistance is believed by WHO to be substantial, based
in part on reported re-treatment rates, a proxy for drug resistance
risk.

Resistance to TB drugs arises from spontaneous mutations in the
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ genome under drug selective pressure.
Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is defined as TB whose
isolates are resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin. Extensively
drug-resistant (XDR) TB is defined as TB whose isolates are resistant
to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as to any member of the
fluoroquinolone family and at least one of the following injectable
drugs: kanamycin, capreomycin, or amikacin. MDR-TB and XDR-TB require
treatment for about 2 years with 2nd-line drugs that are less
effective, more toxic, and costlier than 1st-line isoniazid- and
rifampin-based regimens. A successful outcome of treatment depends on
the extent of the drug resistance, the severity of the disease,
competence of the patient's immune system, access to microbiological
laboratories that can provide early and accurate diagnosis and drug
susceptibility testing so that effective treatment is provided as soon
as possible. Treatment success also depends on a reliable supply of
fully potent drugs and patients' adherence to multidrug treatment
regimens.

In the absence of facilities to test for TB drug susceptibility, North
Korean patients with MDR-TB are placed on inappropriate treatment
regimens. Malnutrition, which suppresses the immune system, and an
unreliable or absent supply of TB drugs contribute to the problem.
Inadequately treated patients who continue to be infectious can spread
drug-resistant strains to persons in their communities. If
inadequately treated persons or their infected contacts migrate across
borders, drug-resistant strains can be spread to other regions.
Drug-resistant strains have now been tracked by molecular
fingerprinting methods over wide areas of the world.
