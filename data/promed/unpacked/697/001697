The Directorate of the Esquel Health Program Area reported this Wednesday [20 Apr 2022] that it is working, in conjunction with the Los Alerces National Park Administration (PNLA), to address a new case of Hantavirus [infection], with a possible source of infection in the Andean region of Chubut province.

The control actions began on Sunday [17 Apr 2022], upon receipt of notification from the Ministry of Health in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA), regarding the death in its field of responsibility of a 57 year old man, with a positive diagnosis for a Hantavirus [infection].

Epidemiological survey
----------------------
According to the epidemiological investigation, the deceased person had stayed for a week in the PNLA, carrying out activities in contact with the forest environment throughout his stay.

In this sense, this area of the province was evaluated and this locality identified as the most likely for the spread of this endemic disease.

However, it is important to clarify that so far no new cases related to this event have been identified, nor have other people who had person to person contact with the aforementioned patient been reported.

Environmental approach
----------------------
In compliance with the sanitary protocol for Hantavirus [infections], personnel from the Department of Environmental Health and Zoonotic Diseases of the Esquel Program Area, together with PNLA authorities, began a survey on Monday [18 Apr 2022], in places frequented by the affected person, carrying out an environmental risk assessment and proceeding to capture wild rodents for subsequent study at the ANLIS Malbr√°n National Institute, which operates in the city of Buenos Aires.

Likewise, it was reported that the PNLA remains open and functions normally, recommending that all its visitors [to the Park] maintain the usual preventive measures.

Hantavirus, symptoms and preventive measures
--------------------------------------------
Hantavirus is endemic in the Andean region and is transmitted by contact with urine, saliva and excreta of rodents infected with said virus. It can also be transmitted from person to person through close contact with infected individuals who are in the initial period of the febrile illness (first 48 to 72 hours).

The symptoms of Hantavirus are fever, muscle aches, chills, headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and, in advanced stages, respiratory distress.

The main prevention strategy is to avoid exposing people to environments at risk of the presence of rodents and to keep the surroundings of homes and sheds tidy and clean. As well as using bleach to disinfect [surfaces], wash your hands frequently with soap and water and before entry into environments that have remained closed for a long time, ventilate for no less than an hour.

Another preventive measure is to carry out outdoor tasks with clothing, adequate footwear and respiratory protection (masks). In case of camping, it is recommended to choose a place free of weeds and not to sleep in direct contact with vegetation.

[This is the 2nd case of hantavirus infection this year (2022) involving a person who was in the Los Alerces National Park in Chubut province. The 1st patient worked in a fisherman's club in the national park, likely in a rural or natural environment where rodent virus reservoirs live. Although the virus involved in the above case and the previous one is not mentioned, the most likely virus involved is Andes virus, found in western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. There is also the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, which is widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). Andes virus can also be transmitted directly between people in close physical contact but there is no indication that this was the route of transmission in the above case. - Mod.TY
