I would like to bring to your attention reports of disease outbreaks in horses and donkeys in Niger and Burkina Faso. It has been reported that 4000 donkeys have died in Ingall, Niger. The suspected cause is strangles (_Streptococcus equi_); however, high rates of mortality, as reported in this case, are atypical for this disease. Further surveillance is required to conclusively establish the causative agent and implications for animal and human health. It is unknown whether the causative agent is zoonotic, in addition carcass disposal has already been highlighted as an issue.

This comes in the wake of a recent outbreak of equine influenza in Nigeria with more than 3000 equine animals affected. Reports from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) suggest the outbreak is a symptom of the unregulated global movement and trading of donkeys for their skins.

Brooke West Africa (http://www.thebrooke.org) are working with partners in Burkina Faso and Niger to source further information and provide capacity building for government veterinary services to respond to the outbreak. We are also raising awareness with OIE representatives and AUIBAR [African Union Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources]. This outbreak is having a significant impact on animal health and welfare as well as family livelihoods.

[Dr Saville appended 2 reports related to the described health event in donkeys.

1. An English translation of an official statement, in French, by Burkina Faso's Ministry of Animal Resources and Fishery, reporting a major outbreak of strangles (in French, gourme or horse angina), which has been affecting the country's donkey population for several weeks. Gourme affects the upper respiratory tract of equines (donkeys and horses) of any age, resulting in high morbidities. The diagnosis was confirmed by the National Laboratory and measures to handle it have been undertaken with encouraging results. The Department invited equine owners to report any abnormalities or changes in behavior of their animals to their nearest competent services for urgent clinical arrangements.

In order to effectively counteract the spread of this contagious disease, it is imperative, among other things, to avoid introducing new animals without quarantine for 2 to 3 weeks, and to apply hygienic measures to the premises and the animals. Equipment should be regularly disinfected and grouping of donkeys and horses avoided. "The department knows how to count on the diligence of all to protect our equidae whose contribution to the national economy is important," the statement said. [The source URL for this report was provided by Dr Saville, but was not included as it could not be accessed. Please contact Dr Saville if you would like the original source information. - Mod.JH]

2. A media report, which states that the region most affected in Agadez (Niger) is Ingall, a pastoral region located in the desert's northern part of the country. The report (in French) is available a http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20190305-niger-anes-decimes-maladie-gourme-danger-economie-pastorale.

ProMED-mail joins Dr Saville and 'Brooke West Africa' in requesting any available additional information on the event. Strangles is not listed by the OIE.

In view of the unusual severity of the described malady, other bacterial and viral, particularly respiratory, diseases of horses and donkeys deserve to be excluded; these include African horse sickness and equine influenza. In Niger's annual report to the OIE for 2018, AHS is included among the diseases "absent in 2018." In Burkina Faso's 2018 report, it was included among the animal diseases about which "no information has been provided." - Mod.AS
