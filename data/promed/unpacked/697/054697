Abstract
--------
Mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission has almost exclusively been detected in the tropics despite the distributions of its primary vectors extending farther into temperate regions. Therefore, it is unknown whether ZIKV's range has reached a temperature-dependent limit, or if it can spread into temperate climates. Using field-collected mosquitoes for biological relevance, we found that 2 common temperate mosquito species, _Aedes albopictus_ and _Ochlerotatus detritus_, were competent for ZIKV. We orally exposed mosquitoes to ZIKV and held them at between 17 and 31 deg C [63-88 deg F], estimated the time required for mosquitoes to become infectious and applied these data to a ZIKV spatial risk model. We identified a minimum temperature threshold for the transmission of ZIKV by mosquitoes between 17 and 19 deg C [63-66 F]. Using these data, we generated standardized basic reproduction number R0-based risk maps and we derived estimates for the length of the transmission season for recent and future climate conditions. Our standardized R0-based risk maps show potential risk of ZIKV transmission beyond the current observed range in southern USA, southern China, and southern European countries. Transmission risk is simulated to increase over southern and Eastern Europe, northern USA and temperate regions of Asia (northern China, southern Japan) in future climate scenarios.

[Vector mosquito surveillance will need to take these predictions into account when planning fieldwork in coming years. Monitoring patients for Zika and other febrile virus diseases will need to be aware of this extended range and diagnostic laboratories should be prepared to conduct relevant tests. Similarly, populations of these potential vector mosquito species will be important. Abundant populations are necessary for ongoing transmission. - Mod.TY]

Giovannoni F, Bosch I, Polonio CM, et al. AHR is a Zika virus host factor and a candidate target for antiviral therapy [published correction appears in Nat Neurosci. 2020 Aug 10]. Nat Neurosci. 2020; 23(8): 939-951. doi:10.1038/s41593-020-0664-0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus linked to multiple birth defects including microcephaly, known as congenital ZIKV syndrome. The identification of host factors involved in ZIKV replication may guide efficacious therapeutic interventions. In genome-wide transcriptional studies, we found that ZIKV infection triggers aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation. Specifically, ZIKV infection induces kynurenine (Kyn) production, which activates AHR, limiting the production of type I interferons (IFN-I) involved in antiviral immunity. Moreover, ZIKV-triggered AHR activation suppresses intrinsic immunity driven by promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, which limits ZIKV replication. AHR inhibition suppressed the replication of multiple ZIKV strains in vitro and also suppressed replication of the related flavivirus dengue. Finally, AHR inhibition with a nanoparticle-delivered AHR antagonist or an inhibitor developed for human use limited ZIKV replication and ameliorated newborn microcephaly in a murine model. In summary, we identified AHR as a host factor for ZIKV replication and PML protein as a driver of anti-ZIKV intrinsic immunity.

[It will be interesting to see if AHR [aryl hydrocarbon receptor] antagonists or inhibitors ameliorate fetal infection and microcephaly in non-human primates and, if they do, subsequently in humans. If that approach is safe and effective it could be useful to administer it to women very early in pregnancy during an outbreak. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background. Characterisation of the dynamics of Zika virus persistence following acute infection is needed to inform blood donor and diagnostic testing policies and understand the natural history of Zika virus infection. We aimed to characterise the natural history, persistence, and clinical outcomes of Zika virus infection through a prospective study in initially asymptomatic Zika virus RNA-positive blood donors.

Methods. Zika virus-infected blood donors identified through Zika virus nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) screening at 3 blood collection organisations in the USA were enrolled in a 1-year follow-up study, with blood and body fluid samples and detailed symptom data collected at up to 7 visits. All samples were tested for Zika virus RNA by real-time PCR (rtPCR); follow-up plasma, whole blood, and urine were also tested by replicate NAAT. Plasma was tested for flavivirus-specific IgM and IgG by ELISA. Zika virus RNA persistence for each assay or sample type and plasma antibody persistence from estimated date of plasma NAAT-detectable infection were calculated from follow-up data using survival statistical methods.

Findings. Between 6 Jul 2016 and 7 Mar 2017, we enrolled 53 participants. From the estimated date of plasma NAAT-detectable infection, Zika virus RNA was detectable in plasma for 9.9 days (95% CI 8.1-12.0), in red blood cells for 95.4 days (62.8-129.1), and in whole blood for 73.5 days (39.8-107.5). Replicate NAATs (one or more of 8 replicates positive) extended detection of Zika virus RNA in plasma to 34.8 days (19.9-56.2) and in whole blood (at least one of 2 tests positive) to 104.8 days (76.7-129.9). Urine was rtPCR reactive up to 14.5 days (10.5-20.3) and saliva up to 26.4 days (19.7-38.7). Zika virus IgM persisted for 237.7 days (128.7-459.5) from the estimated time since plasma NAAT-detectable infection. Zika virus RNA fell below detectable limits more rapidly in the saliva of participants with pre-existing dengue virus IgG than in those without. Of 25 donors identified pre-seroconversion with symptom data at the 1st or 2nd study visit, 16 (64%) developed multiple Zika virus-related symptoms after asymptomatic index donations, compared with 9 (36%) of 25 donors detected after seroconversion.

Interpretation. Determination of viral marker persistence is enhanced by follow-up of blood donors who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, Zika virus RNA-positive, and antibody negative. Zika virus RNA persists in red blood cells for several months following clearance from plasma and body fluids, and replicate, highly sensitive NAATs extend RNA detection in all compartments. Whole blood testing can extend the detection of acute infection for diagnostics and monitoring of pregnant women, sexual partners, and travelers.

[These are very useful observations for diagnostic purposes, as the report above indicates. Although indicative of Zika virus infection, presence of viral RNA does not mean necessarily that infectious virus is present and available for mosquito or sexual transmission. It is highly likely that infectious virus was cleared from circulation long before the maximum duration of RNA persistence was documented. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report Zika virus (ZIKV) vertical transmission in 130 infants born to PCR+ mothers at the time of the Rio de Janeiro epidemic of 2015-2016. Serum and urine collected from birth through the 1st year of life were tested by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or IgM Zika MAC-ELISA. A total of 407 specimens are evaluated; 161 sera tested by PCR and IgM assays, 85 urines by PCR. Of these, 65 percent of children (N = 84) are positive in at least one assay. Of 94 children tested within 3 months of age, 70% are positive. Positivity declines to 33% after 3 months; 5 children are PCR+ beyond 200 days of life. Concordance between IgM and PCR results is 52%, sensitivity 65%, specificity 40% (positive PCR results as the gold standard). IgM and serum PCR are 61% concordant; serum and urine PCR 55%. Most children (65%) are clinically normal. Equal numbers of children with abnormal findings (29 of 45, 64%) and normal findings (55 of 85, 65%) have positive results, p = 0.98. Earlier maternal trimester of infection is associated with positive results (p = 0.04) but not clinical disease (p = 0.98). ZIKV vertical transmission is frequent but laboratory confirmed infection is not necessarily associated with infant abnormalities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background. In 2015 and 2016, Colombia had a widespread outbreak of Zika virus. Data from 2 national population-based surveillance systems for symptomatic Zika virus disease (ZVD) and birth defects provided complementary information on the effect of the Zika virus outbreak on pregnancies and infant outcomes.

Methods. We collected national surveillance data regarding cases of pregnant women with ZVD that were reported during the period from June 2015 through July 2016. The presence of Zika virus RNA was identified in a subgroup of these women on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. Brain or eye defects in infants and fetuses and other adverse pregnancy outcomes were identified among the women who had laboratory-confirmed ZVD and for whom data were available regarding pregnancy outcomes. We compared the nationwide prevalence of brain and eye defects during the outbreak with the prevalence both before and after the outbreak period.

Results. Of 18 117 pregnant women with ZVD, the presence of Zika virus was confirmed in 5926 (33%) on rRT-PCR. Of the 5673 pregnancies with laboratory-confirmed ZVD for which outcomes had been reported, 93 infants or fetuses (2%) had brain or eye defects. The incidence of brain or eye defects was higher among pregnancies in which the mother had an onset of ZVD symptoms in the 1st trimester than in those with an onset during the 2nd or third trimester (3% vs. 1%). A total of 172 of 5673 pregnancies (3%) resulted in pregnancy loss; after the exclusion of pregnancies affected by birth defects, 409 of 5426 (8%) resulted in preterm birth and 333 of 5426 (6%) in low birth weight. The prevalence of brain or eye defects during the outbreak was 13 per 10 000 live births, as compared with a prevalence of 8 per 10 000 live births before the outbreak and 11 per 10 000 live births after the outbreak.

Conclusions. In pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed ZVD, brain or eye defects in infants or fetuses were more common during the Zika virus outbreak than during the periods immediately before and after the outbreak. The frequency of such defects was increased among women with a symptom onset early in pregnancy.

[This report confirms and quantifies the occurrence of teratogenic consequences as a result of Zika virus infection in utero. The results are similar to those documented in Brazil during the Zika virus outbreak there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Significance
------------
ZIKV has "silently" circulated without causing severe diseases for decades since its discovery in 1947. Our study demonstrated that ZIKV acquired an evolutionary mutation in viral envelope gene (E-V473M) that increases virulence, maternal-to-fetal transmission during pregnancy, and viremia in nonhuman primates to facilitate urban transmission since 2013, which may be responsible for the recent emergence and severe diseases. Our results underscore the potential that high genetic mutation frequencies during arbovirus replication and transmission between mosquito and vertebrate hosts could lead to emergence and reemergence of those pathogens. Understanding the mechanisms of emergence and enhanced transmission is essential to detect and respond to future arbovirus outbreaks

Abstract
--------
Arboviruses maintain high mutation rates due to lack of proofreading ability of their viral polymerases, in some cases facilitating adaptive evolution and emergence. Here we show that, just before its 2013 spread to the Americas, Zika virus (ZIKV) underwent an envelope protein V473M substitution (E-V473M) that increased neurovirulence, maternal-to-fetal transmission, and viremia to facilitate urban transmission. A preepidemic Asian ZIKV strain (FSS13025 isolated in Cambodia in 2010) engineered with the V473M substitution significantly increased neurovirulence in neonatal mice and produced higher viral loads in the placenta and fetal heads in pregnant mice. Conversely, an epidemic ZIKV strain (PRVABC59 isolated in Puerto Rico in 2015) engineered with the inverse M473V substitution reversed the pathogenic phenotypes. Although E-V473M did not affect oral infection of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, competition experiments in cynomolgus macaques showed that this mutation increased its fitness for viremia generation, suggesting adaptive evolution for human viremia and hence transmission. Mechanistically, the V473M mutation, located at the 2nd transmembrane helix of the E protein, enhances virion morphogenesis. Overall, our study revealed E-V473M as a critical determinant for enhanced ZIKV virulence, intrauterine transmission during pregnancy, and viremia to facilitate urban transmission.

[Observation that Zika virus circulating before the outbreak in the Pacific islands and the Americas was relatively benign led to the speculation that a mutation had occurred that increased transmissibility and virulence for humans. The report above provides evidence that such a mutation occurred and was responsible for spread of the virus and its pathogenicity. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) is considered to cause an acute self-limited infection in adults, and microcephaly in fetus. Presence of the virus for long periods has been detected in body fluids; however, persistent viremia in serum for more than 1 year has not yet been reported. We have investigated persistence of ZIKV in serum samples of 77 subjects who were infected by the virus between 18 months and 3 years before the start of this study. The subjects included children with microcephaly and their parents. Serum samples were subjected to routine RT-qPCR assay for ZIKV, chikungunya virus, and dengue virus. From the 77 subjects, 5 showed positive for the presence of ZIKV particles by RT-qPCR, including 4 members of the same family. Viral isolation in Vero cells and C6/36 cells confirmed the result and showed the viral particles were active. We have detected viremia in healthy carriers up to 3 years after symptom onset. Humans acting as potential viral reservoirs have major implications for the current understanding of ZIKV infection.

[The occurrence of viremia for up to 3 years in convalescent individuals is surprising. The virus must be persisting in cells where the virus is protected from neutralizing antibodies and in cells that do not undergo apoptosis. One wonders if the viremia is of sufficient magnitude to infect vector mosquitoes, although that seems unlikely, or is sufficient in ejaculates or vaginal secretions for sexual transmission. - Mod.TY]

[9] Immune suppression
Date: Wed 12 Aug 2020
Source: Medical Xpress [edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-08-insights-zika-virus-suppresses-host.html


A research team led by scientists at the University of California, Riverside [UCR], has outlined how the Zika virus, which constituted an epidemic threat in 2016, suppresses the immune system of its host.

The Zika virus, or ZIKV, spreads through mosquito bites and sexual intercourse. Currently, no approved vaccine or antivirals against ZIKV exist.

"Suppressing host immunity is a common strategy employed by viruses to achieve successful infection," said Jikui Song, a professor of biochemistry at UCR, who co-led the study. "Our work provides valuable structural and functional information on the interaction between ZIKV and its host and offers a framework for the development of vaccines and antivirals."

The study appears in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology (1).

Song explained the steps involved in suppressing the host immune response. ZIKV encounters the 1st line of defense by way of a type I interferon, or IFN, response in the host. Secreted by infected cells, IFNs are natural substances that help the host's immune system fight infection. Once ZIKV infects the cell, it presents a nonstructural protein, NS5, which interacts with a key player in the type I IFN pathway: the STAT2 protein. The interaction between ZIKV NS5 and STAT2 degrades STAT2, which inhibits the type I IFN response.

The research involved first solving the crystal structure of a complex between a large fragment of ZIKV NS5 and STAT2. This crystal structure guided the researchers in solving the cryo-EM structure of ZIKV NS5 and STAT2, which then led them to come up with a model for how ZIKV NS5 suppresses human STAT2.

"Understanding the interaction, at the molecular level, between ZIKV NS5 and the host immune factor STAT2, opens up a new window for the rational design of live attenuated vaccines and antivirals," said study co-leader Rong Hai, an assistant professor of virology at UCR. "Targeting the virus-host interaction may also provide an important approach for drug development against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19."

The researchers also generated a panel of mutant ZIKV viruses.

"To our knowledge, these are the 1st NS5-based ZIKV mutants, which have the potential to be used as live attenuated ZIKV vaccines," Hai said.

Next, the researchers will work on the structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to identify new targets against COVID-19.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Introduction. Having verified the true association between the Zika virus and the occurrence of microcephaly, studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of the infection on fetal development. Congenital Zika virus syndrome is a currently known condition but little addressed regarding speech, language, and hearing disorders in children.

Objective. To conduct a systematic review of speech, language, and hearing disorders in children with congenital Zika virus syndrome.

Methods. This systematic review followed the PRISMA instructions and the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, and it was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018111764). The databases consulted were Cochrane, SciELO, PubMed, LILACS, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. OpenGrey and OpenThesis were used to partially capture the "grey literature". Observational studies of children with microcephaly due to congenital Zika virus syndrome were included. The risk of bias was analyzed using the 2017 Joanna Briggs Institute.

Results. 707 records were obtained and, after excluding the duplicates, 644 studies remained. After applying the inclusion criteria, 24 articles were considered eligible. Children with congenital Zika virus syndrome presented abnormal persistence of primitive reflexes (94.7%), impaired cognitive development (95.1%), delayed neuropsychomotor development (between 92.8 and 100%), hypertonia (between 74.7% and 90.1%), impaired language development (between 68.42% and 100%), retrognathia (38.6%), craniofacial disproportion (between 32.9% and 95.8%), altered tongue frenulum (between 30% and 36.36%), the absence of stapedial reflexes (27.3%), dysphagia (between 14% and 88.9%), and hearing changes (between 5.8% and 68.42%).

Conclusion. Children with congenital Zika virus syndrome may have speech, language, and hearing disorders such as hearing loss, dysphagia, alteration in the tongue frenulum, and delays in neuropsychomotor and language development.
