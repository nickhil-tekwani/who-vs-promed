Japanese encephalitis claimed at least 23 lives in Assam in 15 days, a report of National Health Mission said. The NHM report stated that the mosquito-borne disease claimed 4 more lives over the past 24 hours in Assam, taking the toll to 23. Of these, 2 deaths each were reported from Nalbari and Morigaon districts.

On the other hand, 16 fresh cases of JE were detected in the state in the last 24 hours. While Barpeta, Kamrup Metropolitan, Karbi Anglong East, and Hojai reported one case each, Nagaon recorded 4 cases, Sivasagar reported 2, and 3 cases each were reported from Nalbari and Udalguri districts, the NHM report stated.

With these, altogether 160 cases of JE have been reported in Assam since 1 Jul [2022].

Upper Assam districts including Golaghat, Jorhat, Majuli, Sivasagar, and Lakhimpur; central Assam districts of Nagaon, Hojai, and Morigaon; hill district Karbi Anglong East; and lower Assam districts of Barpeta, Kamrup Metropolitan, Nalbari, and Udalguri have been affected by the disease, the report stated.

Dr R L Nunisa, joint director of health services (Malaria) cum state programme officer of National Vector Borne Disease Control Program, Assam, while speaking to media said that the Japanese encephalitis situation in Assam is under surveillance and all preventive measures are being taken to combat the disease.

"The state is undergoing the transmission season for Japanese encephalitis cases, [Dr. Nunisa said]. "Moreover, the floods and soaring temperatures have aggravated the situation.

"Awareness programmes and fogging operations have been intensified across the state. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets are being distributed in the affected areas to prevent the disease from spreading," Dr Nunisa added.

[The cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase rapidly and are occurring in several localities. In just the past 15 days, the number of deaths has increased to 23, with 4 in the past 24 hours, and the number of JE cases increased to 160. Interestingly, none of these 160 cases was classified as acute encephalitis syndrome, as was the situation for those 48 cases in a previous ProMED post (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20220707.8704289). The previous report indicated that the state district rapid response team on acute encephalitis syndrome and JE that will be constituted soon will be dealing with any non-JE AES cases that are diagnosed in the area. Given the rapid rise in cases, a response is urgent. Although vector mosquito control is mentioned as a preventive measure, nothing is said about vaccination. No mention is made in the report above if any of the affected individuals reported above had been vaccinated against JE.

Flooding may have increased the area of breeding of JE virus vector mosquitoes. This is the season of active JE virus transmission, so more cases are likely to occur over the next 3 months. A vaccine against JE is available and is often used in northeastern India where the virus is endemic. - Mod.TY
