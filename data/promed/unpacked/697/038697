Bird flu virus found in market stalls
-------------------------------------
Secretary for Food and Health Dr. York Chow says Po On Road Market
has been declared an infected area after the H5N1 bird flu virus was
found in 5 chicken dropping samples collected from 3 stalls. He told
reporters the affected stalls got the chickens from the Cheung Sha
Wan Temporary Wholesale Poultry Market. The birds may have come from
local or Mainland farms.

Imports of live Mainland chicken will be suspended while local farms
will stop selling chickens for 3 weeks to facilitate the Government's
work in tracing the source of the infected chickens. The Food and
Environmental Hygiene Department has cordoned off all the chicken
stalls in the market and started culling the 2700 chickens in it.
Disinfection work will also be conducted.

The department has stepped up inspection of 64 markets with chicken
stalls and no abnormality has been detected. More chicken dropping
samples will be collected for tests. The department will send staff
to the Mainland to inspect registered farms supplying chicken to Hong
Kong while more samples will be collected from local wholesale
markets for tests.

The Cheung Sha Wan Temporary Wholesale Poultry Market will be
thoroughly cleaned while the next poultry outlet rest day will be
advanced from next Wednesday [11 Jun 2008] to Monday [9 Jun 2008].

The Government will also step up checks on chilled poultry products
and will enhance its inspection of retail markets and local poultry
farms. The Customs and Excise Department will bolster its enforcement
work against poultry smuggling.

Dr. Chow said the incident has been reported to Mainland authorities
and quarantine units have been asked to pay special attention to the
registered farms supplying poultry to Hong Kong. Although no human
avian flu cases have been reported so far, the Department of Health
and the Hospital Authority will enhance prevention work. The health
of staff at the 3 affected stalls will be closely monitored. Public
and private hospitals and clinics have been reminded to report
suspicious cases to the Centre for Health Protection.

People with flu symptoms should seek medical advice immediately and a
hotline (2125 1122) has been set up to handle enquiries. People
should avoid touching live poultry. They should wash their hands
after touching the animals. Chickens should be thoroughly cooked
before eating.

[Hong Kong was the site of the very 1st case of human infection with
HPAI H5N1 in August 1997. Since then, the HK Government has been
applying the following exemplary measures to reduce the risk of
infection spreading from poultry to humans:

(a) vaccination of chickens in local farms and imported chickens;
(b) regulation of local farms including tightened biosecurity
measures (for example, all farms should be [wild] birdproof);
(c) import control (for instance, imported chickens must come from
registered farms with health certificates);
(d) segregation policy (no waterfowl which are natural carriers of
avian influenza viruses can be sold in retail outlets);
(e) market rest days to break the virus cycle and reduce the viral load;
(f) hygiene requirements on wholesale market and retail outlets; and
(g) surveillance targeted at humans, poultry and wild birds to
ensure timely detection of the presence of any avian influenza
viruses in our environment.

The said measures and additional background information are described
in the document "Hong Kong's preparedness for influenza pandemic -
Prevention and Protection" updated July 2007, which is available at
<http://www.info.gov.hk/info/flu/eng/index.htm>.

The website includes also a useful table "Countries / areas with
documented avian influenza H5 infection in birds and human in the
recent 6 months" which is meticulously updated. - Mod.AS]
