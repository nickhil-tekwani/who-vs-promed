----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zebra chip (ZC), an emerging disease of potato (_Solanum tuberosum_ L.)
first documented in potato fields around Saltillo in Mexico in 1994, has
been identified in the south western United States, Mexico, and Central
America and is causing losses of millions of dollars to the potato
industry. Recently, this damaging potato disease was also documented in New
Zealand. This disease is characterized by a striped pattern of necrosis in
tubers produced on infected plants, and fried chips processed from these
infected tubers are commercially unacceptable.

Recent studies conducted in the United States and New Zealand have
associated ZC with a new species of '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter' vectored by
the potato psyllid, _Bactericera cockerelli_ Sulc. A bacterium designated
'_Candidatus_ Liberibacter psyllaurous' has recently been identified in
potato plants with "psyllid yellows" symptoms that resemble those of ZC.

To investigate whether liberibacter is associated with ZC in Mexico, 11
potato (cv. Atlantic) tuber samples exhibiting strong ZC symptoms and six
asymptomatic tubers were collected from a ZC-affected commercial potato
field near Saltillo City, Coahuila, Mexico in September 2008 and tested for
this bacterium by PCR. 7 of 11 (63.7 per cent) ZC-symptomatic tubers and
one of 6 (16.7 per cent) asymptomatic potatoes yielded the expected 1168 bp
[basepair] 16S rDNA and 669 bp amplicons, indicating the presence of
liberibacter.

Amplicons were sequenced and showed 100 per cent identity to liberibacter
16S rDNA sequences amplified from potato psyllids from Texas and potato
tubers from Kansas. The ZC 669 bp sequence was 98 per cent identical to
liberibacter ribosomal protein gene sequences amplified from several
solanaceous plants in New Zealand. The 1168 bp sequence was also identical
to the 16S rDNA sequence of '_Ca._ Liberibacter psyllaurous'.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of '_Ca._ Liberibacter
psyllaurous' associated with ZC-affected potatoes in Mexico.

solanacearum' with zebra chip disease of potato established by graft and
psyllid transmission, electron microscopy, and PCR. Plant Dis 2009; 93(6):
574-583; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-93-6-0574]
------------------------------------------------------------------
A new disease of potatoes, tentatively named zebra chip (ZC) because of the
intermittent dark and light symptom pattern in affected tubers which is
enhanced by frying, was first found in Mexico in 1994 and in the south
western United States in 2000. The disease can cause severe economic losses
in all market classes of potatoes. The cause of ZC has been elusive, and
only recently has been associated with a '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter' species.

Field samples of potato plants were collected from several locations in the
United States, Mexico, and Guatemala to determine transmission to potato
and tomato by grafting of ZC-infected scions and psyllid feeding. The
disease was successfully transmitted, through up to 3 generations, by
sequential top- and side-grafting ZC-infection scions to several potato
cultivars and to tomato. The disease was also successfully transmitted to
potato and tomato plants in greenhouse experiments by potato psyllids
collected from potato plants naturally affected with ZC.

Transmission electron microscopic observation of ZC-affected tissues
revealed the presence of bacteria-like organisms (BLOs) in the phloem of
potato and tomato plants inoculated by grafting and psyllid feeding. The
BLOs were morphologically similar in appearance to BLOs associated with
other plant diseases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified 16S rDNA
sequences from samples representing different geographic areas, including
the United States, Mexico, and Guatemala, were almost identical to the 16S
rDNA of '_Ca._ L. solanacearum' previously reported from solanaceous plants
in New Zealand and the United States. Two subclades were identified that
differed in 2 single base-pair substitutions. These data confirm the
association of '_Ca._ L. solanacearum' with potatoes affected by ZC in the
United States, Mexico, and Guatemala.

[3] Liberibacter and psyllid vectors - New Zealand: economic impact

New pest wrecking potato crop
-----------------------------
The jury is still out on the impact a new pest, the potato psyllid, will
have on crop yields. The insect spreads a damaging bacterium, liberibacter.

Horticulture New Zealand's Potato Group chairman Terry Olsen said
information from potato growers suggested the psyllid has had between a 10
and 20 per cent impact on lowering potato yields, but not a lot is known
about the insect's influence yet. "It is a very new pest here. In 2008, we
saw it first and it has become widespread since then," Mr Olsen said.
"There is some uncertainty and concern about next year's crop."

The insect lives on solanaceous plants, which included tomatoes, capsicums,
and potatoes. Solanaceous weeds and volunteer potato plants are likely to
be reservoirs between potato crop cycles.

Mr Olsen said after talking to other growers, it looked as though crops
harvested early in the season largely escaped damage, while those brought
in since late April [2009] have shown psyllid impact.

"There is a lot of research going on, but as yet, we don't have a good fix
on the psyllid in New Zealand. There is early evidence that it may thrive
in warmer climates and those that have mild winters," he said. "I think the
answer will be a management package, rather than the use of agri-chemicals
alone. There are also some indications that some varieties are more
resilient to the psyllid than others," he said.

Mr Olsen believed while research study was likely to help in the longer
term, most early information would come from grower observation. "The
impact of the psyllid is still an unknown and so is the insect. At this
stage we just don't know the enemy well enough," Mr Olsen said.

[Zebra chip (ZC) disease of potato was first reported in Mexico in 1994 and
has caused yield losses of up to 60 per cent in Guatemala, Mexico, and the
southwestern USA. Symptoms include early senescence of plants and necrotic
flecking of tubers where starch is converted to soluble sugars. This
results in zebra-like stripes and brittleness during processing. ZC leaf
symptoms also resemble a group of symptoms known as psyllid yellows (PY)
which was thought to be due to the injection of toxic saliva by the feeding
insects.

A new liberibacter species transmitted by potato (or tomato) psyllids
(_Bactericera cockerelli_) has now been found to be associated with ZC and
PY. The finding in item 1 that the liberibacter was present in one
asymptomatic tuber does not contradict this, because it may, for example,
be due to an early stage of infection before visible symptoms. The
experimental transmission studies in item 2 have fulfilled Koch's
postulates (a set of criteria for establishing a causal relationship)
showing infectiousness of the new pathogen. In New Zealand, where the
potato psyllid was first reported in 2006, the new liberibacter has been
found to affect also tomato and capsicum. There appears to be some dispute
about naming the species with both _Ca._ L. psyllaurous and _Ca._ L.
solanacearum used above as preliminary names.

Only few members of _Ca._ Liberibacter have been characterised so far,
including the pathogens causing citrus greening (huanglongbing, HLB). HLB
is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus (further information via
ProMED-mail post no. 20090415.1436), but is limited to these crops due to
the host specificity of its vector, the citrus psyllid. In contrast, potato
psyllid has a wider host range including species in 20 plant families, and
this can be expected to impact on the epidemiology and importance of the
new pathogen.

For both ZC and PY there remains a possibility that similar symptoms may
also be due to factors other than the liberibacter. A possible role of
phytoplasmas remains to be clarified which were previously reported as the
cause of ZC in some areas, but not in others.
