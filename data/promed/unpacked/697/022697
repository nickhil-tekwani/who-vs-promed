Influenza - update 115
----------------------
Situation update:
As of 27 Aug 2010, worldwide [pandemic] H1N1 2009 [pandemic] virus
transmission remains most intense in parts of India and in parts of
the temperate southern hemisphere, particularly New Zealand and more
recently in Australia.

In India, the current national influenza H1N1 2009 epidemic, which
1st began during late May and June 2010 in the southern state of
Kerala (co-incident with start of the monsoon rains), continues to
remain regionally intense in several western and southern states as
well as the in the capital. The western state of Maharashtra, which
to date, has detected the highest numbers of cases (including fatal
cases), continues to record the most intense influenza H1N1 2009
[pandemic] activity; however, the rate of increase in the numbers of
new cases reported per week appears to have slowed during mid-August
2010, suggesting that current epidemic activity may be peaking.

Increasing H1N1 2009 activity has also been reported in Delhi since
early August 2010, and in the southern states of Karnataka and Andhra
Pradesh since late July 2010. A number of other states, primarily in
western and northern India, reported small numbers of new cases
during the 3rd week of August 2010, suggesting that low level
circulation of H1N1 2009 may be more geographically extensive. Since
late July 2010, the vast majority of influenza virus detections have
been H1N1 2009 [pandemic].

In New Zealand, [influenza] H1N1 2009 [pandemic] virus transmission
remains active and locally intense, particularly in areas that were
less affected during last winter's 1st pandemic wave. As of the 3rd
week of August 2010, the overall national weekly rate of
consultations for ILI [influenza-like illness] continued to increase
above the seasonal baseline for the 4th consecutive week; however,
the rate of increase in ILI consultations appears have slowed during
the most recent reporting week, suggesting that peak epidemic
activity may occur in the weeks ahead.

Although the overall national rates of ILI consultations has not
exceeded levels seen during the 2009 winter pandemic wave, several
areas of New Zealand, most notably Hawke's Bay, Hutt Valley and
Lakes, are all reporting local rates of ILI consultations that match
or surpass rates seen at the national level at the peak of last
winter's pandemic wave. The vast majority of influenza virus
detections during the current epidemic period have been H1N1 2009.

In Australia, during the 1st 2 weeks of August 2010, data from
several surveillance systems indicate that influenza activity is
increasing, including a one week increase in the national rate of ILI
consultations, regional spread of ILI activity in 3 southern and
eastern states, and a sharp 2-week rise in the proportion of sentinel
respiratory samples testing positive for influenza virus (an increase
from 5 to 15 percent). However, overall national rates of ILI
consultations remain well below levels observed during the 2009
winter pandemic wave.

The majority of recent influenza virus isolations have been
characterized as H1N1 2009 [pandemic]; however, seasonal H3N2 viruses
have also been detected at low levels. Of note, an online influenza
surveillance system that tracks the rate of ILI in the community
found that recent increases in the rate of ILI have been among
persons who were unvaccinated against H1N1 2009 virus. Although
significantly fewer severe and total cases of H1N1 2009 virus
infection have been detected this year compared to last winter, the
median age of H1N1 2009 virus infected cases appears to similar
although slightly older (21 versus 26 years old).

Description: Displayed data reflect the most recent data reported to
Flunet (<http://gamapserver.who.int/GlobalAtlas/home.asp>), WHO
regional offices or on Ministry of health websites in the last 2
weeks. The percent of specimens tested positive for influenza
includes all specimens tested positive for seasonal or pandemic
influenza. The pie charts show the distribution of virus subtypes
among all specimens that were tested positive for influenza. The
available country data were joined in larger geographical areas with
similar influenza transmission patterns to be able to give an
overview (<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/transmission_zones/en>)

Qualitative indicators (Week 29, 2009 to Week 31, 2010: 13 Jul 2009 -
7 Aug 2010)

The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of
influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of
respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on
health-care services.

The maps below display information on the qualitative indicators
reported. Information is available for approximately 60 countries
each week. Implementation of this monitoring system is ongoing and
completeness of reporting is expected to increase over time.

[Readers attention is drawn to the 'Estimates of Deaths Associated
with Seasonal Influenza -- United States, 1976--2007,' published in
MMWR Weekly 27 Aug 2010 / 59(33);1057-1062
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5933a1.htm?s_cid=mm5933a1_w>.

This report summarizes the results of analyses, which found that,
during 1976--2007, estimates of annual influenza-associated deaths
from respiratory and circulatory causes (including pneumonia and
influenza causes) ranged from 3349 in 1986--87 to 48 614 in 2003--04.

The annual rate of influenza-associated death in the United States
overall during this period ranged from 1.4 to 16.7 deaths per 100 000
persons. The wide variation in the estimated number of deaths from
season to season was closely related to the particular influenza
virus types and subtypes in circulation. The new death estimates for
seasonal flu are designed to move away from a single number and
instead take into account the disease's unpredictability. - Mod.CP]
