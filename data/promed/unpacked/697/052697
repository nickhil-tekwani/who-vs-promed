In follow-up to a ProMED posting on 24 Jul 2006 (Archives
20060725.2049 and 20060727.2064), the following is a summary of the
conclusions and recommendations prepared by an independent expert
committee investigating adverse events following immunization (AEFIs)
with the live, attenuated SA 14-14-2 Japanese encephalitis (JE)
vaccine during campaigns held in India's high-risk districts from May
to July 2006. This committee was composed of representatives from
respected national bodies and led by Dr. Jacob John, professor
emeritus of Vellore Medical College. It was convened by the
Government of India immediately following the campaigns to address
any risks associated with administration of the vaccine.
Following an extensive investigation of 504 adverse events reported
through the AEFI system (including 22 deaths) and 29 additional cases
identified through active case-finding, the committee found no link
between the vaccine and the serious illnesses or deaths temporally
associated with immunization. The primary recommendation of the
committee's final report states that "No direct causality has been
established between the reported illnesses and the JE vaccine.
Therefore, no stricture on the further use of the vaccine is
warranted." /1
The committee's findings were recently presented in conjunction with
a summary of the 2006 Indian JE immunization campaigns at key global
health events, including the Global Vaccine Research Forum
<http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/about/gvrf/en> and a meeting of
the World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine
Safety (GACVS). A report from the GACVS meeting will be published in
an upcoming issue of the Weekly Epidemiological Record
<http://www.who.int/wer/en> .
As a result of the expert committee's findings, the Government of
India will move forward with phased immunization against JE in
high-risk districts, using the live, attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine
manufactured by the Chengdu Institute of Biological Products in
China. The next round of campaigns and routine immunization will
start in mid-2007, before the JE season begins in endemic districts.
Further conclusions from the committee's report are summarized below:
- 9.3 million children from 11 districts in 4 states were vaccinated
in 2006 campaigns. Of these beneficiaries, 533 total adverse events
(including 22 deaths) were recorded.
- The most common adverse events (75 percent of reported cases)
involved mild systemic reactions (fever, acute respiratory infection,
vomiting, and/or rash).
- Case investigations and laboratory tests following adverse events
reported during the 2006 campaigns were inadequate, and the committee
recommends strengthening case recording, sample collection, data
analysis, epidemiological investigation, and causality assessment.
- The frequency of 22 deaths among the vaccinated cohort of 9.3
million children aged 1 to 15 years calculates to a rate of 0.00024
percent. By comparison, the probable frequency of death among
children of this age range in the general population is 0.009
percent. /2 Therefore, adverse events following JE vaccination do not
seem to cause excess mortality.
- Seasonal outbreaks of JE and acute encephalopathy in targeted
districts (specifically those in Northern India) may have caused
infection prior to vaccination and resulted in deaths due to
naturally occurring infection rather than infection caused by
vaccination with the live, attenuated virus.
- Consensus statements from several global meetings of the World
Health Organization have identified human vaccination as the only
effective long-term control measure against JE and have recommended
that at-risk populations receive a safe and efficacious vaccine
through the national immunization program. /3
- The Government of India is currently conducting a follow-up study
to evaluate long-term vaccine safety and serious adverse events
occurring up to 12 months following vaccination. During the first 4
weeks following vaccine administration, no serious adverse events
were recorded among the study population. Subjects will be monitored
at several intervals throughout the 12 months following vaccination.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Jacobson for providing us with
an update on the results of the investigations into alleged adverse
reactions following receipt of the JE vaccine during recent campaigns
in India. The original posting in this thread (see references below)
was based on newswires claiming an increase in mortality allegedly
associated with receipt of the JE vaccine. In a follow-up posting,
Dr. Jacobson corrected numerous errors cited in the newswire and
mentioned that there was to be a review of reports of adverse
reactions associated with receipt of the JE vaccine. In that second
posting, the moderator comment stated:
"In the original posting in this thread, we did request further
information on investigations into the alleged reactions associated
with receipt of the vaccine, speculating that it is possible that
some of these cases might in fact be cases of actual Japanese
encephalitis infection, in which children who were vaccinated were
already infected with the JE virus and were in the incubation period
for the disease at the time they received the vaccine."
According to the report of the review committee, there was no
increase in adverse events/deaths following receipt of the JE
vaccine. Of additional import was the finding that the
investigations into reports of adverse events was sub-optimal and
needed improvement. Based on the above information it is clear that
the use of the JE vaccine in India is definitely indicated with the
risk benefit ratio clearly supporting that conclusion. Again our
thanks to Dr. Jacobson for the follow-up information. - Mod.MPP]
