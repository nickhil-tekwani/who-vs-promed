[This outbreak, reportedly, involved one clinical case in a sheep. The additional "cases" (5 sheep, 27 cattle) have, probably, been found seropositive; confirmation will be appreciated.

In August 2006 bluetongue epidemics, caused by BTV serotype 8, broke out suddenly and unexpectedly in Northern Europe -- 1st in the Netherlands and shortly afterwards in Belgium, Germany and the north of France as well as Luxembourg. This serotype had never been reported in Europe before 2006; previously, BTV-8 was identified in Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, Malawi, South African Republic, India and Central America and the Caribbean.

Owing to survival over the winter, the BTV-8 reappeared in the said countries the next year, and spread further into central France, to Great Britain, Switzerland, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Austria and Sweden, reaching Norway at the beginning of 2009. On top of its virulence for sheep, typical for all known BTV serotypes, this BTV-8 strain was found to cause clinical disease in cattle, goats and New World camelids and to be transmitted transplacentally, orally and mechanically. It has virtually disappeared from Europe since 2010.

Following the initial recording of BTV-8 in France in August 2006 on its north-eastern region bordering Belgium, 30 outbreaks were reported to the OIE during the fall of 2006. The epizootic was declared as resolved on 11 Jun 2007 but recurred in July 2007. Between 19 Jul 2007 and 21 May 2008, France reported to the OIE a total of 344 new BTV-8 outbreaks in large and small ruminants. The last follow-up report (No. 34) was submitted on 21 May 2008, informing 5 outbreaks. Since this date the weekly reporting to the OIE was discontinued. A final report was submitted on 9 Nov 2011, including the following comment:

"Up to follow-up report No. 34 of 21 May 2008, 344 outbreaks were reported. Since then, 53 424 new outbreaks were reported in 2008, 2009 and the 1st half of 2010 with 82 810 cases in cattle, 2896 in sheep, 123 in goats and 2 in camels. The last clinical case was reported in December 2009 and the last serological detection was observed at the beginning of June 2010. As part of the active and passive surveillance plans, no further cases have been observed since then and, therefore, since 30 Jun 2010, France has no longer any active outbreaks."

A map showing the locations of the said 344 outbreaks is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=5810.

One of the measures applied within the EU to control the BTV-8 epizootic was emergency vaccination with a killed monovalent vaccine, followed by mandatory general vaccination. This has become voluntary since 2010. It is assumed that no vaccinations against BTV-8 have been applied in the affected holding (and in France?) during recent year(s), but this is in need of confirmation.

Continental France is considered free of any BTV serotype since June 2010 (last viral circulation identified).

In Corsica, 30 outbreaks of BTV-1 have been reported during 2014 and vaccination apparently applied.

For a presentation, dated 4 Dec 2012, addressing BTV-8 and BTV-1 in France, see http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/04122012_bluetongue_france.pdf.

The puzzling issue concerning the current new outbreak in central France is its origin. Up to now, the origin of the European panzootic of 2006-2008 has not been traced. There are several theories explaining its introduction, for instance, shipment of infected biting midges together with animals or plants, import of animals at a viraemic stage of the disease, infected semen or embryos and (least likely) long-distance airborne vector transmission.

Interestingly, another epizootic, caused by a novel/exotic vector-borne animal virus, the Orthobunyavirus coined Schmallenberg virus, started its invasion in Northern Europe, in August 2011, in the same region (Netherlands/Germany/Belgium) where BTV-8 had been detected 5 years earlier. - Mod.AS
