temporary checkpoint into a town, one of many roadblocks to stop
outsiders from entering the villages northwest of the Chinese capital
in Shanjiaying, China on Tue 24 May 2005. Chinese authorities
barred access on Tuesday to villages outside Beijing, where they
reportedly have slaughtered thousands of cows to stop an outbreak
of foot and mouth disease (FMD). Health and agriculture officials
have refused to confirm a report by Hong Kong's South China
Morning Post newspaper that cows have been slaughtered in an
attempt to stop an outbreak of FMD. [see the next item].

China turns blind eye to foot and mouth [disease] allegations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Officials continue to remain tight-lipped over reports of a foot and
mouth disease (FMD) outbreak outside Beijing, as the country takes
precautions to avoid another bird flu pandemic. The Officials at the
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture told the Hong Kong-based South
China Morning Post that they were not aware of any outbreak of the
highly contagious disease, despite reports suggesting the contrary.
Indeed, over 2000 cattle have reportedly been slaughtered in
Yanqing (a district to the northwest of Beijing), and quarantine
conditions have subsequently been put in place.
Despite recent pledges from the Chinese authorities to be more
open in reporting infectious disease outbreaks, the UN's Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) and also Beijing's Office of Animal
Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine have not yet been notified.
In 2003, the country's government was widely criticized for failing to
report the full scale of an outbreak of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), after which it issued an uncharacteristic public
apology.
Earlier this month [May 2005], however, China reported FMD
outbreaks in the northern and eastern provinces of Shangdong and
Jiangsu to the FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE), although officials in the Chinese animal feed industry have
since said that the disease could be active in at least 10 additional
provinces.
Meanwhile, China's heavily controlled media has been forbidden to
broadcast news of the outbreak, widely interpreted as a thinly-veiled
attempt to protect its domestic beef and pork export industries,
estimated to be worth USD 230 million.
The UK's highly publicized FMD outbreak of 2001 saw the
destruction of 4 047 000 cattle and cost the British farming industry
an estimated BP 2.4 billion (USD 4.5 billion) as well as damaging
the meat industry's reputation abroad and adversely affecting export
sales.
The symptoms of FMD, which affects all cloven-hoofed animals
(cattle and swine), can include blister-like legions on the feet,
tongue and udders and, although the disease is not fatal, it can
leave animals severely debilitated and with lowered milk yields.
There are 7 major serotypes (groups of microorganisms that can be
grouped together by the antigens they contain) of the FMD virus
(which is an _apthovirus_ of the family _Picornaviridae_): A, O, C,
Asia 1(the most contagious) [see comment], and Southern African
Territories (SAT) 1, 2 and 3, in addition to over 60 documented
subtypes.
The virus can be transmitted mechanically, attaching itself to truck
tires, clothing and equipment, as well as via aerosol (animal to
animal).

Cattle disease may have prompted return
---------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to offer any immediate
explanation on Monday [23 May 2005] for Deputy Prime Minister Wu
Yi's unexpected return from Tokyo, but the official's sudden
departure from Japan may be related to an outbreak of foot-and-
mouth disease [FMD] at dairy farms within 2 hours' drive of the
Chinese capital.
Observers in Beijing could see no other compelling reason for Wu
Yi's surprise decision to fly back to the mainland just before a
scheduled meeting with Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi.
Wu Yi, whose duties include health issues as well as trade, may
have been called back to deal with the fallout from the spread of the
highly infectious disease. She was instrumental several years ago in
removing the mayor of Beijing and the health minister for their
culpability in hiding the outbreak of SARS.
The lack of information about the outbreak near the capital raised
questions on whether officials had again been hiding information.
10 days ago, a Chinese agricultural official confirmed to an
international animal health organization that FMD had broken out in
Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces. But there was no similar
confirmation of an outbreak near Beijing, although villagers
confirmed the outbreak to a visiting reporter on Monday [23 May
2005] afternoon.
"We did have FMD around here, but it's already been dealt with,"
said Li Suanji, a farmer who runs a store that sells fertilizer and seed
to local farmers in the village of Houluzhuang, just beyond the Great
Wall north of Beijing. Over the past 2 days, Li said, more than 2000
cattle have been destroyed in villages in Yanqing County. He said
there were no cattle left now and that farmers had been offered
compensation by agricultural officials of 3000-6000 yuan, or USD
360-720.
Another farmer working north of the capital, Zheng Chao, said
"We've been isolated for 20 days, and this is the 1st day we've
been allowed out."

[China sent to the OIE its 1st "Immediate notification report" on an
FMD outbreak in the eastern provinces of Shangdong and Jiangsu,
caused by FMDV serotype Asia 1, on 13 May 2005. If other
region(s) are indeed affected, they are not necessarily affected by
the same serotype; and, contrary to the statement in item 2 above
that Asia 1 serotype is "the most contagious" one, other serotypes --
particularly certain strains of the O serotype -- may be even more
infective and invasive, affecting several susceptible species.
The accumulating media-derived rumors about an FMD outbreak in
the vicinity of Beijing illuminate the need for a timely official
intervention, preferably in the form of an update to the OIE regarding
the FMD situation in the People's Republic of China. A weekly
update on outbreak evolution is prescribed in article 1.1.2.3. of
OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code. - Mod.AS]
