Officials have sealed off an isolated town of 10 000 people in rural
west-central China after an outbreak of pneumonic plague killed 2
residents, the state-run Xinhua news service reported on Monday [3 Aug 2009].

An official who answered the emergency line at Renmin Hospital in
Ziketan, where the outbreak is centered, said that all roads into and
out of the area had been closed off, but that residents remained free
to move about within the town. The official, who refused to give his
name, said it was unclear when the blockade would be lifted. Repeated
calls to a plague emergency phone line produced only busy signals.

Ziketan is a remote, ethnically Tibetan town in eastern Qinghai
Province, one of the largest and least populated regions of China.
Officials said the 1st victim, a 32-year-old herdsman, died last
Thursday [30 Jul 2009], and the 2nd, a neighbor who also was a
herdsman, died on Sunday [2 Aug 209], more than a day after being
admitted to a hospital.

Local health officials told Xinhua that they had quarantined 10 other
people, mostly relatives of the dead men, but that none had developed
coughs or fever, signs of the deadly disease.

While bubonic plague is spread by bites from infected rodent fleas,
the deadlier pneumonic plague bacteria are spread through the air by
coughing, and it kills about 6 in 10 sufferers, sometimes within a
day, if it is not treated.

The World Health Organization said that the mortality rate could be
reduced to about 15 percent through treatment with common
antibiotics. A spokeswoman for the agency told Bloomberg News that
experts were monitoring the outbreak but were not especially concerned by it.

[In the initial posting (Plague, pneumonic - China: (QH), RFI
20090801.2702), it was stated that besides the initial death, 11
others were infected. Here, that it not stated but 1 of those appears
to have also succumbed to pneumonic plague.

The following is adapted from reference 1 with the internal citations
changed to begin with 2:

CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters (6.6 ft) as being at
greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried
through air ducts or vents (2). Isolation precautions, such as hand
washing, wearing latex gloves and gowns, and protection of mucous
membranes, should be undertaken for all bubonic plague patients for
48 hours. If no pneumonia is found or there are no draining lesions,
isolation can be discontinued.

Pneumonic plague patients should also be managed under respiratory
droplet precautions, including
- accommodation in an individual room,
- restriction of patient movement outside the room and access to the room, and
- masking of both patient and health-care deliverers.

It is thought that the risk of transmission is ended after the
completion of at least 4 days of therapy (3). The Working Group on
Civilian Biodefense recommended isolation during the 1st 48 hours and
until clinical improvement occurs (4).

Laboratory-acquired plague has been reported and can result in
primary pneumonic plague. Probably initially reported in Wu's 1926
classic monograph on plague (5), the laboratory transmission of
_Yersinia pestis_ appears to be rare. A case report with a review of
4 other cases was published in the USA in 1962 (6). _Y. pestis_ has
been found to maintain some viability for some periods of times (at
least 5 days) on environmental surfaces under controlled conditions
(7). Such an environmental risk for humans is likely to be minimal,
and environmental decontamination is not recommended (4).

A cluster of pneumonic plague in the USA occurred in the early part
of the 20th century in northern California (Fall of 1919) (8).
