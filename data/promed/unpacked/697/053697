We have completed the serological investigation of the above outbreak and
the findings are as follows.
Forty-five paired samples were provided from patients ranging in age from 8
to 19 years, with 57.8% in the 14-16 years age group, 24.4% in 13 years and
below age group and 17.8% in the 17 years and above age group. Fever was
the most common feature, followed by vomiting and bodyache. Some of the
patients reported headache, giddiness, cough, chest pain and
conjunctivitis. In the fatal case, the 15-year-old boy had a one-week
history of fever, malaise and lethargy and was referred to the Queen
Elizabeth Hospital from Beaufort Hospital when he developed a fresh bout of
haemoptysis and poor oxygen saturation. He died several hours after
admission. No post mortem was performed and no samples were available for
investigation. All the patients were from the same area and had bathed
regularly in a river near an oil palm estate and a rubber-processing
factory. The river was swollen by rainfall and flooding during the current
monsoon season.
Routine blood and liver function tests were normal and tests for malaria,
typhoid, scrub typhus, dengue, and hantavirus were not significant. Blood
and urine cultures yielded no growth.
Serological tests revealed that the patients had recent exposures to
melioidosis and leptospirosis. Of the 45 paired samples, 20 showed 4-fold
increase in titres only to _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ in an IgG ELISA
using purified antigen and 5 showed 4-fold increase only to _Leptospira
biflexa_ in a micro-agglutination test. Two paired samples showed 4-fold
increase in titres to both antigens and a number of samples had significant
high titres to either or both antigen.
Interpretation of serological results to these endemic diseases must be
done with due consideration to full clinical signs and symptoms and
epidemiological information in each case.
Footnote:
_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is a saprophyte of certain soils and waters
and is the causative agent of melioidosis in humans and animals in
Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia. Clinical manifestations in
man are varied, ranging from latent, chronic, subacute to the acute
septicemic variety, mimicking almost every known infectious disease. In
endemic countries, serological diagnosis is often hampered by raised
antibody levels in healthy population where subclinical and asymptomatic
infections are common. Severe infection requires early and aggressive
antimicrobial therapy since the mortality rate can exceed 60%. Latency and
chronic infections are a major feature of melioidosis and relapses while on
therapy have been recorded. Recrudescence of infection after an interval of
2-6 years after recovery following prolonged maintenance therapy has been
reported.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of worldwide prevalence caused by a
spirochaete of the genus Leptospira. The natural reservoir is wild rodents
but domestic animals such as dogs, cattle, swine, goats and horses serve as
the major source of human infection. The transmission is often via indirect
contact with soil, water and food contaminated by urine of infected
animals. Leptospires can survive for long periods in stagnant water and wet
soil. The clinical presentation in man includes fever, chill, headache,
conjunctivitis, myalgia and gastrointestinal symptoms. The University
Hospital Kuala Lumpur processes about 100 blood samples annually and about
10-20% are positive using the leptospiral microagglutination test.
