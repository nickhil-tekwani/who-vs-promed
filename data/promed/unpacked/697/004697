It is reported that Ovine Johnes Disease has been found for the first time
in Australian cattle. Researchers at the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural
Institute outside Sydney found OJD in stored cattle tissues from three New
South Wales farms located in the central tablelands where the OJD outbreak
is centred. The three cases occurred between 1989 and 1995. Until now it
was thought that OJD in Australia was confined to sheep and goats, while
Bovine Johnes Disease was found only in cattle, goats and alpacas.
In mid 1996, Australia decided to design a market assurance program for
cattle and sheep to identify herds with a low risk of infection. OJD is not
clinically apparent in the vast majority of infected sheep. It causes
weight loss and some infected sheep die. Evidence from overseas had raised
the possibility of cross-infection. There are strong host preferences for
OJD and BJD but they are not total rhinoceros and antelope are known to
have picked up the cattle strain. There are also accounts of occasional
cross-infection between sheep and cattle in other countries. Because of
this and its implications for OJD management, a study of cross-infection
began in 1996.
The development of the new DNA testing procedure saw the researchers go
back to three Johnes Disease cattle cases that they had been unable to
culture as BJD. Their suspicions were aroused because OJD had been
notoriously difficult to culture in the past. When researchers tested the
tissue with the new DNA system they found the OJD organisms. One theory is
that OJD was contracted by cattle when they were calves and came in contact
with disease-infected sheep.
