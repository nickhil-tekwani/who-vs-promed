A South Korean man died of pneumonia in Can Tho city Monday [5 Nov
2007], local doctors, who suspect he had contracted bird flu, said.

The man was taken to the city General Hospital at 3:00 am Monday [5
Nov 2007] with high fever and breathing problems. He died at 2:00 pm.

The doctors have sent his blood samples to Pasteur Institute in Ho
Chi Minh City to test for the H5N1 strain of bird flu virus, which
has caused 100 infections and 46 deaths in Viet Nam in the last few years.

The man's family said his father in Korea too was suffering from
pneumonia-like symptoms.

[It is not clear from this report how long the Korean man had been in
Viet Nam, in order to get some idea if he, in fact, had avian
influenza and, if so, whether he was infected in Korea or in Viet
Nam. ProMED-mail requests information confirming (or not) avian
influenza virus infection in this case and indicating how long this
individual had been in Viet Nam.
