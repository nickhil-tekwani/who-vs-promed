Tension prevailed at Phaibung Khullen village in Senapati district as cattle continue to die under mysterious circumstances there.

The 1st of such a mysterious death was reported on [30 Sep 2021] and since then 10 cattleheads have died.

The district Veterinary Department had rushed to the spot, enquired about the cattle disease and reportedly vaccinated some cattle that were found off-feed.

Complications such as bloating stomach, swollen neck and off-feed have also been reported among the cattle from the village even today [23 Dec 2021].

The carcasses of the livestock which died mysteriously showed signs of nosebleed and mouth diseases.

The recurrence of such mysterious death of cattle was first reported in the middle week of December [2021].

Reportedly, some cattle also went missing and it couldn't be ascertained whether the livestock are still alive or not.

The villagers have buried the livestock where they died as there are no other means.

Buffaloes are the main source of income for farmers in the region.

The locals of Phaibung Khullen appealed to the authorities concerned to look into the matter and take up appropriate actions at the earliest.

According to the report, a total of 10 "cattleheads" died in the village since 30 Sep 2021, including "recurring" death(s) since mid-December 2021. The significance of such data is not assessable in the absence of the denominator i.e. size of susceptible population, number of farms/holdings (total, affected), and duration of the initial cluster.

No information on clinical signs presented by the animals prior to their deaths has become available. The only clinical information presented relates to the reporter's visit/reporting day (23 Dec 2021): "bloating stomach, swollen neck and off-feed". It is not clear if those animals eventually died. Since vaccination has, reportedly, been applied during the earlier stage of the event in "some cattle that were found off-feed", the identity of that vaccine is requested. In view of "swollen neck" being mentioned, clostridial infections should be included in the differential diagnosis list.

The report refers to a "mysterious" disease in cattle, while stating that buffaloes are the main source of income in the region. Have buffaloes been affected? - Mod.AS
