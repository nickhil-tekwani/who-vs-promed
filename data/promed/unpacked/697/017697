Hackney medics have moved to address a recent outbreak of measles in the borough with a programme of vaccinations which has seen 500 children immunised against the disease.

The programme is seeking to address concerns over low vaccination figures for north-east Hackney, against a background of declining figures for innoculations across the borough generally.

There were 38 confirmed cases of measles in Hackney as at 19 Nov 2018.

Healthwatch Hackney director Jon Williams said: "The local measles outbreak is extremely worrying. We are deeply concerned children in the borough continue to be at risk of this devastating disease because of persistently low immunisation rates. We are confident that the local health system is working flat out to get people vaccinated. City and Hackney needs funds to develop a bespoke programme to tackle poor uptake in our communities and effectively protect local children. Vaccination works and is safe. Meanwhile we urge parents to contact their GP for advice if you think your child is unvaccinated."

An NHS England report blamed a low uptake in London generally on a variety of factors, including the city's increasing birth rate and high population mobility, inconsistent patient reminder systems, and increasingly competing priorities for GPs.

So-called herd immunity is achieved at a vaccination uptake rate of 95 per cent. However, in Hackney uptake for the infants is considerably lower than the rest of London at 75.6 per cent for 2017-18 compared to 89.2 per cent for London, with a higher rate for 2-year-olds, indicating a pattern of late vaccinations, according to the report.

Figures for the north-east of the borough are particularly low, with Stamford Hill Group Practice, Spring Hill Practice and Cranwich Road Surgery performance rates under 60 per cent for giving the MMR vaccine for 2-year-olds.

A City and Hackney clinical commissioning group spokesperson said: "Previous vaccination figures for north-east Hackney are being addressed with an effective immunisation programme which has seen over 500 children being vaccinated in the last 3 weeks. City and Hackney CCG have funded a local outbreak response. We are continuing to work with NHSE to look at how this can be supported now and in the future."

Fourteen new measles cases have been registered around Warsaw over the last week, public broadcaster Polish Radio's IAR news agency reported on Fri [23 Nov 2018].

Meanwhile, Poland's health inspectorate said that measles infections were on the rise in Poland with 79 cases reported in the Mazowvian voivodship alone, since 10 Oct 2018.

Measles can cause deadly complications, especially in children under 5 and adults over 20.

The health inspectorate has urged people to vaccinate children against measles, mumps and rubella, adding that the growing rate of measles infection is concerning, considering that Poland's measles vaccination is very effective.

Italian health ministers declared a measles emergency and plan to vaccinate 800 000 children as well as healthcare workers.

Italy's Health Ministry has announced a measles prevention plan that would keep obligatory vaccinations in place for 0-16 year-olds, as well as aiming to vaccinate people aged up to 30-35.

Vaccines will be offered in schools and universities as well as sports clubs, and ministers are discussing possible incentives for young people who choose to be vaccinated.

The announcement comes after a spike in the number of measles cases in Italy including several outbreaks around the country this year [2018].

This week, 8 cases of measles were reported at the Giovanni XXIII pediatric hospital in Bari, reportedly affecting a 10 year-old-girl, her sister and 2 cousins, none of whom had been vaccinated, and several other patients, including an 11-month-old boy, who was too young to be vaccinated.

"There is a measles emergency," said Vittorio Demicheli, vaccines consultant to the Ministry of Health, "and it is in the age group [under 16s] that the next national plan for the elimination of the disease will dedicate particular attention to."

"The vaccination obligation will be kept so that coverage remains good, in the new generations," he said.

It's also necessary to offer vaccines to adolescents and susceptible young adults; otherwise it will take many years to interrupt the chain of infections," said Demicheli. "Recent outbreaks have affected people with a median age of 25 years, while the outbreak in the north last year [2017] hit mainly 27-year-olds."

Health workers will also be pressed to get vaccinated amid fears that they are putting patients' health at risk.

No new laws will be needed, said Demichelli, because "the tools already exist."

He pointed out that the Marche region had already banned unvaccinated adults from working in nurseries or paediatric hospitals.

Of 100 health workers who contracted the measles virus in Italy last year [2017], 83 had not been vaccinated, Massimo Galli, Professor at Simit, the Italian Institute for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, told The Local Italy.

"It is, therefore, absolutely unacceptable that a healthcare provider is not protected and consequently does not protect their patients, preventing the spread of infection," he said.

Doctors in Puglia said some 91-92 percent of people in the region are vaccinated and that a population coverage of 95 percent was needed for public health protection, a number which takes into consideration those who couldn't be vaccinated for physical and congenital reasons. They appealed to families to "inform themselves correctly" about vaccines.

There has been confusion among parents as to whether or not vaccinations were required for children starting school this year [2018] after a series of amendments and U-turns by the government.

The current coalition government between the Five Star Movement and the League had promised to drop a law adopted by the previous government that banned children from starting pre-school unless they had received jabs against 10 diseases, including measles, tetanus and polio.

In September 2018, the governing Five Star Movement (M5S) presented parliament with an amendment that effectively halts its own reform and reinstates the previous vaccination requirements.

There's a large and growing anti-vaccine movement in Italy, and a lower number of vaccinations is thought to be one of the factors behind an increase in measles cases.

Last year [2017], Italy accounted for nearly a quarter of all measles cases in Europe, according to the World Health Organization.

Italy was one of the countries where now-discredited claims of a link between the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination and autism had a significant impact on public perceptions of the safety of the jab. And the Five Star Movement has also been heavily criticized for its role in raising doubts over the effectiveness of vaccinations.

While both Five Star head Luigi Di Maio and League leader Matteo Salvini say they are in favour of vaccines and have vaccinated their own children, they call the current law "coercive" and criticise it for restricting children's access to education.

The New Jersey Department of Health has identified 3 more places where visitors could have come in contact with measles.

It said a "a highly suspect case of measles" associated with the ongoing Ocean County outbreak may have exposed individuals in Passaic County. A Passaic County resident could have exposed others to the infection while in Passaic County between 17-18 Nov 2018.

In addition, officials have confirmed a 15th case of measles in Ocean County, though there are no known public exposures connected to that person.

Authorities say anyone who visited locations [listed at the URL above] may have been exposed to measles.

https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/israel-news/1626846/measles-hits-kiryas-joel-the-first-case-confirmed-on-monday-night.html


A 1st case of measles has been confirmed in Kiryas Joel, New York, with 75 cases in the county and another 11 suspected cases.

Sources have confirmed to YWN that the case was confirmed on Mon [19 Nov 2018] night.

The child was examined by a doctor a few days ago, and authorities are attempting to reach those patients who were at the same doctor at that time.

The Orange County Health Department is aware of the case and is working with local authorities to prevent further spread of the illness.

In nearby Rockland County, health officials say there is no change in the number of confirmed cases. There are still 75 cases within the county; however, there are now 11 suspected cases that the Rockland County Department of Health is continuing to investigate.

Along with Refuah Health Center in Spring Valley and private physicians, health-care providers have administered more than 6100 MMR vaccines since the start of the outbreak.

Rockland Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert has also ordered that non-immunized children stay home from schools in New Square and from schools that have less than an 80 percent vaccination rate. This affects 34 private schools in the county. Health officials are doing daily checks of the schools to ensure compliance.

Students will be allowed to return 21 days after the last case of measles is documented.

In Lakewood (Ocean County) NJ, there are 14 confirmed cases, and at least 13 suspected cases are being investigated.

The Ocean County Health Department tells YWN that they continue to support and highly encourage the exclusion of non-vaccinated children from schools, preschools and daycares in the outbreak area. These entities have the authority to make that decision when an outbreak has been declared by the New Jersey Department of Health. The age range so far for the current outbreak is 6 months-27 years old.

In Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community, health officials put the outbreak total at 24 since the 1st case in October 2018.

Many Rabbonim around the globe have spoken out against the anti-vaxxers, with some Rabbonim saying that those who don't vaccinate their children are murderers.

The number of cases of measles continues to rise in Rockland County. As of Tue [21 Nov 2018], there are 76 confirmed cases of measles within the county, along with 8 suspected cases that the Rockland County Department of Health continues to investigate, according to a county spokesman.

On Mon [20 Nov 2018], there were 75 confirmed cases and 11 that were suspected.

Authorities said the entire county should be considered at risk. Even people previously considered immune -- that is, anyone born before 1957 or anyone who has received 2 doses of measles vaccine -- could catch the highly contagious disease.

Health officials continue tightened restrictions on schools in the geographic area where the outbreak is concentrated.

All schools in New Square and any school in Spring Valley or Monsey where the immunization rate is lower than 80 percent must keep under-vaccinated or unvaccinated students at home.

The restrictions, which affect 34 schools, will apply until 21 days after the last measles case is confirmed in the county, and officials acknowledge that that could be months away.

The county also wants children to be vaccinated earlier than usual. Instead of waiting till 12 months, any child 6 months or older or any adult who has not received their 1st MMR vaccine yet should get their 1st MMR vaccine now.

A measles outbreak in Colombia has prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue a travel notice last week.

Between March and October this year [2018], Colombia has reported 129 confirmed measles cases.

Of the 129 confirmed cases, 45 were imported, 75 were import-related (25 cases of secondary transmission among persons coming from Venezuela and 50 related to imported cases among Colombians), and 9 with the source under investigation. No deaths have been reported.

The cases were reported in the departments of Antioquia, Arauca, Atlantico, Bolivar, Cauca, Cesar, La Guajira, Magdalena, Norte de Santander, Risaralda, Sucre, and in the districts of Barranquilla, Bogota, Cartagena, and Santa Marta.

Cartagena District and Norte de Santander Department account for 65 percent of the total confirmed cases.

CDC says travelers to Colombia should make sure they are vaccinated against measles with the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.

Measles has infected 2280 people and killed 18 in the mainly Muslim border provinces in the South this year [2018].

The largest group affected were young children up to the age of 4. "Measles vaccination is free and is in line with Islamic principles," Songkhla's public-health chief Utissak Harirattanakul said yesterday [21 Nov 2018], as he tried to encourage Muslim parents to get their children vaccinated against the highly communicable disease.

In a move to downplay locals' concerns the vaccine may be haram (forbidden in Islam), Utissak said both the Sheikhul Islam Office and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation's legal team had approved the measles vaccine.

In Songkhla, one of the 4 southern border provinces, measles has hit 203 patients and killed one. Earlier this week, Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre's deputy secretary-general Somkiat Phonprayoon told relevant officials to go on a door-to-door campaign in the deep South to vaccinate children against measles. He said efforts must cover schools, as all children below the age of 12 must be vaccinated.

Somkiat said officials must explain to community and religious leaders the necessity for locals to have the right understanding of the vaccine. Yala's public-health chief Songkran Maichum said the number of measles infections in his province has already dropped due to serious campaigning. "We have vaccinated up to 94 per cent of local children so far and hope to bring the number up to 95 per cent soon," he said.

A 30-year-old Southland woman has been struck with measles.

The woman, a resident of Milford Sound, tested positive for the highly-contagious and potentially deadly virus on Tue 20 Nov 2018. She did not require hospital treatment.

It is the 1st confirmed case of measles in New Zealand since May 2018.

Southern medical officer of health Dr Susan Jack said it was not known whether the woman was immunised against measles.

Three people were confirmed to have measles in Christchurch and Otago.

Public Health South was working to identify all of the woman's close contacts to determine their immunisation status and offer vaccination.

Earlier this year [2018], there was a measles outbreak across the South Island. Five people, including a baby, contracted the virus. Two were hospitalised.
