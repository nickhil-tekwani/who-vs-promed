Virus Found in Bird Far From NYC
-----------------------------------------
The encephalitis virus that has killed 6 people and infected 55 others in
the New York City area has been found in a dead bird 150 miles north of
Manhattan.
State Health Department officials, however, said Friday the risk of upstate
residents contracting the West Nile-like virus is minimal. No human
encephalitis cases have been reported upstate.
The virus, which is carried by mosquitos, was found in a dead crow collected
earlier this month in the Saratoga County village of Ballston Spa and in a
cuckoo found at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, 40 miles north of
Manhattan. Officials urged upstate residents to take precautions against
mosquito bites until freezing weather further decimates their population.
Finding birds with the virus upstate doesn't mean the encephalitis outbreak
is spreading broadly, said health department spokesman John Signor. The
birds may have become disoriented because of the virus and flown north
instead of south, he said.

[Crows donÂ´t migrate. More likely the virus has been widespread in birds
all over the Northeast USA for weeks, but their deaths were not noticed.
However, mosquito populations are already declining in the region and
therefore virus transmission will cease with the first frosts - Mod.JW
