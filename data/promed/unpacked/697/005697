Swine fever has been discovered in the Starominsk district of Kuban. The
deaths among pigs [began on] 17 Feb 2007, in one of the farms, "Niva
Kubani". The number of dead swine has been increasing daily, reaching 896
on 26 Feb 2007. [For official figures as of 21 Feb 2007, see commentary. -
Mod.AS]
It was concluded that the [deaths were caused] by classical swine fever
(CSF). After [new cases] of the disease [stopped] occurring, 100 further
pigs were slaughtered and the farm was closed for quarantine purposes.
"The disease is not dangerous for people; humans can not get infected by
the virus -- neither from infected animals, nor from their meat", said one
of the officials from the veterinary department.
According to Inna Pobirskaya, head of the veterinary center of the
anti-epizootic department in the Starominsk district, the animals on the
affected farm had been vaccinated against CSF. But the type of virus that
affected the animals was rare and different from the available vaccines'
strain. According to Pobirskaya, this type of virus had been previously
recorded only in Podmoskovye. She said, "we could obtain the virus from
private farm owners, that do not register their animals officially and thus
do not vaccinate them".
The market inspection authorities have said that they are not going to
intensify the control upon meat sold in the market, because control
[measures are] already [quite] strict.

[According to Russian agriculture and veterinary surveillance, CSF is
registered annually in Russia's territory. Usually it occurs in those farms
where animals are not vaccinated or where preventive measures are
deficient. A representative of the regional veterinary surveillance center
was cited as saying that "one of the causes of the outbreak in that
particular farm, was weakened immune system of the swine and the presence
of waste 3 km from the farm" (<http://www.yuga.ru/news/91092/index.html>).

The outbreak was notified by the Russian authorities to the Office
International des Epizooties (World Organization for Animal Health) on 22
Feb 2007; see the report, including map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4901>.

According to the data, the number of susceptible animals was 6192, with 870
cases (apparent morbidity rate 14 per cent) and 351 deaths (apparent
mortality rate 6 per cent, apparent case fatality rate 40 per cent). From
the newswire above, it is apparent that significant additional mortality
took place after the report's date.
According to the official report, the previous outbreak of CSF in Russia
occurred on 17 Jan 2005. - Mod.AS]
