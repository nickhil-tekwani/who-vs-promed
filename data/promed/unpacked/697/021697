From: Bruce Akey <bakey@vdacs.state.va.us>

At a recent briefing of the USAHA's Government Relations Committee in
Washington, D.C., we were given a brief synopsis of the development of this
new test for scrapie. The test was developed at the USDA Agricultural
Research Service's lab in Pullman Washington by Dr. K. I. O'Rourke and
colleagues.
It is based on biopsy of the lymphoid tissue in the 3rd eyelid of sheep and
detection of abnormal prion material using immunohistochemistry techniques.
It looks very promising, picks up scrapie infected animals about 1 year
prior to the onset of clinical signs. There was no mention made of any
trials yet on bovines. We were given the following reference for an
up-coming publication on the new test:
O'Rourke, K. I., Baszler, T. V.,Parish, S. M., and Knowles, D.P. Preclinical
detection of PrP-Scrapie in nictitating membrane lymphoid tissue of sheep.
Veterinary Record, in press.

[I presume that there is some data somewhere, possibly in O'Rouke's paper,
on the sensitivity & specificity of this new test? And in relation to the
onset of overt clinical signs? - Mod.MHJ
