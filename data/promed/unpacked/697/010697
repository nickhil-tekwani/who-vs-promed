This island with a very poor population of 1.5 million, of which 70% are
Catholics, never had any rabies in the past. In the fall of 1997, fishermen
imported several dogs to East Flores from Surawesi. Outbreak investigation
by officers of the Indonesian livestock division and health departments
later learned that one of these dogs became rabid after arrival in Flores.
Within the early part of 1998, some 10 humans died of rabies in the East
Flores district and many dogs developed rabies. Flores had then about 800
000 dogs. Almost all were owned animals but not restricted in movements and
there were approximately 3-4 per household. Dogs are valued domestic
animals used as watchdogs and for food, a traditional meal for festive
occasions (weddings, christenings, funerals etc). Faced with an emergency
for which they neither had the money, experience or material needs
(vaccines, trained vaccinators etc.), the local government decided first to
exterminate as many dogs as possible in East Flores district. This was done
after extensive consultation with community and religious leaders. A dog
[slaughter then commenced, but not before some dogs were exported to the
next western district and sold on the market. Thus the epidemic spread west
all the way across the island. Nearly 90 people died horrible rabies deaths
between 1988 - 2000, even though new cases decreased rapidly as the dog
elimination continued across the island, involving as many as 500 000 dogs.
The next phase now is to vaccinate the rest of the dogs and any new
arrivals. This observer believes that the rapid decision to drastically
reduce the dog population saved possibly hundreds of human lives and that
it now may well be possible to make Flores again rabies free.

[While the depopulation of dogs is highly regretted, limitation of
resources often require difficult choices. It appears there was
considerable input from community leaders and a close examination of
potentially available resources before rabies control policies were chosen.
Let's hope East Flores can achieve good rabies control and prevent further
human and animal deaths. - Mod.PC
