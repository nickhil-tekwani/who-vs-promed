A baby in California has died after contracting whooping cough, officials said, marking the 1st such death in Orange county in more than a decade. A news release posted on [Thu 18 Apr 2019] by the county's health officials did not identify the child or list the baby's age. "We are deeply saddened by this loss of life and send our condolences to the family," Dr Nichole Quick, interim county health officer, said in the news release.

The health department counted 171 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, in 2018, including 8 cases involving infants under 3 months. 7 of those children required hospitalization. The illness is a very contagious disease that spreads through coughing or sneezing, but it can take up to 3 weeks for symptoms to appear. Late-stage symptoms may include rapid coughing followed by a high-pitched "whoop" sound, vomiting and exhaustion.

"The best way to prevent pertussis is to be up-to-date on vaccinations," Quick said. "Children should receive 5 doses of DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis)] as part of their routine vaccination schedule starting at 2 months of age. Pregnant women during each pregnancy, regardless of when their previous pregnancy occurred, are strongly recommended to receive Tdap vaccine during their 3rd trimester. Vaccination during this time stimulates production of maternal antibodies that are passed on to the infant, offering protection to the baby against pertussis during the first few months of life."

6 students and 1 staff member were sent home from Glenwood Elementary School with whooping cough. The school notified all parents of the outbreak. Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools [Orange, Chatham, and Durham counties] spokesman Jeff Nash said the district took extra care to inform parents whose children had been in close contact with sick students or staff.

Nash said whooping cough will pop up around the district every few years. Last year [2018], The Herald Sun reported that whooping cough affected a group of high school students at Chapel Hill High and East Chapel Hill High.

With recently increased cases of pertussis, also known as "whooping cough," concentrated in Campbell county, the Wyoming Department of Health [WDH] is encouraging awareness of the disease locally and across the state, as well as promoting vaccination.

According to the WDH, 5 Campbell county pertussis cases have been reported to agency over the past week. This is compared to one case in all of 2018 and 0 in 2017.

Officials say that there have been 13 reported cases statewide so far this year [2019]. Actual case numbers are likely higher because many illnesses are not recognized as pertussis and others may not be reported.

"Increased pertussis activity is something we watch closely because it can be so tough on infants," said Clay Van Houten, infectious disease epidemiology unit manager with WDH. "Campbell county is of specific concern right now. We've seen several cases there recently and continue to investigate more suspected cases."

Local health officials report there are now 125 confirmed pertussis cases in the Missoula area. Cases are being reported across all ages and due to the duration of the outbreak, it is possible for people who were exposed earlier in the outbreak to be re-exposed.

The Missoula City-County Health Department is continuing to work closely with schools to identify close contacts of confirmed cases. Confirmed whooping cough cases have been reported in approximately 20 schools -- including in the Florence and Frenchtown school districts.

If you are experiencing symptoms of pertussis, see your provider right away. If you or a family member has been identified as exposed, you will receive instructions from the Health Department. The best way to protect against pertussis is by getting vaccinated. Make sure that you and your family are up to date on your immunizations. If you need information on your immunization status, contact your provider or the Health Department.

Need to get vaccinated? The Missoula City-County Health Department, located at 301 West Alder St., carries the pertussis vaccine (DTaP & Tdap) and can bill most insurance plans, including Medicaid. They offer a sliding fee scale for those who are uninsured or underinsured. Call the Immunization Clinic at 406-258-3363 for more information. The clinic offers walk-in hours at the following times: 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.

If you have not been contacted by the Health Department, no action is needed at this point.

If you have additional questions, please contact (406) 258-INFO.

Some students at Western Washington University are worried about more than finals right now as 6 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have been reported on campus over the last 2 months.

Each person was vaccinated, and an email was sent out last month [April 2019] warning students of the bacterial infection. On [Mon 20 May 2019], however, another email confirming more cases over the last 2 months.

These students are hoping if they do end up getting sick, the professors will be understanding and lenient during finals week.

In 2018, 51 cases of whooping cough were reported. There have been 23 so far this year [2019], and we aren't even halfway through the year, according to the Whatcom County Health Department.
