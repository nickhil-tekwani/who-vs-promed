The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a reward for information that leads to the arrest or charges against the person responsible for poisoning deaths of wildlife and several dogs since December 2018.

At least 4 dogs have died from eating poisoned meat in 3 northern Wisconsin counties -- Bayfield, Marinette and Florence -- according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR). It's unknown whether other counties could be involved. Investigators found dead coyotes, raccoons, weasels and one wolf they suspect were poisoned.

The poison was found on the ground on public properties managed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Goodman Timber Co. Each dog died less than 30 minutes after ingesting the poisoned meat, according to the DNR.

In all 4 cases involving the deaths of the dogs, the DNR found poisoned meat in a road ditch, according to the DNR.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working with the DNR and the U.S. Forest Service to find whoever is responsible for the poisonings. The Fish and Wildlife service will give up to USD 1000 to anyone who provides information that will lead to the arrest or charging of the person responsible, according to a Fish and Wildlife Service news release.

Anyone with information about the wildlife and dog deaths can contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement in Madison at 608-221-1206.

[While there are almost no clues in this article as to what the toxic agent in the meat may have been, there is a picture on the original website which may be a clue. The photo seems to have a slight greenish cast. Admittedly, it may be the photo and not real, but if it is green, it may be strychnine. Strychnine often has a greenish cast and is mixed with some grains to be used as gopher bait. This toxin is available in some areas and can be used for inappropriate killing of domestic and wild animals.

Strychnine produces a painful death. A dog ingesting strychnine presents with no vomiting or diarrhea. The initial clinical signs are a restless, anxious dog, described as "walking on egg shells" with increased respirations, not quite panting. This progresses to constant panting and muscle tremors. Finally, tetanic seizures or convulsions occur spontaneously or with touch, light, or noise stimuli. The limbs extend, the head is curved upwards and backward, and the lips are pulled back in what has been termed a sardonic grin.

The severity and duration of convulsions are not prognostic. Death is generally from asphyxia due to prolonged paralysis of the respiratory muscles. When the dog is in seizures, the muscles of the diaphragm are paralyzed, and the dog cannot breathe. Death may be as sudden as 5 to 10 minutes or as long as 2 hours.

Animals poisoned with strychnine can be successfully treated. If the animal was seen ingesting a known bait and is not showing signs, the veterinarian should induce emesis (vomiting).

Animals showing clinical signs should have the convulsions controlled and respiratory support initiated. Pentobarbital sodium is the drug of choice, administered to effect. (Phenobarbital is not as effective due to the long period of time before it takes effect.)

It may be necessary to perform gastric lavage to decrease adsorption of any strychnine remaining in the stomach. The veterinarian should then administer activated charcoal. The charcoal should be removed from the stomach by sedating the animal and flushing the stomach or by administration of a saline cathartic. Forced diuresis with acidification of the urine is appropriate.

An anesthetic machine may be utilized to support respiration for an extended period of time; however, this removes it from use in surgeries. A respirator is better, if available. Use of central acting skeletal muscle relaxants such as glyceryl guaiacolate and/or methocarbamol are recommended but require frequent redosing. The animal will need to have its temperature maintained by use of blankets and placed in a dark, quiet room. Turn the animal periodically to prevent hypostatic congestion. The continued administration of activated charcoal may prevent the convulsions, which re-occur 1-3 days after apparent recovery.

Strychnine is an ugly way for an animal to die, but these animals can be saved by proper and timely assistance.

Anticoagulant rat-exterminating poisonings can also be successfully treated with prolonged administration of vitamin K under veterinarian care and recommendations. - Mod.TG
