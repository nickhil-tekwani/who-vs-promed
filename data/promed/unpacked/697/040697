Health officials have identified dinner rolls as the food that likely sickened Old Country Buffet diners in Maple Grove earlier in 2014.

The rolls were likely cross-contaminated with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis from raw chicken used in the restaurant, Minnesota Department of Health spokesman Doug Schultz said. The health agency's joint investigation with Hennepin County found 36 people who were likely sickened by the bacterium after eating at the restaurant between 11 Jan 2014 and 11 Feb 2014. Most of the diners who fell ill ate there on 25 Jan 2014. At least one person was hospitalized.

"Most outbreaks are preventable. They occur because a food worker came in ill, or because of cross-contamination. ... It's just a question of what steps should have been taken," Schultz said. "Contamination doesn't just happen."

South Carolina-based parent company Ovation Brands (formerly Eagan-based Buffets Inc.) could not be reached for comment. After the outbreak became known, the company said it retrained the entire Maple Grove staff and stepped up food safety inspections.

A final report will be issued as soon as next week.
