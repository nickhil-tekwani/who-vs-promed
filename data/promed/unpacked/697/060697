Outbreaks 57 -- 67
------------------
Further to the 56 FMD outbreaks reported until 9 May 2010 since the
start of the epizootic [see posting 20100509.1520], 11 additional
infected farms, sampled on Sun 9 May 2010, have been tested PCR
positive on Mon 10 May 2010. All of them are situated in Kawaminami.
Of the infected farms, 8 are cattle holdings including a total of
1084 head and 3 are pig farms with 11 514 animals. This brings the
total number of infected farms as of 10 May 2010 to 67 and of animals
to 76 852, of which 71 121 are pigs.

[The sender added a footnote saying that according to Japanese news
reports, half of all pigs in Kawaminami town have already been or are
being culled.

According to Japan's notification to the OIE, dated 20 Apr 2010,
export international veterinary certificates for ruminants and
products derived from them have been suspended since 20 Apr 2010.
However, according to a news item of 11 May 2010, published by CADMS,
a University of California BioPortal (at
<http://fmd.ucdavis.edu/news.php>), Japan's farm ministry said late
Mon 10 May 2010, that Japan has resumed pork exports to Hong Kong. It
may be assumed that this does not relate to the affected Miyazaki
Prefecture, but clarification will help. Japan is the world's biggest
pork importer. - Mod.AS]
