Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Agona infections linked to internationally distributed infant formula - France
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [Sat 2 Dec 2017], an increase of cases infected with the _Salmonella_ Agona strain was identified by health authorities in France in young children aged under 6 months. Subsequent investigations identified an outbreak of _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Agona associated with infant formula products manufactured by the Lactalis Nutrition Sante group in France.

As of [Thu 21 Dec 2017], 35 confirmed cases of _S._ Agona infections among infants aged less than 6 months have been identified in different regions of France. Up to 16 infants have been hospitalized but all have fully recovered and no deaths have been reported.

The outbreak was associated with consumption of 4 different brands of infant formula, including products designed for infants with special medical needs. On [Sun 10 Dec 2017], Lactalis Nutrition Sante withdrew and recalled over 600 batches (more than 7000 tons) of implicated products that were manufactured from [Wed 15 Feb 2017] to present. The implicated infant formula products have been distributed internationally to more than 50 countries and territories.

On [Thu 21 Dec 2017], Lactalis Group has conducted a new recall including all infant and nutritional products manufactured or packaged in the Craon plant since [Wed 15 Feb 2017]. Efforts to trace the distribution of products included in this expanded recall are underway and will be communicated to affected countries through INFOSAN as they are identified.

Public health response
----------------------
French authorities ordered the suspension of marketing and exports and the recall of several infant formula products manufactured by the Lactalis Nutrition Sante group since [Wed 15 Feb 2017]. On [Sat 9 Dec 2017], health authorities issued 3 alerts to pharmacists and health facilities in France to stop delivering the products concerned.

As of [Fri 15 Dec 2017], the recalled infant formula products have been exported to the following 48 countries (including France) and territories: Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, China, Congo, Cyprus, Cote d'Ivoire, France, Gabon, Georgia, Greece, Guinea, Haiti, Hong Kong SAR (China), Iraq, Kosovo, Kuwait, Lebanon, Madagascar, Mali, Monaco, Morocco, Netherlands, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Seychelles, Slovenia, Spain, Sudan, Switzerland, Taiwan (China), Togo, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Yemen, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The products have also been distributed in the French overseas territories and departments.

Working closely with the International Network of Food Safety Authorities (INFOSAN) Emergency Contact Point in France, the INFOSAN Secretariat has informed the INFOSAN Emergency Contact Points (and National IHR Focal Points) in the recipient countries outside of the European Union (EU) of the relevant distribution details to facilitate their investigations, recalls and risk management measures. Countries within the EU have been informed directly through the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Affected products present a risk for serious illness in infants (a susceptible at-risk group for serious disease and complications) that consume the product. Investigations are ongoing by French authorities to identify the outbreak's source. Similar outbreaks have happened previously, despite stringent control measures being in place. Past outbreaks have been related to other manufacturers and multiple geographical locations.

Powdered infant formulas are not sterile products. Salmonella is prevalent in raw ingredients and can survive under harsh, dry conditions for lengthy periods of time. Preparing formula with tepid water can allow for rapid growth/multiplication of the initial low level Salmonella contamination, which may, in turn, cause serious illness and outbreaks among infants.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on France based on the current information available on this event.

If children who have consumed these products exhibit symptoms, such as diarrhoea with or without fever, parents are recommended to contact a doctor as soon as possible. Detected cases of _S._ Agona should then be reported to national health authorities.

Consumers are advised to follow the FAO/WHO guidelines for the safe preparation, storage and handling of powdered infant formula, available online.

In case substitution of some of the affected formula is not available, the French authorities have recommended to heat the prepared formula for 2 minutes at 70 degrees C [158 F] and let it cool down to 37 degrees C [98.6 F] before serving it to infants. This would also inactivate _Salmonella_ bacteria. This could be used as an interim practical solution until an appropriate replacement has been identified.

[The size of the recall and scope of the distribution of the infant formulas is quite impressive. Hopefully, only a small amount of the material is indeed contaminated and the cases will be minimal worldwide.
