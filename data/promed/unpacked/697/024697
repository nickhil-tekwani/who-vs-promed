Since 19 Aug 2005, 23 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)
have been registered in the Republic of Tatarstan. According to the press-
service of the Territorial Department of the Federal Health and Welfare
Service, a precise diagnosis has not yet been confirmed in all cases.
One case occurred in the District of Naberezhnye Chelny, one in Zelenodolsk, 2
in Rybnoslobodsky, 2 in Kukmorsky, 3 each in Sabinsky and Alkeeevsky, 4 in
Nizhnekamsk, and 7 in Bavlinsky. One of those infected in the Bavlinsky
District has died.

[The Republic of Tatarstan is located in the European part of Russia, where
the rivers Volga and Kama converge. The total area of the Republic is 67 836
sq.km. Tatarstan borders 8 administrative regions of Russia: the Republics of
Bashkortostan, Udmurtiya, Mary El, and Chuvash, and the Regions of Kirov,
Orenburg, Ulyanovsk and Samara. - Corresp.NP].
[HFRS is endemic in the region. It is caused by one or more species of
hantavirus, which have rodent reservoirs. I quote ProMED moderator-emeritus
Charlie Calisher from the archive listed below under 2000: [...Puumala
virus is the etiologic agent of what is known in Scandinavia and elsewhere
as Nephropathia Epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS). The usual vertebrate host of Puumala virus is the bank
vole, _Clethrionomys glareolus_. 52 different species of mammals have been
shown to serve as hosts of hantaviruses in Russia (EA Tkachenko et al.
[1998] HFRS in Eurasia: Russia and the republics of the former USSR, in HW
Lee, C Calisher, C Schmaljohn [eds.] Manual of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Asan Inst. for Life Sciences,
Seoul, Republic of Korea, pp:49-57). Three of these belong to the genus
_Clethrionomys_: _glareolus_ (bank vole), _rufocanus_ (gray-sided vole),
and _rutilus_ (ruddy vole or Northern red-backed vole)... If someone in the
epidemic area of Tatarstan can provide [more specific] data, we would be
appreciative. - Mod. CHC." - Mod.JW]
[Further information would be appreciated regarding the nature of this
continuing outbreak and the final diagnoses of the patients with still-
unconfirmed diagnoses. - Mod.CP]
