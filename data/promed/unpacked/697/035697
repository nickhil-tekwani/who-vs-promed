The number of reported cases of scarlet fever across the South West [region of England] has risen by more than 50 per cent in the last week.

A total of 20 cases were reported across the region, up from 13 in the previous week. The increase comes amid a worrying rise in reported cases of the bacterial infection, with the number of people in the UK contracting the illness at a 50 year high.

In Somerset [county], 3 people have been diagnosed with scarlet fever in the past week: 1 in South Somerset and 2 in the Sedgemoor district. This is an increase from 2 in the previous week. The information was released in Public Health England [PHE]'s weekly Statutory Notifications of Infectious Diseases report, published on [15 Nov 2016].

Scarlet fever is treated with antibiotics owing to the potential for complications and more severe illness caused by its group A strep bacteria. Early signs to look out for are a sore throat, headache, and fever with a pinkish/red sandpapery rash appearing within a day or 2. The rash usually first appears on the chest and stomach before spreading to other parts of the body. Scarlet fever is highly contagious and children aged 2 to 8 are most at risk. At present there is no vaccine for scarlet fever.

Dr Theresa Lamagni, PHE's head of streptococcal infection surveillance, said: "Individuals who think they or their child may have scarlet fever should seek advice from their GP without delay as prompt antibiotic treatment is needed." Parents can play a key role in recognising when their child needs to be seen by their GP. Scarlet fever is spread through close contact with infected people or indirect contact with objects and surfaces contaminated with the bacteria. Dr Lamagni added that parents should keep an eye out for signs of scarlet fever.
