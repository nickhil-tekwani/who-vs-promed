Aravinda de Silva writes:
Southern Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a severe drought. Physicians
in the region are reporting an outbreak of a febrile disease which they
suspect to be endemic typhus. Can anyone provide more information on the
agent and vectors of typhus in the Indian subcontinent? Also, are typhus
outbreaks associated with severe drought? The following report from the 26
Aug 2001 Sunday Observer describes the outbreak:
Eighty-three cases of suspected typhus fever have been identified in the
Hambantota district. Almost all the victims are children from agricultural
areas such as Beragama, Dehigahalanda, Weerawila, and Bundala.
Consultant pediatrician of the Hambantota Base Hospital, Dr Ajith
Amarasingha, disclosed that this type of typhus was not very well described
in Sri Lanka and it was called endemic typhus. It is an illness in the form
of fever, which lasts for about 2 to 3 weeks, and affects children
primarily. The characteristic features are fever and a skin rash. "The
disease is spread by domestic rat fleas. The flea [transmits] an organism
called _Rickettsia mooseri_ or _Rickettsia typhi_. When these fleas bite
the children, they get the infection," the doctor said. Dr Amarasingha said
that the hospital lacked adequate laboratory facilities to diagnose this
disease, but on clinical suspicion, they were able to diagnose 83 cases of
suspected typhus fever. "All suspected cases of typhus fever respond very
rapidly to chloramphenicol, but if you do not treat the fever, it will
prolong for about 2 to 3 weeks."

[The GIDEON database offers no information about endemic typhus in Sri
Lanka, but does suggest that the disease is commoner in warmer climates.
Endemic typhus is maintained in a rat/flea cycle, and rodent control is key
to controlling the disease in humans. Unless drought brings rats into
closer contact with humans, I can think of no reason to relate the 2
events. Presumptive laboratory diagnosis using simple serological tests
should be within the capability of most hospital laboratories. Additional
information would be appreciated. - Mod.ES]
