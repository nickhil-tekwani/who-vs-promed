A 17-year-old thoroughbred gelding from an Orange Country, California, facility has been diagnosed with equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 [EHV-1]) after developing neurologic signs of disease, the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) reported [Fri 13 Apr 2018]. "The gelding has been isolated and placed under quarantine," the CDFA's statement said. "Exposed horses will be monitored for clinical signs and temperatures will be taken twice daily. Any horse displaying a fever or compatible clinical signs will be tested."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. In many horses, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

A total of 3 horses have tested positive for Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), a potentially fatal virus, at Sycamore Trails Stables in San Juan Capistrano on [Wed 18 Apr 2018], since a 2-week quarantine began on [Fri 13 Apr 2018] when a 1st horse tested positive and was placed in isolation.

Sycamore Trails Stables Manager Dave Provence confirmed on [Mon 16 Apr 2018] that one of its horses tested positive for EHV-1 and the stables will be in quarantine at least until [Tue 26 Apr 2018]. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) issued a statement on [Fri 13 Apr 2018] that a horse from an Orange County facility was isolated after testing positive for the virus. The CDFA statement has not included that Sycamore Trails Stables is the Orange County facility that is under quarantine.

The horse that 1st tested positive, a 17-year-old gelding, has taken residence at Sycamore Trails Stables for years, Sycamore Trails Co-Manager Roxanne Euhus said. The gelding was diagnosed outside of the stables at a hospital, showing neurological symptoms of EHV-1, and is currently in a hospital in San Luis Rey, Euhus said.

On [Wed 18 Apr 2018], the CDFA announced that 2 additional horses were tested positive for EHV-1. There are 2 forms of the virus, one is respiratory and the other is a neurological form of the disease, also known as Equine Herpes Myeloencephalopathy (EHM). EHM may be caused by damage to blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord associated with EHV-1 infection, according to the CDFA. "Two horses located in the quarantined barn at the Orange County premises have been confirmed for (EHV-1)," the CDFA statement said. "A mare displayed a fever the morning of [Tue 17 Apr 2018] and a horse which was febrile for one day on [Sun 8 Apr 2018]. Both horses have been placed in separate quarantine isolation stabling on the property."

The EHM case remains quarantined and isolated offsite and continues to show clinical improvements, the CDFA statement said. It is unclear which strain of EHV-1 the other 2 horses have.

A sign that read 'Attention, No Horses May Leave This Facility' was posted at the entrance of Sycamore Trails Stables, in addition to caution tape and 'Under Quarantine, Stop, Disease Prevention Control Area' signs posted across the Sycamore Barn of the stables. EHV-1 does not affect humans, but humans can carry the virus, Provence said. "Because (the virus) is communicable and it has an incubation period of about 2-10 days, that's why we have the quarantine," Provence said.

EHV-1 in horses can cause respiratory disease, abortion in mares, neonatal foal death and neurological disease, according to the CDFA website. EHV-1 can be easily spread, so the CDFA recommends that horse owners limit horse-to-horse contact, horse-to-human-to-horse contact, avoid the use of communal water sources, avoid sharing equipment unless disinfected and to monitor horses for clinical signs of the disease, which includes a temperature of more than 102 degrees Fahrenheit.

"The index premises in Orange County has one barn of 56 exposed horses under quarantine," a CDFA statement said on [Mon 16 Apr 2018]. "The quarantined exposed horses are under strict biosecurity requirements and are having temperatures taken twice daily."

A horse owner who has multiple horses stabled at Sycamore Trails Stables said that they are skeptical of the methods of the quarantine. The owner did not want to be named out of potential retaliation. "I am definitely starting to have a serious concern as far as the way it's handled and the way it's spreading," the owner said. The owner said that the 2 new horses with EHV-1 are being isolated in an open corral, and although signs are posted, it is easily accessible for a human, or horse, to walk by. "If you walk by and a horse sneezes, which happens all of the time, then you're immediately a carrier," the owner said. "It's crazy that they put the infected horses in the open air, basically in the middle of the entrance. Just because you put yellow tape around the area doesn't stop the virus."

In addition to CDFA veterinarians, people in the barn are testing their own horses also, Provence said. In total, there are approximately 420 horses lodged at Sycamore Trails Stables, he said.

In February 2012, a quarantine was placed at Rancho Sierra Vista Equestrian Stable after 16 horses were discovered to be infected with neuropathogenic equine herpes-1, a potentially fatal virus. The quarantine was lifted February 13, after 3 weeks passed without any new visible symptoms.

On [Wed 18 Apr 2018], the State Veterinarian's Office was notified that a Weld County horse tested positive for Equine Herpesvirus (EHV-1). This time of year typically kicks off horseback riding, jackpots, horse shows and a number of other horse events and the Colorado Department of Agriculture reminds horse owners that there are a number of steps to protect their horses this season.

CDA is investigating the positive case and has placed the stabled area of the facility where the horse is housed under quarantine. The horse is undergoing treatment and others it may have come into contact with are being monitored but are not showing clinical signs of the disease at this point. At this time, the affected horse that showed clinical signs of disease is recovering.

"The most common way for EHV-1 to spread is by direct horse-to-horse contact but it can also spread through the air, contaminated equipment, clothing and hands; this certainly highlights the importance of practicing basic biosecurity practices," said State Veterinarian Keith Roehr. "Equine event organizers should continue to practice routine biosecurity practices that are effective in the prevention of EHV and other horse diseases as well."

Symptoms of horses affected with EHV-1 include fever, decreased coordination, nasal discharge, urine dribbling, loss of tail tone, hind limb weakness, leaning against a wall or fence to maintain balance, lethargy and the inability to rise. While there is no cure, the symptoms of the disease may be treatable. EHV-1 is not transmissible to people; it can be a serious disease of horses that can cause respiratory, neurologic disease and death.

For more information, visit A Guide To Understanding the Neurologic Form of EHV Infection or visit http://www.colorado.gov/ag/animals and click on "Animal Health."

Basic biosecurity practices can reduce the risk of exposure to diseases. Key points of a biosecurity plan include isolating new animals and those returning from equine events to the home premises, supplying clean feed and water, implementing infection-control practices for visitors and personnel and avoiding movement from various locations if possible. Especially important is the isolation of any sick horses. Horse owners are encouraged to contact their veterinarian if illness appears in their herd.

"Effective biosecurity practices lead to fewer health problems for animals and contribute to a longer and better-quality life for the horse," said Roehr. "When you're traveling with horses, something as simple as a clean water bucket that you don't share with other people's horses can greatly reduce the risk of disease spread."
