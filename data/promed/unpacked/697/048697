[1] Black bean tortillas - revised recall (CA)
Date: Thu 17 Nov 2011

http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm280465.htm


United Natural Foods, Inc. today, 17 Nov 2011, announced a correction
to its previously announced recall of selected types of Gentes Foods
Gordita Black Bean Tortillas, specifically to correct the previously
stated date code of 12 7 11 to the revised date code of 11 6 11.

United Natural Foods, Inc. is recalling this product dated 11 6 11
because it has the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium
botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or
death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not
look or smell spoiled.

The following product has been recalled:

Gentes Foods 10 oz Gordita Black Bean Tortillas UPC 618032102021

As previously announced, Gentes Foods Gordita Black Bean Tortillas
were distributed to the Safeway and Pak N Save stores in California
listed below. Our previous notification, with date code of "12 7 11"
was incorrect, and product with this date code is safe to consume. The
revised date code, which is on a white sticker applied to the
packaging, reads "11 6 11." These date codes sold at other retail
outlets have not been affected because the products were not exposed
to a lack of refrigeration controls.

Store / Address / City
Safeway #1110 / 1546 N Main / Salinas, CA
Safeway #2840 / 2010 Freedom Blvd / Watsonville CA
Pak N Save #3116 / 2255 Gellert Blvd / S San Francisco CA
Pak N Save #3125 / 3889 San Pablo Ave / Emeryville CA

[All 4 of these stores are in Northern California - Mod.LL]

Gentes Foods Gordita Black Bean Tortillas are packed as 6 tortillas in
a vacuum packaged clear sleeve. The package is approximately 10 oz in
size and an orange label is on a clear wrapper with white lettering.

No illnesses have been reported to date.

These items have been recalled due to a lack of temperature control
during the distribution process. UNFI inadvertently subjected the
recall items to temperature ranges above those directed by the
manufacturer.

[2] Uneviscerated salted smoked herring (NY)
Date: Wed 16 Nov 2011

New York State Agriculture Commissioner Darrel Aubertine today warned
consumers not to eat "Salted Smoked Herring" sold by Juncalito Abajo
Meat Corp., d/b/a Associated, located at 1380 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Brooklyn, NY 11239, and distributed by P West In Food Inc., located at
810 Bank Street in Brooklyn, NY, because the product was found to be
uneviscerated.

The "Salted Smoked Herring" was sold from retail stores to consumers
in the New York City Metro area. The product was repacked from bulk in
the store and offered for sale at ambient temperatures. The product is
uncoded and is a product of Canada.

Uneviscerated processed fish is prohibited under New York State
Department of Agriculture and Markets' regulations because
_Clostridium botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in
the viscera than any other portion of the fish.

The "Salted Smoked Herring" was found by New York State Department of
Agriculture and Markets food inspectors during a routine inspection of
the firm. Subsequent analysis by New York State Food Laboratory
personnel confirmed the product to be uneviscerated.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with the
product. Consumers who have this product are advised not to eat it.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in these cases, there are no human cases
associated with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in
these cases) are related to defective preparation or storage
procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the
germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
