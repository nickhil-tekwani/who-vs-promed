Fears Of New Avian Influenza Virus Outbreak Allayed
---------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Hong Kong health inspectors gave the all-clear to a chicken farm
in Yuen Long where poultry were found last month to have antibodies to
haemagglutinin type 5 (H5) avian influenza virus, putting to rest fears of
a new outbreak. Liu Kwei-kin, Assistant Director of the Agriculture,
Fisheries and Conservation Department, said the farm was virus-free and its
chickens safe for the market. He said they found no avian influenza virus
in the 1700 samples collected from the farm. Blood tests on 3000 chickens
also showed up negative. "Throughout the investigation, birds on the farm
remained healthy and there has been no unusual mortality in the flock,"
reported Dr Liu.
On 19 Oct 2000, according to the South China Morning Post, the Department
veterinarians had found that 24 of 52 chicken blood samples from the farm
contained traces of antibodies to H5 avian influenza virus, sparking fears
of a new avian influenza virus outbreak. The farm was sealed off
immediately as the department officers conducted more blood tests on the
chickens. "The presence of antibodies in these chickens suggests a past
exposure to the H5 virus," said Dr Liu, adding that the virus caused no
harm to the chickens and had failed to establish itself on the farm.
The department has kept a close watch on all poultry farms since the 1997
avian influenza virus H5N1 outbreak, in which 6 people died and more than
1.6 million chickens were slaughtered to stop the disease spreading.

[The H5N1 avian influenza virus killed 6 of 18 persons infected in Hong
Kong in 1997. Subsequent analysis indicated that the H5N1 virus had been
transmitted directly from domestic poultry to humans by multiple
independent transfers, suggesting that the virus was poorly adapted to
person-to-person transmission. The H5N1 chicken viruses differed from H5
viruses of wild aquatic birds by the presence of a carbohydrate at the
globular head of the haemagglutinin (HA) molecule. This additional
glycosylation of the HA (and also a shortening of the NA protein stalk) are
characteristic features of the H5 and H7 viruses of chickens. These
observations suggest that changes in both HA and NA may be required for the
adaptation of influenza viruses from wild aquatic birds to infection of
domestic chickens and raises the possibility that chickens may be an
intermediate host in zoonotic transmission. Surprisingly, the H5N1 viruses
isolated from domestic chickens exhibited considerable variability in all
gene products except in the HA protein. Thus these viruses may be
reassortants, each of whose HA gene is well adapted to domestic poultry,
while the rest of the genome arises from a different source. The consensus
amino acid sequences of "internal" virion proteins reveal amino acids
characteristic of human strains. These human-specific amino acids may be
important factors in determining avian-to-human transmission. - Mod.CP
