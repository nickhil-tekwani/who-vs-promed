High incidence of _Dracunculus medinensis_ in northern Ghana
------------------------------------------------------------
The Nanumba District of the Northern Region is reported to be experiencing
the highest incidences of Guinea worm infection in Ghana and the entire
West Africa sub-region. This development is linked to the deplorable water
situation in the area. This was made known to the Minister for Work and
Housing, Yaw Barimah, when he undertook a working tour of some parts of the
Northern Region to acquaint himself with the water situation there.
Talks held between the minister and the Nanumba District Assembly focused
on how best to eradicate the Guinea worm menace. Earlier the minister had
sat in the Project Steering Committee meeting of the Northern Water and
Sanitation Project (NORWASP), funded by the Canadian International
Development Agency [CIDA]. Under the project, CIDA is to deliver 700 water
pumps made up of 630 boreholes and 70 hand-dug wells. In addition to these,
14 000 household latrines are to be provided, and personnel of the district
assemblies will be trained to strengthen their capacity to manage the 6
year project, which began in 2000.
Mr Barimah was briefed on the proposed intervention by the European Union
and AFAD [what does this stand for? - Mod.SH] to provide water and sanitary
facilities in the Northern Region. He said he was satisfied with the donor
support in the region and pledged government's commitment to construct an
office block for the Northern Regional office of the Community Water and
Sanitation Agency (CWSA), to enable all the donors to work from a common
place. The construction is to start as soon as title to land for the
project is secured. The CWSA is a government subsidised organization set up
specifically to facilitate the delivery of water to rural communities and
small towns.

[In 1998, 16 countries in Africa south of the Sahara still reported cases
of Guinea worm infection, according to a World Health Organization press
release (4 Mar 1998), and Ghana, Guinea, and Sudan had the highest
prevalence of the infection. When larvae are discharged into water they are
ingested by copepod crustaceans of the _Cyclops_ spp, where they develop
further. When humans drink water that contains infected cyclops, the larvae
are released in the human host and penetrate the gut wall. - Mod.EP]
