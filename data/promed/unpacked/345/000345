_Culicoides chiopterus_: confirmation of its status as potential vector of
bluetongue virus in Europe
-----------------------------------------------
From August 2006 to date, northern Europe was facing an unexpected
epizootic of the serotype 8 of the bluetongue virus (BTV-8). In 2006,
France underwent only few BTV-8 outbreaks (infected farms). Following a
mild winter, the disease spread dramatically through the country in 2007,
leading to about 16 000 outbreaks during the year. To identify which
culicoids species are involved in BTV-8 transmission, individual [midges]
collected on infected farms [in France] were tested for the presence of BTV.

The following data pertain to a collection by 2 UV traps (OVI type)
performed during the night of 13-14 Sep 2007 on a cattle farm in the
Ardennes department (north eastern France), where clinical cases in cattle
were recorded. After morphological identification, the collected culicoids
were divided into pools [consisting] of the same species, sex, and
physiological stage. The pools included one to 57 individuals. Among the
collected individuals, 973 unfed parous females were tested for the
presence of BTV by real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR): these included 731 _C. chiopterus_ (15 pools), 159 _C.
obsoletus/scoticus_ (3 pools), 72 _C. dewulfi_ (2 pools), 3 _C. lupicaris_
(1 pool), 2 _C. pulicaris_ (1 pool), 2 _C. nubeculosus_ (1), 2 _C.
pallidicornis_ (1), 1 _C. achrayi_ (1 pool), and 1 _C. salinarius_ (1 pool).

Among the 15 pools of _C. chiopterus_, 2 were positive for BTV-8 presence
by RT-PCR. The minimum infection rate (MIR) was thus 2.7/1000 in this species.

These BTV-8 RNA detections in both France and Netherlands [see Bluetongue -
Europe (17): BTV-8, new vector, update 20080321.1077 and commentary. -
Mod.AS] in late autumn 2007 confirm without doubt that _C. chiopterus_ has
to be considered a potential vector of bluetongue virus in Europe.

According to results of the entomological surveillance carried out in
France in 2007, _C. obsoletus/scoticus_ is the dominant sibling species in
areas of BTV-8 transmission (about 70 to 80 per cent of the individuals
collected), whereas _C. chiopterus_ represents less than 5 per cent.
Nevertheless, entomologists from IAH-Pirbright recently showed great
differences comparing collections from light and host-baited traps for _C.
chiopterus_. Indeed, this species represents 31.5 per cent of the total
catch on sheep and approximately only one per cent in UV trap (Carpenter,
personal communication). Thus, _C. chiopterus_ could be more abundant than
suggested by UV trapping.

Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that inventory of species by UV
trappings obviously underestimate the importance of species which are
partially or mainly diurnal.

According to literature, 2 species have been found to date (by RT-PCR) in
northern Europe as naturally infected with BTV-8: _C. dewulfi_ in
Netherlands (Meiswinkel et al. Vet Rec 2007) and _C. chiopterus_ in both
France and the Netherlands (ProMED-mail 20080321.1077).

In the paper published by Mehlhorn in 2007 in Parasitol Research [on
culicoids collections in Germany], several pools, referred to as "_C.
obsoletus_" (certainly synonymous in this paper with "_Avaritia_
subgenus"), not identified down species, were also found positive for BTV
by RT-PCR [See Bluetongue - Europe (17): BTV-8, Germany, vectors
20070719.2315 and ref 3. - Mod.AS].

Moreover, it is interesting to underline that we failed to identify BTV-8
RNA from field-collected culicoids in another infected farm, where _C.
obsoletus/scoticus_ represented 88 per cent of the 1377 parous females
tested, _C. chiopterus_ 3.4 per cent, and _C. dewulfi_ 1.9 per cent
(Balenghien et al. Vet Rec 2008) [See commentary. - Mod.AS]. It would be
useful to complete this list of potential vectors by [entomological]
information from other BTV-8 infected European countries.

Identification of virus from field-collected individuals is only one step
to identify vectors. To progress in the process of BTV-8 vectors
identification, host-baited trap collections and, obviously, vector
competence studies have to be carried out.

[The above firsthand communication from Dr Balenghien and colleagues,
providing the most recent French findings -- supporting the recent Dutch
observations regarding the possible addition of a 2nd culicoides species to
the BTV-8 vectors list -- is warmly welcomed.

The fact that both _C. dewulfi_ and _C. chiopterus_ are coprophilic BTV-8
vectors, breeding exclusively in cattle and horse dung, and the report on
their diurnal activity (similar to _C obsoletus/scoticus_), is of
particular importance for the understanding of the BTV-8 overwintering
mechanism in northern Europe, of the scope of its expected further spread,
and of their potential to disseminate other orbiviruses should they be
introduced into the same ecosystem.

The diurnal activity has been reported by T Balenghien et al (ref 1). They
conducted culicoides collections carried out during 3 consecutive days in
October 2007 (the peak incidence of BTV-8), on a sheep farm reporting
clinical cases, in north eastern France. Culicoides midges were collected
using UV light traps operated continuously, as well as a mouth aspirator on
the belly of a sheep between 10.00 to 14.00 and 15.00 to 18.00, operated in
30-minute sessions; and a backpack aspirator operated for 30-minute
sessions during afternoons around haystacks covered by a black plastic
tarpaulin. These collections gave clear evidence of culicoides diurnal
activity: sheep could be attacked in fields during a sunny autumn morning
by _C obsoletus/scoticus_, _C dewulfi_and _C chiopterus_. Concluding, they
state that since entomosurveillance systems based on UV traps assess only
nocturnal activity, it could not be excluded that host-seeking behaviour
occurs during mild winter days, indicating the need to check the existence
of a diurnal movement in winter, in order to evaluate the reality of the
"vector-free" season.

A recent Belgian study described maize silage residues as possible breeding
sites for the sibling species _Culicoides obsoletus/scoticus_ and confirmed
that _Culicoides dewulfi_ and _Culicoides chiopterus_ breed in cattle dung
(ref 2).

In post 20070719.2315 (July 2007), when it became apparent that BTV-8
renewed and extended its spread in north western Europe, ProMED-mail called
for intensified entomological research efforts, indicating that "detailed,
completed information on the vectors and their ecology will enable
assessment of the seasonality, the host preference, and the potential
further geographic distribution of bluetongue virus in northern Europe and
eventually the outlining of prevention and control policies. It may also
provide needed data on the potential spread of other orbiviruses, should
they be introduced." It is encouraging to note that such efforts are indeed
invested in the subject; further science-based field studies from the BTV-8
affected countries are appreciatively anticipated.

An official press release on the Ministry's website announced on 31 Mar
2008 that 2 new cases of BTV-1 have been confirmed in the Departments of
the Gironde (at Queyrac) and in the Department of Landes (at Leon).
Following the event located in the Gironde, a decree extending the
regulated regions for serotype 1 to this department and part of nearby
departments, the Charente and Charente Maritime, was published in the
official gazette of 1 Apr 2008. These areas were already regulated under
their BTV-8 situation.

The order also amends the regulatory area under the serotype 1 to reflect
the launch of the vaccination campaign against this serotype in the
departments of the Gers, Landes, Pyrenees Atlantiques and Hautes-Pyrenees.

The vaccination will be reassessed to take into account the evolution of
the disease.

So far, 3866 cases of bluetongue have been recorded in France during 2008;
this includes the 2 BTV-1 cases [Thus, the other 3864 cases must have been
listed as BTV-8. - Mod.AS].

It is not clear whether the 3864 BTV-8 "cases," reported in France during
2008, are new or rather (as the case is in the UK; see item 3) recently
detected positive animals which, in fact, had undergone infection during
2007. The same may be said about the BTV-1 cases in the south; an official
clarification would be helpful. - Mod.AS]

Since November 2007, lab results indicate that all the "new cases" of
bluetongue reported in the UK were infected during the vector season in
2007 and were only picked up by pre-movement testing carried out in 2008.
As far as we are aware at present, there is no indication that BTV-8 has
been circulating in the UK in the past 4 months (December-March 2008).
These cases are neither a reoccurrence of disease nor a new outbreak; these
animals have remained PCR- and ELISA-positive since being infected during
the midge season in 2007, and the animals showed no clinical signs of
disease at the time of pre-movement sampling.
