The Ministry of Health has confirmed the outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Kagadi district.

The case was confirmed following the death of [JM], 34, a herdsman and a resident of Kihuura LCI in Mabaale sub-county, Kagadi district.

[JM] died at St Ambrose Charity Health Center IV in Kagadi town on Monday this week [10 Jan 2022] where he had been admitted after he developed severe fever, muscle pain, and headache.

Paul Bahizi, the Kagadi District Assistant Health officer says that health officials in the district became suspicious after the death of the deceased. He says that they were compelled to collect samples from him and sent them to Uganda Virus Research Institute Entebbe for analysis which tested positive for Rift Valley fever.

Dr. Fred Ssewankambo, a representative from World Health Organization (WHO) has asked the district authority to swiftly launch sensitization campaigns, especially in Mabaale before the disease spreads.

Lillian Ruteraho, the Kagadi Resident District Commissioner says they have dispatched a team of health experts to trace the victim's contacts so that samples are taken from them for analysis.

She has asked residents to be vigilant and cooperate with health officials in order to help contain the outbreak of the disease from spreading to other areas.

Ruteraho adds that the National Rapid Response team from the Ministry of Health has been alerted and soon they will be sent to the district to back up medical officials in the district to handle the outbreak.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans.

Infection can cause severe diseases in both animals and humans. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock. Some of the symptoms of RVF include fever, muscle pains, headaches, and bleeding, among others.

The virus was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya.

In March 2016, an outbreak of RVF was identified in Kabale district, southwestern Uganda.

A comprehensive outbreak investigation was initiated, including human, livestock, and mosquito vector investigations.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.

Rift Valley fever virus transmission is again active in Uganda, with one death reported. One hopes that the team dispatched to the affected area will inform the people to avoid contact with infected animals and their meat and milk products. As mentioned in previous posts, Rift Valley fever virus is endemic in Uganda, and human cases occur there sporadically. The above report makes no mention of cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in domestic animals in the area where the human cases occurred. Farm animals are the main reservoirs and amplifiers of RVF virus. RVF outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals. It is odd that no small ruminant animal cases are mentioned, unless the animals had been vaccinated previously and are immune.

RVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in Aedes vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. Adult female mosquitoes coming from infected eggs can transmit the virus during their 1st blood meals. Eradicating the virus from these areas is not possible with current technology.

As Mod.AB noted: "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_." - Mod.TY
