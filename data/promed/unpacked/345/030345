[2] WHO update
Date: 27 May 2015
Source: WHO [edited]
http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.ebola-sitrep.ebola-summary-20150519?lang=en


There were 12 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 24 May [2015]: 9 from Guinea and 3 from Sierra Leone. A total of 5 districts (3 in Guinea, 2 in Sierra Leone) reported at least one confirmed case, compared with 6 districts the previous week. The west-Guinean prefecture of Forecariah reported the most cases of any one district, and continues to present the greatest challenge in terms of response, with multiple chains of transmission over a wide geographical area (4 sub-prefectures), and the continued occurrence of cases from unknown sources of infection.

Cases from Guinea were reported from the western prefectures of Dubreka (3 cases) and Forecariah (5 cases), with a single case reported from the north-western prefecture of Boke, which borders Guinea-Bissau. In line with the previous week, cases in Boke and Dubreka were concentrated in the sub-prefectures of Kamsar and Tanene, respectively. The 5 cases reported from Forecariah were reported from 4 different sub-prefectures. A 4-day targeted case-finding and sensitisation campaign was concluded in Forecariah on 19 May [2015]. During the course of the campaign, multidisciplinary teams trained in case detection and social mobilisation visited 8023 homes and contacted 38 557 people.

Of the 9 cases reported from Guinea, 7 were known contacts of a previous case; one (in Forecariah) arose from an unknown source of infection, and one case was not a registered contact of a previous case but, on further investigation, does have an epidemiological link to a known chain of transmission in Forecariah. The case that arose from an unknown source of infection was one of 3 cases in Guinea identified after post-mortem testing of community deaths. A total of 13 unsafe burials were reported in the week to 24 May [2015], representing 4 percent of 335 reported burials: a decrease compared with 25 (6 percent) of 386 reported burials the previous week, and a marked decrease compared with 163 (43 percent) of 375 reported burials during the week ending 19 Apr 2015.

Because of the proximity to Guinea-Bissau of the recent cluster of cases in the Guinean prefecture of Boke, a response team from Guinea-Bissau has been deployed to the border to assess points of entry. Investigations are ongoing to trace a contact who attended the funeral of a case in Boke and who is thought to have returned to a fishing community in Guinea-Bissau.

In Sierra Leone, 3 confirmed cases were reported from Freetown (2 cases), and Port Loko (1 case). In Freetown, cases were reported from 2 densely populated neighbourhoods, Kroo Town and ward 350, in the north and east of the city, respectively. Both cases are known contacts of recent cases and are linked to the chain of transmission originating in Moa Wharf. One of the cases was in voluntary quarantine at the time of symptom onset and was transferred to a nearby Ebola Treatment Centre. The 2nd case was a high-risk contact of a previous case from Moa Wharf. After being lost to follow-up, the case developed symptoms on 15 May [2015] and was subsequently relocated to a community care centre in ward 350 and treated for malaria on 19 May [2015]. Intensive efforts are underway to identify all contacts associated with this case, and many high-risk contacts are currently in voluntary quarantine. The single case in Port Loko was reported from the chiefdom of Kaffu Bullom and is thought to be linked to a chain of transmission from the northern district of Kambia. Having been a focus of transmission several weeks ago, Kambia has not reported a confirmed case for 10 consecutive days as of 24 May [2015].

The last health worker infection in Guinea was reported on 6 Apr [2015], and 14 May [2015] in Sierra Leone. There have been a total of 869 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
-----------------------------------
There have been a total of 27 013 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1), with 11 134 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 9 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and 3 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 24 May [2015]. The outbreak in Liberia was declared over on 9 May [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 to 4 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are 4 to 5 times more likely to be affected than children.

A total of 869 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 507 reported deaths (table 5)... -more

[3] Sierra Leone clarification: last survivor of his lab team

http://www.who.int/features/2015/ebola-health-worker-sesay/en/


Clarification from Robert Garry regarding ProMED Ebola update (72): WHO update, Sierra Leone, susp. technology, funding 20150524.3383587, item [3] Sierra Leone: last survivor of his lab team http://www.who.int/features/2015/ebola-health-worker-sesay/en/
-------------------------------------
I would like to make a correction to the WHO article about the Ebola cases amongst laboratory staff at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH).

The building that contains the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) laboratory, directed by Mr. Augustine Goba, who 1st diagnosed the 1st case of Ebola in Sierra Leone, contains a 2nd general laboratory.

The article should be referring to the several Ebola cases in the general laboratory, not the VHF laboratory.

This is an important distinction. Personnel in the VHF laboratory work in full personal protective equipment (PPE) and handle samples in class II biosafety cabinets. In sharp contrast, personnel in the general laboratory were tasked to perform malaria thick smears and wore minimal PPE.

There was one fatal case of Ebola in VHF laboratory staff during the current outbreak. However, this individual likely did not contract Ebola in the VHF laboratory. Rather, he appears to have contracted Ebola from one of many fatal cases of Ebola in his family or during his 2nd job performing thick smears in a private non-KGH laboratory.

We deeply regret the lost of all health care workers during the Ebola outbreak. It is very important that the historical record is accurate to identify hazards that can be mitigated when Ebola emerges again.

21 May 2015 Guinea: Dr. Sakoba Keita - Taxi drivers can help drive Ebola away
http://allafrica.com/stories/201505251212.html?viewall=1
[According to Dr. Keita, "We've learned that the virus moves with people, and so our contact tracing has to reflect human traffic. We're trying to collaborate our efforts with taxi drivers and minibus drivers. Many sick people travel by taxi in order to reach traditional healers. We're asking people not to do that if they have the symptoms of Ebola and to make contact with the national hotline instead."

Direct involvement of the community is always a good approach to control disease. - Mod.LK]

26 May 2015 Guinea: 6 jailed for sharing taxi with Ebola infected corpse http://pulse.ng/health/in-guinea-6-jailed-for-sharing-taxi-with-ebola-infected-corpse-id3796345.html
[For allegedly travelling in a taxi with an Ebola-infected corpse, 6 people have been put in isolation in prison in Guinea. Reports say the body, which was the corpse of a police recruit from Forecariah town towards Conakry, was seated upright in a taxi, dressed in a T-shirt and jeans with sunglasses and sandwiched between 3 others. This demonstrates how important cultural practices are for the family members of the deceased. This is clearly a challenge to Ebola control. - Mod.LK]

UPDATE: The Italian, male nurse (Ebola patient) is now able to feed himself and take medications orally and intravenously. However, he continues to have a "widespread" fever. No definitive prognosis has yet been made.]

22 May 2015 Liberia: IMS monitoring Ebola crisis in Guinea, Sierra Leone
http://allafrica.com/stories/201505250964.html?viewall=1
[According to the head of the Liberian Incident Management System, health authorities in Liberia are monitoring the Ebola situation in neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone to prevent a resurgence of the virus in Liberia. The IMS is also focusing on strengthening cross-border surveillance, monitoring of border teams, supporting community engagement along the borders, and monitoring the compliance of individuals who are crossing the borders with the required hand-washing and temperature check procedures.]

http://allafrica.com/stories/201505260286.html
[Meeting with over 20 survivors at State House Mon 25 May 2015, barely a year since the outbreak, President Ernest Bai Koroma assured survivors of the dreadful Ebola virus disease of government's readiness to provide them with the necessary social services till their lives return to normal.]

26 May 2015 Sierra Leone: Mass Ebola raid in Koidu
http://politicosl.com/2015/05/mass-ebola-raid-in-koidu/
[Scores of people have been detained in Koidu Town, Kono District in the east of Sierra Leone after a surprise late evening raid on Wednesday [20 May 2015?]. It was unclear why the raid was conducted, but police said it is in relation to efforts to enforce the Ebola bylaws enacted to prevent the spread of the deadly viral disease.]

[It is not at all clear why these raids were conducted, but using "well armed soldiers" to carry out raids, arresting business people and confiscating motor bikes of NGO workers does not seem like an effective approach to control of Ebola. The effort would be better spent having trained individuals conduct contact tracing. - Mod.LK]

25 May 2015: South African government lifts travel restrictions on Liberians

[Effective immediately, the South African government has lifted restrictions placed on Liberians during the Ebola crisis. Liberians will be required to submit to thermal scanning in airports, as are other travelers.]

27 May 2015 USA (Dallas): More were treated for Ebola-like symptoms in Texas
http://www.ktre.com/story/29170075/study-more-were-treated-for-ebola-like-symptoms-in-texas
[According to a study published this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine, following hospitalization of the 1st patient with Ebola diagnosed in the United States on 28 Sep 2014, contact tracing for Ebola was initiated. Approximately 12 more people than previously reported were hospitalized with Ebola-like symptoms last year [2014] after being exposed to the disease in Texas. 179 people in the Dallas area were identified as requiring monitoring for symptoms. Of 112 health-care-worker contacts with the index case, 22 (20 percent) had known unprotected exposure, and 37 (30 percent) did not have known unprotected exposures but interacted with a patient or contaminated environment on multiple days. Transmission was confirmed in 2 healthcare workers who had substantial interaction with the patient; the 2 HCWs had 40 additional contacts. Of the 20 community contacts of the index patient or the 2 HCWs, 4 had high risk exposures. All 179 contacts underwent required movement restrictions, and 7 contacts underwent quarantine.

26 May 2015 USA (New Jersey): Lassa fever death evokes Ebola fears
http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/243075-lassa-fever-death-in-new-jersey-evokes-ebola-fears
[The New Jersey hospital's failure to immediately diagnose the disease [Lassa], and to ultimately let the man leave the hospital, mirrors the experience of a man in a Dallas hospital who became the 1st person to die from Ebola in the United States.

The patient in Dallas was not asked about his travel history and was let go from the hospital one day after he checked himself in. Within days, he had returned in a far worse condition and could not ultimately be saved. This individual also became the 1st person to spread Ebola in the U.S.

Lassa fever has never been spread from person-to-person in the United States, and there have only been 6 documented cases in the last 40 years. The CDC will be seeking out health workers, family members, and people who shared his plane from Liberia to Morocco to JFK International Airport on 17 May 2015. - Mod.LK]

http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-05/27/c_134272727.htm
[Ebola virus cannot infect mice unless it 1st attaches to a host protein, Niemann-Pick C1. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that Ebola enters host cells by binding directly to NPC1 and that blocking the ability of the virus to engage NPC1 prevents Ebola infection. Recent in vivo studies (mice) showed mice lacking both copies of the NPC1 gene (lacking the NPC1 protein) were completely resistant to infection.]

[A brick-sized portable device, which was launched in August 2014 following 6 years of development, allows specialists to test for viruses and bacteria by identifying target DNA sequences without the need for samples to be taken back to a lab for testing on much larger equipment.

The tests showed the device offered sensitivity equivalent to that of larger lab-based machines -- meaning it could detect very small amounts of Ebola -- and did not generate false positives when other diseases common to West Africa were present.

Tests on the device showed it met US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for "emergency use authorisation" on Ebola.]

http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2297164
[JAMA. 2015;313(20):2015. doi:10.1001/jama.2015.4358
A novel recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine based on the 2014 Zaire Guinea Ebola strain, which is responsible for the current Ebola epidemic, elicited a robust immune response in recipients, according to the 1st phase 1 trial of the vaccine. (Zhu F-C et al. Lancet. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60553-0, published online 24 Mar 2015).

The trial, conducted in China, randomly assigned 120 healthy Chinese adults to receive placebo or a low dose or high dose of the vaccine. 28 days after vaccination, 38 of 40 participants in the low-dose group and all 40 of those in the high-dose group had a positive immune response to the vaccine, with the magnitude of the immune response being dose-dependent. No specific immune response was recorded in the placebo group, and no serious adverse events were reported in any group.

Further trials will be necessary to demonstrate that the immune response observed will offer protection against Ebola. - Mod.LK]

27 May 2015 West Africa: Ebola will persist, aid lacking, warns WHO
http://gulftoday.ae/portal/47d56432-6aa9-44f7-b88e-c12f52233352.aspx
[According to the World Health Organization, the Ebola outbreak in Guinea and Sierra Leone may persist through 2015 and beyond because of decreasing financing. According to WHO Special Representative for Ebola Dr. Bruce Aylward, the WHO lacks more than USD 100 million towards its USD 350 million budget for its Ebola operation over the next 6 months, jeopardizing its ability to keep people on the ground. In addition, the rainy season has started in West Africa, making it difficult to access remote rural areas, making contract tracing difficult. 1/3rd of new infections still occur in people not suspected of having been exposed to the Ebola virus.]
