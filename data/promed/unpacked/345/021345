[The current immediate notification sent to the OIE confirms and complements the information already published in ProMED-mail 20200722.7601885.

"LSD is currently endemic in most of Africa, parts of the Middle East, and Turkey. Since 2015, the disease has spread to most of the Balkan countries, the Caucasus, and the Russian Federation, where the disease continues to spread, making the risk of an imminent incursion into other unaffected countries very high. Since 2019, several outbreaks of LSD have been reported by Members in South and East Asia."

Detailed information summarizing relevant information on the activities that the Asia and Pacific region has been working on as well as OIE recommendations on LSD are available at https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/projects/lumpy-skin-disease-lsd/.

"LSD is not transmissible to humans. However, all laboratory manipulations must be performed at an appropriate containment level determined by biorisk analysis." https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.12_LSD.pdf. - Mod.CRD
