Indian health authorities said on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022] they had halted all production of New Delhi-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals after a WHO report its cough and cold syrups exported to Gambia may be linked to the deaths of dozens of children there. Known as a "pharmacy of the world," India supplies 45% of all generic medicines to Africa.

The deaths of 69 children in Gambia -- one of the worst such incidents involving drugs from India -- have come as a blow to the industry whose exports more than doubled in the last decade to hit USD 24.5 billion last fiscal year.

Indian authorities inspected Maiden's main factory in the state of Haryana 4 times this month [October 2022] and said they suspended all its manufacturing activities on Tuesday [11 Oct 2022] after finding the firm had been manufacturing and testing drugs in violation of rules "across its manufacturing and testing activities."

"In view of the seriousness of the contraventions observed during the investigation and its potential risk to the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug being produced, all the manufacturing activities of the firm is being stopped with immediate effect," said an order by federal and Haryana state drug regulators.

The drugs exported to Gambia were made by Maiden in a single batch in December last year [2021] at its main factory in Haryana's Sonipat district, about 40 km (25 miles) north of New Delhi, with a use-by date of November 2024, the order said.

A top Indian health official, who declined to be named, said the government would not tolerate wrongdoing, but it was important to find out what exactly happened in Gambia. He denied allegations by some critics the health regulations in India, especially at the level of states, were lax.

The government has formed a committee of 4 experts who will advise further action after "examining and analysing adverse event reports, causal relationship and all related details shared by the WHO (World Health Organization)".

Indian laws allow for imprisonment and fines for selling spurious drugs. But the source said the WHO had yet to share any report establishing a direct link to the deaths with the Indian-made medicines.

WHO Assistant Director-General Mariângela Simão told a virtual news conference it was working closely with Indian authorities to investigate Maiden's cough and cold syrups. She said the WHO's conclusion about the deaths being linked to Maiden's medicines was based on analysis of several samples of medicines which had used by hospitalised children.

Maiden says on its website it has an annual production capacity of 2.2 million syrup bottles, 600 million capsules, 18 million injections, 300 000 ointment tubes and 1.2 billion tablets at its Haryana factories. It says it has 2 other factories in the state apart from the main one.

The WHO issued a medical product alert last week asking regulators to remove Maiden goods from the market. The UN health agency said laboratory analysis of 4 Maiden products -- Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup -- had "unacceptable" amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which can be toxic and lead to acute kidney injury. Diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol are used as a cheaper alternative in some pharmaceutical products to glycerine, a solvent or thickening agent in many cough syrups.

Gambian police, in a preliminary investigation report on Tuesday [11 Oct 2022], said the deaths of 69 children from acute kidney injury was linked to the cough syrups made in India and imported via Atlanta-based Atlantic Pharmaceuticals. Atlantic could not be reached for comment.

The cough syrups had been approved for export only to Gambia, India says, although the WHO says they may have gone elsewhere through informal markets.

Indonesia said on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022] it would investigate cases of acute kidney injury which has caused the deaths of more than 20 children in its capital Jakarta this year [2022], but that there was no connection with the cases in Gambia.

Indonesia will investigate cases of acute kidney injury, which has caused the deaths of more than 20 children in its capital Jakarta this year [2022], health authorities said on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022]. The probe comes as authorities in Gambia said nearly 70 children died from acute kidney injury after taking a locally sold paracetamol syrup used to treat fever.

Indonesia will coordinate with investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) having found "unacceptable" levels of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which can be toxic, in 4 products of syrup made by New Delhi-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Indonesia's drug regulator (BPOM) said in a statement the syrups were not registered in the country.

Mohammad Syahril, a health ministry spokesperson, told (IDAI) data. The total number of deaths nationwide is still being determined, he said. Syahril added the cases in Gambia are not related to those in Indonesia.

Separately, the Jakarta health agency said there have been a total of 31 cases reported in the city since January [2022], of which 68% have been fatal.

The health ministry said it is talking to experts from the WHO that are investigating the case in Gambia, and it has formed a team with IDAI and a Jakarta-based hospital to look into the matter. The health ministry said early findings point to potential intoxication as a cause of the illness, but no definitive cause has been found yet. The ministry said further research was needed.

Indian authorities said on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022] they found 12 violations of good practices at a factory of Maiden and halted production of cough syrups at the plant.

[Maidan Pharmaceuticals is based in New Delhi, India.

The 1st article above states: "Diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol are used as a cheaper alternative in some pharmaceutical products to glycerine, a solvent or thickening agent in many cough syrups." This issue of a substitution of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol is not limited to India. It appears to be a much broader situation, as it now encompasses Gambia and possibly Indonesia, and more cases could be discovered in other regions.

I wonder if those who chose to use these "cheaper alternatives" knew they were toxic and deadly, or bothered to check if those substitutes were toxic. I wonder whether it all came down to a lower cost in manufacturing, and more profit.

It is really hard to look at making a little extra money over the lives of people, and especially children. This affects the parents and siblings of those victims forever.

Perhaps those involved will be held accountable. If there are more of these products in other regions, we hope they can be tracked down and removed from the market before others suffer kidney failure, pain, illness and death. - Mod.TG
