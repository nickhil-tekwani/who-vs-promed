Regarding the post Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Brazil: (MG) fatal, RFI , 20180813.5962203, I will like to contribute with some more information to the queries of the Mod's. Comment:

1.- About the cases above, additional information would be welcome; are there any links between cases?
Answer: Yes. The 3 cases (2 men, one woman) were strolling in "Parque da Ilha" (Island Park). This is a recreational area near by the Itapecerica river, inside the city of Divinópolis, Minas Gerias State (see the location in the Google maps link:https://bit.ly/2w3hNMQ).

2.- Was there exposure to vectors (including ticks) or environments with presence of vertebrate hosts (rodents in general, horses)?
Answer: Yes, there was tick bite exposure. The area is endemic for the star-tick (_Amblyomma sculptum_), that maintains its life cycle in the large capybara (_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_) population. This animal lives in that region across the Itapecerica river basin, and has proliferated during the past 3 decades after hunting it was prohibited. These capybaras can be easily seen walking in ravines near the river including downtown Divinópolis that is cut by the river. The presence of _Rickettsia rickettsii_, a causative agent of Brazilian spotted fever, has been well known for several years in the tick population and its hosts, capybaras, horses and dogs, reside in this region.

A good review on the epidemiology of Brazilian spotted fever in the region of Divinópolis/MG by Ferederico Rodrigues Ramalho (presented at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF) in 2017), can be accessed through the link https://repositorio.ufjf.br/jspui/handle/ufjf/4578 [in Portuguese].

The capybara population in an urban area from Divinópolis city can be seen in this YouTube video https://youtu.be/mh8Uc8JgD0s.

3.- Have there been trips to areas with forest, pasture, water collections?
Answer: Yes, as explained, the recreational park "Parque da Ilha" is near the river Itapecerica, and has significant and diversified vegetation (pasture, ornamental plants, fruit trees, native forest). Some aspects of the park can be seen in this YouTube videohttps://youtu.be/n0ZxOGvFsQU.

4.-Were they vaccinated against yellow fever?
Answer: Unfortunately, I do not have this information available.

5.- Was there jaundice, renal insufficiency, respiratory manifestations, hemodynamic changes, and/or shock?
Answer: Unfortunately, I do not have this information available, but the diagnosis confirmation whas made by the "Laboratório de Riquetsioses e Hantavirose do Laboratório Central de Saúde Pública de Minas Gerais/Funed" [Rickettsiosis and Hantavirosis Laboratory of the Minas Gerais Public Health Central Laboratory, FUNED] a state reference laboratory for rickettsiosis and hantavirus infection, located in Belo Horizonte, the main city of Minas Gerais state. These laboratories are certified by the Ministry of Health of Brazil, so the results are reliable.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Hirsch for providing additional details about the cases of hemorrhagic fever in Divinópolis, Minas Gerais state. Although a confirmed diagnosis is mentioned, the etiological agent involved in these cases is not reported. ProMED would appreciate additional information about the etiology when it is available. Is it Brazilian spotted fever?

A 2016 published report states, "In Brazil _Amblyomma sculptum_ from _Amblyomma cajennense_ complex is a tick species with a rather broad distribution encompassing the Cerrado Biome and devastated areas of the Atlantic rainforest. This species is also the major vector to humans of _Rickettsia rickettsii_, agent of the Brazilian spotted fever. Main primary hosts for the adult stage and frequently associated to high environmental infestation levels are the native capybaras and tapirs and a domestic host, the horse. Recent, however, solely circumstantial evidence, has shown that pigs (_Sus scrofa_) domestic, feral or exotic (wild boars) as well as wild suidae may maintain _A. sculptum_ populations as well." https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405939016301678.

A map of Divinópolis showing the location of the park can be accessed with the URL in Dr. Hirsch's comments above, and a HealthMap/ProMED map available at: Divinópolis, Minas Gerais, Brazil: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5965116,16253. - Mod.TY]
