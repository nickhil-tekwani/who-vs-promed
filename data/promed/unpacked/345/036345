Misiones: an outbreak of botulism left 2 dead and 6 admitted to intensive care for the consumption of homemade sausages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of botulism surprised the missionary city of Andresito [Misiones]. A 77-year-old woman and her 39-year-old son lost their lives last Thursday [6 Jan 2022], and the symptoms coincide with this disease. In addition, 6 other people are in intensive care. After the passing of the man and his mother, it was learned that the patients who are hospitalized in serious condition in Eldorado have a direct link with the two victims of the alleged poisoning from the consumption of homemade sausages, as reported by the portal Online missions.

Sources of the investigation indicated that the results of the autopsy will be known on 10 Jan 2022 and that, once that information is accessed, it will be possible to clearly determine what triggered the death of the 2. The brother of one of the women hospitalized for the outbreak said that his 23-year-old relative is experiencing a visual reduction caused by poisoning. Vision problems are one of the symptoms of the disease.

According to the man, the woman is hospitalized with her 38-year-old husband and their 2-year-old daughter. "What we know is not much, they would have ingested a food of their own manufacture that would have intoxicated them," he said.

According to relatives, the affected people shared the food that caused the poisoning with their relatives, neighbors, and friends. "What I understand is that he invited acquaintances and they became intoxicated as well "

Outside the Samic Hospital, where patients are in intensive care, he explained: "The last time I saw my brother-in-law and my sister was yesterday at noon, they cannot speak, drink water, and see little." He also commented that he was unable to communicate with his hospitalized relatives and that they are awaiting the autopsy information. "We do not know anything, we are with faith and hope that everything will turn out well", he pointed. At the moment, the doctors cannot give details until receiving the results of the autopsy.

The Ministry of Public Health of Misiones, meanwhile, published a statement last Friday [7 Jan 2022], to warn about the suspicion of food poisoning. "The mechanism of investigation and seizure of merchandise was activated in Andresito for its study by the Food Division of the sanitary portfolio, due to suspicion of food poisoning/botulism", they published.

To treat affected patients, the provincial health portfolio commissioned, "preventively", specific serums to Buenos Aires and Corrientes with the aim of "reinforcing the provincial stock". In addition, they reminded "the population that food should not be consumed that is not duly certified by the relevant food authorities."

[Although the neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure can be mimicked by other diseases, a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. While the botulinum spores can survive in boiling water, the botulinum toxin is heat-labile. Heating food to a typical cooking temperature of 80 deg C (176 deg F) for 10 minutes before consumption can greatly reduce the risk of illness.

Botulism, or sausage poisoning as it was originally termed, was first seriously studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany in 1793. [See Botulism in Alaska, Nov 2017, Alaska Dept of Health and Social Services (https://dec.alaska.gov/media/23924/resources-botulism-in-alaska-2017-update.pdf). - Mod.ML] The outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this outbreak, the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly increased, prompting a study of the disease by local health officer Justinius Kerner (1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were attributed to the consumption of sausage. The illness became known as "botulism" after "botulus", the Latin word for sausage.

"Misiones is one of the 23 provinces of Argentina, located in the northeastern corner of the country in the Mesopotamia region. It is surrounded by Paraguay to the northwest, Brazil to the north, east and south, and Corrientes Province of Argentina to the southwest."

[While the verbiage of this article does not mention home canning, the prominent photo at the beginning of the article (in Spanish) shows a photo of jars of goods, obviously home canned. I am unclear if home canning/preservation was involved in this situation, or if the photo is unrelated to the situation. This article is not clear as to the occasion of this situation.

"No matter how you get botulism, the symptoms are usually the same. The most defining symptom is weakness starting on both sides of your face, goes down to your neck, and then to the rest of your body. Other early symptoms include: double or blurred vision; drooping eyelids; difficulty swallowing; slurred speech; and shortness of breath. Other symptoms that can follow include vomiting, belly pain, and diarrhea. Later, you may have a very hard time urinating and have severe constipation. Symptoms do not include a fever. If you don't get treatment, the symptoms could progress to paralysis of arms and legs and the muscles used for breathing." "Symptoms of inhalation botulism are the same as those for general botulism but usually happen more quickly. Respiratory failure can occur."

"Foodborne botulism symptoms usually appear within 18-36 hours of eating food with the bacterium, though they could show up in as little as 6 hours. In some cases, symptoms of botulism don't occur for a week to 10 days after exposure."

We hope the investigation is speedy and there are no other victims. - Mod.TG
