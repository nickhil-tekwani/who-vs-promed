Prolonged warm weather in Victoria has prompted the resurgence of a deadly livestock disease. Six heifers in western Victoria died at the weekend [17-18 May 2014] from ryegrass staggers, a disease contracted from toxic fungus in pastures.

Hamilton vet David Rendell says it's rare for an outbreak of the disease in May. "We've had quite unseasonably warm weather, which has allowed the fungus in the ryegrass to get active again and produce the poison," he said. "One of my clients mustered some cattle and wasn't aware the staggers could be a problem at this time of the year and ended up losing 6 of them."

Ryegrass staggers causes spasms, the loss of muscles and paralysis. Dr Rendell says the disease typically spreads throughout southern Australia and rarely occurs north of Horsham. He says the disease will disappear when cooler temperatures return.

"At the moment, the key would be to avoid mustering for an extra couple of weeks and be aware that it could be a problem now when it normally isn't," Dr Rendell said. "The real issue is that I spoke to a few people about it and they said 'no, we've got no ryegrass staggers now' and if you're not looking for it, you don't see it. They've gone back and had a look and said 'cripes, they are showing signs'."

[This situation sounds like it could be annual ryegrass toxicity (ARGT). ARGT is very common, causes a more serious disease than ryegrass staggers, and results in more loss of livestock. Ryegrass staggers is not so common in Australia, although it is in the USA. Ryegrass staggers is not necessarily deadly. Believing the disease is ryegrass toxicity, not ryegrass staggers, then ARGT is associated with ingestion of toxins (corynetoxins) present in _Lolium rigidum_ (annual ryegrass) and not _L. perenne_ (perennial ryegrass).

The toxins of _L. rigidum_ have a mysterious origin, in that they are produced by the bacterium _Rathayibacter toxicus_, which infects _L. rigidum_ via its vector, the nematode _Anguina funesta_.
