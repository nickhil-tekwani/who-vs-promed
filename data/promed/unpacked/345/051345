[The self-declaration above from Belgium about the recovery of its bluetongue-free status follows similar declarations from Germany, the Netherlands, and France; all, stating a regained free status, with effect from 15 Feb 2012. Belgium was the 1st country to announce the discovery of bluetongue disease in 2006 (see ProMED-mail posting 20060819.2316).

All 4 countries were initially infected by BTV-8 in 2006. The origin and route of introduction remain to be clarified. The disease was eventually controlled (eradicated?) by compulsory mass vaccinations. - Mod.AS
