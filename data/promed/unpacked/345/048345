Scientific Commission of the OIE* Approves the Technical Report from SENASA**
--------------------
*OIE: Office Internacional des Epizooties / International Organisation for
Animal Health
**SENASA: Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria / National
Service for Health and Quality of Agricultural Food Products
The Scientific Commission for Land Animals of the OIE decided today in
Paris to restore Argentina the status of "country free of foot and mouth
disease with vaccination" north of the 42nd parallel, since south of this
latitude, the country is free of foot and mouth disease without vaccination.
After reviewing the report of SENASA presented in October 2004, the
Commission approved the immediate restoration to Argentina of its status.
The decision of the Commission was based in the recommendation of an ad-hoc
Group of the OIE. Such ad-hoc groups are convened by the Head of the OIE to
decide specific scientific and technical issues.
When receiving the communication from OIE, Mr. Jorge Amaya, Head of SENASA,
stated that now Argentina is in a better position to strengthen its own
sanitary programs as well as those of the region, and the number of
potential countries buying Argentinian meat products may also
increase. Mr. Amaya also highlighted the important role of SENASA
technicians in achieving this status.
In September 2003, after detection of foot and mouth disease in pigs in
Tartagal, Argentina lost its status of country free of foot and mouth
disease with vaccination north of the 42nd parallel.
On 12 Jan 2005, the Permanent Committee for Food Products and Animal
Sanitation of the European Union [European Food Safety Authority] voted to
modify Decision 79/542/CEE in order to include Chaco, Formosa, Jujuy, and
Salta provinces within the Argentinian regions approved for exporting boned
and preserved meat products to the European Union.
