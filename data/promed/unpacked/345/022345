Pakistan Denies Ebola Fever Report
----------------------------------
Pakistan's Federal Health Secretary, Ejaz Rahim, has denied a news item
published in The Telegraph on 1 Dec 2000, reporting that Ebola virus had
killed 9 people in Pakistan. "Not a single case of Ebola virus [infection
has been reported nor have any lives been claimed by it in Pakistan," said
Mr Rahim. There were said to have been "a couple" of cases of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus in Karachi.

[Ebola hemorrhagic fever has not occurred outside the African continent so
far.
Previous reports posted in ProMED-mail of an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever
in Baluchistan, contained references (edited out) from local sources to an
"Ebola-like disease". Extensive enquiries by ProMED-mail at that time
failed to substantiate these statements. The evidence is consistent with
the occurrence of an outbreak due to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus.
