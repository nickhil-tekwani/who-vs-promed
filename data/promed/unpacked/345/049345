Another 5 farms located in the departments of the Creuse and Puy-de-Dome were confirmed suffering from bluetongue serotype 8. These farms were diagnosed after samples taken at the "National Charolais" competition held at Mans on 12 and 13 Sep 2015 [see commentary].

In total, in addition to the 1st outbreak detected in Allier and the 11 infected herds detected within 2 km [1.25 mi] of this focus, 3 additional farms in the Allier, 2 in the Puy-de-Dome, and one in the Creuse have been declared infected, totalling 18 farms. The areas declared as protection and surveillance zones have therefore been amended, taking into account this development (see map available at the source URL). The definition of the infected zone will be confirmed by the prefectural orders made in the relevant departments.

A scheduled monitoring at the national level is being established on the basis of samples for viral research by PCR in 60 farms by administrative region. The details of this monitoring are available in a statement published by on 18 Sep 2015 (link to be published). The same instruction provides enhanced clinical surveillance nationwide. A page of questions and answers on the current situation has been published on the Ministry of Agriculture's website [http://agriculture.gouv.fr/questionsreponses-sur-le-cas-de-fievre-catarrhale-ovine-fco-detecte-dans-lallier].

The more detailed analysis of PCR results obtained from samples taken in the farms located within 2 km [1.25 mi] of the 1st breeding farm detected in Allier confirms a higher prevalence of infection in cattle than in sheep. This is consistent with what was known for this serotype (see Figure 2 [at the source URL above]). These results were obtained on a limited number of samples from 11 farms (including the 1st affected farm) and need to be consolidated (see Figure 3 [at the source URL above]).

[On Fri 18 Sep 2015, France submitted to the OIE its follow-up report no 1 on the BTV-8 outbreak, reporting 14 new outbreaks in cattle units and 3 on sheep farms. The affected administrative departments are Alier (14 outbreaks), Puy-de-Dome (2), and Creuse (1). See, with interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=18684.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 17
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 437 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0
Cattle / 3493 / 42 / 0 / 0 / 0

According to the report, no vaccination was performed prior to the outbreak ("no vaccination" among "measures applied").
Under "Measures to be applied," the following 2 measures are mentioned:
1. Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)
2. Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone.

Sequencing results of the current BTV-8 strain may help in clarifying if it is the same one which caused the major 2007-2008 epizootic (indicative of a possible residual, unnoticed circulation?) or a new introduction. - Mod.AS
