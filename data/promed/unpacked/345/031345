UK: Antibodies to West Nile Virus, Usutu Virus, and Sindbis Virus in Wild Birds
---------------------------------------------------
Viruses causing potentially deadly diseases [caused by West Nile virus and
others] are entering Britain, a leading expert has claimed. Professor
Ernest Gould, who works at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Oxford,
says he has found signs of such viruses in birds. He carried out tests on
30 species of birds across the country and found antibodies in 50 percent
of birds. But Professor Gould said there was no evidence of any risk to
animals or humans.
"We have found antibodies to West Nile virus, Usutu virus, and Sindbis
virus," he told BBC News Online. "Infection in these birds was
sub-clinical, which means they were healthy, but the antibodies suggest
they have been exposed to these diseases."
West Nile virus is transmitted by mosquitoes which feed on virus-infected
birds. It is normally found in Africa but has recently emerged in the
United States. While most humans who contract the virus by mosquito bite do
not suffer illness, it can cause encephalitis, meningitis, and death.
Usutu virus is also transmitted by mosquitoes. This disease has rarely been
found outside Africa. However, an outbreak in Austria in 2001 killed
thousands of birds. The risks to humans are unknown.
Sindbis virus was recently discovered in birds in Scandinavia. It can cause
fever in humans and has been linked to a form of arthritis.
"These viruses are being moved by birds and mosquitoes," said Professor
Gould. "They are probably coming into this country [with migrating birds]."
Professor Gould and colleagues at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology are
now carrying out further tests to see whether there is any threat to people
living in Britain. "So far, no associated disease in humans has been
identified. We don't have any evidence that is, but that is not to say it
isn't happening." Professor Gould stated that increased travel and
increasing urbanisation are helping to spread these diseases. "We are being
exposed more frequently to more viruses, and this is because of increased
movement. There is a risk."
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) carries out checks on animals to see
whether they are carrying diseases that may pose a threat to humans. A
spokesman said: "Although there continues to be some concern over the
theoretical possibility of human infection from West Nile virus in the UK,
the risk of this is considered to be low, and no endemic cases have ever
been reported.
"However, the HPA carries out surveillance of infectious diseases all the
time." The Department of Health is drawing up plans to deal with any future
outbreak of West Nile virus in the UK. "This plan includes surveillance
measures, testing procedures, travel and health education advice, and
advice on effective methods of controlling the insect vectors of this
virus," said a spokesman. "All of the information in the strategy will be
based on the best advice available from both expert scientists and
government advisory committees."

[The original research relating to this report has already been reported in
ProMED-mail (see references below) and was published in the Journal of
General Virology for October 2003 (Buckley A, Dawson A, Moss SR, Hinsley
SA, Bellamy PE, Gould EA. Serological evidence of West Nile virus, Usutu
virus and Sindbis virus infection of birds in the UK. Journal of General
Virology, 84, 2807-2817, 2003).
The apparent absence of disease in British wild birds infected with
arthropod-borne virus -- in contrast to the behavior of introduced West
Nile virus in North America and Usutu virus in Austria -- is striking. To
what extent this phenomenon may be due to genetic differences in the
virulence of virus strains, to routes of transmission, or to vector
specificity are intriguing questions for further investigation. While there
is a perceived risk of transmission of these viruses to the human
population in the UK, it is not clear from this report whether surveys have
been carried out to detect specific antibodies to these 3 viruses in human
serum. The report does not indicate whether any one of these 3 viruses has
yet been isolated from any species of wild bird in the UK. A update on this
research would be appreciated.- Mod.CP]
