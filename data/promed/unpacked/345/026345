Ten people are admitted to various hospitals in Kisii County following an anthrax outbreak in Sugubo village, Bobasi constituency, a border of Kisii and Trans in Narok County.

The outbreak was reported on Thursday last week [5 Jan 2023] where at least 10 animals were confirmed dead. Agriculture County Executive [CEC] Magret Obaga said at least 10 cows died, increasing the fatalities to 13.

The county has deployed more veterinary officers to the region to carry out a free vaccination campaign to mitigate further deaths. "We have restricted animal movements as we roll out the vaccination campaign on Monday," the CEC indicated. The executive, however, said primary vaccination was being concentrated around Sugubo ahead of the official roll-out. The larger roll-out of the drive would take place at Nyamache Monday [9 Jan 2023].

Meanwhile, residents of Sugubo suspect cross-border interactions of the animals at the local market with those in Transmara has something to do with the outbreak. One household in the area said their animals were wiped out Saturday [7 Jan 2023] alone.

Many of those rushed to hospital are said to have feasted meat from the carcass. They are, however, out of danger, according to doctors attending to them. Obaga advised the residents to report any further incidents of the outbreak as preparations get underway to deal with it.

"We appeal those who present symptoms related to anthrax to seek medical treatment," the County CEC stated.

[Hopefully the livestock vaccination will get started tomorrow, 9 Jan [2023], as promised. Action is what matters, not words.

Latterly, Mahmoud sent me a report published 6 Oct 2022 entitled "Anthrax Scare in Kisii County" (https://mountkenyatimes.co.ke/anthrax-scare-in-kisii-county/).

This report has no detailed information as to what happened, but apparently at least one livestock outbreak had occurred in October or late September 2022. Again, much talk of action. And this was echoed in a flood of videos (see https://www.kenyamoja.com/video/kisii-county-government-gears-contain-anthrax-outbreak-nation-video-186101).

The local population may by now be aware of the risks of purchasing meat from privately slaughtered and butchered sick and dead livestock. Maybe.

Our thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
