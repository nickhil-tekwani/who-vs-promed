------------------------------------------------------------------
The following background data on Hepatitis C in Egypt are abstracted from Gideon [http://www.gideononline.com] and the Gideon e-book series. [1,2].

Incidence and prevalence
------------------------
Hepatitis C is the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in Egypt. The nationwide carriage rate in 1997 was estimated at 6 to 8 million, or 18.1 per cent of the population -- the highest rate in the world. A study published in 2010 estimated the yearly rate at 500 000 new cases (0.7 per cent of the population); while a study published in 2013 estimated the yearly rate at fewer than 150 000 cases. An analysis published in 2009 predicted that 127 821 deaths from chronic liver disease and 117 556 deaths from hepatocellular carcinoma would occur in Egypt over the next 20 years.

The high rate of hepatitis C infection in Egypt is largely attributed to previous mass-injection (antimony tartrate) treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis, which involved repeated use [of] non-sterilized needles. 84 per cent of patients who had received intravenous schistosomiasis therapy during the 1980s were found to be HCV-positive; and anti-_Schistosoma_ antibodies were found in 29 per cent of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection (2013 publication). There is also evidence for ongoing transmission of hepatitis C from parents to children co-infection by other hepatotropic viruses is common. 72.0 per cent of children with hepatitis C are seropositive toward hepatitis E virus. (2008 publication); and occult hepatitis B is present in 3.9 per cent of patients with hepatitis C (2010 publication).
