Date of previous occurrence: February 2008
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: Pending
Nature of diagnosis: Suspicion, Clinical, Laboratory (basic),
Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (Bet Halewi): Bet Halewi, Hasharon, Hamerkaz
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Feb 2009
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village

Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 650 / 40 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: There are 2 adjacent herds, one of 380 calves
and one of 270 heifers. The outbreak occurred in 40 calves. An
epidemiological investigation is ongoing. The calves showed signs as
salivation and fever.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1

Cattle / 6.15 percent / 0.00 / 0.00

Epidemiology;
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: A radius of 10 km around the farm has been
put under movement control of animals. The status of vaccination of
all the ruminants in this radius has been evaluated, and animals were
re-vaccinated when necessary.

Control measures
Measures applied
- Quarantine
- Movement control inside the country
- Screening
- Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)
- Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
- No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

[We are informed that the affected animals are young (less than a
year old) fattening calves and that no mortalities have been seen so
far. The animals have, most probably, not been vaccinated yet since
they were introduced (while at a very young age) into the feedlot at
a later date than the last annual vaccination there. The affected
farm is located in central Israel, close to several other cattle
operations, including dairy farms and fattening units (see map at the
above URL).

The Middle East is one of the heaviest FMD-infected regions on the
globe, with seroytypes O and A as the predominant virus types; FMDV
Asia 1 is also occasionally present. Exceptional incursions of
African serotypes (FMDV SAT1, SAT2) have been recorded in the past as
well (e.g. SAT 2: Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, 2000). A most useful
source of information on the FMD situation in the Middle East is available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/middle_east.html>.

Although Israel exercises a severe policy to prevent the introduction
of FMD, particularly to protect its record-yielding dairy cattle
(national production means in 2008 exceeding 11 000 kg milk/cow, with
about 100 000 cows in lactation), outbreaks of FMD have been recorded
during 18 out of the 24 years between 1982 and 2008. This included
only one outbreak in a dairy farm.

Since the early 1970's, the most prevalent serotype recorded in
Israel has been FMDV-0, found in cattle, sheep, goats, gazelles, pigs
and wild boars. FMDV serotype A22 has not been seen in Israel since
its last recording in 1981. FMDV serotype Asia 1 has been last
recorded during 1984 and 1989, infecting beef (2 herds) and dairy
(one herd) cattle. Serotype SAT-1 was last recorded in 1962.

A remarkable feature of FMD in Israel is its seasonality (in large
and small ruminants). 1st (primary) cases during the season usually
appear in December-February, and if spreading, the peak of the
epizootic will be seen in April-June (70-75 percent of all annual
totals). Since 1974, not a single case has been recorded in November.
The reasons for that puzzling phenomenon have not been clarified so
far. The said seasonality is also reflected in ProMED-mail's reports
(presented in "see also," further): out of the 29 postings addressing
FMD in Israel since 1998, 28 were issued during the months
December-May (of which 13 primary outbreaks were in January).

About 70 percent of primary outbreaks of FMD in Israel are seen in
areas adjacent to the northern frontiers, bordering Lebanon and
Syria. The current outbreak is, chronologically, not exceptional, but
its geography is rather unusual, probably not being the primary
outbreak of the season but the 1st one to be detected.

Results of the serotyping and additional epidemiological data,
particularly concerning the possible source and route of the virus
introduction, are expected.

The Israeli FMD vaccination scheme includes annual vaccination of all
cattle over the age of 3 months during October to December, applying
an oil-emulsion vaccine. Since 2006, the following strains were
included in the vaccine: O1 Geshur 85; O1 Manisa; O1 3039; A22 Iraq
87; A Iran 96; Asia 1 Shamir. Small ruminants are compulsorily
annually vaccinated as well but only against serotype O1. - Mod.AS]
