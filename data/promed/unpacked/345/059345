Given the resurgence of equine encephalitis in the south, staff of the [Honduras] National Agricultural Health Service (SENASA) is conducting an immunization campaign in order to prevent more animal deaths. The regional director of SENASA, Arturo Vasquez, confirmed the equine disease in Pespire municipality and Linaca village, in the municipality [and department] of Choluteca.

Vasquez said that the veterinary brigade is fighting the disease in the affected areas, since there are 5 dead animals and equine encephalitis [virus] is transmissible to other horses. He said equine encephalitis is transmitted by a [mosquito] vector.
The 1st case of the disease occurred in the Gulf area and was eradicated at the time, but it has now reappeared, so appropriate measures are being taken.

"2 years ago we immunized about 2000 animals against the disease and we thought we had eradicated the disease, but this outbreak of equine encephalitis has reappeared and, therefore, we are undertaking more immunization in Linaca and Pespire," he said.

[Although the type of equine encephalitis virus involved in these cases is not mentioned, it is probably Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE). Encephalitis in equine animals due to eastern (EEE), western equine encephalitis, or West Nile viruses have not been reported in equine animals in Honduras, although there were equine cases of EEE virus infection in Panama as recently as last year (2013) and human cases in 2010. There have been equine cases of encephalitis due to VEE virus infections reported in Honduras in 1998, 2002, and 2003.

Unfortunately, the subtype of VEE virus involved in these cases or the current ones was not reported. This is epidemiologically important since the different subtypes have different animal reservoirs and mosquito vectors. Subtypes IAB and IC are of greatest concern because horses themselves are amplifying hosts and can experience massive epizootics with spill-over to human populations.

There is a live, attenuated vaccine available for equine use as well as inactivated, trivalent vaccines that includes VEE virus. Because outbreaks are sporadic, it is difficult to get horse owners to maintain good herd immunity through regular vaccinations over a long period of time. There are excellent, detailed comments about VEE virus, its subtypes and epidemiology in the moderator comments in the ProMED-mail posts cited below. - Mod.TY
