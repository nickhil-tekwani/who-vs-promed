[The identification of PPR in Bhutan should not surprise. In fact,
the disease is long known to circulate in small ruminants in several
other countries in the Indian subcontinent and in adjacent parts of
central Asia without being officially notified. Additional, similar
notifications from such countries are to be expected. - Mod.AS]

[According to the OIE WAHID database, Bangladesh has reported the
presence of the disease but has not provided counts since 2007. India
has regularly reported hundreds of cases every years since 2006.
Tibet reported hundreds of outbreaks in 2006 and 2007 but only Tibet
reported 5 outbreaks in 2007 and 2008 but none since then until last
month, June 2010. Nepal reported hundreds of outbreaks in 2006 and
2007; 13 in 2008 and 143 in 2009. Only Myanmar has not reported any
cases in the past 5 years. - Mod.PC]
