The Jujuy provincial minister of health yesterday [Mon 14 Jan 2019] confirmed a hantavirus [infection] case in San Pedro. This is one of the 4 suspected cases evaluated in this Ramallo city and was diagnosed in a 56-year-old patient who is being treated and is progressing well.

This was confirmed for El Tribuno in Jujuy by the subsecretariat for Health Promotion, Prevention, and Attention, Veronica Serra, who stated that there were 4 suspected hantavirus [infection] cases in the province: 3 in the public sector that were negative and one in the private sector that was positive. "Recently, yesterday afternoon, the diagnosis was confirmed for a patient hospitalized in the Santa Maria Clinic in San Pedro, who is being treated and is progressing favorably," the official stated.

She also explained that there is blocking work now, but all epidemiological research will start today [Tue 15 Jan 2019] in the morning.

Serra also remarked that this specific case is different from the type of hantavirus that is circulating in Chubut province and is a milder strain. "The one circulating in Jujuy is a completely different strain [species] than the hantavirus in the south. The transmission of the hantavirus that we have in the province occurs via aspiration of urine of the rodent, not person-to-person as is occurring in the south [See the Chubut comments below. - Mod.TY]. It is a variant of the disease that is milder as for its transmission," she said.

In Jujuy province last year [2018], 7 cases of hantavirus [infection] were registered, the majority on the Ramal and Valles area. "In 2018 there were 4 cases in Libertador General San Martin, one in San Pedro, one in El Carmen, and the other in Cochinoca department, of which none were fatal; all were treated and progressed favorably."

The health office requests adoption of extreme security measures in order to avoid future cases.

The 1st symptoms are similar to those of flu: high fever, chills, muscular pain, headache, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, but without upper respiratory tract (cold) symptoms. This mild picture may evolve to cases with severe cardiopulmonary effects.

Some of the recommendations in order to prevent the infection [include]
- Avoid living with rodents and contact with their secretions.
- Avoid entry of rodents and nest-making in houses.
- Close openings in doors, walls, and around pipes.
- Perform cleaning with one part of bleach to 9 parts of water (let stand for 30 minutes and later rinse). Wet the floor before sweeping it in order to not raise dust.
- Ventilate for at least 30 minutes before entering places that have been closed (houses or sheds). Cover the nose and mouth with a damp handkerchief or respiratory mask before entering.
- Take special care when starting up fans or air conditioners whose filters or ducts could have been in contact with [virus] contaminated dust, rodents, or their excreta.

Hantavirus infections represent an emerging zoonosis transmitted to humans by rodents infected with the virus. The natural reservoirs of the infection [virus] are certain wild rodents that have a chronic, asymptomatic infection with persistent viremia and shed the virus in urine, saliva, and excrement.

In Argentina, 2 species of hantaviruses circulate (Andes and Laguna Negra). [This is not correct; there are several more. See comments below. - Mod.TY].

The hantaviruses are fundamentally transmitted by inhalation of aerosols carrying virus particles coming from feces, urine, and saliva of infected rodents. Other possible routes of transmission are contact of conjunctival, nasal, or oral mucosas with the secretions of infected rodents, or by the bite of an infected rodent.

There is evidence for person-to-person transmission (Andes virus, in the south in Epuyen), and because of this, the secretions of human fluids should be considered dangerous.

[This report apparently presumes that the hantavirus involved in this case is Laguna Negra, although it is not stated that this virus has been laboratory confirmed. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_); and Laguna Negra (in northern Argentina in _Calomys laucha_).

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case. - Mod. TY]

The death of a man in Salta province on Tuesday [15 Jan 2019] brings the total number of dead in Argentina as a result of the latest outbreak of hantavirus [infections] to 11; 28 people with the virus remain in hospital under observation.

A man died in Tartagal hospital in Salta province on Tuesday [15 Jan 2019] after a week spent in the hospital, Doctor Viviana Heredia confirmed to local media. Another patient, a 19-year-old man, is isolated in the same hospital. He appeared with a high fever and headaches, local newspaper El Tribuno reported.

"We have no evidence that the virus has been transmitted person-to-person like in Chubut (province), but we do know that it is transmitted in rat feces and urine, which is why people must avoid food contamination and entering places where rats may have been," Dr Heredia said.

Hantavirus is also known as Orthohantavirus. Humans can contract the virus, which infects rodents but does not cause disease in them, as a result of contact with rodent urine, saliva, or feces.

[There were several cases of hantavirus infections scattered over the province last year (2018). A total of 21 confirmed cases of hantavirus infections, with 7 deaths from the disease, were registered in the entire province since 1 Jan 2018. The confirmed cases corresponded to localities in Oran, Tartagal, Pichanal, Colonia Santa Rosa, Apolinario Saravia, and Irigoyen. The patients ranged from 22-52 years of age. Although the hantavirus involved is not mentioned, since the report indicates that the cases have occurred in Salta province, including Oran, Oran virus seems likely.

Although rodents were mentioned as possible hosts in the report above, the rodent host of the suspected hantavirus endemic in this area was not reported but likely is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _O. longicaudatus_.

Argentina is on lockdown after a deadly virus typically found in rodents has spread to humans, killing 12. A dozen deaths have already been confirmed following a horrific outbreak of the so-called hantavirus, a dangerous disease that affects the pulmonary system after patients become infected through the faeces and urine of rats. Horrifying symptoms, which come on in stages and begin with a fever before ending with haemorrhaging organs, spread at a frighteningly fast rate. The 1st death was a 25-year-old man on Wednesday morning [16 Jan 2019], and another 11 had been announced in just 24 hours. The outbreak happened in the northeast Argentine province of Entre Rios, medical sources have confirmed. Health officials are in the process of battling to control the illness.

The Secretary of Health of Argentina, Adolfo Rubinstein, said in a local radio interview: "Fundamentally, up to now, the route of contagion was the sporadic cases by inhalation of mice secretions. The difference is that it is interhuman contagion; this is what is much more worrisome from the epidemiological point of view."

He also said that the government suspects the Hantavirus outbreak is a "mutation" since "interhuman contagion" can occur.

He stressed that the patients go through a "very serious condition" since this outbreak is registering a "very high mortality, of more than 40%."

He also said the chain of symptoms in humans began when a couple shared a table at a restaurant, which triggered the virus after germs were transited between the pair.

The disease is transmitted by contact with urine, saliva, and droppings of rodents infected with the virus. For transmission between people, a close contact must be made with the patients in the initial period of the febrile episode, which goes from the first 48-72 hours.

The route of propagation is inhalation, so kisses and hugs can get people infected, as well as the saliva particles when speaking. Other symptoms include muscular pains, chills, headaches, nausea, or diarrhoea.

The deer mouse, the white-footed mouse, the rice rat, and the cotton rat are the only types of rodents capable of passing the virus onto humans, with the breeds prominent in Argentina and other areas of South America. [This is incorrect. None of these species occur in Argentina. The deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniiculatus_) and the white-footed mouse (_P. leucopus_) are distributed from Canada to Mexico. The rice rats, several species in the genus _Oryzomys_, and cotton rats, several species in the genus _Sigmodon_, occur from the USA to northern South America. Several other species are hosts of various hantaviruses in Argentina that can infect humans (see the list in the comment above). - Mod.TY].

[There have been a few sporadic cases of hantavirus infection in Entre Rios province in the past. In 2011, there were 4 confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the province, 2 of which died (see ProMED-mail Hantavirus update 2011 - Americas (26): Chile, Argentina, USA 20110523.1562). In 2013, there was a single case there. The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current ones above, are not specified. This report states that the 12 cases were confirmed, but the specific hantavirus involved is not mentioned, nor if the confirmation was made on clinical grounds or by laboratory test (and if so, which test). The unusual human-to-human transmission raises several questions that are discussed below for this Entre Rios outbreak and for the one in Chubut province. - Mod.TY]

[Dr. Clement responded to Mod.TY's comments about the unusual nature of the Chubut outbreak with a large number of purported person-to-person transmissions in Epuyen, Chubut. There, health officials in a previous report hypothesize that the outbreak is due to human-to-human transmission, which would be unusual. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. Transmission of the virus person-to-person at a party would seem unlikely, making one wonder if either a different virus or pathogen is involved or if there was significant contamination of a common food source at the party where the transmission took place. The most common source of Andes hantavirus infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat or its excretions. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region.]

15 Jan 2019 comments

The 2nd hypothesis (food contamination by an infected rodent reservoir) looks like the most probable: different hantaviruses, or even different viruses, or not "running the streets." If so (i.e., food contamination), the source should be "easy" to find by a meticulous epidemiological investigation involving all party members.

There are (scarce) indications that hantaviruses can infect humans via the G-I [gastrointestinal] tract. The only risk factor that might be common to all hantaviruses is perhaps smoking (with hand-to-mouth transmission), demonstrated in the 1st European hantavirus case-control study for Puumala virus (PUUV; see Van Loock F, Thomas I, Clement J, Ghoos S, Colson P: A case-control study after a hantavirus outbreak in the South of Belgium: Who is at risk? Clin Inf Dis 1999;28:834-839) and confirmed afterwards by several case-control Finnish studies for PUUV, but not considered in American studies so far.

When rats and contaminated food illness outbreaks are mentioned together, "Haverhill fever" comes to my mind, but this is a bacterial, not a viral, illness and is almost never fatal: see text Wikipedia hereunder and Clement J, Frans J, Van Ranst M. Human Tula virus infection or rat-bite fever? Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis 2003;22:332. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-003-0921-7:

Haverhill fever (or epidemic arthritic erythema) is a form of "rat-bite fever" caused by the bacterium _Streptobacillus moniliformis_, an organism common in rats and mice. Symptoms begin to appear 2-10 days after a rat-bite injury. The illness resembles a severe influenza, with a moderate fever (38-40 deg C, or 101-104 deg F), chills, joint pain, and a diffuse red rash located mostly on the hands and feet. The causative organism can be isolated by blood culture, and penicillin is the most common treatment. Treatment is usually quite successful, although the body can clear the infection by itself in most cases. Complications are rare but can include endocarditis and meningitis. Despite its name, it can present without being bitten by a rat [1].

The disease was recognized from an outbreak that occurred in Haverhill, Massachusetts, in January 1926 [2]. The organism _S. moniliformis_ was isolated from the patients. Epidemiology implicated infection via consumption of milk from one particular dairy [3].

Yes, this outbreak is highly unusual, but what are finally the arguments that this (lethal) outbreak in Patagonia is all hantavirus indeed? Were all "positive" cases, a fortiori the 9 fatal cases, positive for IgM, and if so, for which hantaviral antigen? Was PCR applied on these positive IgM samples? Which were other (lethal) pathogens excluded hitherto?

There are quite some articles documenting pathogenic hantaviruses after HFRS in human saliva (see PubMed), but human-to-human hantaviral transmission via this way has, to my knowledge, never been documented so far, let alone a massive outbreak with 60 infections and 9 fatalities. Moreover, incurring HFRS (or HPS?) via this way supposes "intensive" kissing with swallowing part of the infected partner's saliva: inconceivable for a massive outbreak, even for a tumultuous teenager's birthday party.

That brings us to hantaviral transmission via the G-I tract, a more plausible way for a birthday party with a supposedly hantavirus-contaminated common food source. The "suspect" food has to have been cold (ice cream?); however, because warming up to greater than 60 deg C [140 deg F] destroys pathogenicity of hantaviruses but preserves their antigenic properties, thus their use for diagnostic tests. However, even demonstrating pathogenic hantavirus in the G-I tract proves nothing, since in a German study (annex), the presence of pathogenic hantaviruses (PUUV) during HFRS in the gut was not any way related to, e.g., acute kidney injury (AKI): it reflects probably only the local cause of intestinal swelling (appendix included) resulting in severe abdominal cramps and even ascites forming, as seen both in HFRS as in HPS.

On the other hand, literature describing HFRS or HPS outbreaks after ingesta of hantavirus-contaminated food is extremely poor and remains a fascinating source for research. I found only this:

Mesic S, Almedin H: Investigation of modes of hantavirus infection transmission from rodents to humans. Med Arh. 2008; 62(4): 229-30.

[Article in Bosnian]

Abstract
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a focal zoonosis of viral etiology that appears in many countries of the world. Investigation has demonstrated that, for an epidemic of HFRS, it is necessary to have intensity of the epizootic process. The increased number of mice-like rodents in enzootic foci of HFRS is the most important factor. This investigation pointed out to a high risk of direct contact with rodent secrets, from visible urine and feces traces of rodents that are present in a large number of patients, in 422 patients, or 69.29%. Results of this investigation demonstrate that hantavirus infection can be spread by infectious droplets as in areas with an increased number of rodents. In this manner, 65 people, or 10.67%, got HFRS in the investigated period. The food, if it is exposed to the rodent contamination, can be a way of transmitting infection and HFRS. This investigation determined this way of transmitting infection in 64 persons, or 10.50%. As a possible way to transmit the infection with drinking water contaminated by rodent excreta, 40 patients got the disease, or 6.58% out of the total number.

PMID:19145808

My suspicion is that this outbreak is not due to a hantavirus. But if it is indeed, it is a major new finding. I am curious to get the results from Argentina.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Clement for his comments. The questions he raises are critical in understanding what has been going on in this highly unusual outbreak. - Mod.TY]

[It is important to know if the hantaviruses involved in the Chubut and the Entre Rios outbreaks, where person-to-person transmission is postulated, have been isolated or identified by PCR. Comparison of virus sequences with known Andes and other hantaviruses will be critical in order to find out if a mutant of Andes virus is involved in Chubut, as one health authority proposed, or another hantavirus is responsible in Entre Rios. ProMED would be interested in receiving information about the types of tests employed and the results obtained from them.
