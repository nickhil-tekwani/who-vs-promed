Over 100 pigs died of swine fever, suspected poisoning: Malaysian official
-----------------------------------------------
The cause of death of over 100 pigs in Kampung Paya Mengkuang in Alor Gajah
was due to acute swine fever and suspected poisoning, early reports said.
State Chairman for Human Resources, Health and Consumer Affairs, Seah Kwi
Tong urged the people not to panic, as the deaths had nothing to do with
the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus. "The deaths occurred in a single shed
and did not spread to surrounding sheds or to humans," he told reporters on
Wednesday [26 Jan 2005]. He was commenting on reports by several newspapers
on the deaths of 120 pigs in a farm in the village over the last 5 days. He
said the initial reports were based on post-mortem conducted on 2 carcasses
by a private doctor from Shah Alam, Selangor.
As a precautionary measure, the movement of the pigs in the farm had been
restricted since last Sunday [23 Jan 2005]. Seah said samples of the pigs'
organs, urine and consumed food had also been taken by the Veterinary
Research Institute in Ipoh for investigation.
Paya Mengkuang, which is the biggest pig farming district in Melaka, was
hit by an outbreak of JE several years ago.

[The significant importance of Japanese encephalitis is its zoonotic
nature; Nipah should be ruled out as well. Data on the final diagnosis in
this case will be appreciated. - Mod.AS].
