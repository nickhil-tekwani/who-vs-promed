The 2000 National PPV survey has now been completed. Sampling was
conducted in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia.
Additional positive sites [were identified in Ontario in recent weeks, and
one positive sample [was identified in Nova Scotia. No positives were
found in British
Columbia or Quebec.
Samples were tested by the CFIA Centre for Animal and Plant Health in
Charlottetown, P.E.I., in addition to CFIA laboratories in Sidney, B.C. and
Nepean, Ontario. Sample preparation support was provided by laboratories of
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in Summerland, British Columbia and
Vineland, Ontario.
As of 14 Nov 2000, the following results were obtained:
Total PPV-susceptible Prunus Samples Collected
Ontario 100 913
British Columbia 9048
Quebec 816
Nova Scotia 1377

[The test method used in the survey was a triple antibody sandwich ELISA
using an anti-PPV polyclonal antiserum for trapping the antigen, a
monoclonal antibody (5B-IVIA, Durviz s.l, Spain) as the secondary antibody
and goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate as the tertiary
antibody. 5B detects all known PPV serotypes including (D [apricot,
France, M [peach, Greece, SP [peach. France, EA [Egypt, and C [sour
cherry, Moldova, a.k.a. SoC) but does not bind to other potyviruses. The
only strain detected in the Canadian survey was the D strain. The disease
seems widely distributed in Ontario and has also been detected in a
confined area in Nova Scotia. The apparent absence of the virus in British
Columbia and Quebec will likely call for continued surveying as part of a
national strategy for managing the disease. - Mod.DH
