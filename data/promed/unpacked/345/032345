Botswana has confirmed an outbreak of animal sleeping sickness (nagana)
which has so far killed 21 heads of cattle in the country's remote northern
part. The deputy director of animal health and production, Dr. Kereng
Masupu, has said the cattle disease, which is caused by tsetse fly, has hit
the Okavango and Ngamiland. He revealed the disease was first detected in
October and spread to other areas. This is the first time the disease has
occurred in the area.
According to him, the recent heavy rains and floods have hindered control
efforts because some areas had been rendered inaccessible for insecticide
spraying. The department was using insecticides to control the tsetse fly,
as well as undertaking intensive trypanosomiasis surveillance in the area
with the aim of treating infected animals. The nagana outbreak is the
second animal disease to hit the region in recent years following the
cattle lung disease, which was, however, successfully eradicated.
As a result of the lung disease, new animals have since restocked the area.
But farmers in the area have expressed fears the animals given to them
under the restocking exercise could be vulnerable to the disease because
they were from areas free of nagana. However, Masupu dismissed such
sentiments, saying all animals are susceptible to the disease.

[The tsetse flies, _Glossina_ spp, are important blood-feeding flies found
in many areas of Africa. The male and female tsetse fly are both avid blood
feeders. All species of _Glossinia_ feed on vertebrate blood. Tsetse flies
serve as the intermediate hosts for several species of trypanosomes causing
fatal disease of both domestic animals (nagana) and man (African sleeping
sickness). Trypanosomes invade the blood, lymph, cerebral spinal fluid, and
various organs of the body, such as the liver and spleen.
Nagana, a related complex in cattle, caused by _Trypanosoma brucei_ has
occurred over enormous areas estimated to be as great as one quarter of the
African continent. The disease is fatal to horses, mules, camels, and dogs.
Cattle sheep and goats usually survive, except when parasitized by certain
strains. Many of the wild ungulates native to Africa show no evidence of harm.
The tsetse fly can be controlled by catching and trapping, bush clearing,
fly screens, repellents, insecticides, and sterile male release techniques.
