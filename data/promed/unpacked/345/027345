The number of congenital syphilis cases has ballooned to rates not seen in 2 decades. Public health workers say the increase coincides with a decline in funding for public health and a drop in the rate of women accessing prenatal care.

In the Central Valley, where 2/3 of the nation's fruit and nuts are grown, the pastoral landscape masks entrenched racial and economic disparities. Life expectancy in Fresno County drops by 20 years depending on where you live, and it's those who live in historically poor, redlined, or rural neighborhoods who are most impacted by a resurgence of maternal and congenital syphilis.

Fresno was the 1st county to sound the alarm, alerting the state health department in 2015 when the number of cases more than doubled in one year. It has only gotten worse since then. Today, California has the 6th-highest rate of congenital syphilis in the country, with rates increasing every year. In 2020, 107 cases per 100 000 live births were reported, a staggering 11-fold increase from a decade prior. That rate far exceeds the California Department of Public Health's 2020 target to keep congenital syphilis numbers below 9.6 cases per 100 000 live births -- a goal it outstripped almost as soon as it was set.

Even more shockingly, the syphilis rate among women of childbearing age was 53 times higher than the 2020 goal.

"When they rank developed nations on health measures, the indicators always include sexually transmitted diseases. And we're failing." At one point in the late 1990s, rates were so low across the US that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thought syphilis among men and women could be effectively eradicated from the population. After all, in many cases, a single shot of penicillin is all that's needed to curb the infection. But at both the national and state level, public health departments were overstretched and woefully underfunded. People slipped through the cracks, and sexually transmitted infections of all types began to skyrocket once more.

Increasing case rates have also gone hand-in-hand with increasing rates of homelessness and methamphetamine use. Inadequate prenatal care is the no. 1 predictor for maternal and congenital syphilis. It is a disease whose reemergence signifies severely inadequate access to health and social services systems.

In 2019, the most recent year detailed state data is available, 37 syphilis babies were stillborn and 446 were infected. Black babies were 3 times more likely to be born with syphilis compared to the statewide rate, while Hispanic babies made up nearly 50% of all cases. (Native American infants were not included in this calculation because numbers are too low to be statistically stable.)

It can be easy to blame women's choices for increasing rates, but the truth is much more complicated. The CDC noted in its 2020 Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance report that "these disparities are unlikely explained by differences in sexual behavior and rather reflect differential access to quality sexual health care."

It's hard to pinpoint one reason for the resurgence of this and other sexually transmitted infections, which have also reached record-setting numbers, but high on the list are barriers to health care. In a recent study led by state health department researchers, babies born in the poorest census tracts in the state experienced congenital syphilis at 17 times the rate of those born in the most affluent census tracts. "This is a reflection of holes in our safety net, and it's a reflection of all the different social determinants of health that play into poor health outcomes," said Dr Ina Park, medical director for the California Prevention Training Center at UC San Francisco and co-author of the CDC's 2020 sexually transmitted infection treatment guidelines. Park was not involved in the study.

Those social determinants of health -- or barriers such as housing instability or lack of insurance -- lead to missed opportunities to stop the infection from spreading. In the 1st 2 years of California's outbreak, between 2012 and 2014, nearly 1/3 of mothers who gave birth to babies with syphilis were never tested before delivery, and 1/3 were tested less than 40 days before giving birth. In contrast, every mother who gave birth to syphilis-free babies was tested early in their pregnancy, according to state researchers.

Those disparities haven't budged in the ensuing years. In 2018 more than 1/2 of pregnant women with syphilis had delayed or no prenatal care, according to a more recent analysis from the California Department of Public Health. Half reported methamphetamine use, and roughly half were recently incarcerated or homeless, the report said. "It is structurally a socioeconomic issue -- a race issue," said Jennifer Wagman, a UCLA researcher who in 2018 oversaw a study in Kern County aimed at identifying why women were missing prenatal care. "We're not seeing wealthy white women with (congenital syphilis) babies. It's just not happening," Wagman said.

Prior to the pandemic, public health funding was notoriously low. In the decade following the 2008 recession, state funding for public health dropped by 64%. Federal funding helped fill some of the gaps, but across the country money dedicated to sexually transmitted diseases has remained stagnant, with purchasing power decreasing by 40%. The year that Fresno County reported skyrocketing rates of congenital syphilis, state spending on infectious disease reached its lowest point in a decade. COVID-19 led to an explosive infusion of emergency funds, but public health money is typically siloed and can only be used for specific purposes.

In many instances, recession-era budget cuts equated to staffing cuts, reduced hours, and clinic closures. In 2017, a survey by the National Association of County and City Health Officials showed that 43% of local health agencies cut staffing and 1/3 reduced or eliminated services for sexually transmitted infection programs nationwide. No agency or organization tracks STD clinic closures in California, but anecdotally, health officials know it has happened. Fresno closed its full-service clinic in 2010. Kings County closed its HIV clinic later the same year. Sonoma County closed its HIV clinic in 2009.

More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic and monkeypox outbreak have only served to further stymie the state's public health workforce. Sexually transmitted infection investigators in particular were extremely valuable during the early days of the pandemic due to their experience with contact tracing. "The majority of the team was pulled to do contact tracing for COVID-19. Nurses were pulled to do testing and vaccinations," Vang said.

The same holds true at the state level in the health department's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Branch, which works to reduce the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. The branch hasn't released detailed infection data or reports since 2019 because half of the branch's staff were redirected to the COVID-19 emergency response. Now, monkeypox has further strained staff time and resources.

"Some staff remain redirected to the COVID-19 response more than 2.5 years later, and the program is still working to backfill these positions," spokesperson Ronald Owens said in a statement. "In addition, many other STD Control Branch staff are now currently redirected to monkeypox response." If she had all of the money in the world, Adams, the Fresno STD program director, said she would hire public health field nurses to work in tandem with her disease investigators and social services case workers.

The program had a taste of that in 2016 when the state sent extra resources its way. Nurses were able to provide syphilis treatments on-the-spot, a critical strategy since the 3-shot treatment many patients need must be given exactly 7 to 8 days apart and many patients miss follow-up appointments. If they miss a treatment, they have to start the antibiotic course from the beginning. "For a lot of clients it may be your one and only chance to help them when you have them," Adams said.

Case workers could also help patients find substance abuse treatment programs and with housing needs. By 2018, the combined forces of state, local, and even federal resources helped turn the outbreak around, but the funds dried up -- and then the pandemic hit. They lost their dedicated nurse. The case worker transferred to another department. A dual investigator and phlebotomist, who could do blood draws for testing, retired. Investigators were pulled for COVID-19 work. Now, they share resources with the tuberculosis and immunization teams, which limits their flexibility.

The most recent state budget included USD 30 million to combat syphilis and congenital syphilis. That number is USD 19 million less than what legislators originally proposed, but still represents the largest investment in combatting sexually transmitted infections in state history. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state legislators also approved USD 300 million annually for public health, filling some of the hole created during the Great Recession.

In a statement, Owens said the state health department will use the additional funding to work with local health departments. The money will likely be used to bolster existing programs and address racial disparities seen among babies with syphilis, Owens said.

There are other bright spots on the horizon, too. Last year [2021], Newsom signed into law a measure making California the 1st state to require insurance plans to cover at-home tests for sexually transmitted infections. Proponents of the measure say it's an important step toward eliminating testing barriers and bringing some services back to rural areas.

Still, considering the decade of underfunding coupled with population growth and more severe community needs, the latest infusion of money is only the start of what experts say is needed to stop the spread. California spent roughly USD 12.3 billion between 2020 and 2021 to combat COVID-19 in addition to USD 110 billion from the federal government, vastly outstripping the amount spent on infectious disease prevention prior to the pandemic: roughly USD 83 million.

The lack of public health resources pushed many of the testing and treatment responsibilities onto the primary care system, but most doctors aren't equipped to interpret the complex test results, which differ based on a patient's history of prior infection. Many primary care practices also don't offer treatment because it costs them thousands of dollars per dose to keep in stock.

[The US state of California's Central Valley, bounded by the Coast Ranges to the west and the Sierra Nevada to the east, is a broad, elongated, flat valley that is 40-60 mi (60-100 km) wide and approximately 450 mi (720 km) long, parallel to the Pacific coast of the state; it covers approximately 11% of California's land area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California)). It is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world and includes the cities of Sacramento, Stockton, Modesto, Merced, Fresno, Visalia, and Bakersfield. A map showing the location of the Central Valley can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Central+Valley.

For a discussion of the effects that underfunding public health has had on the increasing rates of congenital syphilis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED post Syphilis - USA (09): women, congenital, underfunding public health 20220415.8702637.

Poverty and other social factors have a big impact on rates of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases among women. The news report above clearly stresses the impact that funding cuts over many years to public health departments across the United States have had on their ability to control diseases like syphilis. - Mod.ML
