[The map included in the OIE report at the source URL above shows the location of the outbreak, right on the Georgian border in NW Azerbaijan.

In early June 2012 the Azerbaijani authorities issued an anthrax alert fearing the movement of infected animals across the border from Georgia. Clearly their fears were not ill founded. Since that report we were informed of some 41 human cases in Georgia, many in relation to Georgia's southern border provinces; see ProMED-mail posts 20120615.1169757 and 20120623.1178670. Unfortunately the border is porous. Reading between the lines of the OIE report and that the village stock had been vaccinated in January 2012, either the vaccination protection had not held up and immunity had waned -- normal protection should last 9 months but there are warnings about it not being effective at 6 months -- or it was an animal that had been missed or was purchased since January 2012. It could even have been a Georgian beast with a latent infection. Formally imports of Georgian cattle and meat are permitted with vaccination; imported stock are subject to 21 days of quarantine. For some reason this case was not in the "young stock" revaccination of July 2012, when 98 head were revaccinated. Pure speculation would be that this was an illegally imported beast whose existence was therefore hidden from the authorities and vaccination.

The disease is otherwise infrequent in Azerbaijan, with single outbreaks recorded in 2006, 2007 (with 17 human cases), 2008 (with 12 human cases), and a single human case with no reported livestock cases in 2010; no human or livestock cases were reported in 2011. Unfortunately, the disease is more active in Georgia and with significant numbers of human cases: 2006 (38 human cases); 2007 (42); 2008 (62); 2009 (38); 2010 (28); and 2011 (81 with one death).
