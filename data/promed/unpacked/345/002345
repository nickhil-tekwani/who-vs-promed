For some days (actually since Friday morning 2 January) we have been in
receipt of reliable information from various reputable sources indicating
that the major disease in the Wajira and Garissa areas is Rift Valley
Fever, and that the major international health agencies had been informed.
As soon as we have official confirmation from Kenya, confirmation will be
posted. We had delayed posting to allow WHO and the Kenyan government time
to disseminate this information in a timely manner.
