[Two of the 7 cases described in the above WHO updates gave a history of contact with camels, and a 3rd case gave a history of drinking raw camel's milk. These cases correspond with cases reported in MERS-CoV (05): Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO, RFI 20140710.2592792 and MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (04): Saudi Arabia, Iran, WHO 20140704.2585758, albeit there are some differences from the original reports on the Saudi MOH website for the cases reported on 5 and 6 Jul 2014: the 52-year-old male from Jeddah was reported on the Saudi MOH website on 4 Jul 2014, and the fatal case from Arar city was originally reported as a 73-year-old male. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update (United Arab Emirates), 14 Jul 2014
-------------------------
On [10 Jul 2014], the National IHR Focal Point for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the cases reported are as follows:
- A 67-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, UAE who became ill on [17 Jun 2014] and was admitted to a hospital on the same day. On [2 Jul 2014], the patient was critically ill and was admitted to the intensive care unit in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. He was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV infection on [6 Jul 2014]. The patient is reported to have underlying medical conditions. The patient owns a camel farm in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. He visited his farm 3 months prior to becoming ill and had direct contact with camels. Two weeks prior to becoming ill, he visited a camel farm in Abu Dhabi, where he did not have direct contact with camels. He does not have a history of contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV infection and does not have a history of recent travel. Investigation of the camel farm in Abu Dhabi and follow up of contacts of the patient are currently ongoing.
- A 50-year-old man residing in Abu Dhabi, UAE, who was identified as part of screening of contacts in a farm where a camel was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV infection, according to the report of the Ministry of Environment and Water on [26 Jun 2014]. The patient was screened for MERS-CoV infection on [3 Jul 2014]. The patient did not have any symptoms then. However, he developed a mild cough on [5 Jul 2014] and was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV infection on [6 Jul 2014]. He does not have a history of contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with MERS-CoV. Tracing of contacts of the patient and other contacts of the camel farm are ongoing.

Globally, 836 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 288 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO.

[The occurrence of 2 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in the UAE had been previously reported by both the HAAD (Health Authority of Abu Dhabi) and the media and were covered in MERS-CoV (05): Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO, RFI 20140710.2592792. But at the time of both reports, no details on either one of the cases was available. The above WHO update provides detailed information on these cases including information that both cases had a history of visiting a camel farm in the incubation period preceding onset of illness, although one case claimed not to have had direct contact with any camels during that visit. Of note, the other case was originally screened as an asymptomatic contact in a farm with a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected camel. One presumes the initial screening was negative, but re-screening after onset of a "mild cough" led to laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection in this individual. What is interesting is that it appears as though there is significant screening of both people and camels underway in the UAE. On 4 Jun 2014, there was a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO in a butcher working in a camel and sheep slaughterhouse in the UAE (MERS-CoV (01): Bangladesh, KSA, Algeria, UAE, Iran, WHO, RFI 20140616.2541707).

The above WHO updates cover those cases reported by Saudi Arabia to WHO as of 10 Jul 2014, bringing the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection maintained by WHO to 836 cases including at least 288 deaths. Since 10 Jul 2014, there have been no new cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by the Saudi MOH, nor any other country in the world, hopefully indicative of a slowing down of transmission of the MERS-CoV at the present time. Since then, there have been 2 additional deaths reported by Saudi Arabia in cases that had previously been reported, which would bring the global tally of deaths attributable to MERS-CoV infection to at least 290, representing a case fatality rate of 34.7 percent.
