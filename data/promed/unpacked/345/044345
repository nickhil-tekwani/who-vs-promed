Officials say 20 000 people have sought medical help from Zika virus [infection], but officials fear many more thousands could be infected.

Zika fever is a viral illness [the virus is related to other flaviviruses], similar to dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis [the Zika virus infection's clinical illness is different from yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis virus infection cases. Mod TY].

The head of the surveillance office in French Polynesia, Dr Henri-Pierre Mallet, says that among some people affected by Zika, 30 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome have also developed. "This means they are very likely linked with the epidemic of Zika and maybe associated with the epidemic of dengue that we face also, and, in this condition of viral infections circulating in the country, we have these cases of Guillain-Barre, which can be a serious disease."

Dr Mallet says Guillain-Barre can cause life-threatening complications, in particular if the respiratory muscles are affected or if the autonomic nervous system is involved.

[The Zika virus outbreak continues to increase. Dr Henri-Pierre Mallet has reported cases in the Society, Marquesas, and Tuamotu Islands since week 41 [7-13 Oct 2013]. The number of cases at that time was currently about 400. The islands affected at that time were: Tahiti, Moorea, Raiatea, Tahaa, Bora Bora, Nuku Hiva and Arutua (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131106.2041959).

As of 3 Dec 2013, the French Polynesia Department of Health reported 99 laboratory confirmed cases of Zika virus infections and 35 000 suspected cases of Zika fever (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131222.2131169). The above report does not indicate how many of the 20 000 illnesses have been confirmed as Zika virus infections. There is a mixed outbreak going on in French Polynesia caused by both Zika and dengue viruses.

It is not clear whether Dr Henri-Pierre Mallet thinks that the cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome he mentions are related causally to Zika virus infections or whether their occurrences are coincidental.

[Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a post-infectious ascending demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy that is thought to be triggered by an immune response against peripheral nerve antigens by a preceding infection. More than 20 cases of GBS have been reported to follow dengue virus infection (http://www.institutpasteur.nc/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/S2-03-O-Simon.pdf), and cases have also been reported to follow chikungunya virus infection (http://www.neurology.org/content/69/22/2105.short#). - Mod.ML
