Effingham County Emergency Management Agency director Walter Wright
points to a dead redbreast Monday [23 May 2011] found in the Ogeechee
River near the Effingham-Bulloch county line. Wright posted signs at
the river warning residents to not swim or consume any fish from the
Ogeechee.

The discovery of thousands of dead, dying, and blistered fish on the
Ogeechee River from Screven to Bryan County prompted the state
Environmental Protection Division (EPD) to shut down activities in the
river and investigate the cause of the fish kill.

The EPD advises against swimming or consuming fish taken from the
Ogeechee River in Bryan, Chatham, Effingham, and Screven Counties.
Results from tests on water, sediment, and tissue samples are expected
to produce further guidance by mid-week.

Fish kills can stem from low oxygen levels in water, diseases, or
chemical spills.

In trying to pinpoint the cause of this kill, the EPD inspected King
America Finishing Inc., a Screven County textile processor whose
treated wastewater flows into the Ogeechee.

Company president Mike Beasley said Monday [23 May 2011] he was
unaware of any spill, but cooperated fully with the EPD. By late
Monday afternoon, inspectors cleared the facility.

"EPD and EPA reps have completed an investigation of the King
Finishing facility today and cannot find any potential or possibility
that this facility has had any sort of upset at their wastewater
treatment plant, release or spill of anything," said Al Frazier, EPD
emergency response network manager. King is the only large industrial
facility with significant discharge to the Ogeechee, he added. The
company's 175 employees process more than 50 million yards [45.72
million m] of fabric annually, applying specialized finishes such as
fire retardants and water-resistant coatings.

Tim Barrett, a Department of Natural Resources fisheries supervisor
based in Richmond Hill, began investigating reports of dead fish
Friday [20 May 2011]. "We've seen a range of fish: redbreast, blue
gill, black crappie, catfish," he said. "We have seen even bowfin and
darters."

Barrett and his crew counted 550 dead fish Saturday [21 May 2011],
though there were undoubtedly more that sank or were eaten by turtles,
snakes, and birds, he said.

Conditions on the Ogeechee didn't seem ripe for a natural dip in
oxygen that can kill fish, Barrett said. "We took dissolved oxygen
readings but we've not seen a dissolved oxygen sag that would kill
fish," he said. "It's really hot, and there are low flows, but we
haven't found any low dissolved oxygen readings today."

By the end of the day Monday [23 May 2011] the kill area ranged from
Screven County just below King America Finishing Inc. to south of US
80 in Bryan County. It could spread into Chatham today, Barrett said.

With the main manufacturer cleared by EPD and oxygen readings not at
a dangerous level, regulators are scratching their heads until more
information comes in. "We're waiting on lab test results," said EPD
spokesman Kevin Chambers. "We'll be seeing what, if anything, they can
tell us."

The nonprofit Ogeechee Riverkeeper organization is also conducting
fish and water sample tests with a University of Georgia lab and a
North Carolina lab.

Riverkeeper Dianna Wedincamp was unhappy with the slow response from
officials as evidence of the fish kill became apparent. The EPD issued
an advisory Sunday afternoon [22 May 2011]. But that left plenty of
people exposed, she said. "People were in the river; they were
swimming in the river," she said. "There were kids in the river.
People were having fish fries from the fish they were catching."

Effingham Emergency Management director Walter Wright on Monday [23
May 2011] put up signs at Steel Bridge boat landing on Ga. 119 at the
Effingham-Bulloch county line warning residents not to swim or to
consume fish, even those caught in the Ogeechee as far back as early
last week. He said the water doesn't smell or look strange.

"We're asking all residents to stay out of the Ogeechee," Wright
said. "... we are seeing a lot dead in Effingham County. They are
blistered from something. As of right now, we don't know what's
killing them."

[It is understandable to look to a manufacturing plant first.
However, it makes me wonder who else has dumped something
inappropriate into the water. Perhaps, someone disposing of household
waste? A truck filled with some chemicals has overturned in the
river?

I am reminded of an incident where a company was blamed for a
situation and while there was no leak, there was less disinfectant
applied to the effluent than was appropriate. Could this be a case of
something similar?

If this number of fish are dead in a relatively local area, and the
officials are worried about it spreading, then a couple of things come
to mind. It is not likely a point source emission or dilution will not
solve the problem here.

Hopefully necropsies and testing of affected fish will yield clues
and results.
