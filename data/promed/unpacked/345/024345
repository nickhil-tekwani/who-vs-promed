A map (on the original site listed above) shows the counties that were confirmed as having cases of vesicular stomatitis from the start of the 2015 outbreak on 29 Apr to 18 Dec. Today, only 13 premises remain under quarantine in 3 states: Colorado, Nebraska, and Texas.

More than 800 properties across 8 US states were affected by the 2015 vesicular stomatitis outbreak, official figures reveal.

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), a division of the US Department of Agriculture, provided a 2015 summary of the outbreak, which began with a confirmed case in a horse in New Mexico on 29 Apr 2015.

APHIS, in an 18 Dec 2015 update, said a total of 819 premises had been affected by the disease across 8 states: Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. Most of the affected animals were horses.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral infection that can affect horses, mules, cattle, bison, sheep, goats, pigs, and camelids. It also has the ability to infect people, causing flu-like symptoms, but such cases are rare.

Clinical signs include vesicles, erosions and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, teats and above the hooves of susceptible livestock. Vesicles are usually seen only early in the course of the disease.

Its transmission is not completely understood, but biting insects are known to be a key vector, and mechanical transmission and livestock movements are also believed to play a part.

The signs are similar to those of foot and mouth disease, which is why US authorities must legally be notified of cases. In cattle, animal health agencies must establish that the signs are not a result of foot and mouth disease, which has not been seen in the US since 1929.

All cases in 2015 were confirmed as the New Jersey serotype.

Colorado was the worst-affected state, with 437 premises across 35 counties affected. Wyoming recorded 146 affected premises across 10 counties. Utah had 56 affected premises across 8 counties, while New Mexico had 52 affected premises across 13 counties.

South Dakota recorded vesicular stomatitis across 7 counties, with 50 premises affected. Arizona recorded 36 affected premises in 3 counties, while Nebraska recorded 38 affected premises in 10 counties, and Texas recorded 4 affected properties across 4 counties.

Currently, there are 13 premises remaining under quarantine in 3 states: Colorado, Nebraska, and Texas.

The wave of 2015 cases followed a bad year in the US for the disease in 2014.

Researchers have noticed a pattern of major outbreaks of the virus in the US every 8-10 years. However, the extent of the 2014 outbreak was known to heighten the risk of the virus successfully over-wintering in insect eggs or larvae in the US.

Vesicular stomatitis is endemic in Mexico, which has a climate which seems to allow the virus to propagate there all year around. Seasonal climate changes and ecological conditions allow the biting insects that carry the virus to spread north in some years when conditions are favorable to the insects.

US outbreaks have been sporadic since the 1st incursion was confirmed in 1937, but in the last 30 years the American southwest has emerged as a hotspot for the virus. The high-risk season runs from spring to fall, with a peak in mid-summer. Outbreaks in the region tend to start in the warmer south and spread north as the weather warms.

It is believed that major outbreaks in the US occur when climatic and ecological factors combine in a way that favor the insect vectors, although the formula is not necessarily simple.

Key measures that livestock owners could take during the high-risk season were insect control and the use of repellents on animals, especially targeting the more sensitive skin areas with little or no hair where the lesions are most likely to develop, including the muzzle, mouth, ears, around the teats, and above the hooves. Repellent is also recommended near any areas with broken skin, such as where fly strike or wounds are present.

Tongue lesions -- most likely resulting from the transfer of virus from around the mouth -- can be especially troublesome, with some animals in such discomfort that they stop eating and drinking.

Fly masks with ear protection can be effective, as can keeping horses indoors at dawn and dusk, when the insects are most active.

Research has shown that when animals are bitten by infected insects where their coats are thicker, they will develop an immune response but will not develop lesions at the site of the bites. In contrast, when bitten on the more sensitive areas, lesions can develop and can discharge infected fluid, which is capable of infecting other animals.

The vesicular stomatitis virus has not been detected in the bloodstream of infected horses and cattle. The only place that scientists can isolate the virus is from ruptured lesions.

[This is a great overview of the situation for 2015.

USDA APHIS released an update on 18 Dec 2015 updating their statistics to include a new case in Texas. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/downloads/animal_diseases/vsv/Sitrep_121815.pdf

"On 18 Dec 2015, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories on Plum Island, New York, confirmed a finding of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection (New Jersey serotype) on a bovine premises in Johnson County, Texas. One cow on the premises has met the case definition of infection with compatible clinical signs and positive complement fixation antibody titer.

This is a return to positive state status for Texas and a new affected county in the state."

This case is Texas is unusual in that is in mid-December. Generally there have been 1 or 2 killing frosts in that area of the state by mid-December. However, Texas has had unusually warm weather this past December. Certainly regulatory officals in Texas and other states are hoping for some cold weather to stop this outbreak of this virus. - Mod.TG
