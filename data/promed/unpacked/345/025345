A disease, which is wiping off bee populations across globe, originated in Europe and has been spread through human acts. The virus is being spread through European honeybees, said the researchers.

The European honeybees are considered to be the carrying agent of the deformed wing virus. The researchers said that the phenomenon is not a natural one and is mainly man-made. Human commerce and transfer of bees for the purpose of crop pollination are the main reasons behind the spread.

The _Varroa_ mite is one of the disease vectors in this situation. The researchers have affirmed that millions of honey bees have been killed owing to the little critter. Explaining the phenomenon, the researchers shared that the _Varroa_ eat the bee larvae and the deformed wing virus causes bees to bite the dust.

The researchers said that both the _Varroa_ mite and deformed wing virus are linked with Europe [as its] source. If the disease would have been natural then it would have been spread around the nearby places.

But areas and regions that are as far as Europe and New Zealand are showing the problem, which shows it is a man-made issue. "This is the 1st study to conclude that Europe is the backbone of the global spread of the bee killing combination of deformed wing virus and _Varroa_. This demonstrates that the spread of this combination is largely manmade," affirmed study's lead researcher Dr Lena Wilfert, of the University of Exeter's Centre for Ecology and Conservation.

The study strengthens the theory that human transportation of bees is liable for the spread of devastating disease. The disease known as deformed wing virus has spread from Europe to North America, Australia and then New Zealand. The disease has not spread in Asia and Australia.

The key finding of the study as per senior author Professor Mike Boots of Exeter and UC Berkeley is that global virus pandemic in honeybees is manmade not natural. Therefore, it is in our hands to take steps to curb the same.

[This global hypothesis makes epidemiologic sense; when you move any animal you also move its parasites and pathogens. - Mod.MHJ

Prior results from empirical and theoretical research and found that bee colony collapses are caused by interacting stress factors that affect the balance between pathogens and host immunity. Otherwise silent infections with DWV become uncontrollable and kill the bees when accompanied by infection with the mite _Varroa destructor_, the stress response and a suppression of the immune system. These new data shows that the synergistic interaction between both parasites (the virus and the mite) originates from human intervention. Bees can deal with either of them alone, but not in combination, which is a situation relatively new for them (in evolutionary terms). There might be a role for other stressors (such as insecticides) in this host-parasite and parasite-parasite interactions. - Mod.PMB

Deformed wing virus (DWV) has been known since the 1980s and was first recognized in Japan. It is an RNA virus and has worldwide distribution. While it most commonly affects the honey bee (_Apis mellifera_) it also affects the bumble bee (_Bombus terrestris_).

Abstract from Highfield AC et al: Deformed wing virus implicated in overwintering honeybee colony losses. Appl. Environ. Biol. 2009; 75(22): 7212-20; doi: 10.1128/AEM.02227-09; http://aem.asm.org/content/75/22/7212.full

The worldwide decline in honeybee colonies during the past 50 years has often been linked to the spread of the parasitic mite _Varroa destructor_ and its interaction with certain honeybee viruses. Recently in the United States, dramatic honeybee losses (colony collapse disorder) have been reported; however, there remains no clear explanation for these colony losses, with parasitic mites, viruses, bacteria, and fungal diseases all being proposed as possible candidates. Common characteristics that most failing colonies share is a lack of overt disease symptoms and the disappearance of workers from what appears to be normally functioning colonies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR to monitor the presence of 3 honeybee viruses, deformed wing virus (DWV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV), during a 1-year period in 15 asymptomatic, varroa mite-positive honeybee colonies in Southern England, and 3 asymptomatic colonies confirmed to be varroa mite free. All colonies with varroa mites underwent control treatments to ensure that mite populations remained low throughout the study. Despite this, multiple virus infections were detected, yet a significant correlation was observed only between DWV viral load and overwintering colony losses. The long-held view has been that DWV is relatively harmless to the overall health status of honeybee colonies unless it is in association with severe varroa mite infestations. Our findings suggest that DWV can potentially act independently of varroa mites to bring about colony losses. Therefore, DWV may be a major factor in overwintering colony losses.

Abstract from Wilfert L et al: Deformed wing virus is a recent global epidemic in honeybees driven by _Varroa_ mites. Science; 351(6273): 594-7; doi: 10.1126/science.aac9976; http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6273/594

Deformed wing virus (DWV) and its vector, the mite _Varroa destructor_, are a major threat to the world's honeybees. Although the impact of _Varroa_ on colony-level DWV epidemiology is evident, we have little understanding of wider DWV epidemiology and the role that _Varroa_ has played in its global spread. A phylogeographic analysis shows that DWV is globally distributed in honeybees, having recently spread from a common source, the European honeybee _Apis mellifera_. DWV exhibits epidemic growth and transmission that is predominantly mediated by European and North American honeybee populations and driven by trade and movement of honeybee colonies. DWV is now an important reemerging pathogen of honeybees, which are undergoing a worldwide manmade epidemic fueled by the direct transmission route that the _Varroa_ mite provides.

So the mite appears to be intimately involved in spreading DWV. It should also be remembered there are some mechanisms, including some chemicals and fungicides that can control the mite, and therefore may control the virus.

The man-made movement of bees may have provided a distribution for both the mite and the DMV. - Mod.TG]
