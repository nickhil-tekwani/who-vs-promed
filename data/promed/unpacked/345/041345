Two unvaccinated horses in the area [Boundary County, Idaho] died of West Nile virus, Panhandle [Boundary, Bonner, Kootenai, Shoshone, and Benewah Counties] Health District [PHD] officials announced [Fri 12 Aug 2016]. These are the 1st confirmed cases of the mosquito-borne illness in Boundary County since 2014.

"We have had one confirmed case of West Nile virus," said Boundary County Commissioner Dan Dinning. "They reported it as 2. Only one has been tested and confirmed. We have a 3rd horse that may be infected."

The horses in question were in the Porthill and lower Meadow Creek areas of the county, he said.

The bite of an infected mosquito spreads the virus to livestock and birds as well as humans. In general, West Nile does not produce symptoms in humans, but in a few cases, the symptoms can be severe, said PHD's Melanie Collett. When present, symptoms may include fever, headache, nausea, body aches, tiredness, swollen lymph glands, and vomiting.

Common bird species that can be infected with the deadly virus include crows, ravens, blue and gray jays, red-tailed and broad-winged hawks, red-wing blackbirds, magpies, starlings, common grackles, cowbirds, and several types of blackbirds, according to the National Wildlife Health Center.

"We know mosquitoes carrying West Nile can live in North Idaho, and mosquito pools have tested positive in the past," said Jeff Lee, staff epidemiologist at PHD.

"Our guy tells us we have a very low number of mosquitoes this year [2016]," said Dinning. "He hasn't found any infected mosquitoes."

Animal owners can prevent their livestock from contracting the virus by seeing they get a vaccination every year.

"Residents should be aware of West Nile virus and take simple precautions to protect themselves against mosquito bites," said Lee.

The best way to avoid bites is to reduce exposure to and eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes, by:
- limiting time spent outside at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active;
- applying insect repellent to skin and clothing, too, since mosquitoes may bite through clothing. DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus are all EPA-approved insect repellents, according to the Idaho Health and Welfare office;
- keeping window and door screens in good repair to prevent bugs from coming inside;
- disposing of items that hold water, such as empty cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots and discarded tires;
- cleaning roof gutters where standing water accumulates;
- emptying and turning over wheelbarrows, wading pools, boats and canoes;
- changing the water in birth baths and pet dishes frequently;
- cleaning and chlorinating swimming pools and outdoor spas;
- trimming tall grass, weeds and vines where mosquitoes hide out during daylight hours;
- landscaping to prevent water from pooling.

A horse in St Croix County, Wisconsin, has died from West Nile virus, according to state officials.

The Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection announced last week that a 4-year-old unvaccinated quarter-horse gelding was the stricken animal.

According to Dr Julie McGwin, equine veterinarian for the department, the horse was from a "premises in St Croix County," but had a Polk County address in Clear Lake. The horse was believed to have died 1 Aug. 2016; the WNV confirmation came on 5 Aug 2016.

The announcement comes on the heels of news from Pierce County the previous week that a dead crow had tested positive for West Nile virus.

Department officials urged horse owners to get their horses vaccinated to guard against West Nile virus and another mosquito-borne disease, eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

"Horses require 2 doses of the vaccinations initially [generally 3-4 weeks apart - Mod.TG], and then boosters at least annually," McGwin, said.

Other horses on the farm where the St Croix County horse died have since received their 1st round of WNV vaccinations.

The 2 viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes and can be fatal to horses, though they're not contagious between horses. The viruses can, however, be carried by mosquitoes from a bird to horses -- and humans, though humans cannot contract the virus directly from horses.

"Mosquitoes biting warm-blooded animals is the only route of transmission," according to the release.

The best means of protecting horses is to vaccinate them against WNV. A WNV vaccine is usually combined with EEE (eastern equine encephalitis) and WEE (western equine encephalitis). If your horse has never been vaccinated then 2 injections are required, about 3-4 weeks apart.

Rid the area of any standing water (old tires, flower pot catch pans, etc.) where mosquitoes can breed. Use mosquito repellent spray that is recommended by your veterinarian. - Mod.TG]
