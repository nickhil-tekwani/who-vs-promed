Significance
Cross-protection from seasonal epidemics of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) has been hypothesized to contribute to the relative sparing of children during the early phase of the pandemic. Testing this relies on understanding the prepandemic age distribution of recent HCoV infections, but little is known about their dynamics. Using England and Wales as a case study, we use a transmission model to estimate the duration of immunity to seasonal coronaviruses, and show how cross-protection could have affected the age distribution of susceptibility during the first wave, and could alter SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns over the coming decade.

Abstract
We hypothesized that cross-protection from seasonal epidemics of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) could have affected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, including generating reduced susceptibility in children. To determine what the prepandemic distribution of immunity to HCoVs was, we fitted a mathematical model to 6 years [y] of seasonal coronavirus surveillance data from England and Wales. We estimated a duration of immunity to seasonal HCoVs of 7.8 y (95% CI 6.3 to 8.1) and show that, while cross-protection between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the age distribution, it is insufficient to explain the age pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the first wave of the pandemic in England and Wales. Projections from our model illustrate how different strengths of cross-protection between circulating coronaviruses could determine the frequency and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics over the coming decade, as well as the potential impact of cross-protection on future seasonal coronavirus transmission.

Introduction
Using England and Wales as a case study, we use dynamic models to estimate 1) the duration of infection-induced immunity to seasonal HCoVs, 2) the ability of potential cross-protection from seasonal HCoVs to explain the age patterns in the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and 3) the implications of the duration of immunity and potential cross-protection on future dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted our lack of knowledge on coronavirus immunity and long-term dynamics. In our study, we estimate that immunity against seasonal HCoVs can last years; however, by necessity, we made strong assumptions about the cross-immunity between seasonal HCoV strains. Further studies exploring cross-protection between strains for seasonal coronaviruses as well as routinely subtyped surveillance data would help inform future models. Nonetheless, based on the available data, our study indicates that seasonal coronavirus immunity may last multiple years, which should be considered in the planning of subsequent studies. We also conclude that cross-protection from seasonal coronaviruses is not enough to explain the age susceptibility pattern of SARS-CoV-2, indicating other mechanisms must be involved. While serological data could be useful to further evaluate the extent of cross-protection, the reduction in social contacts due to government interventions against SARS-CoV-2 complicates their use. Our models rely heavily on social contact matrices, and getting an accurate understanding of social contacts in the last year [2020] comes with many challenges, such as multiple changes in public health interventions with uncertain adherence. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the background environment of coronaviruses for insights into SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progression.

Kuwait has detected its first case of the omicron variant of the coronavirus, state news agency KUNA reported on [Wed 8 Dec 2021].

The variant was detected in a European traveller who arrived in Kuwait from an African country where the variant had been detected, KUNA reported, citing the health ministry's spokesman.

[3] India: Covishield
Date: Wed 8 Dec 2021
Source: BBC [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59574878


The world's largest vaccine maker will halve the production of its COVID-19 vaccine because it has no fresh orders, its top-ranking executive has said. India's Serum Institute is sitting on a stockpile of half a billion doses of Covishield, the local version of AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria jab, the firm's CEO Adar Poonawalla told CNBC-TV18.

The jab accounts for 90% of the 1.3 billion doses given so far in India. India has fully vaccinated half of its eligible adults since January [2021].

"I am in a dilemma which I never imagined to be in. I am producing 250 million doses [of Covishield] a month but the good news is India has covered a large part of the population and we will have completed all our orders to the Ministry of Health in a week's time," Mr. Poonawalla said.

"We have no other orders at hand. So I am going to be reducing the production by at least 50% to begin with on a monthly basis until orders again pick up either in India and the world."

Some 85% of Indians have been administered one dose. However, tens of millions of people are still to receive their 2nd dose.

One way India could absorb the excess capacity of vaccines is by reducing the time between 2 doses of Covishield from 12--16 weeks to 8 weeks, Partha Mukhopadhyay, a researcher at the Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Policy Research, told the BBC.

"Also India has vaccinated about 83 million of the roughly 130 million adults above 60 years so far. We still have a gap in terms of vaccine coverage among our most vulnerable people," he said.

Then there is the question of providing booster doses, which the government has yet to decide on.

Serum Institute halted vaccine exports in April [2021] to cater to domestic demand as infections shot up in India. The firm is the largest single supplier to COVAX, the international scheme to ensure equal access to COVID-19 vaccines. India resumed COVID-19 vaccine exports from October [2021].

Mr. Poonawalla said COVAX was placing orders "but that's very slow and the uptick will pick up in the 2nd quarter".

He said he was in touch with the leaders of countries which needed more vaccines, but many of them would "sadly" not be able to lift from India unless they improved their logistics and cold storage facilities.

"All these other nations cannot vaccinate at 7 or 8 million beneficiaries a day like India has done. They don't have that kind of infrastructure. Hopefully by this time next year [2022] they would have hopefully reached 60--70% of the target for double vaccination," Mr. Poonawalla said.

In October [2021], more than 160 former world leaders and global figures called on the UK and other rich countries to immediately airlift millions of surplus COVID-19 vaccines to less developed nations.

[4] South Korea

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/8/record-covid-cases-in-s-korea-as-immunity-wanes-among-elderly


South Korea's daily count of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 7000 for the first time, with experts attributing the record jump to waning immunity among older people.

The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KCDA) reported 7175 new cases on [Wed 8 Dec 2021], 2221 more than the previous day [Tue 7 Dec 2021].

It said infections were rising particularly among older adults who had "suffered a drop in vaccine efficacy, and children who have yet to receive their first doses", according to the Yonhap news agency.

The number of critically ill patients also reached an all-time high of 840, up from 66 the previous day.

The increase in infections and severe cases comes after the government began easing COVID-19 restrictions under a so-called "Living with COVID-19" policy in November [2021]. Most of the cases are being reported in the greater Seoul region, home to half of the country's 51.7 million people.

"Last week [w/e 5 Dec 2021], the level of daily increase reached 5000 and today the tally came out over 7000 - the viral spread has been fierce," Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said during a government meeting on COVID-19.

"In the capital area, where 80% of total cases are reported, we continue to add hospital beds with active cooperation from the medical community, but still it is tough to catch up with the pace of rising virus cases," he added.

The Yonhap news agency said more than 78.7% of beds in intensive care units at hospitals around the country are now occupied. In the capital region, the figure was 84.5%.

Kim said the government will mobilise additional personnel to oversee coronavirus patients treating themselves at home and improve the emergency transfer system to hospitals for those who develop severe symptoms.

The quarantine period for those living with COVID-19 patients at home will also be reduced from 10 to 7 days, he said.

The prime minister went on to urge the elderly to get booster shots, noting that people aged 60 and above accounted for 35% of infections and 84% of severe cases.

He also urged adolescents to get vaccinated.

Waning immunity
---------------
South Korea has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, having inoculated some 91.8% of its adult population. Dr. Alice Tan, from MizMedi Women's Hospital in Seoul, said authorities in the country thought the high vaccination rates would keep the virus at bay when they began opening up the country in November [2021].

"We lifted many restrictions, including allowing visitations to long term care facilities, convalescent hospitals and nursing homes. Unfortunately, we did not take into account the amount of waning of immunity that had occurred, especially in people older than 60 years," she told Al Jazeera.

Most of South Korea's elderly received their 1st doses in February and March [2021].

"With measures lifted, there was an increase in community transmission, which we expected, but unfortunately, there was also a huge spike in breakthrough infections, especially in people aged 60 and above. And that's what's caused a huge increase in the number of hospital admissions," Tan said.

In a bid to contain the virus's spread, health officials reimposed some curbs on [Mon 6 Dec 2021], including banning private social gatherings of 7 or more people in the greater Seoul area and requiring adults to verify their vaccination status at restaurants, cinemas, museums and other indoor venues.

South Korea has also tightened its borders to fend off the new omicron variant since identifying its first cases last week some of which were linked to arrivals from Nigeria. The KDCA said health workers confirmed 2 new omicron cases on [Wed 8 Dec 2021], bringing the tally to 38.

While the emergence of omicron has triggered global alarm and pushed governments around the world to tighten their borders, scientists say it remains unclear whether the new variant is more contagious, more likely to evade the protection provided by vaccines or more likely to cause serious illnesses than previous versions of the virus.

Tan told Al Jazeera she is concerned about the spread of the omicron variant in South Korea. "The omicron variant is in the community in South Korea and my biggest concern is if we see huge increases in cases that inevitably always leads to cases in hospitalisations, even if the disease is less severe," she said. "And right now, our hospitals are full, we cannot afford to have a surge in COVID-19 on top of what we are seeing."

South Korea is currently requiring all passengers arriving from abroad to quarantine for at least 10 days, regardless of their nationality or vaccination status.

The country has banned short-term foreign travellers arriving from 9 African nations, including South Africa and Nigeria.

It has recorded a total of 489 484 cases since the start of the pandemic and 4020 deaths.
