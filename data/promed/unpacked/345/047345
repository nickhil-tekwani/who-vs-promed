[1] FDA report
Date: Sat 12 Apr 2008
Source: US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) News, press release [edited]
<http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01819.html>


The [US] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today [12 Apr 2008]
announced that at least 21 people in 13 states have been diagnosed
with salmonellosis that was caused by the same strain of _Salmonella
enterica_ serotype Agona that was found in the recently recalled
unsweetened Puffed Rice and unsweetened Puffed Wheat Cereals produced
by Malt-O-Meal.

The recalled products were distributed nationally under the
Malt-O-Meal brand name as well as under private label brands
including Acme, America's Choice, Food Club, Giant, Hannaford, Jewel,
Laura Lynn, Pathmark, Shaw's, ShopRite, Tops, and Weis Quality. The
cereals have "Best If Used By" dates from 8 Apr 2008 (coded as
"APR0808") through 18 Mar 2009 (coded as "MAR1809").

Consumers should throw out any product in their homes from these
recalled lots. Grocery stores and other retailers should promptly
remove the cereals from their shelves.

Individuals who believe they may have experienced an illness
consistent with the symptoms described above after consuming a puffed
wheat or puffed rice cereal made by Malt-O-Meal should contact their
health care practitioner immediately and report the illness to their
state or local health authorities.

On 5 Apr 2008, Malt-O-Meal voluntarily recalled the cereals because
the company's routine testing found _S._ Agona in a product produced
on 24 Mar 2008.

The FDA is working with Malt-O-Meal to determine the cause of the
contamination and with the states and the CDC (US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention) to identify and prevent additional illnesses.

[2] CDC report
Date: Fri 11 Apr 2008

<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/agona/>


The [US] CDC is collaborating with public health officials in
multiple states across the USA and with the FDA to investigate a
multi-state outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agona
infections. An investigation that includes interviews of persons with
_S._ Agona infections and comparison of the DNA fingerprints suggests
that cereal from Malt-O-Meal unsweetened Puffed Rice Cereals and
unsweetened Puffed Wheat Cereals is likely related to these illnesses.

As of 11 Apr 2008, state and city health departments from 13 states
identified 21 ill persons infected with _S._ Agona with the same
genetic fingerprint. Ill persons with the outbreak strain have been
reported from California (1), Colorado (1), Delaware (1), Maine (3),
Massachusetts (2), Minnesota (1), North Dakota (1), New Hampshire
(2), New Jersey (3), New York (3), Pennsylvania (1), Rhode Island
(1), and Vermont (1). Illness onset dates, which are known for 9
patients, ranged from 22 Jan 2008 to 2 Mar 2008. Their ages range
from 1 to 95 years; 62 percent are female. 3 hospitalizations and no
deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
On 5 Apr 2008, Malt-O-Meal Company initiated a recall after the
company's routine food testing detected the presence of salmonellae
on 24 Mar 2008 in a Minnesota plant that produces and packages dry
cereals. Malt-O-Meal issued a recall of unsweetened Puffed Rice
Cereals and unsweetened Puffed Wheat Cereals produced during the past
12 months at the plant in Minnesota. On 7 Apr 2008, PulseNet, the
molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance,
notified CDC's OutbreakNet Team of a cluster of human _S._ Agona
isolates with an indistinguishable PFGE [pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis] pattern (outbreak pattern) in multiple states. On 10
Apr 2008, CDC was informed by several state health departments that
patients infected with _S._ Agona with the outbreak pattern had eaten
Malt-O-Meal cereal products. On 11 Apr 2008, the Minnesota State
Public Health Department confirmed that the _Salmonella_ isolate
isolated from the Minnesota plant was _S._ Agona and had the same
indistinguishable PFGE pattern as the isolates from ill humans. CDC,
multiple state health departments, and FDA are working
collaboratively to identify additional cases and determine the source
and factors that contribute to this outbreak. Information about this
recall can be found at

[Since at least some cases occurred before this batch of cereal was
produced, the contamination had to have been occurring (at least
intermittently) for several months.

A 1998 _S._ Agona outbreak was associated with the same company and
was summarized in: CDC: Multistate Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Serotype
Agona Infections Linked to Toasted Oats Cereal -- United States,
April-May, 1998. MMWR. 1998;47: 462-4,
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053368.htm>.
The following was abstracted from this report:

During April-May 1998, a total of 11 states reported an increase in
cases of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Agona infections; as of 8
Jun 1998, a total of 209 cases have been reported and at least 47
persons have been hospitalized, representing an 8-fold increase over
the median number of cases reported in those states during 1993-1997.
The states reporting increases were Illinois (49 cases), Indiana
(30), Ohio (29), New York (24), Missouri (22), Pennsylvania (20),
Michigan (15), Iowa (8), Wisconsin (6), Kansas (4), and West Virginia
(2). This outbreak represents the 1st time a commercial cereal
product has been implicated in a _Salmonella_ outbreak, although an
infant cereal product was implicated in an outbreak of _S._
Senftenberg in the United Kingdom (1). _Salmonella_ spp. are
relatively resistant to desiccation and can survive for long periods
in dry environments such as cereal.

_Salmonella_ Senftenberg associated with infant food. Epidemiol
Infect 1988; 120(2): 125-8 (abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9593480>)

It is curious that _S._ Agona is linked to the uncommon food vehicle
(breakfast cereal) in 2 outbreaks from the same company a decade
apart. Of note, it is not specifically stated that the 2008 and the
1998 strains are genetically distinct. - Mod.LL]
