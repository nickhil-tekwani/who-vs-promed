https://www.smh.com.au/national/measles-alert-after-passenger-who-flew-from-bali-to-tulla-falls-ill-20180319-p4z54u.html


People who took a flight from Bali to Australia 2 weeks ago should watch for symptoms of measles after a fellow passenger was diagnosed with the illness on [Sun 18 Mar 2018], the Department of Health and Human Services has warned. Qantas flight QF44 from Denpasar [Bali] arrived in Sydney [New South Wales] at 6:25 am on [Sat 10 Mar 2018] and the passenger then boarded QF415, arriving at Tullamarine [Victoria] at 10:35 am the same day. The man became unwell after the flight and was hospitalised on [Sun 18 Mar 2018], following the confirmation of his illness. He may have been infectious during both these flights.

Public health physician Dr Finn Romanes said they were working with airline officials to identify and contact passengers who shared both the international flight into Sydney and the domestic flight into Melbourne. "People who were at Melbourne Airport on [Sat 10 Mar 2018], particularly around the domestic baggage collection area, who develop illness from now until [Wed 4 Apr 2018] should alert their doctor or hospital emergency department," Dr Romanes said. "He was also potentially infectious when he visited the Lentil as Anything restaurant at the Abbotsford Convent between 2 pm and 3 pm on [Sat 10 Mar 2018]."

Measles is a highly infectious viral disease that can cause serious illness, particularly in very young children and adults. People can develop pneumonia and other serious complications from the disease, and often need to be hospitalised.

Dr Romanes said the illness usually begins with common cold symptoms such as a runny nose, red eyes, and a cough, followed by fever and rash. "The characteristic measles rash usually begins 3-7 days after the 1st symptoms, generally starting on the face and then spreading to the rest of the body," he said. "Anyone developing symptoms is advised to ring ahead to their general practitioner or hospital first and tell them that they may have measles so that appropriate steps can be taken to avoid contact with other patients."

Unvaccinated people who visited Cairns' [Queensland] largest shopping centre last week [week of 12 Mar 2018] have been warned to see a GP immediately, as they may be at risk of contracting measles. Health officials from Townsville and Cairns are urgently contacting people who have been exposed to an infectious case of the disease. Public health senior medical officer Dr Julie Mudd said an adult female tourist who recently visited Cairns, had developed measles while staying in Townsville, which she in turn was believed to have contracted from another tourist in Victoria.

The measles alert has been issued for people who visited the following areas [see source URL above]. GPs and hospitals have been notified of the possibility of measles cases presenting over the next 2 weeks.

Dr Mudd said information had been sent to the venues with workers and patrons being contacted where possible. "Anyone born after 1965 who was in these areas and who has not been fully vaccinated against measles should see their GP immediately," she said. "If you are sick with fever, phone ahead to inform the practice that you may have measles, so that processes are in place to protect other patients from exposure." She acknowledged the cooperation the health department had received from the businesses in assisting staff with vaccinations. "It is important to make it clear that these businesses have not been responsible for causing any risk to public health," she said.

Queensland Health recommends anyone born during or since 1966, who has not had 2 documented doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or had proven measles, should visit their local GP to get vaccinated for measles. The vaccine is free for anyone who requires it.

Health authorities in Mexico detected a new case of measles in a 38 year old woman who traveled to Italy and returned to the Mexican city of Tijuana (Baja California) infected with this infectious disease.

The head of the Department of Epidemiology of Baja California, Néstor Hernández Milán, said that, on confirming that the woman was positive to the disease, isolation actions were carried out at her home and a 52-block sanitary fence was implemented to detect any similar case. "We had a communication with the health services of Italy, through the National Liaison Center, in which it is reported that she could potentially have come into contact with a positive measles person, coming precisely from Tijuana," the Mexican official said. He also indicated that people who have been vaccinated have no risk of infection, so he recalled the importance of applying the vaccine at 1 year of age, a booster at 6 years, and one more vaccine at 12 years. Hernández Milán recalled that a person with measles can infect up to 18 people, but if they are vaccinated they are not at risk.

On [15 Mar 2018], Mexican health authorities confirmed the detection of 3 cases of measles in an Italian woman, her son, and the Mexican woman in charge of her care in Mexico City. According to the Ministry of Health, these 3 cases were infected by an infected person who came from outside Mexico, which has not yet been identified.

In 2018, imported cases have been reported in 8 countries of the American continent, including Antigua, Barbuda, Brazil, Canada, the United States, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela.

Vulnerable persons who have not been vaccinated for measles and have been through airports in Newark, New Jersey, Detroit, and Memphis this month [March 2018] are being warned about the possible risk of measles by the health officials. They have announced that 2 air passengers from overseas were confirmed to have had measles and were travelling via these airports.

According to the official sources, these 2 cases have happened within a few days of each other. The 1st case was confirmed on [6 Mar 2018] when a passenger carrying the infection came in from an unknown origin abroad to Detroit Metropolitan Airport. They had to be admitted to a hospital at a later stage according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). The 2nd case was that of a child who flew in from Brussels to Newark Liberty International Airport and then to Memphis, where they were isolated.

The warning comes from the New Jersey Department of Health that says that people passing through Terminal B or Terminal C in Newark between 2:45 pm and 9:00 pm need to seek medical help if they develop any symptom of measles.

According to officials, refusal to vaccinate has resulted in 118 cases of measles last year [2017] in the US. With the vaccine, an individual is 97 per cent protected from the infection. Dr Eden Wells, MDHHS chief medical executive added, "Immunizations are the best way to protect our families and communities from the harmful, sometimes deadly consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles. If you have questions about a child's vaccination status or your own vaccination history, talk to your doctor right away to ensure your family has optimal protection."

http://gardnernews.com/update-measles-outbreak-johnson-linn-miami-counties/


On [8 Mar 2018], the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Johnson County Department of Health and Environment (Johnson county) were notified of a case of measles in a daycare in Johnson County. A total of 10 cases have now been identified -- 8 Johnson county residents, 1 Linn county resident associated with the daycare, and 1 Miami county resident not associated with the daycare.

To date, KDHE along with the Johnson County Department of Health and Environment, Linn County Department of Health, and the Miami County Department of Health have been able to identify where and when each case became infected. KDHE urges people who are ill or exhibiting measles-like symptoms to stay at home unless they are seeking medical care. Before visiting a healthcare provider, call ahead so that the provider can take measures to protect other patients and staff.

This outbreak continues to be investigated and KDHE and county health departments are working to identify contacts. The average number of days from when a person is exposed to measles, and when they first start showing symptoms is approximately 10-14 days (range of 7-21 days). Secondary cases are now appearing outside of the daycare. There is concern that some individuals in the general population may have potentially been exposed to persons with measles while they were infectious. Be aware that if a person has visited one or more of these locations on the dates and times listed they may have been exposed to measles [see source URL above for specific locations. - Mod.LK]

The best way to prevent measles is to get the MMR vaccine. Currently, KDHE is not recommending any changes to the routine vaccination schedule. If you have had measles or have been vaccinated, your risk of contracting the disease is extremely low. Because measles is a highly infectious disease, it is very important, if a person has been exposed and is starting to experience symptoms, that they stay home except to see a healthcare provider and limit their contact with people.

[6] Colombia (Magdalena) suspected ex Venezuela

http://caracol.com.co/emisora/2018/03/21/santa_marta/1521632973_302128.html


A suspected case of measles has been reported by health authorities in the municipality of Plato, located in the center of the department of Magdalena, after a family came to the hospital emergency room with a minor who presented the symptoms characteristic of measles. This child, apparently of Venezuelan origin, is in isolation in his house and receiving a simple medical treatment until it is confirmed that the symptoms are indeed measles.

Once the suspected outbreak was reported to the Colombian health system, an inter-agency commission was activated and travelled to that population to conduct field research. This group is formed by delegates from the Ministry of Health, the National Institute of Health, and the Ministry of Health of the Magdalena department.

"The 1st thing we are going to review is if it is measles and for that the national government has implemented an expedited system that gives us the answer in 48 hours; in addition, we will clarify if it is an autochthonous or imported case," says Manuel Navarro, secretary of the health department Amental, a member of the commission.

The authorities have also emphasized that the risks of contagion for Colombians in Magdalena are minimal because this department has achieved 99 per cent [MMR] vaccine coverage, which is the one that protects the infant population under 5 years from contracting measles, [mumps], or rubella.

Magdalena's health secretary is requesting that adults in all municipalities review their children's immunization cards to confirm that they have received the vaccination dose that protects them from the disease and that if a child presents any clinical manifestations suggestive of measles they should consult a medical center immediately.

Since the measles outbreak started in October 2017, Serbian health authorities have reported 3812 cases, including nearly 2000 cases in just the past 2 months, of which 1972 were laboratory confirmed at the Torlak Institute, according Serbia's Institute for Public Health (computer translated).

Of this total, 13 people have died, with half of these reported from Belgrade. The majority of patients are younger than 5 and over 30 years of age. A total of 95 per cent of patients were not vaccinated, partially vaccinated or unknown vaccine status and 32 per cent of patients required hospitalization for their illness.

According to experts in Serbia, the epidemic has peaked and the number of cases should now gradually decline. In January 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice for Serbia in light of the measles outbreak ...

https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/health/303729/half-of-measles-cases-hospitalised-as-outbreak-worsens-in-limerick.html


Half of the measles cases in Limerick have had to be hospitalised, the HSE [Health Service Executive] has said, as the virus outbreak continues to worsen in the region. The number of measles patients has risen by 2, amounting to 25 cases since the outbreak was first announced on [31 Jan 2018].

In an urgent appeal to the public, the HSE has said that the problem is continuing because the rate of the population that has been vaccinated is too low to tackle the outbreak. "This measles outbreak is continuing because we do not have herd immunity -- that is, the proportion of the population immune to measles is less than 95 per cent."

The spokesperson said that measles is a "serious public health issue. It is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 per cent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected. It is spread easily through coughing and sneezing. Measles can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and inflammation of the brain and can, in rare cases, lead to a fatal disease of the brain, which develops years after the infection. The mortality rate from measles infection is 1-2 per 1000 cases."

Of the 25 cases, the majority are in Limerick city, with one case in Clare, though this is linked to Limerick. Almost two thirds of detections are in people aged 15-40. The HSE said that this is "demonstrating that measles is not just an illness of childhood. Half of the cases have been hospitalised. The only effective protection against measles is 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Anyone who has not had 2 doses of MMR is at high risk of getting measles if they come in contact with someone who has it. Many adults this age also have young children, which means they are more likely to be exposed to measles and may in turn expose their babies and young children to measles if they get it," the spokesperson explained.

The HSE is providing free MMR vaccination clinics, with no appointments required, on a number of dates [see source URL above for details. - Mod.LK].

"During this outbreak MMR vaccine is free of charge to the public as the HSE is paying for the vaccine and for the GPs to give the vaccine. The following groups, in particular, should check if they have had 2 doses of MMR and if not, visit their GP to get immunised as soon as possible. If people do not have a medical record of their vaccination it is not harmful to have extra doses to be on the safe side: parents under the age of 40 who have never had measles or haven't had the full course of MMR vaccine; adults under the age of 40 who work with the public; couples under the age of 40 who may be planning a family; adults and young people under the age of 40 who plan to travel abroad in the coming months." The spokesperson said it was also important that parents of children in the region also check if their children have had the vaccines appropriate for their age.

The number of confirmed cases in a measles outbreak in northern Portugal has reached 66, the country's Directorate-General of Health (DGS) announced on [Thu 22 Mar 2018]. The majority of the cases are linked to the Santo Antonio Hospital in Porto with two thirds of the infected said to be health professionals. Of these cases, 11 have since recovered while 55 remain ill, with a further 37 being investigated.

In 2016, Portugal was declared free of measles by the World Health Organization (WHO), as only 19 cases were recorded between 2006 and 2014, according to the Lusa Portuguese News Agency, almost all of which had been contracted abroad. However, some 30 cases of measles and the death of a 17 year old girl were registered in Portugal last year [2017].

The DGS said that all its health professionals are vaccinated, meaning that those infected in this outbreak ought not to be at risk.

[The report states that 2/3 of the infected at Santo Antonio Hospital in Porto are health professionals, but at the same time also states that all its health professionals are vaccinated. Both cannot be correct unless some of the vaccinated individuals are not fully vaccinated with the entire series of inoculations. CDC recommends children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination. The MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97 per cent effective at preventing measles; 1 dose is about 93 per cent effective. - Mod.LK

The country's largest district is grappling with a measles outbreak with 90 cases being recorded in first 2 and a half months of 2018. As many as 15 cases were registered in Kutch on [Thu 22 mar 2018] itself. The number of measles cases for 2017 calendar year was 257 as per the health department records. Local doctors claim that the rise in measles cases was mainly because of the lack of immunisation among newborn babies as there are some superstitions and myths associated with it among certain communities.

A child is to be vaccinated for measles at the age of 9 month and after 22-23 months. But in many cases people don't take their children for vaccination. According to latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) report for 2015-16, only 45 per cent of children between the ages of 12 and 23 months are fully immunized in Kutch. For Gujarat state, the figure stands at 50 per cent.

On [Thu 22 Mar 2018], a 17 year old youth was admitted in a hospital at Nakhatrana in Kutch, while a 10 year old boy with measles was brought to Bhuj hospital. Generally children under 5 years of age are affected by the disease, but in Kutch, teenage boys and girls are also attending the hospital with this infection. According to local doctors, the number of infected people could be more as many do not go to hospitals because of superstition and blind beliefs. Kutch district epidemic control officer Dr Arunkumar Kurmi said, "the highest number of cases -- that is, 29 -- were registered in Bhuj taluka in last 2 and a half months followed by Mundra (15) and Gandhidham (13)."

A pediatrician in Bhuj Dr Saroj Gupta said she has received more cases compared to last year [2017]. "On an average I get at least 3 cases of measles every day, most of them children. The spread is mainly because of lack of awareness among the people about immunisation," Gupta told TOI.

Another pediatrician, Dr Rajesh Maheshwari, who practices in Gandhidham town, said, "There is a belief among certain Muslim communities that vaccination leads to infertility and that's why they don't bring children for vaccination. While in some Hindus communities people believe that measles is not a disease but fury of goddess and they need don't need to go to the doctor. We need to make people aware that this is a deadly disease and infected persons can lose his life," he added.

A member of World Health Organization (WHO) Dr Amol Bhosle, who works in Kutch district, refused to comment and Kutch district collector Remya Mohan could not be contacted despite several attempts.

[There are a number of reports in this posting announcing alerts for risk of infection with measles virus in airports, shopping centers, and other public locations. Imported cases are a major problem in spread of measles, especially when vaccination levels are not sufficiently high to create herd immunity. But even with a high level of immunity in the population, unvaccinated individuals are at risk of infection and possibly severe disease if they come into contact with infected individuals.

Other reports of measles outbreaks, which we are seeing with increasing frequency, are due to avoidance of vaccination due to superstitious beliefs and lack of understanding of the seriousness of the disease and the safety and efficacy of the vaccine series. Public health officials apparently have not found an effective approach to countering these beliefs. This is desperately needed for the health of the young children who are the ones who suffer needlessly.

The best approach to prevention is the full course of vaccination with the MMR vaccine. - Mod.LK]
