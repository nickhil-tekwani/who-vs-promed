Germany has registered a record rate of new COVID infections over the past week, according to figures released [Mon 15 Nov 2021].

The number of new cases per 100 000 people in the last 7 days hit 303, the latest data from the Robert Koch Institute of infectious diseases (RKI) showed. It is the first time the rate has surpassed 300 since the pandemic began and comes just one week since an unprecedented jump to over 200.

Only 67.5% of Germany's population is fully vaccinated. The highly contagious delta variant has run rampant through the unvaccinated population as the temperature drops and people stay indoors.

The number of cases increased by 23 607 over the past 24 hours. The total number of cases since the beginning of the pandemic passed the 5 million mark on [Sun 14 Nov 2021]. The RKI recorded 43 new coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, up from 33 from last [Mon 8 Nov 2021]. The overall COVID-19 death toll in Germany now stands at 97 715.

While the number of infections has broken record after record in the ongoing 4th wave, the rate of hospitalization has yet to reach the level seen in the earlier stage of the pandemic.
On [Fri 12 Nov 2021], the hospitalization rate was at 4.7 people per 100 000 in the past 7 days, up from 4.65 on Thu. Data is not recorded over the weekend.

This number reached 15.5 during the Christmas period last year [2020].

The high levels of infection vary greatly across Germany, with several regions in eastern and southeastern Germany reporting more than 1000 new cases per 100 000 people in the past 7 days.

The incidence rate was more than 7 times higher in the eastern state of Saxony than in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, for example. Saxony has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.

German doctor and vice president of the World Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, laid the blame at the feet of lawmakers, telling the Rheinische Post newspaper that measures against the virus had been "too late, too half-hearted, too varied."

He added that promises that there would be no mandatory vaccinations or any further lockdowns came from a lack of understanding regarding the virus. Montgomery called for "mandatory vaccination everywhere where people have a duty towards those they are protecting, such as in nursing homes, hospitals or in schools. Whoever refuses, cannot work there."

The chairwoman of the Margburger Bund doctors' union, Susanne Johna, also criticized political failings, saying that warnings of a surge in infections made in summer had been ignored.

"Warnings were dismissed as scaremongering. Urgent advice was ignored during the election campaign because it was obviously not politically desirable," she told public broadcaster Tagesschau.

[As Germany battles its worst infection rate since the pandemic began, a lockdown (similar to Austria, see ProMED Coronavirus Disease 2019 Update (393): Austria, Eastern Europe, Uk Exit Strategy, Global]) has been imposed in the capital, Berlin, with only fully vaccinated or people recently recovered from COVID-19 allowed to enter restaurants, cinemas, and sports facilities.

The federal government is also reversing course only a month after saying it would no longer provide free coronavirus testing. (from https://tinyurl.com/3f6ceutr)

[2] New variant B.1.640
Date: Sat 13 Nov 2021

https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/coronavirus/new-covid-variant-found-in-france-reason-for-panic-or-not-quite-yet-684878


A new COVID variant identified in a handful of European countries is raising concerns among some health professionals because there are changes to the coronavirus spike protein that have never been seen before.

The variant, known either as B.1.X or B.1.640, was first reported by the French paper Le Telegramme after it infected 24 people at a French school in the Brittany region last month [October 2021]. When the variant was discovered in France, the school at which the outbreak occurred was forced to close half of its classes, Le Telegramme reported.

Although the situation is now under control and no cases have been found in France since [26 Oct 2021], the French Regional Health Agency said, the variant remains under surveillance.

A handful of cases were also discovered in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Scotland, and Italy, although the delta variant and its descendants continue to be the most dominant strains.

Bar-Ilan University Prof. Cyrille Cohen, who is originally from France and regularly interviews and consults with French health officials, explained that the B.1.640 variant has some unprecedented mutations. One, in particular, has drawn attention: the spike protein, which is what allows the virus to cling to the human cell and start the infection process, has some deletions.

The question is whether this will make the virus more or less infectious.

The variant is believed to have emanated from Africa, a scenario Cohen said health experts are afraid of and that highlights the need for vaccine equality.

"This variant exemplifies that if you leave some of the world's population without access to vaccines, then the virus will continue to multiply and it will lead to more variants," Cohen said.

A Q4 Global Forecast report published last week by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) highlighted that while mostly developed countries have successfully vaccinated large swaths of their citizens, most developing countries have made only negligible progress.

The report specifically highlighted the failures of Africa's vaccination drive, where as of late [October 2021] only 6% of the population in African states is vaccinated against COVID.

"The cause of such low vaccination rates is well-known: despite recent improvements, global production continues to lag behind demand, with developing countries facing long delays in accessing vaccines," the EIU report said, adding that the World Health Organization's COVAX program has only managed to ship some 400 million doses globally and that donations from richer countries have been sparse.

Moreover, even if vaccines were delivered, African countries would be challenged in rolling them out, the report said - mainly for logistical reasons.

"Not giving vaccines to these countries may seem OK in the short term," Cohen said, "but in the long term, we might have new variants that are problematic that developed in unvaccinated countries."

"I don't want to frighten people," he said. "There are just a few cases of B.1.640 now and it could very well be that in a month we could all forget about this variant.

"But it is an example of what could happen if there isn't access to vaccines for everyone."

[3] T-cell vaccine
Date: Sun 14 Nov 2021
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/15/uk-firm-to-trial-t-cell-covid-vaccine-that-could-give-longer-immunity


An Oxfordshire-based company will soon start clinical trials of a 2nd-generation vaccine against COVID-19, an easy-to-administer skin patch that uses T-cells to kill infected cells and could offer longer-lasting immunity than current vaccines.

Emergex was set up in Abingdon in 2016 to develop T-cell vaccines, the brainchild of Prof. Thomas Rademacher, the firm's chief executive and professor emeritus of molecular medicine at the University College London medical school.

The vaccines prime T-cells to remove infected cells from the body quickly after infection, thus preventing viral replication and disease. While the antibodies produced by the current COVID vaccines stick to the virus and stop it from infecting cells, T-cells find and destroy infected cells. Those other vaccines, such as the Pfizer/BioNTech and the AstraZeneca/Oxford University jabs, also produce a T-cell response, but to a lesser extent.

Emergex has received the green light from the Swiss drugs regulator to conduct initial human trials in Lausanne, involving 26 people who will receive a high and a low dose of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine, starting on [3 Jan 2022]. Interim results from the trial are expected in [June 2022].

Robin Cohen, the firm's chief commercial officer, said: "This is the first time a regulator has approved a COVID vaccine to go into clinical trials whose sole purpose is to generate a targeted T-cell response in the absence of an antibody response and those T-cells look for infected cells and kills them."

Using the analogy of an asteroid hitting a planet, he explained: "The virus is the asteroid: it fires into the planet and a viral code, a signature for that virus, is rapidly displayed all over the surface. These signatures are read by T-cells as foreign, and the T-cells kill the cell before it can produce new live viruses."

Current COVID-19 vaccines mainly elicit an antibody response that wanes over time, which means people need booster shots to maintain protection against the virus. The Emergex vaccine works differently, by killing infected cells quickly. This means it could offer longer-lasting immunity - possibly for decades - and could also be better at fighting virus mutations, said Cohen.

A study published in Nature last week [w/e Sun 7 Nov 2021; see citation below] showed that some people experience "abortive infection" in which the virus enters the body but is cleared by the immune system's T-cells at the earliest stage. Scientists said the discovery could pave the way for a new generation of vaccines targeting the T-cell response, which could produce much longer lasting immunity.

Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said he doubted that a T-cell vaccine "could do the job on its own" but it could play a complementary role, in a mix-and-match approach where different vaccines are given for the first, 2nd and 3rd doses.

He said mRNA vaccines such as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot work so well because they produce a strong neutralising antibody response. The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be more effective against COVID than the AstraZeneca/Oxford jab, which elicits a stronger T-cell response.

But a T-cell vaccine could be used to complement other jabs, he said, as T-cell vaccines might be more impervious to virus mutations. "Antibodies are very sensitive to mutations while T-cells can see many other parts of the virus. Maybe that's a selling point for T-cell vaccines."

He noted that the idea of T-cell vaccines was not new - for example, Prof Sarah Gilbert, the University of Oxford professor who developed the AZ/Oxford jab, has been working on them for influenza for more than a decade.

Cohen said the tricky part was working out the delivery mechanism for the Emergex vaccine to the immune system. Rademacher and his team settled on tiny gold particles coated in peptides (bits of proteins) designed to generate the T-cell response in the body.

The vaccine will eventually be administered as a skin patch the size of a thumbnail bristling with micro-needles that release the shot within seconds. It can last for up to 3 months at room temperature, unlike other jabs that need to be stored in the freezer or fridge.

The trial will be conducted by Prof Blaise Genton from the Centre for Primary Care and Public Health at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. He said: "This exciting new scientific approach to developing a vaccine against Sars-CoV-2 addresses the need to generate a T-cell response to elicit long-term immunity."

However, the Emergex shot will not be available until 2025 at the earliest, the usual timeframe for vaccine development. Last year [2020] COVID vaccines were developed within months as the regulatory process was speeded up, but the emergency has passed, said Cohen.

Emergex is testing another T-cell vaccine against dengue fever on humans in a separate Swiss trial, with initial results due in [January 2022]. Half the world is at risk from dengue fever, according to the World Health Organization, and there is no specific treatment or vaccine for it. The firm also wants to deploy its T-cell vaccines against influenza, Zika, Ebola, and other infections.

Dr. Andrew Freedman, a reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University school of medicine, said last week: "A vaccine that primes T-cell immunity against different viral protein targets that are shared between many different coronaviruses would complement our spike vaccines that induce neutralising antibodies."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Individuals with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 do not necessarily develop PCR or antibody positivity, suggesting some may clear sub-clinical infection before seroconversion. T-cells can contribute to the rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections (1-3). We hypothesised that pre-existing memory T-cell responses, with cross-protective potential against SARS-CoV-24-11, would expand in vivo to support rapid viral control, aborting infection. We measured SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells, including those against the early transcribed replication transcription complex (RTC)12,13, in intensively monitored healthcare workers (HCW) remaining repeatedly negative by PCR, antibody binding, and neutralisation (seronegative HCW, SN-HCW). SN-HCW had stronger, more multispecific memory T-cells than an unexposed pre-pandemic cohort, and more frequently directed against the RTC than the structural protein-dominated responses seen post-detectable infection (matched concurrent cohort). SN-HCW with the strongest RTC-specific T-cells had an increase in IFI27, a robust early innate signature of SARS-CoV-214, suggesting abortive infection. RNA-polymerase within RTC was the largest region of high sequence conservation across human seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) and SARS-CoV-2 clades. RNA-polymerase was preferentially targeted (amongst regions tested) by T-cells from pre-pandemic cohorts and SN-HCW. RTC epitope-specific T-cells cross-recognising HCoV variants were identified in SN-HCW. Enriched pre-existing RNA-polymerase-specific T-cells expanded in vivo to preferentially accumulate in the memory response after putative abortive compared to overt SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data highlight RTC-specific T-cells as targets for vaccines against endemic and emerging Coronaviridae."
