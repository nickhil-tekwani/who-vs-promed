Juniper is under attack from a pathogen that causes withering and often death of the shrub. Experts say the disease, called phytophthora austrocedri, has been found to be spreading through juniper trees in Scotland.

The pathogen has entered Britain through the plant trade and may have got into juniper woodlands through well-intentioned planting schemes. The disease lives in the soil, infecting juniper roots and killing large numbers of trees, especially on wet sites.

Professor Fiona Burnett, Scotland's Rural College, has warned, "The principles of best plant health practice such as sourcing seed and plants with care and avoiding moving problems inadvertently in soil apply equally to field crops and the plants in our moorlands, gardens, forests, and fields."

Researchers in Scotland have found some junipers are resistant to the disease and it is hoped natural regeneration will allow populations to recover over time. Science is also helping to identify sites that are less vulnerable to the pathogen and which can be targeted for conservation and protection. In 2015, a study said juniper was in a "critical state" in Scotland, thanks to the spread of the deadly fungal disease [ProMED-mail post 20151029.3751425].

[European juniper (_Juniperus communis_) is a small conifer. Its berries are popular as a spice and for medicinal uses in northern and central Europe and are also used in the making of gin.

The fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora austrocedri_ (Pa; synonym _austrocedrae_) was first characterised as a new species from Argentina in 2007 associated with lethal dieback of _Austrocedrus chilensis_ (Chilean cedar), which is native to the region. In the UK, it was first reported in 2011. Symptoms on juniper include necrosis of needles, lesions on stems, dieback of twigs and branches, followed eventually by death of the bush.

The genus includes some of the most destructive crop pathogens (for example, _P. infestans_ causing potato late blight). New species are being identified frequently, many of which are thought to be due to hybridisation between local pathogen strains. Symptoms vary between hosts, but on trees and shrubs, the pathogens mainly cause root rots and stem cankers, which destroy the host's access to water and nutrients. Symptoms usually include yellowing of foliage followed by dieback; sudden death of the host may occur when additional water stress is imposed by a dry season.

The pathogens are soil borne. They are spread with soil and plant material, by water and mechanical means (often by contaminated equipment and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements) and removal or burning of affected plants. Trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective in some tree species.

The related _P. kernoviae_ and _P. ramorum_ are considered serious pathogens of native trees and shrubs in Europe and North America. _P._ taxon Agathis is devastating native kauri tree populations in New Zealand. _P. cinnamomi_ has caused immeasurable damage to eucalypts and other native vegetation after its introduction to Australia. Eradication or control of phytophthora diseases of trees in Australia and North America have been largely unsuccessful.
