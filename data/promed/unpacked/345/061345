Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Randers, Randers municipality, West [Central Jutland]
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Feb 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Water type: fresh water
Population type: Wild

Total animals affected:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 1 (scale 0 to 5) / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: [on 18 Feb 2019], ISA HPR0 was detected in wild Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) in facility for restoration of wild stock near the city Randers in the municipality Randers. The salmon was caught in Gudenaen. The fish and its eggs has been destroyed, and the relevant parts of the facility has been cleaned and disinfected.

[Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is a disease of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxovirus (ISAV) and affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease can be systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs.

It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry. The disease is of obligatory notification to the OIE.

Differences in virulence among ISAV strains have been described in several studies. Non-virulent ISAV variants are named ISAV-HPR0 -- like the one reported in this episode -- and are characterized by an haemagglutinin-esterase protein carrying a full-length highly polymorphic region (HPR). All currently described pathogenic ISAV isolates associated with ISA disease have deletions in the HPR with over 30 different HPR-deleted subtypes identified in Europe, North America and Chile. ISAV‐HPR0 variants are especially interesting as they do not cause any signs of disease, cannot be grown in vitro using current available cell lines and have been shown to be more prevalent in gills compared to ISAV‐HPRx variants, which typically lead to systemic infections. - Mod.PMB
