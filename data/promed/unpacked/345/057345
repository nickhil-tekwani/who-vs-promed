HEMORRHAGIC FEVER WITH RENAL SYNDROME - RUSSIA (CENTRAL FEDERAL REGION) (02)

The ProMED-mail posting on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS) in Central Russia dated 11 Mar 2007 (see, Hemorrhagic fever
w/renal synd. - Russia (Central Federal Region 20070311.0857)
requires some additional comment. The report contained inaccuracies
concerning HFRS due to hantaviruses in this region.
Part [1] of the report was OK, clearly stating that the epidemic is
over. Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) is the main cause of HFRS in these
regions, and HFRS epidemics typically take place in late autumn to mid-winter.
However, part [2] needs some comment. The statement that a new
epidemic was predicted this spring [2007] due to awakening of rodents
may be a misunderstanding. Spring epidemics due to PUUV do not
happen, although in rodent peak years, due to masting [production of
edible seed or fruit] in the temperate forest zone, a number of cases
can occur in mid- to late summer. If the word "awakening" refers to
hibernating rodents, they do not carry PUUV. The host is the bank
vole _Myodes_, earlier called _Clethrionomys glareolus_, not
_Apodemus agrarius_, as the Moderator mentioned in his comments.
"Field mouse" mentioned in the posting can refer to any rodent in
layman reports. In central and eastern Europe, _A. agrarius_ carries
Saaremaa hantavirus [SAAV]. These murine and arvicoline rodents are
active throughout the winter.
The epidemic was attributed to a warm winter. This could be a mere
coincidence because in central Russia HFRS epidemics typically occur
in 3-year cycles, reflecting the dynamics of the carrier species.
Even if climate warming may affect the disease dynamics, it is risky
to make strong statements based on one winter only when the long-term
dynamics of carrier rodent species should be known. Worse epidemics
than reported now are known from central Russia from earlier years
(see ProMED-mail archives).
And let us not forget human behaviour: Professor Tkachenko (Moscow,
Russia) has pointed out that after the political change in Russia
(collapse of the Soviet Union), much more private housing
construction has taken place in forest areas increasing the risk of
contracting PUUV/HFRS.
A warm winter, on the one hand, may help rodents from an energetic
standpoint, but on the other hand, may be harmful by removing the
snow cover and protection against predators. Our recent experience in
northern Europe (data from Finland and those communicated by Dr. Gert
Olsson in Sweden) suggests, in fact, that a warm early winter can
delay/slow down the HFRS epidemic until the cold spell hits and
activates bank vole movements into human settlements.
The statement that the virus is killed at -30 deg C (-22 deg F) is a
clear misunderstanding. We preserve hantaviruses (and many other
viruses) routinely at -70 deg C (-94 deg F) to keep them in better
shape longer. Furthermore Kallio et al (2006) (1) have shown recently
that temperature and humidity have a clear effect on the survival of
PUUV outside the host, with humidity and low temperatures promoting
survival. In addition to different patterns of rodent host dynamics
(cyclic vs more seasonal) and landscape structure (large taiga
forests vs fragmented patchy temperate forests), the low temperature
promoting virus survival may be one more factor resulting in more
HFRS in northern Europe and Russia vs central and southern Europe.
After a peak winter, in the following spring and summer, bank vole
populations decline to much lower than average densities. Therefore,
starting rodent extermination programs in the decline phase is
useless, and can be even harmful if poisons are indiscriminately spread around.
