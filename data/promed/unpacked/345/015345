Report to the nearest medical centre if symptoms of fever and body
rash appear, warns the Ministry of Health. There is a rubella outbreak
with 3 reported cases in the greater Suva area, as confirmed by Health
Ministry spokesman Peni Namotu.

Dr Francis Bingwor of the National Adviser Family Health said the
Ministry intervened to raise awareness after it received reports of 2
females and a male aged between 19 and 24 years who developed symptoms
of rubella at the Fiji School of Nursing. There are suspected cases
for other areas like Samabula, she added

Dr Bingwor is calling on parents to take precautions and get babies
vaccinated against the disease to prevent them from contracting
rubella from adults suspected of being affected.

"Rubella is a vaccination preventable disease which can be prevented
if children, both boys and girls, get vaccinated against it," she
said. "Parents are encouraged to make sure that their children are
vaccinated against the disease, which is a service provided at all
baby clinics around the country," she said. "Mothers are urged to take
their babies for the vaccination at 12 months, and it is also provided
at primary schools," she said.

"Usually it is thought that rubella [vaccination] was only for girls;
however, this was only because females in primary schools would lineup
for the rubella shots, so we are thinking the males who are being
affected this time were missed in 2004, because prior to this, only
girls were given the rubella injection," Dr Bingwor said.

"Vaccines provided in Fiji are very effective, and parents should
please seek immediate medical attention as soon as you have signs of
fever and body rashes."

[Rubella virus infection can seriously affect pregnant women, damaging
their unborn child, particularly the fetus's sight, hearing, heart and
brain development. Infection in the 1st 10 weeks of pregnancy causes
90 percent of infants to be damaged, typically their heart, eyes, ears
and brain, often in combination. In the next 6 weeks, 1/3rd of infants
are affected, usually, but not always, restricted to hearing loss.
Later infection is rarely associated with damage, and is referred to
as congenital rubella infection.

Rubella (German measles) is generally a mild disease, and people are
infectious before they develop symptoms; hence unvaccinated women may
be at risk of contracting infection during pregnancy. Immunization is
the only way to protect against rubella virus infection, and women
working in health care settings are particularly vulnerable if
unvaccinated. Since 2004, rubella vaccination has been universal in
Fiji, and cases of the disease have declined dramatically. The above
report indicates, however, that there are still sufficient
unvaccinated individuals in the community to maintain the virus in
circulation. Eradication of rubella (German measles) is encountering
the same problem as eradication of measles proper, namely incomplete
vaccine coverage. Travelers to Fiji should be warned of the potential
hazard.
