Outbreak of panic turned crisis to disaster
-------------------------------------------
Panic, confusion, messy decision-making and a lack of public
confidence were key features of the Government's handling of the
foot-and-mouth outbreak, an official inquiry concluded yesterday.
Iain Anderson, chairman of the "lessons learnt" report, said: "The
foot-and-mouth epidemic of 2001 was an emergency which became a
crisis. And in some parts of the country, it was a crisis which
became a disaster." He lists a catalogue of inefficiency and weak
management that led to the Government's failure to deal speedily with
the outbreak.
The report makes uncomfortable reading for Nick Brown, who was
Agriculture Minister at the time and is now Minister for Work, and
Jim Scudamore, the Chief Veterinary Officer. Lack of information from
ministers and officials prevented the inquiry from learning who was
responsible for controversial decisions that led to the slaughter of
millions of healthy animals and the closure of most of the country's
footpaths.
Dr Anderson said that he could not find out the truth even after
studying mounds of documents and questioning Tony Blair, other
ministers and officials. When asked about decisions, such as the
delay in calling in the Army, they had told him that they "did not
know" or had not attended the relevant meetings. Dr Anderson
concludes, however, that there had been no "foul play" or deliberate
withholding of information. His report also clears the Prime Minister
of delaying or speeding up the response to the outbreak because of
the pending general election. When asked if the election date had
influenced the management of the disease, Mr Blair had replied
"categorically not" and "nonsense" and said that he had focused on
tackling the disease. He did concede that calling in the Army earlier
"might have made a difference early on in the crisis".
One of the main criticisms was the lack of contingency planning,
despite a report by one of the Government's vets, Richard Drummond,
who said that the veterinary service could not cope with a serious
disease outbreak. A government memorandum to the inquiry said that a
plan was in place. However, Dr Anderson said: "We did not find this
to be so." A failure to have an agreed strategy also led to arguments
when the disease was spreading. After a state vet had spotted the
first likely case at the Cheale Meats abattoir, it was decided to use
an e-mail to alert the Pirbright laboratory, the world reference
centre for the disease, that samples had been sent. This e-mail was
not read and 12 hours were wasted. "Urgent phone calls" should have
been made.
The report also discloses that government vets had been more
preoccupied with BSE than with drawing up plans to fight
foot-and-mouth. Mr Scudamore was even approached about the lack of
progress by a senior Welsh vet who was concerned enough to want to
train staff and draw up plans for the slaughter and disposal of dead
animals. Mr Scudamore was told of the impending threat of a
foot-and-mouth outbreak from the Middle and Far East during a visit
to the Pirbright laboratory in July 2000, 8 months before the first
case. After this visit Mr Scudamore raised his concerns with
colleagues, but the issue was never discussed with ministers or
senior officials. The report says: "No action outside the state
veterinary service was taken to tackle the significant shortcomings.
We believe this contributed to a false sense of security within MAFF."
For future emergencies Dr Anderson suggests creating a national
volunteer reserve like the Home Guard. The state veterinary service
should form "flying squads" that can investigate new alerts and
"veterinary paramedics" should help vets to identify diseased farms.
In summing up, Dr Anderson said that Mr Scudamore was a "man of
considerable honour and professional integrity" and after this
experience was "a better person" to have in his position. One of the
key criticisms of Mr Brown was his assertion on television on 11 Mar
2001 that he was "absolutely certain" that the disease was under
control. "His comments did not reflect the situation on the ground.
The disease was, at this stage, out of control by any reasonable
measure," Dr Anderson said. Mr Brown's comments led to a loss of
trust in rural communities.
The report also highlights the lack of recognition of the impact of
the disease on tourism and the rural economy. Dr Anderson concludes:
"We recognise the desire to see someone blamed and understand the
frustration and anger felt by so many. However, the nation will not
be best served by seeking to blame individuals; rather we should seek
to apply the lessons to be learnt."

Rural groups say inquiry "should have dug deeper"
-------------------------------------------------
Farmers, campaigners and experts welcomed the Anderson Report into
the foot and mouth outbreak yesterday, but criticised it for not
going far enough. There was relief that the report detailed, and
condemned, the Government's failure to effectively tackle the
outbreak in the first few weeks.
Lady Emma Tennant, whose husband is a farmer in Cumbria, which was
ravaged by the disease, said: "I'm delighted that's come out in the
open at last. It hasn't been properly recognised until now. That's
the first step towards putting it right for next time and towards
somebody taking responsibility for what happened." But as a
campaigner for animal vaccinations to protect against an outbreak
spreading in the future, she was disappointed that Dr Iain Anderson's
report only recommended the measure as an option. "It's the obvious
thing to do," she said. "I would say it's a necessity not an option."
Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association [the leading UK
association for organic agriculture] and another campaigner for a
vaccination policy, said of the report: "It doesn't go far enough.
It's a classic apportionment of blame exercise without recognising
what the real omission by the Government was -- the ability to take
on new ideas at crucial moments. They weren't open to new ideas."
Brigadier Alex Birtwistle, the Army officer appointed to co-ordinate
the response to the disease a month into the crisis, agreed with much
of what the report highlighted as Government failures. He said that
when he took on the task of combating the spread of the disease, the
situation was "a shambles" caused by a failure of suitable
management. He said: "This was a simple management problem. "At
national level there was a failure to co-ordinate early. You don't
need hindsight to realise that. It was common sense. It was an
abrogation of responsibility by certain individuals and groups."
Professor Roy Anderson, an epidemiologist from Imperial College,
London who advised the Chief Scientist, Professor David King, on how
the outbreak should be handled, welcomed the report as fair. He was
convinced its recommendations would help to ensure that any repeat
outbreak would be tackled more effectively. "It's a very
comprehensive document with a lot of clear guidance about how things
should be improved."

Beckett rues mistakes in foot and mouth crisis
-----------------------------------------------
Nick Brown, the former agriculture minister, was singled out
yesterday for fierce criticism by the official inquiry into the foot
and mouth crisis.
In an account of the government's "haphazard and messy" response to
the crisis, Mr Brown was blamed for losing the confidence of farmers
after he falsely claimed that the disease was under control. Margaret
Beckett, who succeeded him in the rural affairs department, last
night defended Mr Brown, who was demoted to work and pensions
minister after the election. But in a statement to MPs, she admitted
that mistakes had been made in "desperate circumstances". Mrs Beckett
also accepted a key recommendation of the foot and mouth inquiry:
that the government should formally adopt vaccination as a possible
measure against future outbreaks of the disease.
The report dismissed Mr Brown's assertion on 11 Mar 2001 -- nearly 3
weeks into the crisis. It said: "His comments did not reflect the
situation on the ground. The disease was, at this stage, out of
control by any reasonable measure. "The minister's comments
contributed to the loss of trust on the part of rural communities.
Many people, including some of those directly involved in managing
the outbreak, still find it difficult to reconcile their experiences
during this period with the notion of the disease being under
control."
The remarks about Mr Brown were the most pointed criticism of any
individual in the foot and mouth inquiry, which was chaired by Iain
Anderson, a former adviser to Tony Blair. No individual is blamed for
the crisis, but Dr Anderson said that a series of blunders turned it
into a disaster.
He criticised ministers for:
- Failing to call in the army until late in the crisis;
- Failing to introduce national restrictions on the movements of
livestock until 3 days after the outbreak, unlike the Netherlands,
which introduced restrictions within 24 hours of the first outbreak
in Britain. "Considering what is known about the infectious nature of
this disease, we conclude that earlier movement restrictions would
have been justified and should have been ready to be put in place
more quickly than they were";
- Failing to hand control of the disease to the Cobra crisis centre
in the Cabinet Office until the 31st day of the crisis.
The report warned that lessons of the inquiry into the 1967 foot and
mouth outbreak appeared not to have been learned. "In the
Northumberland report [into the 1967 outbreak] and back through the
decades similar conclusions to ours were drawn about the need for
preparation, the rapid deployment of resources and the central
importance of speed, above all speed-to-slaughter of infected
animals. Better preparation to support speedier deployment of
critical skills and faster action on the ground to slaughter infected
animals and their close contacts would have limited the scale of the
damage".
Tony Blair, who was praised for his decisive role in bringing the
disease under control once Downing Street and the Cabinet Office took
charge, did not escape criticism. He was among a series of ministers
and officials criticised for their failure to recall key events from
the crisis. "There was not a coherent memory of how [key decisions]
were made," Dr Anderson said.
Mrs Beckett told MPs that the government was "determined to learn the
lessons" of what happened in one of the world's worst epidemics.
Flanked by Mr Blair, she said she had no difficulty in accepting Dr
Anderson's recommendation that the government should admit it made
mistakes. "I can and I do," Mrs Beckett said. "The house will know
that I have always acknowledged that in the desperate circumstances
faced not only by the farming community but by my department and its
officials... mistakes were bound to have been made."

Recommendations of reports into foot-and-mouth
----------------------------------------------
The Government set up 3 inquiries following the most recent foot and
mouth outbreak. The main points of all 3, and of the inquiry report
after the 1967 outbreak, are listed below.
1. The Lessons learned inquiry by Dr Iain Anderson, a former advisor
to the Prime Minister, published today is the final report. Its main
recommendations are:
-Revise powers under the Animal Health Act 1981 to ensure laws for
slaughter are clarified.
-Vaccination must form part of future control of a disease outbreak.
-The Military to be called in immediately for assessment of help they
can provide.
-The 20-day standstill between the movement of animals to remain
until new risk assessments are finalised.
-Electronic tagging systems for cattle, sheep and pigs.
-Create a new national volunteer reserve to help in a disease outbreak.
-State veterinary service to form "flying squads" to respond to a
disease alert.
-Devise new role for veterinary "paramedics" to assist vets in outbreaks.
-New training for farmers and vets in spotting rare diseases and bio-security.
-No more funeral pyres for dead animals.
-New guidance and instructions on slaughter of animals.
-More consultation with local communities about locations of burial pits.
-A "senatorial" group to be set up to provide independent advice to
the Prime Minister and Cabinet during a crisis.
-Accountants and procurement experts to be recruited to work in
emergency control centres during a crisis.
2. A scientific inquiry by the Royal Society, chaired by Sir Brian
Follett reported last week. Its main recommendations were:
-Emergency vaccination to be used as "a major tool of first resort"
to prevent a foot and mouth outbreak becoming an epidemic.
-The aim is to "vaccinate to live" and for animals to enter the food
chain in the normal way.
-A new campaign to win over consumers to safe eating of foot and
mouth vaccinated meat and milk.
-More research for a foot and mouth vaccine which could possibly be
used routinely within 15 years - this would require international
agreement.
-A new early warning system to alert the country to potential threat
from new exotic diseases. One option is for a New National Centre for
Animal Disease Research and Surveillance.
-An EU-wide database on disease, threat and risks.
-A new national database of every owner of farm animals including
pets, zoos, rare breed collections and animal sanctuaries.
-The need to draw up contingency plans for every possible disease
threat and for the strategies to be debated in Parliament.
-Tighter import controls at ports on passenger baggage and freight
containers to keep out diseases.
-More training for farmers and vets to spot rare diseases and even a
special video to be compiled for the purpose.
-Tighter controls on animal movements for sheep and cattle to ensure
traceability and limit potential for spread of disease.
-An extra 250 million BP funding requited for research and
development, particularly to find a new diagnostic test to quickly
identify diseased farms.
-Tests to distinguish between an infected and vaccinated animals also
a priority.
-Encourage new vets to join the state veterinary service.
3. The Policy Commission on Food and Farming, chaired by Sir Don
Curry, reported in January 2002. Its main recommendations were:
-A shift from wasteful food subsidies to greener farming.
-The vision was for 20 percent of all farm subsidy payments to be
paid for environmental schemes and rural projects by 2007.
-The creation of a Food Chain Centre to ensure to ensure maximum
efficiency from farm gate to plate and to help farmers to drive up
their prices.
-Boost for organic farming - farmers to receive payments after
conversion from traditional to organic farming, as happens in other
continental countries.
-New controls on illegal meat imports - the Government is already
working on a scheme to introduce sniffer dogs to check luggage at
airports and ports.
-New champion for local food to encourage people to buy British.
-An extension of the red tractor logo on farm foods.
-A new Priorities Board to decide and fund new research on animal diseases.
-A network of demonstration farms to show best practice.
-Farms should follow strict farm standards or face Government licensing.
-An increase from 10 000 to 50 000 seasonal part-time workers a year
allowed to be hired by farmers. Fruit growers are unable to find
pickers in summer and this allows them to employ more foreign
students.
-Farmers to be paid handouts from Brussels in euros to save bank
conversion costs.
-Electronic tagging of all cattle, sheep and pigs.
-Boost for green energy with reduction of duty on biofuels and more
support for combined heat and power plants.
-Streamline red tape by setting up new system of farm audits.
-All school children to visit a working farm.
4. The Duke of Northumberland chaired an inquiry into the 1967 foot
and mouth outbreak. Its main recommendations were:
-Ring vaccination to prevent spread of the disease - animals would
later be slaughtered and removed from food chain as occurred in The
Netherlands last year.
-The mobilisation of the Army from day one.
-A ban on meat imports from countries with a history of foot and mouth disease.
-The rapid slaughter of infected animals and burying them on farm in
pits lined with quicklime. The inquiry favoured burying, not burning,
dead animals.
-Infected farms disinfected and cleaned within 24 hours.
-Stringent checks on pig swill operators to ensure food was being
boiled for an hour to kill off disease.
-The appointment of a team of valuers nationwide to keep check on the
compensation payments to farmers.

[With the publication of the "Lessons to be learned" report, all 3
inquiries formally appointed by the British Government have completed
their investigations and delivered their recommendations, as
summarised in the 4th item. In addition to those 3 inquiries, 8 other
investigations into the FMD issue have been conducted in the UK and
Europe (see ref 20010810.1889). An additional Inquiry has been
established by the European parliament on 16 Jan 2002, and its
"Temporary Committee on foot and mouth disease" has recently paid
visits to several locations in the UK.
The full texts of the 3 formal UK reports are available on the internet:
1. Report of the policy commission on the future of farming and food,
January 2002
<http://www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/farming/pdf/PC%20Report2.pdf>
2. Inquiry on Infectious Diseases in Livestock, the Royal Society, July 2002
<http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/inquiry/index.html>
3. Lessons to be learned Inquiry, July 2002
<http://www.fmd-lessonslearned.org.uk/nav/report.htm>
While both last reports deal with the evolution of the FMD epizootic,
their views differ in various aspects, such as the role of computer
modelling; their accuracy and their impact upon decisions and
decision-makers. Though the "Lessons to be learned" Inquiry had,
obviously, to manoeuvre within a politically challenged landscapes,
the document makes a very instructive reading. Science-based lessons
are to be sought in the excellent Royal Society's document. - Mod.AS].
