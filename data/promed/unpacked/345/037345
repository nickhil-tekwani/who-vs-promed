People infected with leprosy in the USA often have the same
previously unknown strain of the microbe _Mycobacterium leprae_ that
is also carried by armadillos. Though it's been known for decades that
armadillos can harbor leprosy, also called Hansen's disease, the
discovery of the overlapping strain strengthens the long-held
assumption that armadillos can infect people directly.

Researchers report in the 28 Apr 2011 New England Journal of Medicine
that many infected people in the Deep South contracted leprosy while
close to home -- not in some exotic locale where the disease is more
common. The only possible infectious agents would be an armadillo or
person. Some of the infected people had even handled armadillos, the
only animal known to harbor leprosy.

The findings all point to animal-to-person spread. "It's still not a
smoking gun, but it's getting awfully close," says James Loughry, a
zoologist and armadillo expert at Valdosta State University in Georgia
who wasn't involved in this project. "It's hard to imagine that it's
not being transmitted from armadillos to humans."

Richard Truman, a microbiologist at the National Hansen's Disease
Program and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, and his
colleagues compared bacterial samples from 50 patients in Louisiana
and from 33 infected wild armadillos from 5 southern states. A highly
specific strain of the bacterium showed up in 28 of the 33 animals and
in 22 of 29 patients who had never lived outside the USA and Mexico.
Interviews with 15 of the leprosy patients further revealed that 8 had
had direct contact with armadillos.

Loughry says roughly 6 to 10 percent of armadillos he has tested in
Alabama and Mississippi have leprosy. Other studies place the rate as
high as 20 percent in the wild.

There are many kinds of armadillos in Latin America, including the
9-banded armadillo -- the only one found in the USA -- but it's not
known if the other types contract leprosy. Since John James Audubon
and John Bachman recorded in the 1840s that armadillos lived in
southern Texas, mainly near the lower Rio Grande, 9-banded armadillos
have expanded their range to much of the Deep South and northward to
the southern tip of Illinois.

It remains unclear how an armadillo would transmit leprosy. Truman
speculates close contact is required. "Actual causality is difficult
to confirm," he says. It's also not clear whether armadillos, which
get sick from leprosy, are infectious during the long incubation
period preceding symptoms. But it's well-known that leprosy spreads
among people. And the limited exposure people have to armadillos means
that some person-to-person transmission must be happening in southern
states where cases show up, Truman says.

Leprosy remains very rare in the USA, with about 150 new cases each
year, says James Krahenbuhl, director of the National Hansen's Disease
Program. "Public education can actually decrease disease risk by
limiting contacts [with armadillos] and increasing awareness among
physicians in these locations," he says. The disease is curable, but
can require more than a year of antibiotics.

[Armadillos are placental mammals found only in the western
hemisphere
(http://bss.sfsu.edu/geog/bholzman/courses/fall99projects/armadillo.htm).
They are primarily nocturnal, feed mainly on insects, and burrow. A
typical burrow is roughly 8 inches wide, 7 feet deep, and up to 15
feet long
(http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw082). Armadillos give birth to 4
identical young from a single egg in each litter. A bony carapace that
covers its back and flanks is divided into 3 sections -- a scapular
shield, a pelvic shield, and a midsection composed of a number of
bands separated by flexible skin. The 9-banded armadillo (_Dasypus
novemcinctus_), with a length of about 2.5 feet and weighing around 14
pounds, is distributed from northern Argentina to the southern USA and
is the only species out of 20 that inhabits the southern portion of
the USA. They are concentrated around the Gulf of Mexico by expansion
of their natural habitat and by escaping from captivity (e.g. in
Florida). They are found in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas,
Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, South
Carolina and even as far north as Nebraska. However, cold weather
limits the northern boundary of the armadillo's range. For a map of
their distribution in the USA, see
http://bss.sfsu.edu/geog/bholzman/courses/fall99projects/armadillo.htm).

Armadillos are naturally infected with _Mycobacterium leprae_, the
cause of leprosy in humans. _M. leprae_ tends to grow in cooler parts
of the human body, such as the feet, nose and ears. The armadillo,
however, has a lower core body temperature than most mammals. The
armadillo's unusually low body temperature, which is similar to that
of human skin, is thought to account for their susceptibility to
systemic infection with this organism. Infected wild armadillos have
been reported in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama & Mississippi,
where more than 20 percent are reported to be infected in some
locales. However, no _M. leprae_ infections have been found in
armadillos examined in Florida (http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw082).

Because lepromatous patients excrete enormous numbers of leprosy
bacilli in their nasal secretions as collected through nose blows, the
mode of spread is likely respiratory or nasal discharge. A case of
lepromatous leprosy poses increased risk for infection for close,
long-term contacts, such as household members. Casual and short-term
contact does not seem to spread the disease. As the organism is also
present in skin, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread.
Because the organisms that are shed by lepromatous patients and
armadillos can persist on surfaces in the environment, fomites are
also a potential source of infection.

About 150 new cases of leprosy are reported each year in the USA.
About 70 percent of those cases have acquired their disease when they
lived or worked in leprosy-endemic regions outside the USA; however,
about 30 percent report no foreign residence and therefore likely
acquired leprosy in the USA. Most of these indigenously acquired cases
reside in Texas and Louisiana, and case-control studies have shown
that contact with _M. leprae_ -infected armadillos by hunting,
handling, or consuming armadillo meat is a risk factor for acquisition
of leprosy in the U.S.

The above news release refers to a recently published study (Truman
RW, Singh P, Sharma R, et al. Probable Zoonotic Leprosy in the
Southern United States. N Engl J Med 2011; 364:1626-1633. April 28,
2011. Available at:
http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010536). The researchers
analyzed the genomes of _M. leprae_ collected from 50 unrelated
patients with multibacillary leprosy and 33 armadillos that were
captured in the wild in 5 states where armadillos are known to harbor
_M. leprae_. 39 of the 50 patients reported residence in Mexico or
U.S. states with leprosy-infected armadillos, and 29 of the 39
reported no foreign residence. Genotyping confirmed that the same
highly specific strain of the bacterium showed up in 28 of the 33
animals and in 22 of 29 patients who had never lived outside the USA
and Mexico and who resided in states with leprosy-infected armadillos.
Interviews with 15 of the leprosy patients further revealed that 8 had
had direct contact with armadillos. This genotype has not been
reported previously elsewhere in the world. In patients whose risk was
foreign residence only, the genotype was typical for the strains found
in that foreign region.
