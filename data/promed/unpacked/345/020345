State health officials say that a Utah man died after exposure to [a] hantavirus last month [May 2016].

Medical privacy policies prohibited release of the man's identity, but Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko did confirm Thursday [2 Jun 2016] that the victim was between the ages of 45 and 64, and that he died in late May.

"I can't provide anything more specific than that," he said. "We've worked with the family to provide information on how to safely clean rodent droppings from properties they frequent."

Rats, mice, and other burrowing and nesting rodents are known to carry the deadly disease, which can be spread to humans through contact with the animals' urine, saliva, or feces.

[The spring season often brings with it sporadic cases of hantavirus infections, as cabins and other buildings unused over the winter are opened up and cleaned. In the western USA, the virus responsible for this and previous cases in Utah doubtless is Sin Nombre. Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir host of the virus.

As mentioned in a previous post, important steps to follow to prevent contracting hantavirus include:
- Air out closed-up buildings before entering.
- Trap mice until they are all gone.
- Clean up nests and droppings using a disinfectant.
- Don't sweep up rodent droppings into the air where they can be inhaled.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Get rid of trash and junk piles.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.

Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate associated with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Prompt medical attention is essential.
