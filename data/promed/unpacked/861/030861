Chagas disease in the Chaco
---------------------------
You would not know it if you drove to his small
farm, but Ramon Raul Alegre is the owner of a
unique mud hut. It looks like all the other adobe
outhouses dotted near the dusty, dirt tracks in
Pampa del Indio, which is a municipality of
Argentina's northerly Chaco province, except that
it is more dilapidated than most. That is because
the walls of Alegre's hut have been dismantled
chunk by chunk, every few months, by scientists
from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) in
Argentina, who are searching for the
blood-sucking bug _Triatoma infestans_. It is the
region's main vector of _Trypanosoma cruzi_,
which is the parasite that causes Chagas disease.

The reason for this piecemeal destruction is that
Alegre's hut is the 1st known to house bugs that
somehow developed resistance to pyrethroids, the
class of insecticides that has dominated
vector-control programmes for Chagas disease
since the mid-1980s. Curiously, the bugs
developed this resistance in the absence of
repeated exposure to pyrethroids. No one is sure
how this happened. It is possible that the bugs
were recently transported from a site in the
western part of the Gran Chaco -- a vast lowland
plain that encompasses parts of Argentina,
Bolivia and Paraguay -- or that the resistance
arose spontaneously in the local population.

The initial sign came when Alegre was bitten at
sunset in a nearby field shortly after the hut
was 1st sprayed. This prompted an experiment. 4
times at 2-monthly intervals Juan Manuel
Gurevitz, a PhD student at the UBA, re-sprayed
the hut with pyrethroids and collected the bugs
that died. Between each application, Gurevitz
placed a tent of mosquito netting over the whole
structure to stop bugs escaping or re-infesting
the hut -- and to prevent Alegre's goats from gobbling fallen insects.

"We tried all approaches to maximize pyrethroid
effectiveness," says Uriel Kitron, who is a
professor of environmental sciences at Emory
University in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United
States, and who is observing the study site. "All
the time the bugs were able to reproduce and
recover their numbers." Today's inspection
suggests that the 5th spraying in 2 years, this
time with malathion -- a much more toxic
insecticide that cannot be purchased over the
counter in Argentina -- has finally nailed
Alegre's problem. The pyrethroid resistance has
been confirmed by blind laboratory tests on the bugs.

Life-long Chagas man
--------------------
Both Gurevitz and Kitron work with Ricardo
Gurtler. Now aged 55 years, Gurtler has studied
the fundamentals of Chagas disease transmission
and control since he was a PhD student. For
roughly the 1st half of his career, Gurtler
watched with optimism as the big budget,
militaristic Southern Cone Initiative interrupted
vectorial transmission of Chagas disease in 3 of
Argentina's 5 neighbouring countries. This
happened in a few provinces of Argentina as well.
After 2001, when the country experienced the
largest sovereign default in economic history,
however, Argentina's control programmes were
degraded by inconsistent funding and vague or
absent management. The number of Argentines
displaying acute symptoms of Chagas disease has
since risen in 8 of the 22 provinces.

The bulk of Gurtler's research comes from
Santiago del Estero province in Argentina, where
he and his co-workers kept tabs on a study site
between 1984 and 2006 (ref. 1). They have
compiled a huge database. Over the years, they
monitored bug densities, counted how many bugs
were infected at different stages of development,
tested dogs, cats and residents, and organized
communities to plaster the walls of some houses
to eliminate the crevices that the bugs like to
hide in. They used the information to model _T.
cruzi_ transmission mathematically (2).

Policy recommendations fell out of their models.
"For example, Ricardo showed that if you have
fewer than 2 dogs in a household, you're unlikely
to get infected," says Rick Tarleton, who is a
professor at the University of Georgia and has
researched Chagas disease since the 1980s. "That
information has been helpful in planning dog
vaccination programmes." A group at the
Autonomous University of Yucatan, in Merida,
Mexico, has started testing a therapeutic DNA
vaccine against _T. cruzi_ in mongrel dogs. In
2008, they published the results of a pilot
clinical trial, which showed some success.

Over the past decade, researchers have
increasingly used dogs as sentinels of _T. cruzi_
transmission, and new research has suggested that
their immune reaction against bug salivary
antigens can be used as a surveillance tool. "The
dog issue is a classic example of the kind of
heterogeneity we keep finding with Chagas," says
Kitron, as a ragged old dog limps past. "This
guy's much more likely to be the source of
infection than the other dogs here." Similarly,
20­30 percent of the buildings in each community
seem to act as foci of infected bugs that rapidly
re-infest other buildings after a spraying
campaign (3). "But that means that control can be targeted," adds Gurtler.

The Santiago del Estero project revealed the
basic dynamics of Chagas disease in the Gran
Chaco. Now that job is done, Gurtler's focus has
been to understand how they differ across it. For
this, he has established 3 new study sites in the
Gran Chaco: one in Bolivia, one in Paraguay and
one in Argentina. The sites have different
vegetation, climate and ethnic groups. An added
bonus of the new set-up, Gurtler hopes, will be
to encourage more collaboration between academics
and vector-control officials in the 3 countries.

Tobas and triatomes
-------------------
Pampa del Indio is Gurtler's new location in
Argentina. It has a population of around 15 000.
One-third of the inhabitants live in a town of
the same name; the rest live in huts scattered
along the few tracks that transect the
municipality and along the edges of scrubby
forest. It is among the poorest municipalities in
Argentina, and has probably the highest
percentage of people of indigenous origin of any
municipality in the country. The local indigenous
folk in Pampa del Indio belong to the Toba ethnic
group. Tobas lived a largely nomadic life,
hunting and fishing, until deforestation and
agriculture arrived in the area in the early
decades of the twentieth century. The government
of Juan Peron, who was Argentina's famous thrice
ruler, gave some Tobas land titles approximately
60 years ago. This encouraged them to live a more agricultural existence.

Alegre is Toba
--------------
His other hut  where he lives -- shows why Toba
homes are much more likely to be infested with
_T. infestans_ than those of Creoles in Pampa del
Indio. Tobas often choose to sleep on the floor.
They tend to thatch the roofs of their houses,
providing _T. infestans_ with more prime habitat
than just mud walls. In general, Tobas are poorer
than the non-indigenous inhabitants, so they can
less easily afford insecticides, and find it
harder to travel to the town's small hospital
where they might learn about Chagas disease and
receive treatment. The Toba population is also in
constant flux: Tobas are attracted to Pampa del
Indio because it is where their community is
gaining political power, which is also why the
town acts as a springboard for those migrating to
Argentina's main cities seeking work or bigger welfare payments.

For these reasons, monitoring _T. cruzi_
transmission among indigenous people is often
difficult. "Sometimes the Toba ask 'Why do you
want my blood?'" explains Gurtler, who has taken
to 1st testing households' dogs and presenting
these results to the owners to convince them that
a blood test is in their interests. "You can't
take samples from people and leave. You have to
build trust -- it takes time -- and the local
health-care staff can't do this because they are
understaffed." Tobas also have a different attitude towards their homes.

For instance, last year, Gurtler and his team
found 500-odd vectors in one house, just 15
minutes after spraying -- which suggested that
the hut could have been infested with about 5000
bugs in total. Rather than treating the house,
the family decided to burn it to the ground.
"They often do the same if a relative dies in a
house -- burn it and build another house close
by," explains Gurtler. Understanding these
idiosyncrasies is part of what he calls "the
human element," which Gurtler believes is
neglected by most Chagas disease
control programmes -- a sentiment echoed by
on-the-ground researchers in other countries.

From Chagas to Kafka
--------------------
This trip's purpose is to show Kitron around the
new study site. As part of the tour, Gurtler
drops in on the local hospital. It seems clean,
with a committed but under-trained staff. The
director, Arturo Navajas, is open about its
problems. He does not have good statistics on the
prevalence of Chagas disease locally. His best
data are for the pregnant women who visit the
hospital, of which approximately 10 percent test
positive. The true figure is almost certainly
higher. Moreover, the hospital has only 2 boxes
of drugs -- enough for merely 15 people -- that
arrived a year after they were ordered.

Inefficiencies at every level beset the
scientists trying to study Chagas disease. In
2002, in the middle of Argentina's economic
crisis, Gurtler and Kitron received a grant from
the United States National Institutes of Health,
of which more than USD 500 000 went to their work
in Argentina. Meanwhile, to reduce the rate at
which cash left the country, the Argentine
government passed a law limiting the amount of
money that could be withdrawn from bank accounts
to a few hundred dollars a week. This meant that
Gurtler had to buy reagents and minor equipment
during trips to the United States.

"Even today we have to justify every dollar that
enters the lab's bank account as if we were
laundering money. It's really not anyone's
fault," he shrugs. "It's the way everything works
here. It's a kind of Kafka-esque story. People
from abroad find it hard to understand. It's a
challenge everywhere to get funded [...] but here
dealing with how you get to the money takes about
a third of researchers' time."

Like many countries in Latin America, Argentina
has a decentralized public-health system.
Provinces and municipalities administer vector
control in a whimsically individual way. In Pampa
del Indio, for example, no official is
responsible for ensuring that houses are sprayed
with insecticides; however, favours can sometimes
be bartered. The morning after Gurtler shows
Kitron the hospital, he is back to speak to
Navajas. He has telephoned Hector Frelij, who is
a friend of his in Buenos Aires and who has the
difficult task of coordinating Chagas disease
control at the national level. Frelij has agreed
to send more drugs directly to Pampa del Indio.
In response, Navajas says he will help Gurtler in
organizing cross-sectional blood tests of the
community to provide an estimation of the local prevalence of the disease.

The dark side of data
---------------------
Good data are scarce, and the more scientists
dig, the more they seem to be debunking the
assumptions upon which the Southern Cone
Initiative was based. In the beginning,
eliminating _T. infestans_ was considered
achievable because this vector was thought to be
highly susceptible to pyrethroids and lacking the
genetic variation required to develop resistance.
Several groups, including Gurtler's, have
disproved these assumptions. The bugs were also
thought to be bad fliers and unable to re-infest
from afar. Gurtler's data from Santiago del
Estero, however, reveal that they can travel
distances of 500­2000 meters [547-2187 yards] (4).

It was also assumed that once all of the _T.
infestans_ bugs in a settlement had been
eliminated, re-infestation from nearby forests
was impossible. Except for a melanic version or
'dark morph' of _T. infestans_ that lives in the
Andean valleys of Bolivia, _T. infestans_ was
thought to be unable to survive and breed in the wild. Again, this is untrue.

In the summers of 2006 and 2007, several members
of Gurtler's group identified dark morphs in
forest 40 km [25 miles] from the town of Fuerte
Esperanza in northeast Argentina, not far from
Pampa del Indio5, and about 1000 km [620 miles]
from the Andean valleys of Bolivia. They did this
by piggy-backing on a study of the local
population of _Amazona aestiva_ and _Aratinga
acuticaudata_ parrots. These birds tend to nest
in hardwood trees with trunks made hollow by a
fungus. When Gurtler's group placed jars
containing live mice (as bait) in the trees, they
recovered dark morphs of _T. infestans_ glued to
the sticky paper placed around the necks of the
jars. The trapped bugs appear to be genetically
much closer to the insects living in huts in
Pampa del Indio than to the sylvatic dark morphs
in Bolivia -- suggesting that some of the
re-infestation in the eastern Gran Chaco comes from non-domestic populations.

"It's just that no one looked for them before,"
suggests Gurtler. Similarly, nobody thought to
study urban vectors until recently  or
systematically checked, after spraying campaigns,
whether the bugs really did die. These
revelations point to why the original Southern
Cone Initiative did not work everywhere, and give
some hope that programmes can be designed to reinvigorate it.

Back at Alegre's unique mud hut, Gurevitz has
found _T. infestans_ vectors in a nearby chicken
coop. It is unknown whether these originated from
the resistant population in the hut or flew to
the coop from another house 500 m [547 yards]
away. Gurtler, Gurevitz and Kitron drive to
Alegre's house to try and find him. His wife
appears. "More bugs?" she asks, disappointed.
"Don't worry, we'll get rid of them. We'll be back," promises Gurevitz.
