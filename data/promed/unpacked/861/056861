Almost all crops of wheat are infected by cereal leaf rust, _Puccinia
recondita_, in fields in the Ussolskiy, Cheremkhovskiy and Irkutsk
districts of the Irkutsk region. It is one of the most widespread
diseases of wheat. Experts from the regional station of Plant
Protection warned about it last week [14 Jul 2006]. According to
Galina Fedorova, the manager of the phyto-sanitary department, it is
necessary to harvest fields urgently, otherwise about 40 percent of
the crops may be lost. Now is the period when wheat is heading,
therefore leaf rust is especially dangerous. "When infection occurs
at heading and before grain has ripened, it will affect productivity
severely," explains Galina Fedorova. Hot and damp weather promotes
the spread of rust. One way to control the disease is spraying with a
special solution [fungicide - Mod.JAD] with the help of aircraft or
sprays. It is an expensive procedure and is therefore accessible only
to those who can afford it.

[The cereal crop plant wheat (bread wheat,_Triticum aestivum_ & durum
wheat, _Triticum turgidum_), develops symptoms of leaf rust (aka
brown rust) when infected with the fungus _P. triticina_ (aka _P.
recondita f. sp. tritici_).
The Russian Federation is one of the largest wheat producers in the
world, with a production area of up to 26 million ha. Among many
fungal, viral and bacterial diseases, leaf/brown rust disease results
in the greatest yield losses because it is found everywhere and takes
away about 10 percent of annual yield. In epidemic years, yield
losses may be 50 percent and more. In various regions (Central and
Southern Russia, East Siberia, Volga Region), brown rust epidemics
develop frequently on both winter and spring wheat crops.
The use of resistant cultivars and fungicide treatments manage this
disease in some major wheat production areas of the world, but it
remains a major threat to wheat production elsewhere, as pointed out
in this posting - Mod.JAD]
[The Irkutsk region is located in the south of Eastern Siberia, in
Pribaikalye. The region comprises 7 679 sq. km (4.6 percent of all
Russian territory). The region includes 33 areas (raions) and 22
cities. The Irkutsk region is larger than any Western European state.
Its territory could contain Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Great Britain,
Portugal and Holland combined. The region borders the Krasnoyarsk
region in the west, in the east the Chita region, in the southeast
and south the Republic of Buryatiya, and in the southwest the Tyva
Republic. In the northeast, the border runs along the Republic Sakha
(Yakutia), which is included in the structure of the Far Eastern
economic region. The total extent of its borders exceeds 7240 km,
including Lake Baikal, 520 km. - Corresp.NP]
