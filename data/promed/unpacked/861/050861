The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health was [on 7 Mar 2017] investigating an imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The male patient, aged 76 with underlying illnesses, developed fever and cough with sputum on [3 Mar 2017] and sought medical attention at a private clinic the next day. He attended the accident and emergency department of Yan Chai Hospital on [5 Mar 2017] and was admitted on the same day for management. The patient has been transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital for isolation and further management. His clinical diagnosis is pneumonia and he is now in a critical condition. His nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen tested positive for influenza A(H7N9) virus tonight [8 Mar 2017].

Enquiries revealed that the patient travelled alone to Fuzhou, Fujian [mainland China] between [11 Feb and 1 Mar 2017] during which he visited a wet market there. The patient's close contact has remained asymptomatic so far and has been put under medical surveillance. Tracing of his other contacts in Hong Kong is under way.

"The case has been reported to the mainland and Macau health authorities as well as the World Health Organization. We are communicating with the mainland authority to follow up the patient's exposure and movements in the mainland. Based on information available thus far, it is classified as an imported case. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. We will issue letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions to alert them to the latest situation," a spokesman for the CHP said.

"In Hong Kong, it is the 5th imported human case of H7N9 recorded this winter [2016-17]. The number of human cases reported in the mainland has increased substantially with more than 480 cases recorded since last October [2016]. The number of cases in this wave so far has been much higher than that in the same period last winter season. The situation demands particular attention," the spokesman added.

The CHP of the Department of Health [8 Mar 2017] reported an update on the 5th human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong this winter [2016-17]. Contact tracing has so far identified 7 close contacts and 61 other contacts. All have remained asymptomatic. The close contacts are the patient's home and ward contacts. They will be given antiviral prophylaxis with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for 5 days, advised to wear a mask, and put under medical surveillance for 10 days following their last exposure to the patient.

[This report covers 5 recent cases reported since the last update on 7 Mar 2017. All reports indicate that epidemiological investigations were undertaken and some cases had exposure to wet market poultry, followed by illness. All identified contacts are being monitored for symptoms of influenza like illness. However, continued occurrence of these cases mandates that stricter preventive measures be implemented in the wet markets to reduce transmission. - Mod.UBA
