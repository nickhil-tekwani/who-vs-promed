Some North American bats leave hibernation with little sign of the devastating effects of white nose syndrome, a fungal epidemic that has claimed the lives of some 5 million bats since it first emerged in winter 2005. But even though those bats seem to have survived the fungal disease, their immune systems reactivate and can then inexplicably -- and devastatingly -- kick into overdrive, a new study reports.

These animals appear to have what immunologists call immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, or IRIS. The discovery of the condition in bats "is the 1st potential example of IRIS that has ever been seen outside a human patient," observes wildlife pathologist Carol Meteyer of the US Geological Survey in Madison, Wisconsin. Until now, most IRIS victims have been HIV patients treated with medicines to restore flagging immune systems.

Together with Daniel Barber and Judith Mandl at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, Meteyer describes the bats' IRIS-like disease in the 15 Nov 2012 Virulence [issue].

Animals afflicted with white nose syndrome acquire the infection during hibernation, when their bodies chill to near-freezing and their immune systems effectively go into suspended animation. Despite its name, the disease appears to kill its hosts by eroding large patches of tissue in the animals' wings. _Geomyces destructans_, the infecting fungus, then begins filling in those divots with its own cells, Meteyer says. Stricken bats become weak, dehydrated -- and eventually become unable to fly.

IRIS seems to show up in bats that have largely evaded this scenario. Instead, these animals emerge from hibernation with normal-looking wings. But as their body temperature warms back up and their immune systems reactivate, their health takes a nosedive. Within days, dark patches riddle their wings. The patches point to where immune cells known as neutrophils have begun unleashing an inflammatory assault against the fungus they've been summoned to eradicate. Over the next 2 weeks, these and other immune cells encapsulate the fungal patches, walling them inside scablike structures. Soon the scabs fall away, leaving the wings with huge holes. Flight becomes limited, if not impossible.

The 1st signs of this unusual condition emerged in May 2008, Meteyer recalls: "I was being sent bats found in front yards. They could not fly." She quickly dismissed her initial suspicion, rabies, after examining the 1st animal's wings. "Under microscopy, I could see the wings were tattered with holes." Further probing would link inflammation to this damage.

Animals exhibiting IRIS can be nursed back to health in the lab with food, drink, and warmth, Meteyer has shown. But in the wild, it's doubtful such animals stand a chance, she says. If the fungal disease doesn't kill them outright, IRIS will. "They just face this double whammy."

What her team describes in its new paper reflects what appears to happen in HIV patients, says Samuel Shelburne, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Although HIV depresses their immune systems, these patients can acquire other types of infections -- such as from bacteria -- that they initially don't fight. But then when drug therapy reconstitutes that immunity, these people can develop an overwhelming inflammatory response.

Bats might therefore offer an animal system in which this situation develops, he says, so that researchers can probe why only some HIV patients develop the devastating IRIS backlash.

In fact, Meteyer notes, her colleagues at NIH hope to test just that using colonies of hibernating Mexican free-tail bats. This species, unlike those naturally affected by white nose syndrome, survives well in captivity and is not endangered.

The article abstract reads:
"White nose syndrome, caused by _Geomyces destructans_, has killed more than 5 million cave hibernating bats in eastern North America. During hibernation, the lack of inflammatory cell recruitment at the site of fungal infection and erosion is consistent with a temperature-induced inhibition of immune cell trafficking. This immune suppression allows _G. destructans_ to colonize and erode the skin of wings, ears, and muzzle of bat hosts unchecked. Yet, paradoxically, within weeks of emergence from hibernation an intense neutrophilic inflammatory response to _G. destructans_ is generated, causing severe pathology that can contribute to death. We hypothesize that the sudden reversal of immune suppression in bats upon the return to euthermia leads to a form of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS was first described in HIV-infected humans with low helper T lymphocyte counts and bacterial or fungal opportunistic infections. IRIS is a paradoxical and rapid worsening of symptoms in immune compromised humans upon restoration of immunity in the face of an ongoing infectious process. In humans with HIV, the restoration of adaptive immunity following suppression of HIV replication with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) can trigger severe immune-mediated tissue damage that can result in death. We propose that the sudden restoration of immune responses in bats infected with _G. destructans_ results in an IRIS-like dysregulated immune response that causes the post-emergent pathology."
