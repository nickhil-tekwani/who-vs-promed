An early warning of how many people will die from the brain disease
new-variant CJD could be revealed by tests on thousands of appendixes and
tonsils removed over the past two decades. The tissues stored by hospitals
are to be examined after a discovery that the agent responsible for the
disease can be identified in the appendix before brain symptoms appear.
So far, there have been 27 confirmed cases of nvCJD, but some experts have
warned that ultimately tens or even hundreds of thousands could die. By
testing the tissue samples, a firmer estimate may be possible. Announcing
the programme, Sir Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer, said that the
discovery made it possible to explore how the disease develops, and measure
its likely impact.
The discovery was made after a Devon coastguard, Tony Barrett, 45, died of
CJD in July. His appendix was removed at Torbay in September 1995, eight
months before he displayed symptoms of CJD. The appendix was recovered,
examined, and found to contain prion protein, an indication of infection by
nvCJD. This is the first time that the disease has been identified in any
tissue before the symptoms, said James Ironside of the CJD Surveillance
Unit at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.
The plan is to examine a large number of specimens dating from the
mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, the period when risk of infection from beef was
at its greatest. They will be compared with specimens from the 1970s,
before "mad cow disease" appeared. Dr Ironside said it was not clear how
many specimens would be tested, but it would be thousands. Each test takes
about two days, and the samples will be anonymous.
If any is found to contain prion protein, Sir Kenneth said, there would be
careful consideration of what to do next. Although anonymous testing is a
good way of assessing the prevalence of an infection, previously used for
HIV, difficult ethical questions arise if positive samples are found. The
Health Department will have to decide whether to tell individuals that they
are incubating a fatal disease.
Interpreting the tests will be difficult. Dr Ironside believes that anybody
showing evidence of prion protein in the lymphoid tissues of the appendix
or tonsils is likely to develop the disease, but this is only an
assumption. It is conceivable that many people could carry the infection
without it reaching the brain. It is also likely that the genetic make-up
of the individual could determine vulnerability.
Samples of tissue taken from patients are routinely stored, both as a
valuable research tool and to enable hospitals to defend claims that
symptoms were missed or operations bungled.
With 45,000 appendix operations and several hundred thousand
tonsillectomies performed every year, there will be no shortage of raw
material. Some hospitals have appendix specimens dating back to the 1920s,
Sir Kenneth said yesterday.

[A dauntingly large piece of work, but invaluable. If one may extrapolate
from this one case, any positive tonsil or appendix might be expected to
predict death within a few months. Therefore the earlier in the time series
that positives are identified and then matching with the subsequent history
of the individual, who may or may not have survived, will be very
informative. Can one remove tonsils twice? If one were, say, tonsil
positive in '85 and still alive in '98, is there tonsilar tissue to
re-harvest? - Mod.MHJ]
