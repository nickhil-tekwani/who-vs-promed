Trichinellosis, Yunnan province, China
--------------------------------------
[China has announced that the illness in Lanping (see ProMED-mail
20090303.0869) has been identified as trichinellosis. Below is a
translated excerpt of a Chinese-language article.]

Lanping County's 'infectious disease of unknown origin' has been
identified as trichinellosis.

Today [5 Mar 2009], the provincial CDC reported that it had completed
investigation of the group illness in Lanping County; 9 cases of
trichinellosis have been confirmed and there was one other death due
to severe illness. Surviving patients have improved after aggressive
treatment and the situation has been brought under control.

_Trichinella_ is endemic in China. A recent serosurvey found
trichinella-specific antibodies in humans in all provinces included
in the study. "The seroepidemiological surveys of _T. spiralis_
infection in humans were carried out in 6 provinces or municipalities
of China during 2000-2003. The overall seroprevalence was 3.57
percent. From 2000 to 2003, 17 outbreaks of human trichinellosis,
with 828 cases and 11 deaths were recorded in 8 provinces of
China. All 11 deaths occurred in southwestern China (1 case in
Sichuan, 4 cases in Tibet, and 6 cases in Yunnan." (Wang ZQ, Cui J,
Xu BL: The epidemiology of human trichinellosis in China during
2000-2003. Acta Trop. 2006; 97(3): 247-51;
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16414006>).

Another study found that 3.5 percent of dog meat sold at markets was
infected with _Trichinella_ (Wang ZQ et al: The epidemiology of
animal trichinellosis in China. Vet J. 2007; 173(2):391-8;
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162414>), and the widespread
consumption of dog meat could be part of the explanation for the high
prevalence of infection in China. - Mod.EP
