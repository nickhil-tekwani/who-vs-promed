Lung transplant recipients can die from excess ammonia, a condition a new study links to urinary tract bacteria.

A 44 year old man appeared to be recovering nicely after a double lung transplant at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. A week after the surgery, however, the patient, whose own lungs had been ruined by the inflammatory disease pulmonary sarcoidosis, grew confused and then became delirious. Although a brain scan found nothing wrong, tests showed that the amount of ammonia in his blood had spiked -- and continued to rise even after dialysis to remove the toxin. 40 days after his surgery, he died.

Now, a new study implicates bacteria that normally live in the urinary tract as the cause of the man's fatal illness and the deaths of other lung transplant patients [1]. The work suggests a way to treat a rare but deadly complication of organ transplantation and cancer treatment.

Although our bodies normally produce small amounts of ammonia when we break down proteins, liver enzymes transform it into a safer compound, urea, which is excreted in our urine. In some organ transplant recipients and cancer patients, however, the amount of ammonia in the blood explodes. Although this condition, known as hyperammonemia, is unusual, "when it has occurred, it's been disastrous," says pulmonologist Mark Wylam of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The brain swells, and patients fall into a coma. "The end of the ordeal is that they die," he says.

Not only is hyperammonemia resistant to treatment and usually fatal, but the cause has also been elusive. In 2013, Wylam and colleagues discovered the likely culprit in one case, a 64 year old woman who died from hyperammonemia after a double lung transplant [2]. They found that her blood and tissues were positive for a type of bacterium, _Mycoplasma hominis_, that often causes mild genital infections in women.

But the man who died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital showed no signs of _M. hominis_, thoracic surgeon Ankit Bharat of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago and colleagues found. Instead, they detected a different bacterium, _Ureaplasma urealyticum_, in the man's blood and in samples from his bladder, spleen, liver, and lungs. The team then tested tissue from 3 other lung transplant patients who had died from hyperammonemia, including the patient studied by Wylam and colleagues. All 3 showed evidence of infection with _U. urealyticum_ or a kindred microbe, _U. parvum_. In contrast, 20 lung transplant recipients who didn't develop hyperammonemia were negative for all 3 microbes, the researchers report online today [22 Apr 2015] in Science Translational Medicine.

The researchers also checked for the bacteria in 2 lung transplant recipients who had hyperammonemia but were still alive. Both patients carried _U. urealyticum_ or _U. parvum_ bacteria, and both recovered after antibiotic treatment.

Wylam, who wasn't connected to the new study, says the results are convincing. "They have shown that _U. urealyticum_ can also cause these unexplained cases of hyperammonemia." The authors of the paper recommend testing lung transplant recipients who have hyperammonemia for _Ureaplasma_ infection. The study also provides guidance about treating the condition. Although the man Bharat and colleagues studied had received the antibiotic azithromycin, the bacteria may have become resistant to it. The microbes are vulnerable to 3 families of antibiotics, so a combination of drugs would be a better choice to avoid resistance, Bharat says.

About 2/3rds of us have ureaplasma bacteria living in our urinary tract, where they feast on urea, breaking it down to produce energy and releasing ammonia as a byproduct. Why the bacteria occasionally trigger widespread infections and death isn't clear. Cancer patients and transplant recipients have suppressed immune systems, and the microbes might take advantage of their weakened defenses. However, another possibility emerged when Bharat and colleagues found that the lungs of one donor already contained the bacteria before the organs were transplanted into the recipient. So donor organs could deliver the microbes to patients who develop hyperammonemia.

Ureaplasma microbes are hard to diagnose because they don't like to grow in the cultures that hospitals often use to identify the culprits in bacterial infections. Unrecognized infections could be responsible for additional cases of hyperammonemia and even other illnesses, Bharat says. For example, he notes, the microbes could be causing disease in malnourished patients. "These organisms could be a bigger problem," he says.

Disseminated _Ureaplasma_ infection as a cause of fatal hyperammonemia in humans. Sci Transl Med 2015; 7 (284). Abstract available at: http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/284/284re3.short.

Abstract
--------
"Hyperammonemia syndrome is a fatal complication affecting immunosuppressed patients. Frequently refractory to treatment, it is characterized by progressive elevations in serum ammonia of unknown etiology, ultimately leading to cerebral edema and death. In mammals, ammonia produced during amino acid metabolism is primarily cleared through the hepatic production of urea, which is eliminated in the kidney. _Ureaplasma_ species, commensals of the urogenital tract, are Mollicutes dependent on urea hydrolysis to ammonia and carbon dioxide for energy production. We hypothesized that systemic infection with _Ureaplasma_ species might pose a unique challenge to human ammonia metabolism by liberating free ammonia resulting in the hyperammonemia syndrome. We used polymerase chain reaction, specialized culture, and molecular resistance profiling to identify systemic ureaplasma infection in lung transplant recipients with hyperammonemia syndrome, but did not detect it in any lung transplant recipients with normal ammonia concentrations. Administration of ureaplasma-directed antimicrobials to patients with hyperammonemia syndrome resulted in biochemical and clinical resolution of the disorder. Relapse in one patient was accompanied by recurrent ureaplasma bacteremia with antimicrobial resistance. Our results provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between ureaplasma infection and hyperammonemia, suggesting a need to test for this organism and provide empiric antimicrobial treatment while awaiting microbiological confirmation."

An earlier publication of this clinical syndrome in immunocompromised patients appeared in Lancet: Wylam ME, Kennedy CC, Hernandez NM, et al. Fatal hyperammonaemia caused by _Mycoplasma hominis_. Case Report. Lancet 2013; 382 (9908):1956. Abstract available at: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62115-7/abstract.

Abstract
--------
"A 64 year old woman had bilateral-sequential lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis. The adolescent donor had a history of polysubstance abuse and massive head trauma. On postoperative day 4 the transplant recipient was extubated, developed fever to 38.4 deg C, and became less alert. CT of the head showed no specific findings. On postoperative day 6 neurological examination showed minimal eye movements and severe encephalopathy. MRI brain scan showed small foci of restricted diffusion consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, attributed to intravenous tacrolimus."

_Ureaplasma_ and _Mycoplasma_ are bacterial genera that comprise the order _Mycoplasmatales_. They are the smallest self-replicating organisms with the smallest genomes (a total of about 500 to 1000 genes) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7637/). They lack a cell wall and are not visualized by Gram staining. They can be detected by use of specialized culture media or PCR that many hospital-based laboratories do not offer. These organisms are primarily noninvasive mucosal pathogens in healthy hosts. They usually reside extracellularly on the mucosal surface of the respiratory or urogenital tracts, but can rarely invade the bloodstream and disseminate to numerous organs and tissues in immunocompromised patients.

_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ is a well-established respiratory pathogen and is rarely isolated from healthy persons. _Mycoplasma hominis_ and _Ureaplasma_ species are genital tract organisms that are generally considered opportunists, which cause invasive infections in susceptible populations. _Ureaplasma_ species have been isolated from cervicovaginal specimens in up to 80 per cent and _M. hominis_ has been isolated from cervicovaginal specimens in up to 53 per cent of asymptomatic sexually active women and in a lower percentage of men. These genital species can be sexually transmitted and cause urethritis and, in women, pelvic inflammatory disease. The genital mycoplasma can be transmitted to newborns during vaginal delivery.

Release of ammonia occurs in _M. hominis_ by arginine metabolism and in ureaplasma through hydrolysis of urea mediated by a very potent urease (http://cmr.asm.org/content/18/4/757.full). Hydrolysis of arginine or urea is the predominant means by which these organisms generate ATP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2751442/). Release of ammonia in the urinary tract can cause elevation of urinary pH and precipitation of magnesium ammonium phosphate, also known as struvite stones in the urinary tract. The above articles attribute elevated blood ammonia levels (hyperammonemia) in organ transplant recipients to disseminated _M. hominis_ or ureaplasma infection in these patients. Elevated blood ammonia levels and increased entry of ammonia into the brain can cause an encephalopathy.

Proper specimen collection and handling are important in detecting these organisms and laboratories should be notified in advance if infection caused by these organisms are suspected. Serologic studies are not useful for evaluating genital mycoplasmal infections.

Most mycoplasma and ureaplasma are susceptible to tetracyclines, macrolides (such as erythromycin and azithromycin), and fluoroquinolones, but are resistant to antibiotics that specifically inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, such as the beta-lactam antibiotics. However, _M. hominis_ is intrinsically resistant to 14- and 15- membered ring macrolides, including erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin, and resistance to tetracycline and the macrolides, associated with therapeutic failure, have been acquired by _Mycoplasma_ species and ureaplasma. - Mod.ML
