An outbreak of an infectious disease is plaguing children and employees at
day-care centers and public pools in Ohio and Kentucky.
Officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta are
working with Ohio and Kentucky public health officials to monitor the
outbreak of shigellosis, which causes dysentery, and [to track its spread.
The Cincinnati-area outbreak is large, but not nearly as widespread as the
nation's largest in 1987 when 7334 cases were reported in North Carolina,
CDC spokeswoman Nicole Coffin said Tuesday.
Cincinnati had logged at least 1200 cases of the disease as of Monday, said
Dr. Judith Daniels, Cincinnati Health Department medical director. There
were 52 reported cases in nearby northern Kentucky, said Peggy Patterson,
spokeswoman for the Northern Kentucky Independent District Health
Department. "There are some connections to Cincinnati, maybe with day cares
or pools," Patterson said. The outbreak has primarily occurred in day-care
centers, Daniels said.
"We're studying the data and trying to get a clearer picture of where it
started, and how," said Mary Sacco, director of nursing for the Hamilton
County General Health District in Cincinnati.
Shigellosis is a highly contagious disease marked by bloody diarrhea,
cramps, fever, nausea and vomiting. People who don't wash their hands after
using the restroom or changing a diaper can inadvertently spread the
bacteria to others.

[This is apparently the same outbreak reported earlier (see ProMED-mail
references cited above), but now seems to have spread to Kentucky. This is
not surprising since the Cincinnati metropolitan area extends across the
Ohio River into Kentucky, but microbiological characterization of strains
and the results of epidemiological investigations would still be of great
interest. - Mod.ES
