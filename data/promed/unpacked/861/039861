PENGUINS - SOUTH AFRICA (5)
============================
I am a Wildlife Veterinarian for the California Department of Fish and
Game's Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response and respond to oil
spill incidents as well as do research in oil spill related wildlife
epidemiology. While, I do not recall this type of behavior in birds
exposed to petroleum products, we are investigating the cause of
seizuring in California sea lions which may have been exposed to a
diesel-like product.
Let me know if I can help.
