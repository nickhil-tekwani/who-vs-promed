CHOLERA, NON-O1, NON-O139 - SWEDEN (BLEKINGE): WOUND INFECTION

In recent weeks, 3 people in Blekinge County in south east Sweden were
reported to have developed mild to severe wound infections caused by
non-agglutinating (not O1 or O139) and non-toxin-producing _Vibrio
cholerae_ bacteria after outdoor water contact (Baltic Sea and possibly an
irrigating pond). All 3 people had skin breakages, and 2 had other
underlying diseases.
Environmental water samples from various sources have been analyzed, and
several samples from Baltic Sea coastal waters and from 4 lakes have tested
positive for non-agglutinating and non-toxin-producing _V. cholerae_. These
strains have not yet been compared to those found in humans. The weather
has been hot and sunny in Sweden during Jul 2006, and unusually high
surface water temperatures of over 20 degrees C recorded.
There are 200 serotypes of the bacterium _V. cholerae_, of which O1 and
O139 are toxin-producing and cause classical cholera with profuse, watery
diarrhea (sometimes exceeding 20 litres per day). Variants of the bacteria
that are non-agglutinating and non-toxin-producing may rarely cause wound
infections, mild diarrhea, and external otitis in people with skin
breakages who bathe outdoors in warm, brackish water. The optimal growth
conditions for these bacteria include a salinity of 0.4-1.7 percent and a
water temperature exceeding 20 degrees C. In such conditions the bacteria
have been found in the Baltic Sea.
Classical cholera has been a notifiable disease in Sweden since 1919, and
all forms of _V. cholerae_ infection became notifiable on 1 Jul 2004. The
last case of imported classical cholera to Sweden was notified in 2004. The
same year, a severe, septic wound infection with non-agglutinating and
non-toxin-producing _V. cholerae_ was contracted after a patient bathed in
an outdoor hot tub containing water from the Baltic Sea that had been
heated to about 38C (1,2).
The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control is now advising people
with any skin breakages not to bathe and swim outdoors. A message has been
posted on the European Union's Early Warning and Response System to inquire
about _V. cholerae_ wound infections recently seen in other European
countries. Information may be sent by email to the author.

[Wound infections due to _V. cholerae_ are not as common as the
gastrointestinal manifestation. In a table from a report of _Vibrio_
surveillance from the USA, however, 3 (12 per cent) of Gulf Coast isolates
of nontoxigenic _V. cholerae_ were reported to cause wound infections and 2
(10 per cent) caused wound infection associated with non-Gulf Coast isolates.

In addition, Ko et al (1) reported on non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_
infections from Taiwan and found 4 of 30 patients with wound infections. Of
the 4, 3 had necrotizing fasciitis similar to infection by _V. vulnificus_.
All 4 patients had underlying co-morbidities, especially liver disease. In
a case report, Farina, et al (2) reported a case of _V. cholerae_ O2
cutaneous infection in a cirrhotic Italian tourist returning from Tunisia.
Both of these references cite older cases as well.
