An epidemic of hepatitis E is escalating across refugee camps in South Sudan's Maban county. To date, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has treated 3991 patients in its health facilities in the camps and has recorded 88 deaths, including 15 pregnant women. Hepatitis E [virus] causes a liver disease and can lead to acute liver failure and death. It is particularly dangerous for pregnant women. Like cholera, the virus spreads in environments with poor sanitation and contaminated water. There is no cure, but its symptoms are treatable.

"We have been doing everything we can to care for people with hepatitis E [virus infection], but there is no treatment for the disease," says Dr. Jose-Luis Dvorzak, MSF Medical Coordinator in Maban County. "We suspect this outbreak is far from over, and many more people will die."

The 1st cases appeared in June 2012. Three camps -- Jamam, then Gendrassa and Batil -- have seen the most cases so far. Numbers still have not peaked in Batil camp, where death rates have steadily risen from one or 2 per week in November [2012] to 10 per week in January [2013]. Over the past 2 weeks, MSF has identified a further 41 suspected hepatitis E cases in Doro camp, 2 of whom have died, meaning that none of the camps in Maban County is free of the virus.

This hepatitis E outbreak was able to take hold because of poor water and sanitation conditions, such as inadequate distribution of clean water, limited access to functioning latrines, and too few hand-washing points in the Maban refugee camps, which host more than 110 000 Sudanese refugees. "The refugee camps should not only be a place of safety from conflict but also a place where refugees can stay alive and are safe from preventable diseases and outbreaks," said Laurence Sailly, MSF Emergency Coordinator in Doro camp.

Because of Maban county's geographical location, it is a flood plain in the rainy season and a parched wasteland in the dry season. The refugees in these camps are completely reliant on humanitarian assistance for the food, water, and healthcare they need to survive. While continuing to concentrate on the extremely heavy medical workload of caring for hepatitis E patients and treating all the other patients with other pathologies who present in our field hospitals, MSF teams are also carrying out emergency gap-filling activities, such as pumping, treating, and distributing around 2.5 million liters of water per week in Doro camp.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. Genotypes 1 and 2 are usually seen in developing countries and cause community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 70 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. The highest seroprevalence rates are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for hepatitis E virus (see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html). The conditions in the refugee camps in South Sudan are such that, once established, the illness is difficult or impossible to control and eradicate, as described in the MSF statement above.

Hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route due to faecal contamination of drinking water. Other transmission routes include foodborne transmission from ingestion of products derived from infected animals and vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Currently, there is no vaccine available for control of hepatitis E virus infection. Hepatitis E virus infection is self-limiting in normal conditions, and fulminant hepatitis is rare, with only pregnant women being at increased risk. In environments such as the refugee camps in South Sudan, the outcomes are much more serious, especially for pregnant women.
