As of 11 Feb 2003, out of 84 suspect cases of YF, 38 have been
laboratory confirmed, 23 excluded, and 23 are pending. These include
23 deaths, of which 14 have been laboratory-confirmed. All have
occurred in rural areas of townships in the locality of Lucas.
The Ministry of Health alerts residents of and travelers to the
region of the Vale do Jequitinhonha, Minas Gerais, of the need to get
vaccinated against YF.

[This is an increase of one more death over the report of 9 Feb 2003
-- see reference below. The number of confirmed cases remains at 38.
The epidemic appears to remain a sylvatic one (transmitted by jungle
mosquitoes), and has not yet become urban (transmitted by _Aedes
aegypti_). One wonders about the etiology of the 23 cases reportedly
clinically compatible with YF, but excluded after laboratory testing.
