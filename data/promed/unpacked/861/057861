As of Tue 20 Sep 2005, 822 people, including 150 children and teenagers,
have been treated in hospital on suspicion of hepatitis A virus infection
in Nizhniy Novgorod, according to the press service of the government of
the Nizhniy Novgorod region. Another 30 people, including one child with
this diagnosis, were admitted to hospitals in the city today [20 Sep 2005].
The majority of the patients are from the Sormovskiy district of the city.
The outbreak of hepatitis A in Nizhniy Novgorod was recorded first on 5 Sep
2005. In the opinion of physicians, a principal cause of the outbreak is
delayed repair of the network of waterpipes in the Sormovskiy district of
the city. Anti-epidemic measures [vaccination?] are being carried out in
the city.

[The outbreak of hepatitis A in Nizhniy Novgorod continues unabated. In the
past week the number of hospitalised cases has risen from 356 to 852. As is
frequently the case in Russia, inadequacy of the public water supply
appears to be responsible for this outbreak. In view of the ubiquity of
hepatitis A outbreaks in Russia, as stated in the previous post,
ProMED-mail will cease to post reports of hepatitis A except -- as in the
present case -- where the number of cases is large and the outbreak remains
uncontained. - Mod.CP]
