The government of Jakarta has been working to vaccinate 1.9 million children, or a slight increase from the previous target of 1.7 million in a bid to fight the outbreak of diphtheria. "We have decided to cover all children, so not just 1.2 million, but the target now has been increased to 1.9 million people," Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan stated at the City Hall here on Wednesday [3 Jan 2018].

Jakarta recorded 109 cases of diphtheria last year [2017], with the figure increasing from 17 cases in 2016, 10 in 2015, and 4 in 2014. "The increase is relatively high, so we need to take some extraordinary measures," Baswedan noted. The Health Department of Jakarta had conducted a simultaneous vaccination of children, as they are most vulnerable to the bacteria, through the Diphtheria Outbreak Response Immunization Program in some areas last year [2017]. Until now, major diphtheria-infected cases were found in children, but Governor Baswedan intends to cover grown-ups too as a precautionary measure.

Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection that affects the mucous membranes of the throat and nose with initial flu-like symptoms but can aggravate to fever, swallowing difficulties, hoarseness, enlarged lymph nodes, coughing, and shortness of breath; while in some patients, the disease may affect the skin, leading to ulcers.

Although it can spread easily from an infected person to others within 2-3 days of having contracted the bacterial infection, diphtheria can be prevented through the use of vaccines.

[Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap). In Indonesia, DTP is given at 2,3,4 and 18 months with a booster 6-7 years of age.

The rise in DTP3 (the 1st 3 doses) coverage in Indonesia has been associated with a marked decline in cases of diphtheria nationally from over 3000 cases in 1980 to 189 cases in 2009; however, since then, the annual number of cases increased to between 430 to 1192 cases; although only 252 cases were reported in 2015 (http://www.searo.who.int/immunization/data/indonesia.pdf).

The above news report says that there were 415 cases in 2016 and at least 591 cases in 2017, likely the result of poor immunization coverage. None of the diphtheria patients in Indonesia were said to have been vaccinated against the disease.

A diphtheria vaccine coverage rate of 80-85 per cent is thought to be necessary to stop transmission. Although vaccination rates may be this high in Indonesia as a whole, rates may be much lower in some communities. If an unvaccinated person gets diphtheria, they can easily pass it on to the other unvaccinated contacts, who then can spread diphtheria quickly through a community with a low vaccine coverage rate (http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/april/2_Review_Diphtheria_results_April2017_final_clean.pdf).

Indonesia is located mainly in South East Asia, between the Indian and Pacific oceans; it is the world's largest island country, with an estimated population of over 261 million people (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia). Its capital, Jakarta, which is the 2nd most populous city in the world, is located on the north west coast of Java, the world's most populous island, with over half of the country's population. Indonesia has 34 provinces that are subdivided into regencies and cities, which are further subdivided into districts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia#Administrative_divisions).
