Influenza update - [10 Feb 2014] - Update number 204

Summary
- In North America, influenza activity decreased in the United States of America and Canada and increased in Mexico with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating.
- In Europe, influenza activity continued to increase, particularly in the south with both influenza A viruses circulating.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity remained high with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating, with increases observed in some countries.
- In western Asia, influenza activity was increasing with mainly A(H3N2), while Egypt reported high activity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.
- In countries of tropical areas, variable influenza activity was reported.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained low.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of [6 Feb 2014, 12:30 UTC]), during weeks 3 to 4 ([12 Jan 2014 to 25 Jan 2014]), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 97 countries, areas, or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 68 458 specimens. 19 547 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 17 992 (92 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1555 (8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 8257 (79.75 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 2096 (20.24 percent) were influenza A(H3N2) and one (0.01 percent) was influenza A(H5N1). Of the characterized B viruses, 200 (69.7 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 87 (30.3 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
North America
In North America, influenza activity was variable, however the number of laboratory confirmed detections decreased. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remained the predominant virus detected. This differs from the 2012-2013 season in which A(H3N2) was predominant.

Canada experienced a decrease in influenza activity. The overall influenza activity in Canada during the 2013-2014 season has been similar to the 2012-13 season and is within expected levels for this time of year.

In the United States of America (USA), influenza activity decreased compared to the previous week but overall remained elevated. The proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was 3.3 percent, which is above the national baseline of 2.0 percent. All 10 regions reported ILI above region-specific baseline levels. The age groups experiencing the most hospitalisations are 18-49 years and 50-64 years. Additionally, the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was above the epidemic threshold.

In Mexico, A(H1N1)pdm09 activity increased compared to the previous weeks. The proportion of ILI-associated medical visits was 3.8 percent in the last week of January 2014 and increased as compared to the previous week.

Europe
In the European region, influenza activity has increased, mainly in countries from southern parts of Europe. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses circulated throughout the region with variability in predominance among different countries. Despite the increasing trend, ILI and acute respiratory infection (ARI) consultation rates remained below the epidemic threshold for the majority of countries.

Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region
In Central and Western Asia, increased A(H3N2) activity continued to be reported by the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Pakistan, and Turkey since the beginning of January 2014. Egypt continued to experience high A(H1N1)pdm09 activity. Influenza activity remained low in the remainder of the region.

Eastern Asia
In the Asian region, overall influenza activity remained low, although a number of countries reported increasing influenza activity. A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses co-circulated, however, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus remained the predominant subtype. In China, influenza activity in the north and south remained at a high level. In Mongolia, influenza activity increased, surpassing their baseline threshold in late January 2014. Influenza activity continued to increase in the Republic of Korea, with similar proportions of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B.

Tropical Asia
Influenza activity among Southeast Asian countries was variable in January 2014. Lao People's Democratic Republic and Thailand report increased influenza activity with A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and Influenza B viruses co-circulating. Influenza activity remained sporadic in other Southeast Asian countries.

Countries in the tropical zone
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America and tropical areas of South America remained low.

Central African tropical region
In the African region overall, influenza activity remained low. Increasing A(H3N2) activity was, however, detected in Algeria, Ethiopia, and Madagascar. Influenza B viruses also circulated in Ghana.

In the temperate northern hemisphere countries, the USA and Canada have been experiencing a decrease in influenza activity, although still above the epidemic threshold in the USA, while the European countries have been having an increase in activity. Likewise, the Southern hemisphere has been experiencing low level of influenza activity. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is the predominant virus detected in North America, whereas both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 are circulating in Europe. According to the FluNet information, a single H5N1 isolate was recovered; one wonders whether this refers to the case of H5N1 in a Canadian returning from mainland China (see Avian influenza, human (10): Canada ex China (Beijing) H5N1, fatal 20140108.2160514).

In contrast, central and western Asia have been seeing a predominance of H3N2 activity with the exception of Egypt, which has been seeing a high A(H1N1)pdm09 activity. - Mod.MPP]
