More than 100 people were sickened during a _Yersinia_ outbreak linked to pasteurized milk in 2019, according to a study. Raw milk may have cross-contaminated pasteurized milk during the pasteurization process. _Yersinia enterocolitica_ infections affected a youth summer camp and nearby community in northeastern Pennsylvania in July 2019.

Researchers identified 109 cases, 48 confirmed and 61 probable. 92 were campers and camp staff while 17 were in the community. Yersiniosis is not a reportable condition in Pennsylvania, although there are plans to make it one, which delayed outbreak identification and start of the investigation, said the study published in the journal Foodborne Pathogens and Disease [see citation below]. Onset dates were [7 Jun to 26 Jul 2019] and the median patient age was 15 years old. The affected camp was for girls so 86 percent of patients were female. Symptoms mainly included abdominal pain or cramps, then fever, and headache. Several patients also had non-bloody diarrhea. 7 people were hospitalized but no deaths were reported.

Initially, a youth summer camp reported _Yersinia enterocolitica_ cases to the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) among 4 campers and staff. Additional _Yersinia_ cases in residents unconnected with the camp were recorded by the local hospital laboratory. In July 2019, PADOH advised people who purchased milk from Creamworks Creamery in Waymart, Wayne County, to not drink it or use it in cooking as it may contain _Y. enterocolitica_. During interviews, 2 unrelated community members reported consuming pasteurized milk from the small dairy in northeast Pennsylvania. The camp owner said the dairy provided weekly milk shipments. It had sent 214 gallons of pasteurized milk in 5 weekly shipments to the camp by mid-July [2019]. Among 37 patients, 31 had consumed Creamworks Creamery milk. It was the only shared exposure identified between the camp and the community. Campers were not interviewed and not all staff completed a cohort questionnaire.

PADOH and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture held an emergency inspection of the dairy on [17 Jul 2019] and the firm ceased distribution and recalled all milk. Before reopening, steps included a herd check by a licensed veterinarian, equipment cleaning and sanitation, and replacement of pasteurizer plates. Inspectors didn't find significant sanitary issues at the dairy. However, the gasket sealing the bulk milk tank was worn and needed replacing. Pasteurization records indicated proper temperatures were reached. The pasteurizer used was purchased 10 years previously.

The dairy milked 75 cows and produced 17 500 to 24 500 pounds of milk per week. About 3500 pounds were pasteurized on site weekly with a high-temperature short-time pasteurizer. Products were sold to 22 clients, including small businesses and retailers, and sold at a farm stand. The remaining unpasteurized milk was collected by a local cooperative that pasteurized and distributed it.

_Y. enterocolitica_ was isolated from all 3 unpasteurized milk samples from the bulk milk tank. It was not found in any of the unopened pasteurized milk, environmental, or well water samples. Most milk samples tested were collected and pasteurized in mid-July 2019, almost 2 weeks after the peak number of _Y. enterocolitica_ cases.

Raw milk may have cross-contaminated pasteurized milk during the pasteurization process or contamination of the environment could have resulted in post-pasteurization contamination of pasteurized milk, according to the study. 7 clinical samples, 5 from campers and camp staff and 2 from community members, yielded _Y. enterocolitica_. The human and milk isolates were indistinguishable by whole genome sequencing.

Researchers could not find the pathogen's origin at Creamworks Creamery but it is possible pigs or wildlife near the dairy were a potential source of _Y. enterocolitica_. Scientists were unable to test pigs before they were removed from the dairy or pasteurizer plates for wear and leaks. "We recommend governmental agencies and small dairies conducting on-site pasteurization collaborate to develop additional outbreak prevention strategies. In addition, we recommend research partners continue to develop sensitive and rapid laboratory techniques to identify _Y. enterocolitica_ in nonclinical samples," they said.

ProMED had not posted on this recently published outbreak, but did post about a smaller but similar outbreak in western Pennsylvania in 2011.

The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with foodborne disease are _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and _Y. enterocolitica_. The latter species can be associated with abdominal pain as a hallmark symptom. As a mesenteric lymphadenitis, yersiniosis can mimic appendicitis but may also cause infections of other sites, such as wounds, joints, and the urinary tract. Because of the degree of abdominal pain, yersiniosis has been misdiagnosed as Crohn's disease as well as appendicitis. "Diagnosis of yersiniosis begins with the identification of the organism from the feces or blood and sometimes at the time of appendectomy. Diarrhea is reported to occur in about 80 percent of cases; abdominal pain and fever are the most reliable symptoms. Because of the difficulties in isolating yersiniae from feces, several countries rely on serology."

"_Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.), oysters, fish, and raw (not usually pasteurized) milk. The exact cause of the food contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this organism in the soil and water and in animals such as beavers, pigs, and squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food supply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food handlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as contributing to contamination."

"The major "complication" is the performance of unnecessary appendectomies, since one of the main symptoms of infections is abdominal pain of the lower right quadrant. Yersiniosis may also be associated with reactive arthritis, which may occur even in the absence of obvious symptoms. The frequency of such post-enteritis arthritic conditions is about 2-3 percent" (https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnado152.pdf).

ProMED has periodically posted on human infections associated with the ingestion of "raw" unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization is a process of heating a food, usually liquid, to a specific temperature for a definite length of time, and then cooling it immediately. Pasteurization, unlike sterilization, is not intended to kill all micro-organisms in the food. Instead, pasteurization aims to reduce the number of viable pathogens so they are unlikely to cause disease (assuming the pasteurized product is stored as indicated and consumed before its expiration date). Although known in China and Japan, the modern version was created by Louis Pasteur, after whom it is named, conceived as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring.

It is not the case, however, that pasteurized milk or milk products are never able to transmit infection. In response to a cluster of appendectomies in an area of New York State in the fall of 1976, investigators found that an epidemic of _Y. enterocolitica_ had occurred and that it was associated with the drinking of school-bought chocolate milk (1). The pasteurization technique in the dairy was found to be satisfactory and the investigation suggested that the organism was introduced at the dairy during mixing by hand of chocolate syrup and pasteurized milk, a post-pasteurization contamination. A huge outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis in the USA occurred in 1994 when ice cream pre-mix, already pasteurized, was transported by tanker trailers that had just carried non-pasteurized eggs (2) and an estimated 224 000 infections occurred.

Post-pasteurization contamination of milk is thought to underlie most of these outbreaks associated with pasteurized milk, although the mechanism of contamination may not be elucidated. Such outbreaks include more than 16 000 culture-confirmed cases of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium in Illinois reported in 1987 (3), a multistate outbreak of _Y. enterocolitica_ in 1982 (4), as well an outbreaks of listeriosis in Massachusetts in 1983 (5). The listeriosis outbreak, however, was one in which the investigators raised questions about the ability of pasteurization to eradicate a large inoculum of certain organisms from raw milk.

The persistence of small numbers of pathogenic organisms may not be relevant since the milk is kept at refrigerator temperatures for most organisms, but for _L. monocytogenes_ and _Y. enterocolitica_ this may not be the case. Certain organisms like these can be referred to as psychrotrophic, defined as bacteria that may grow at 7 deg C [44.6 deg F] or below, irrespective of their optimal temperature for growth (6). These organisms, if remaining at some number after pasteurization or inoculated after pasteurization, can then replicate in the refrigerated milk.

Although the risk from pasteurized milk is quite small, there is some. Some, if not most, of this risk is from post-pasteurization contamination but not all. Be that as it may, unpasteurized milk has a much higher risk.
