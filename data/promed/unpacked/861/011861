A cow elk sampled 12 Sep 2010 east of Glendo in hunt area 3 has
tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), a brain disease
known to affect some deer, elk, and moose. The elk was located 13
miles [21 km] east of Glendo and 4 miles [6.5 km] northeast of Camp
Guernsey.

"This animal had all the classic symptoms of CWD," said WGFD [Wyoming
Game & Fish Department] wildlife disease specialist Hank Edwards.
"CWD samples were taken by Wheatland game warden Craig Smith and sent
to the lab for testing."

According to Edwards, a positive for elk in this area is no surprise
as elk area 3 overlaps deer hunt areas 15, 16, and 55, which have
been endemic for 10 years.

Personnel at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department Laboratory analyzed
samples taken as part of the department's annual CWD survey and
discovered positive results on 15 Oct 2010.

After a review of available scientific data, the World Health
Organization in December 1999 stated, "There is currently no evidence
that CWD in cervidae (deer and elk) is transmitted to humans." In
2004, Dr Ermias Belay of the Center for Disease Control said, "The
lack of evidence of a link between CWD transmission and unusual cases
of CJD, [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a human prion disease] despite
several epidemiological investigations, suggest that the risk, if
any, of transmission of CWD to humans is low." Nonetheless to avoid
risk, both organizations say parts or products from any animal that
looks sick and/or tests positive for CWD should not be eaten.

[Chronic wasting disease is one of the transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies. This is the same group as BSE or bovine spongiform
encephalopathies or mad cow disease. However, the malady in cervids
was noticed in Colorado decades ago -- the 60s -- and thus far has
not had any human involvement. While the risk is low, probably very
low, caution is always appropriate. - Mod.TG]
