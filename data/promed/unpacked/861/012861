UNDIAGNOSED ILLNESS - INDIA (KERALA): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The number of fever cases this season [2007] has gone up to 550 000.
This is an undeclared emergency, and the help of the Army has been
obtained by the state government.

Army personnel are cleaning up the areas and introducing
anti-mosquito-breeding measures and killing adult mosquitoes. Army
doctors are leading clinical and preventive measures in many towns.
Hundreds of deaths have been reported, but there is no official
confirmation or count or an organized way of collecting authentic
data. There was a disease surveillance system in place, but it was
scrapped in 2003 upon declaring Kerala as the healthiest place in
India.

According to news reports, fever cases include chikungunya, dengue,
leptospirosis and typhoid fever. Apparently, all of them are being
confirmed in different laboratories in which small numbers are
tested. The government health system has been overwhelmed by the
number of persons entering hospitals, and that has resulted in panic
and the army's assistance.

The mosquito-borne fevers chikungunya and dengue cannot spread to
such a large population in such a short time, especially as
chikungunya infected a number of people last year [2006], and they
are, therefore, immune; dengue has been endemic for 2 decades, and,
again, a large proportion should be immune.

[Dr. John's interpretation is that a contagious infection is present.
By contagious he means person-to-person transmitted, not via a
vehicle or vector. He goes on to say that "Respiratory transmitted
fevers are very few, and influenza is a number one possibility. Most
of the deaths are in persons over 60 years old, according to
newspaper reports. That too fits with an influenza diagnosis.
Epidemic influenza is not readily suspected because of the wide age
range involved, the severe systemic symptoms, the lack of
familiarity, and the lack of laboratory testing. Sometimes the most
obvious is the easiest to miss."

ProMED thanks Dr. John for this report. This large number of febrile
infections exceeds the number of recent chikungunya virus infections
in Kerala. In October 2006, some 100 000 suspected cases (reported by
MedIndia.com
<http://www.medindia.com/news/view_news_main.asp?x=14772>)
with at least 70 deaths (reported by BBC News
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5405680.stm>)
in Kerala due to chikungunya virus infection were reported in the
popular press. It will be important for samples from a significant
number of the febrile patients to be tested in the laboratory to
establish the etiology or etiologies of these illnesses. ProMED
requests further information about the laboratory results and about
the epidemic, indicating how long it has been going on, specific
locations of the cases, and the sex/age breakdown of those affected.
