Epidemiological comments: a herd of 55 sheep/goats brought from DRC despite the prohibition of imports from PPR affected countries. Positive serological results were picked up in a farm during routine surveillance. No clinical evidence suggestive of the disease has been found so far in the area. Surveillance activities have been intensified in all the 7 provinces bordering neighbouring infected countries and vaccination is planned and will take place within the next 2-3 weeks.
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: since this is the 1st time that peste des petits ruminants is identified in the history of the country, the reason for notification as 1st occurrence applies to the country but the event is in fact circumscribed to a zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

[This notification addresses the introduction into Cabinda of PPR-seropositive sheep and goats from a neighboring country (DRC, Democratic Republic of the Congo) where PPR is endemic. The authorities of Angola seem to regard the event as introduction of the disease, though no clinical PPR cases have been reported. Cabinda, formerly Portuguese Congo, is an exclave province of Angola, separated from the rest of the country by DRC territory; see the interactive map at the source URL.

The fate of the introduced suspected consignment, the results of the pending virological lab investigation, and surveillance in small ruminants throughout Angola will have to be taken into consideration when deciding upon the final PPR status of Angola. - Mod.AS
