Dead blackbirds: Experts suspect virus
--------------------------------------
Conservationists and bird lovers are concerned. In the Rhine-Neckar
region, an increasing number of dead blackbirds has been found. The
mosquito experts KABS [Local Action Group to fight mosquitoes] located
in Waldsee suspect an African virus as the cause.

"One of our staff was able to prove (the existence of) African Usutu
virus in local mosquitoes in our region," says Norbert Becker,
Scientific Director of KABS [see item 2 further]. Even if it is only a
single find, it is conceivable that infected mosquitoes have
transmitted the virus to birds. Already in the years 2001 and 2002 in
Austria there has been an increase in blackbirds dying of Usutu
virus.

In Italy and Hungary, there have been minor outbreaks of bird disease
(Usutu virus) that is often fatal for blackbirds. For people the
virus, however, would be relatively harmless, says Becker. Only in
rare cases there might be a slight fever.

The sole evidence of Usutu virus in the _Culex pipiens_ (Common Gnat)
that includes sucking blood from birds, is not enough to prove a link
between the virus and the dead black birds. The virus must be detected
in dead birds.

Norbert Becker and PhD student Hanna Jost are asking the public to
store birds found dead in a cooler and inform the experts by phone.
The dead birds will be picked up for examination.

Abstract
--------
Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that emerged 2001 in
Austria and caused deaths in wild birds. In Germany, 70 378 female
mosquitoes were captured in 2009 and 2010 and assayed for USUV. Virus
was isolated in cell culture from one pool of _Culex pipiens pipiens_
mosquitoes trapped exclusively in August 2010 in Weinheim, Germany.

Subsequent phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship
between the isolated USUV strain from Germany and a USUV strain from
Austria, which was detected in a dead blackbird in 2004.

[The following background and discussion passages have been derived
from the full text of the above short report. For the full text and

Usutu virus (USUV) is an arthropod-borne, single-stranded RNA virus
and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus group within the family
Flaviviridae. This virus was 1st isolated in 1959 from _Culex neavei_
mosquitoes collected in Ndumu, Natal, South Africa.

Vectors of USUV are ornithophilic mosquitoes of the genera Culex,
Coquillettidia, Mansonia and Culiseta. Wild birds are the principal
reservoir for USUV and migratory birds play a key role in the
introduction of USUV into new areas. Outside Africa, USUV emerged in
2001 in Vienna, Austria and caused deaths in blackbirds (_Turdus
merula_) and great gray owls (_Strix nebulosa_).

In 2002, USUV was still circulating in Austria, demonstrating that
USUV has managed to overwinter in a local bird-mosquito cycle in
central Europe. More recently, USUV-specific RNA or antigen was also
detected in birds or mosquitoes in Hungary, Switzerland, Italy and
Spain.

In the summer of 2009, USUV-related illness were reported in 2
immunocompromised patients in Italy.

Despite these cases, the potential of USUV to cause human disease
needs further investigations.

In 2002, an extensive analysis of serum samples from healthy birds
captured in the United Kingdom was performed and demonstrated that a
significant number of the serum samples contained neutralizing
antibodies against USUV. This study was subsequently followed by a
seroconversion study of chickens from the time of hatching until the
age of 8 or 9 months and seroconversion to USUV was detected.

Neutralizing antibodies against USUV were also demonstrated in serum
samples of wild birds captured during 2002­2005 in Germany.

In the United Kingdom and in Germany, no obvious reduction in the bird
population was observed during this period. However, it was not known
if USUV circulate in German mosquito populations. Therefore, the
natural vectors of USUV in Germany also remain unknown.

Our study demonstrates the potentially emerging USUV in southwestern
Germany. The virus most likely spread from Austria to Germany rather
than being independently introduced from Africa. This finding is the
1st direct detection of USUV in Germany, although neutralizing
antibodies were detected in wild birds in Germany.

No obvious increase in deaths of birds were detected in Germany in
2009 and 2010, which suggested a low prevalence or virulence of
circulating USUV. However, in Italy, USUV-related illness in humans
was reported even though the USUV infection rate in mosquitoes was
rather low.

USUV strain 1477 was detected in a pool of _Cx. pipiens pipiens_
mosquitoes in Weinheim, a small city in the upper Rhine valley and the
only trapping site that represented an urban ecosystem. The density of
blackbirds and _Cx. pipiens pipiens_ mosquitoes in such an urban
ecosystems is much higher compared with an agro-ecosystems or forest.
This might explain why USUV was not found in other regions of Germany
covered by our trapping sites.

In conclusion, after detection of several arboviruses that are new to
Germany in 2009 another important arbovirus was demonstrated to
circulate in Germany in 2010. Thus, mosquito-based surveillance for
arboviruses in Germany is important for public health because it
provides data about arbovirus activity and distribution. Further
studies will be conducted to estimate the medical importance of USUV
in southwestern Germany.
