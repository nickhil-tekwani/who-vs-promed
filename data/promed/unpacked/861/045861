Boddupalli Prasanna, International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center [CIMMYT], said maize lethal necrosis disease (MLN) is under control but not eradicated. "We have managed to contain the spread within the region but continue to monitor its movements." A survey conducted in late 2018 in eastern and southern Africa showed no MLN in Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Incidence is falling in Kenya but MLN continues to spread to other regions in Uganda.

Prasanna attributed the success to collaborative efforts from governments, farmers and research institutions in the region. He called on governments and partners to step up awareness in western and northern Africa. The disease "moves so fast and it is difficult to predict where it will be spotted next, hence the need to intensify awareness amongst the farmers," he added.

Prasanna said an array of new measures, including the use of legumes for at least 2 months, need to be taken. A total of 15 MLN-tolerant hybrids have been released in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, and an additional 5 hybrids are now under commercialization.

[Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is caused by co-infection of _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_, transmitted by chrysomelid beetles) with one of several species in the family _Potyviridae_. As synergistic partners of MCMV in MLN, _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV, genus _Tritimovirus_) or _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) have been reported previously from the Americas and Europe. MLN and MCMV were reported for the 1st time in Africa from Kenya in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20130123.1510727). The disease is spreading in the region where millets have also been identified as an additional crop host being affected by MLN (ProMED-mail post 20150820.3590521). _Sugarcane mosaic virus_ (SCMV) has been reported as the co-infecting virus in sub-Saharan Africa, but seed transmission of MLN in Africa has been claimed and seed transmission is reported only for MDMV, not SCMV. MDMV and SCMV belong to a complex of closely related potyviruses infecting tropical grasses. Based on serology, some strains (e.g., MDMV-B) varying in host range and ability to be seed transmitted have been reassigned between the species, which has resulted in some confusion in taxonomy.

Symptoms of the individual viruses are synergistically enhanced in MLN and may include leaf mottling and necrosis, distortion of ears, absence of kernels, failure to produce tassels, as well as stunting, premature aging and death of plants. Symptoms may disappear during the growing season, leaving plants with latent infections but reduced yield and as virus reservoirs, making disease monitoring difficult. Losses from MLN are both due to yield reductions and trade implications resulting from the risk of seed being infected with the synergistic partners WSMV and MDMV. All of the viruses involved in MLN can be spread by different insect vectors that may be carried by wind over long distances. Disease management may include crop rotation, certified clean seeds, control of vector species and weedy reservoir hosts, as well as use of crop cultivars or hybrids with reduced sensitivity to the viruses.

In the areas where MLN was not detected in the surveys reported above, the viruses may nevertheless still be present as latent infections, in reservoir species or at low incidence. Absence of proof cannot be taken as proof of absence of pathogens. Therefore, the continued monitoring planned for the region will be of vital importance to keep track of MLN and prevent further outbreaks and spread.
