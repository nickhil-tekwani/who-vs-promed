Birds in Sweden killed by virus
-------------------------------
A virus has killed birds in the Vanern and Vattern lakes in Sweden. The
virus reportedly attacks the liver and the kidneys and kills the birds
through dehydration. The disease has been observed before but not to such
an extent, according to TT, a Swedish news agency.
The disease has also been observed on the Swedish west coast, Skane and the
Stockholm archipelago and it has been estimated that it has been causing
the death of thousands of birds.
