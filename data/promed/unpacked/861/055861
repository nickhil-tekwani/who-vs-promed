[1] USA: ACIP recommendations
Date: Tue 1 Dec 2020

Healthcare workers and people in nursing homes should be at the front of the line for upcoming COVID-19 vaccines, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel recommended Tuesday [1 Dec 2020].

The recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP), if heeded, will steer the initial short supply of vaccines to about 21 million health care personnel and 3 million Americans working or living in long-term care facilities. The logic is that health care workers are crucial to keeping overtaxed US healthcare systems working. And residents of long-term care facilities have accounted for 6% of all cases and 40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States, according to one presentation made by the ACIP panel.

The panel's advice will be reviewed by CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield and, if accepted, will provide badly needed official guidance to state officials scrambling to plan for vaccine distribution.

The committee voted 13 to 1 to prioritize the 2 groups, according to the Washington Post.

The novel coronavirus has killed nearly 270 000 people and infected more than 13.5 million in the United States, with a new surge causing cases and deaths to skyrocket in recent weeks.

A presentation to the committee noted at least 243 000 confirmed COVID-19 infections have occurred among health care personnel, with 858 deaths recorded. Health care personnel include employees at hospitals, long-term care facilities, outpatient clinics, home health care services and pharmacies, along with paramedics and public health workers, according to the presentation.

US officials expect to have about 40 million doses of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna distributed by the end of the year [2020] -- just enough to immunize 20 million people with the 2-dose vaccine, the Post said.

In 2021, 5 to 10 million doses of vaccine are anticipated to ship each week.

ACIP provided guidance on Tuesday [1 Dec 2020] even though the US Food and Drug Administration hasn't yet authorized the 2 leading vaccines for emergency use. That's because states needed the committee's input before Friday [4 Dec 2020], which is their deadline for submitting their vaccine distribution plans to the federal government, the Post reported.

The next phase of priority vaccinations could focus on essential workers such as educators, food and agriculture workers, utility workers, police, firefighters, corrections officers, and transportation employees, the ACIP presentation said. This represents about 87 million people, and also would promote vaccination among minority communities that have been hit hard by the pandemic, the Post reported.

After that, people aged 65 and older (about 53 million) and adults with high-risk medical conditions (about 100 million) could be next in line for vaccination, the presentation noted.

"If we had vaccine for every person in the United States, it would be an easy decision," Jose Romero, the advisory group's chairman and the Arkansas secretary of health, said in an interview with the Post over the weekend. "But we don't, and that's why we have to make a prioritization scheme for the initial set of vaccines. We want to give vaccine to those who need it most in our society," he said. "I can tell you, in my opinion, this is the most weighty vote we have given in my 7 years on the committee."

[The ACIP is the key scientific body that reviews all vaccines and provides recommendations for the use of the vaccines. It routinely convenes 4 times per year but also when special needs arise such as the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/index.html). Interestingly, they have convened on a vaccine(s) that have not been FDA approved as yet.

The Washington Post article mentioned, "The committee voted 13 to 1 to prioritize the 2 groups. Helen Keipp Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University, was the sole dissenting vote. Unease over the recommendations centered on the inclusion of long-term care residents, with several panel members saying there were insufficient vaccine safety and efficacy data to support immunizing them right away. Talbot said safety monitoring of those getting the shots in long-term care settings is often inadequate. "We hope it works, and we hope it's safe," she said of the vaccine. Other members said they were reassured by the support of the recommendation from geriatric medicine specialists." (https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/01/vaccine-priority-groups-covid/).

As is seen in the link to the ACIP recommendations, there are 3 parts for prioritization: group 1a, the 1st group to be vaccinated as mentioned above, include healthcare workers and long term care facility staff and residents. Group 1b, the 2nd group, includes essential workers -- (education sector, food, and agriculture, utilities, police, firefighters, corrections officers, transportation). Group 1c, the 3rd group includes adults with high risk medical conditions and adults 65 years and older.

The slides also present Harris poll results consistent with the phase 1 recommendations.

Concerns are being raised re inequities of the planned program (https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-issues-letter-secretary-health-and-human-services-urging-support-underserved).

Calculating estimated available vaccine doses in 2021, from January through June there should be between 130 million and 260 million doses, at 2 doses per person that means between 65 and 130 million individuals can be fully vaccinated. At best that amount plus the amount released this month would cover approximately 45% of the population (2020 estimated at 331 million).

It will be interesting to see what other countries are proposing. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Europe: schools and transmission
Date: Tue 1 Dec 2020 5:32 PM EST

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/europe-schools-covid-open/2020/12/01/4480a5c8-2e61-11eb-9dd6-2d0179981719_story.html


When European schools reopened their classrooms in the spring [2020], after the 1st wave of the coronavirus had crested, some parents expressed concern their children were being used as "guinea pigs" in a dangerous experiment. But to the extent that European schools have acted as laboratories for the world, the findings 8 months later are largely positive. Most of Europe kept schools open even during a worst-on-the-planet 2nd wave of infections this fall. And still, schools appear to be relatively safe environments, public health officials say. As long as they adhered to a now-established set of precautions -- mask-wearing, hand-washing, ventilation -- schools are thought to have played only a limited role in accelerating coronavirus transmission in Europe.

Those conclusions contrast sharply with the prevailing wisdom in the United States, where public health officials have focused on low rates of positive coronavirus tests in the broader community as a prerequisite for in-person schooling. Some US school districts recently announced that they are going remote again, as coronavirus cases rise, and other districts have yet to reopen their classrooms at all. "It is still difficult for me to understand why schools are closed in the United States," said Otto Helve, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare who has studied coronavirus transmission in schools. "Schools are not driving the epidemic."

Though cases among students and teachers have risen along with overall viral levels in their communities, the rate at which the virus has been passed on within classrooms has stayed low and constant -- unlike universities, which have emerged as a concern.

In Finland, 20 000 of about 1.2 million students and teachers this school year have been asked to quarantine because of possible in-school exposure, Helve said. But just 1 percent of that group -- about 200 people -- has gone on to exhibit any coronavirus symptoms and then tested positive. Not everyone without symptoms gets tested, but based on those who have, another 1 percent of these people probably have asymptomatic cases of the virus, Helve said.

Skeptics say schools aren't doing enough testing to have a true sense of how much the virus is spreading. But communities with enough resources to conduct broader testing after possible exposure haven't typically found many asymptomatic cases hiding among teachers and students. And because most European schools have embraced bubbles, where students and teachers mix only with their class and no one else, thorough contact tracing can be done in schools even when it falters in wider society.

"We are not seeing the tip of the iceberg; we are seeing the whole iceberg because of our good tracing," said Quique Bassat, a Spanish pediatrician and epidemiologist who was the coordinator of the Spanish Pediatrics Association's working group for school reopenings.

In Spain, coronavirus cases were already rising sharply across the country in early September [2020], as classrooms prepared to reopen for the 1st time since the pandemic hit.

"There were legitimate concerns that perhaps we were fueling the epidemic, and perhaps we were adding more fuel to the fire, and this was going to be the apocalypse," Bassat said. "To the surprise of many, reopening the schools, applying all these measures in a strict way, controlled transmission, and there were no big outbreaks."

In Bassat's region, Catalonia, 87 percent of initial cases in classrooms did not spread to another person. And among the 13 percent that did, the "vast majority" spread to only 2 or 3 other people in the school, he said.

The virus's onward spread was limited even though Spain's positive coronavirus test rate -- 13 percent at its peak in early November [2020], and 10 percent now -- is far higher than the level that many US school districts have said is acceptable for in-person schooling. New York City closed its schools last month after 3 percent of city tests came back positive, then reversed itself and made plans to resume classes for the youngest grades.

Most Spanish schools have continued without interruption for the youngest age groups, up to about 12. In Spain and elsewhere, high schools have been more likely than younger grades to switch to part-time or full-time remote education, since risks of infection and transmission appear higher among teenagers than among younger children.

France, which spiked worse than Spain last month [November 2020], also saw relatively low numbers in schools. The week of France's peak last month, 0.1 percent of students and 0.2 percent of school personnel tested positive for the coronavirus. Across the country, 142 of 528 400 classrooms quarantined, about 0.03 percent, while 21 of 61 500 schools went into fuller quarantine, according to data from the education ministry.

Rising infection levels among German children have sparked nervousness there, but public health experts say that partly reflects a more relaxed approach to safety measures. People between the ages of 15 and 19 have been among the most-infected in Germany in recent weeks, and cases among them tripled between mid-October [2020] and their peak in mid-November [2020] -- faster than those among the population at large, which doubled. Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for stricter mask-wearing and smaller class sizes, but those decisions are left up to individual states.

Overall, while some parents and teachers' unions continue to have concerns, many European societies are broadly behind efforts to keep students in their classrooms. Advocates of in-person school say the cost of virtual classrooms for vulnerable students is steep, as is the economic toll of taking parents out of the workforce because their young children are at home.

"It's not that we think schools are no danger, that there's no effect," said Steven Van Gucht, the head of viral diseases at the Belgian public health agency. "Schools are the last thing to close; they're really the last thing on the list. There is political pressure and societal pressure. We consider schooling an absolute priority."

Austria, the Czech Republic, and Italy have been exceptions within Europe, opting for widespread school shutdowns or restricted reopenings amid outbreaks. In Italy, that decision sparked protests from students, who in several cities donned hats and gloves and sat with their laptops outside their school buildings, saying they have a right to in-person education.

Pandemic measures are significantly less polarized in Europe than they are in the United States... Teachers' unions, which have emerged as a powerful force of opposition to school reopenings in the United States, have generally been more acquiescent in Europe, pushing for safety measures rather than closures.

And European societies have generally been willing to make sacrifices to keep schools open, such as banning indoor dining or channeling money for safety measures that in some countries are estimated to cost about USD 12 000 a month for a school of 1000 students.

Cristina Trujillo's English-instruction classroom in the southern Spanish city of Seville now has a carbon dioxide monitor to keep watch over how much exhaled air is building up. Some rooms have had new windows cut into them so that air can flow in from 2 sides. The school, Colegio Santo Angel de la Guarda, bought N95 masks for its teachers. Then, when their voices became too muffled, it bought them microphones. They'll get voice lessons next month to project better. Because students can't leave books in their classroom overnight anymore -- that would get in the way of the thorough disinfection -- their load has been lightened by doing work on Chromebooks that the school purchased for the pandemic. The school's technology coordinator now devotes most of his time to keeping everyone safe: checking carbon dioxide levels, overseeing renovations, buying masks, and hand gel. Keeping the virus in check is "easier in school," Trujillo said. "Here, the environment is under control."

As cases mounted across Spain, to levels that at their [4 Nov 2020] peak were comparable to those in the United States, not a single case spread inside the school, officials said. 2 teachers and 11 students brought cases into classrooms from outside, but none infected anyone else. Bassat said he worried less about the risk from in-person education and more about what happens when the country's 8 million students get a break from it. Spain has 3-week winter holidays, and children will stay at home or mix with family and friends. The transition from a controlled to an uncontrolled environment could be perilous, he said.

Policymakers across Europe say students can and do infect one another. Sometimes they bring cases home and infect their families. But even in societies where cases have been off-the-charts, as was the case for Belgium in October [2020], public health officials say they believe cases in schools reflected viral growth in society at large but weren't a driver of it. One indicator: Incidence of the virus among teachers and students never exceeded that of the country at large.

When Belgium buckled under a 2nd wave in which daily cases peaked at 1536 per million people -- more than 3 times the level in the United States right now -- it doubled a preplanned post-Halloween school vacation to 2 weeks, creating a 14-day circuit breaker that built on a broad, nationwide lockdown. Afterward, schools resumed, and infections have dropped for weeks.

"It is very clear to everyone what the downsides are to having school closures," Helve said. "The downside to closing would need to be compensated by an extremely good outcome in terms of disease control, and it doesn't seem to do that."

[An interesting read without a clear verdict based on data, mostly observational. School attendance and school closure as part of pandemic control continue to be controversial. Some countries in Europe are keeping schools open, others remain closed. Similarly in the USA, some states are keeping schools open, others are not. - Mod.MPP]

[3] WHO updates (as of 1 Dec 2020)
[A] Weekly epidemiological update
Date: Tue 1 Dec 2020
Source: Emergency Situational Updates [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---1-december-2020


Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of 10am CET 29 Nov 2020

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
In the past week, global case incidence remained high at approximately 4 million new cases, although a slight downward trend was observed (Figure 1). Weekly deaths, however, continued to rise, with over 69 000 new deaths reported globally. The Region of the Americas was the largest contributor to new weekly cases last week. Although the European Region reported a continued decrease in new weekly cases, it still accounts for the 2nd greatest proportion of new weekly cases, while death rates have continued to increase and accounted for approximately half of the new global deaths in the past week. The Eastern Mediterranean Region registered a slight decline in both cases and deaths last week, after 4 months of continued increases. Relatively small increases were reported from the African and South East Asia Regions, and more substantively from the Western Pacific Region last week.

As of [29 Nov 2020], there have been over 61.8 million cases and over 1.4 million deaths reported globally since the start of the pandemic.

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (reporting over 1.1 million cases, a 0.3% increase from the previous week), India (over 297 000 cases, a 6% increase), Brazil (over 218 000 new cases, a 4% increase), Italy (over 184 000 new cases, a 22% decrease), and Russian Federation (over 179 000 new cases, a 10% increase).

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
The African Region reported about 48 000 new cases and just under 1000 new deaths last week; a 3% and -10% change from the previous week, respectively (Figure 3). The highest number of new cases and deaths were reported from South Africa (19 730 new cases, 333 new cases per 1 million), Algeria (7438 new cases, 170 new cases per 1 million), Kenya (6201 new cases, 115 new cases per 1 million), Ethiopia (3578 new cases, 31 new cases per 1 million), and Uganda (2277 new cases, 50 new cases per 1 million), which collectively account for 81% of all new cases in the Region.

For the past 3 weeks, cases in South Africa have increased by over 20% week-on-week, and last week 19 730 new cases were reported (3500 more than the previous week). The rise in new cases in the Western Cape (including in Cape Town) and Eastern Cape provinces is a cause for concern. As of [30 Nov 2020], Gauteng, the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape, and Kwa-Zulu-Natal provinces have reported 79% of total cumulative cases.

Ethiopia reported 3578 new cases (31 new cases per 1 million) and 59 deaths (0.5 new deaths per 1 million) in the past week. The number of new cases being reported from Ethiopia has fallen considerably since a peak at the end of August [2020] when there were over 10 000 new cases per week. This week the number of new cases rose by 18%, while new deaths fell by 17% from the previous week. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has warned that a full scale humanitarian crisis is unfolding as thousands of refugees in the Tigray region seek safety in eastern Sudan. At the 70th Session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa held last week [24 Nov 2020], Ethiopia's Minister of Health highlighted the need to continue to be vigilant in COVID-19 testing, isolation, and treatment, and maintaining strong communication on public health and social measures.

Cameroon reported 589 new cases (22 new cases per 1 million) and 2 new deaths (0.1 new deaths per 1 million) in the past week. Since first declaring cases on [6 Mar 2020], new cases rose to peak at around 2000 cases per week at the end of June [2020] and in early July [2020]. However, the number of new cases declined in July [2020] and have averaged below 400 per week since early August [2020]. For the past 2 weeks cases have risen above this average, with 836 new cases 2 weeks ago and nearly 600 cases reported this last week. Last week UNHCR warned that as the pandemic continues, a lethal mix of stay-at-home orders, deepening poverty, and economic duress is unleashing a wave of violence against refugee, displaced, and stateless women and girls. UNHCR report that in North West and South West Cameroon where the security situation remains volatile, a staggering 26% of gender-based violence incidents logged since the onset of the pandemic relate to children.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [29 Nov 2020]

- Region of the Americas
The Region of the Americas reported over 1.6 million new cases and 22 000 new deaths, a small increase of 3% and 2%, respectively (Figure 4). The highest number of new cases and deaths were reported from the United States of America (1.15 million new cases, 3476 new cases per 1 million), Brazil (218 000 new cases, 1026 new cases per 1 million), Mexico (64 000 new cases, 502 new cases per 1 million), Colombia (57 000 new cases, 1122 new cases per 1 million), and Argentina (48 000 new cases, 1067 new cases per 1 million). These 5 countries account for 93% of all new cases in the Region.

Colombia reported the 4th-highest number of new cases in the Region, with 57 000 cases (1122 new cases per 1 million). The number of new deaths increased by 2% from the previous week to 1285 new deaths (25.3 new deaths per 1 million). Since the pandemic started, Colombia has seen at least one prominent peak in case incidence in August [2020] during which almost 78 000 cases per week were reported, followed by a moderate decline; however, the country has sustained over 50 000 new cases per week since early October [2020]. Bogota, Amazonas, and Barranquilla have reported the highest case incidence. Among active cases, 70% are at home, 26% in general hospitalization and 3% in intensive care units (ICUs). Men account for 64% of cases, and 77% of those who have died were aged 60 years and over. Colombia has extended its state of emergency by 3 months.

Peru reported 12 000 new cases (371 new cases per 1 million) and 355 new deaths (10.8 new deaths per 1 million); decreases of 9% and 6%, respectively from the previous week. Since new cases peaked in the week of [17 Aug 2020] at almost 60 000 cases, Peru has observed a consistent decline in cases. Preliminary results of a seroprevalence study in the capital, Lima suggest that around 35% of the population has been infected. To prepare for vaccination activities, 10 000 members of the armed forces are being trained to support immunization campaigns.

Chile reported 9798 new cases (513 new cases per 1 million) and 292 new deaths (15.3 new deaths per 1 million). New cases in Chile peaked in the week of [15 Jun 2020] with 69 000 cases. Since early August [2020], between 9000-13 000 cases have been reported weekly, with an overall slow rate of decline. The Minister of Health reported that the numbers of hospitalized patients and patients admitted to ICU are also gradually declining. Magallanes Region has reported the highest cumulative incidence rates, followed by the Metropolitan, and Arica and Parinacota regions. The Ministry of Health has expressed concerns over increases in some southern regions, such as Los Rios, Magallanes, and La Araucania. Chile reports that 5 million tests have been conducted, around 1 million tests per month. The Arturo Merino Benitez airport was opened for foreigners last week. An upcoming election was scheduled for [29 Nov 2020], although people with COVID-19 were not allowed to go to the polls.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [29 Nov 2020]

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
After 15 weeks of steady increases in weekly cases, both new cases (248 000) and new deaths (5800) have shown a slight reduction in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, of 1% and 8% respectively compared to the previous week (Figure 5). The highest number of new cases were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (94 500 new cases, 1125 new cases per 1 million), Jordan (32 500 new cases, 3200 new cases per 1 million), Morocco (29 000 new cases, 780 new cases per 1 million), Pakistan (21 000 new cases, 94 new cases per 1 million), and Iraq (15 000 new cases, 380 new cases per 1 million).

In the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, reported cases and deaths both increased by 43% in the past week, with over 12 000 new cases (2368 cases per 1 million) and 93 new deaths (18.2 new deaths per 1 million) reported. This represents the highest number of new cases reported per week in the territory since the outbreak began. The proportion of positive tests has increased slightly over the last 3 weeks along with an increase in the number of total tests conducted. In the Gaza strip, the current testing strategy is limited to symptomatic patients and their contacts, and a 5% COVID-19 infection rate among health workers. Health services continue to operate with 50% of beds in hospitals and 78% of ICU capacity occupied by COVID-19 patients.

The Islamic Republic of Iran continues to report the highest number of incident cases in the Region. The country has experienced an increasing trend in newly reported cases since the end of August with a 3% increase to 94 000 new cases (1124 cases per 1 million) in the last week. During this period, the number of weekly new deaths decreased by 4% to 3159 deaths (38 deaths per 1 million). As Iran approaches the 1 million case mark in the coming week, the country is strengthening public health and social measures to curb this trend by introducing curfews and partial movement restrictions based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations in respective cities and counties. COVID-19 PCR testing activity has substantially increased from an average of 6 samples/100 000 population/week during August [2020], to 27 samples/100,000/week in the past 4 weeks (totaling over 6 million tests to date); however, positivity rates have also increased over the same period, from approximately 10% to 32% in the past week.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [29 Nov 2020]

- European Region
In the European Region, the number of new cases has been decreasing for 3 consecutive weeks, since its peak in the 1st week of November [2020]. In the past week, the number of new cases reported declined by 13% to over 1.5 million (Figure 6). Despite this reduction, the Region still accounts for 40% of new global cases and 50% of new global deaths as almost half of the countries within the region continue to show an increasing trend. Last week alone, over 35 000 new deaths were reported from the Region, bringing cumulative deaths to 412 000. The highest number of new cases were reported from Italy (184 000 new cases, 3000 new cases per 1 million), Russian Federation (180 000 new cases, 1200 new cases per 1 million), Poland (130 000 new cases, 3438 new cases per 1 million), Germany (124 000 new cases, 1500 new cases per 1 million), and the United Kingdom (112 000 new cases, 1647 new cases per 1 million).

In Turkey, upward trends in both cases and deaths have continued over the past week, with over 47 000 new cases (560 new cases per 1 million) and just over 1150 new deaths (14 new deaths per 1 million) reported. The country saw a 58% increase in new cases in the past week, with rising numbers previously seen mainly in Istanbul, Izmir, and Bursa having now spread throughout the country. There have been concerted efforts to increase testing capacity following an upward trend in reported cases during the summer holiday period. To date, over 18.2 million tests have been conducted with a 3% positivity rate in the past week.

Serbia has reported a steady increase in the weekly number of cases and deaths since October [2020]. In the past week, 46 910 new cases (6700 new cases per 1 million) and 300 new deaths (45 new deaths per 1 million population) were reported. The country has conducted over 1.7 million tests to date, including around 137 000 people tested in the past week (20 tests/1000 population/week), of which 34% were positive. With over 7200 patients hospitalized and more than 250 on ventilation support at the end of last week, a clinic in the country will be converted into a COVID-19 hospital to provide intensive care and oxygen support to cope with the increase in the number of cases requiring clinical care.

In Greece, after several weeks of an upward trend, cases have decreased by 27% with 12 913 new cases (1239 new cases per 1 million) reported, whereas a steep increase in the number of deaths continues, with 696 new deaths reported (67 new deaths per 1 million) in the past week. This number accounts for 1/3 of the total deaths reported since the beginning of the outbreak. As the current situation is challenging the national health system, plans are underway to strengthen it at the national level and in the most affected areas in Thessaloniki, which is located in northern Greece, by ensuring that every patient receives the health care needed through hiring more health workers and increasing ICU capacity.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [29 Nov 2020]

- South East Asia Region
In the South East Asia Region, new weekly cases remained at similar levels as the previous four weeks with 371 180 cases reported in the past week. (Figure 7). The trend in cases is largely driven by the number of cases in India, which reported 80% of new weekly cases in the Region.

- Western Pacific Region
In the past week, the number of new cases reported in the Western Pacific Region increased by 12% with 40 550 cases, continuing the increase since the beginning of November (Figure 8). The number of weekly cases is lower than the highest peak observed in the Region in the week commencing [3 Aug 2020]. The number of deaths in the past week remained at similar levels compared to the previous 2 weeks with 445 deaths reported from 8 countries including the Philippines and Japan which together comprised 87% of all deaths. The highest number of new cases were reported from Japan (14 500 new cases, 114 new cases per 1 million), Philippines (11 000 new cases, 100 new cases per 1 million), Malaysia (9500 new cases, 293 new cases per 1 million), Republic of Korea (3000 new cases, 60 new cases per 1 million) and French Polynesia (1100 new cases, 4000 new cases per 1 million).

The Philippines reported 10 945 cases (100 cases per 1 million) in the past week; a similar level to the previous week. The overall trend shows a gradual decrease since its peak in late July [2020] to early August [2020]. The country reported 253 new deaths in the past week, a 12% decrease compared to the previous week, although the Philippines has reported the highest cumulative deaths in the Region with 8333 deaths. As of [25 Nov 2020], 55% of cumulative cases were male, and the most affected age group was 20 to 29 years (27%) followed by 30 to 39 years (24%). Out of 8215 confirmed deaths, 60% were male, with the most affected age group aged over 70 (34.5%) followed by 60 to 69 years (27.3%). The National Capital Region, which surrounds Manila, has reported 46% of cumulative cases, followed by Calabarzon Region (18%) in the south east of Manila. National authorities have conditionally approved ending restrictions on Filipino healthcare workers to take up employment outside of the Philippines and are developing a contingency plan to rapidly respond to a possible surge following the upcoming holiday season.

The Republic of Korea reported 3091 new weekly cases (60 cases per 1 million), a sharp 41% increase compared to the previous week, reaching the highest weekly case count since early March [2020]. A total of 18 new weekly deaths were reported; in comparison, less than 20 deaths/week have been reported since late September [2020]. Sources of infections have diversified since the start of the pandemic, and younger groups are now at the center of the spread. Clusters have been traced to military facilities, educational institutions, sports facilities, healthcare facilities, gatherings among friends, among others. In Seoul, the 5-tier physical-distancing rules have been raised to the 3rd-highest level amid rising cases in the metropolitan area. The government urged students to stop attending "cram schools" and private lessons ahead of college entrance exams in early December [2020].

In French Polynesia, 1118 new cases were reported in the past week, a 12% decrease compared to the previous week, continuing a downward trend since the week commencing [9 Nov 2020]. Incidence is decreasing in Tahiti and other islands. 10 new deaths were reported in the past week, similar to the previous week. While there are currently no national movement restrictions implemented, a curfew was introduced in October [2020] and there are inter-island movement restrictions in place.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (188 620), Brazil (52 248), India (36 456), Turkey (30 110), and Russia (26 402) have reported the highest numbers of cases and represent 55.3% of all newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. A global total of 12 868 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (30 Nov 2020-1 Dec 2020). Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include Ghana, Nepal, Tunisia, and Venezuela, among others.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, Brazil, India, Turkey, Russia, Italy (19 347), Sweden (17 629), Germany (15 898), Iran (13 881), UK (13 429), and Ukraine (12 498). A total of 58 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (down from 64 on Fri 27 Nov 2020); 32 of the 58 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days (584 178) and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 1.7%, while daily reported deaths (10 284) have increased by 0.73%. The USA has decreased both newly confirmed cases (-8.4%) and reported deaths (-4.7%) which may still be a function of the weekend decreased reporting. The 7-day average daily new cases reported in the USA is 164 783 and newly reported deaths is 1584.

Impression: The countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. Globally the 64 million reported case mark has been crossed; Poland will cross the 1 million cumulative case count tomorrow as the 13th country reporting more than 1 million cases; and the state of Florida in the USA has crossed the 1 million cumulative case count in the past 24 hours, making it the 3rd state in the USA to report more than 1 million cases. - Mod.MPP]
