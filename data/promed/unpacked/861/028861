The detection of 4 dogs [infected with] rabies virus and another 3 suspected in El Progreso, Yoro, again sounded the alarm by the health authorities who are doing everything possible to halt the spread of the disease. The alert, which was maintained partially, was reactivated last Friday [10 Aug 2012] when the health inspectors were advised by a household owner and dog breeder in the San Jose Uno neighborhood, that he had several animals suspected of having rabies.

The technicians knowledgeable about rabies took the call, corroborated that the dogs had the virus, and initially sacrificed 8 of the 11 in the house, with 4 resulting positive.

Alfonso Bonilla, municipal health director in Perla del Ulua, said that the other 3 dogs, a female and 2 puppies, were sacrificed and the heads were sent to the central laboratory in Tegucigalpa. "We expect to have test results this Thursday [16 Aug 2012], but from the animals' behavior, we think that they will be positive [for rabies]." The [health] official was concerned about the increase in the disease. From April [2012] up to the past week, there have been 4 cases of canine rabies, this weekend [11-12 Aug 2012] the number increased to 8 and we expect [with the 3 new cases] that [number] to total 11.

"We suspect that the animals [dogs] could have been infected by bats, since the owner took good care of them and carried out good control with vaccination and nutrition. The place is protected by a wall and they [the dogs] did not go out on the street, [eliminating] the suspicion that they were bitten by some other ill dog."

The outbreak of the virus was reported to Suyapa Dominguez, Yoro departmental epidemiologist, who informed higher levels centrally.

Bonilla assured that the rabies vaccine is only available from the Health System, so the people must not trust in acquiring another product offered in the marketplace.

Dominguez stated that the order has been given to all personnel to become involved in the vaccination effort to halt this problem. "We have sufficient medicine [vaccine] and we are requesting more logistical help for El Progreso; there have been no cases in other municipalities," she stated.

She stated that the municipal Department of Justice [police] initiated the elimination of street dogs.

[Interestingly, there was a case of canine rabies diagnosed in El Progreso in January 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110114.0155). This makes one wonder if the virus is circulating, long-term, in the general area. The source of that virus, or that in the current outbreak in El Progreso, is undetermined, and the strain on the virus is also not indicated. A rabies virus strain analysis would help to determine if the virus in the dogs originated in bats or some other domestic or wild mammal. Carrying out an aggressive vaccination campaign of dogs in the area is the best strategy for halting the outbreak.
