A polar bear at the Toronto zoo could be the first of its kind to die
of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus, and zoo officials say the
thick-skinned animal could have been bitten on the nose.
"It is bizarre because (polar bears) have very thick fur and thick
skin, so a mosquito would have had to land on his nose or his eyeball
[or the margins of the eyelids. - Mod.TY] or somewhere where it could
get through," Shanna Young, executive director of communications at
Toronto Zoo, said on Wednesday.
She said the zoo believed it was the first time that a polar bear had
died of the tropical disease, although there has been evidence that
the virus has turned up in black bears. [West Nile virus is not just
tropical, it occurs in subtropical areas in Europe and is now well
established in temperate North America. - Mod.TY]
The zoo euthanized the bear, named Kunik, last month after it had
trouble using its hind legs. The symptoms pointed to West Nile
encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, and Young said postmortem
tests came up strongly positive.
A sample of the bear's brain tissue has been sent to Health Canada,
which is responsible for national public health, and a confirmation
of the cause of death is expected within weeks.
West Nile virus was first isolated nearly 70 years ago in Uganda. It
is mainly transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, which
itself became infected by feeding on the blood of infected birds.
Toronto has seen only 6 human cases of West Nile this year, down from
38 in 2005. The zoo, Canada's biggest, conducts mosquito eradication
programs and tests vaccinations on its animals, but there is no
vaccine for polar bears, Young said.
Kunik was 26 years old and came to the zoo after being orphaned in
Canada's Northwest Territories, Young said. "He was huge, over 1000
pounds. He loved to swim and was very playful." Only one polar bear
remains at the zoo. Another died earlier this year [2006] of old age.

[ProMED is interested in receiving information about the confirmation
of West Nile virus in the samples submitted to the Health Canada
laboratory. The death of this polar bear is unfortunate not just
because a charismatic individual is gone, but the bear was a constant
reminder that the species faces an uncertain future as its habitat --
sea ice -- is rapidly retreating due to global warming. ProMED
thanks Mary Marshall for sending in the same report. - Mod.TY]
