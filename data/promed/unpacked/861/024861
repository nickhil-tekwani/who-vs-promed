A case of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) has been reported from Mullankolly under the Pulpally Family Health Centre in Wayanad [district in Kerala].

KFD, also known as monkey fever, is a viral disease transmitted to humans through a species of ticks usually found on monkeys.

The patient, a 30-year-old youth, is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Sulthan Bathery. The patient was hospitalised on Wednesday [11 Feb 2021], and samples were sent to the virology laboratory at Sulthan Bathery, which confirmed them as a case of KFD, District Medical Officer R Renuka told The Hindu. Surveillance had been stepped up in hotspots in forest fringes identified by the Health Department, Dr Renuka said.

Front-line forest staff and high-risk populations living on forest fringes have been advised to use personal protection measures, including gloves and gumboots.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The virus was first identified in 1957 after it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka State, India. The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. The recommended preventive measures include using tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full-sleeved clothes and long pants to cover exposed skin to reduce contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites. There is no specific treatment for Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD). Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD (https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf).
