The death toll from the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease increased by one to a total of 9 in Quebec City on Wednesday [29 Aug 2012], as public-health authorities sought additional help in their inspection of buildings that are suspected of harbouring the deadly _Legionella_ bacteria.

Authorities also reported that the number of people infected with the non-contagious bacterial illness surged to 141 from 126 on Tuesday [28 Aug 2012] in what is one of the biggest outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease in Canada in at least 25 years.

The outbreak is now in its 6th week, with no signs of having peaked.

Dr Francois Desbiens, director of public health in the provincial capital, said that the team of municipal and public-health inspectors will now receive help from the 'Regie du batiment' [building control], in charge of the province's buildings.

On Tuesday [28 Aug 2012], Desbiens said that visual inspections of 99 rooftop cooling towers the suspected source of the outbreak revealed that at least 29 were in filthy condition. Authorities were getting ready to douse those towers with another shock treatment of bromine to kill off any lingering bacteria.

Those towers were first disinfected last week [week of 20 Aug 2012]. Given that the incubation period for Legionnaires' disease is 2 to 10 days, it's possible that some people might have inhaled the contaminated air from some of those cooling towers before the 1st shock treatment, and might still fall ill in the coming days.

Meanwhile, authorities have greatly expanded the contamination zone since the outbreak was officially declared in mid-July [2012]. The initial zone of contamination was in the very centre of the capital, with a radius of less than 1 kilometre [0.62 mi].

The contamination zone has now expanded in concentric circles in every direction, but mostly to the north, with a radius of more than 6 kilometres [3.7 mi]. Among the buildings under investigation are federal and provincial government office towers, hotels, and commercial properties.

_Legionella pneumophila_ bacteria are known to thrive in temperatures between 25 deg C and 42 deg C [77 -107.6 deg F], usually in the summer and fall. Cooling towers that are not disinfected regularly are known to breed the bacteria, which are inadvertently pumped through ventilation systems and vented outside as mist.

People walking by these vents can inhale the aerosolized bacteria and fall ill in a matter of days. Once the bacteria enter the lungs, a persistent cough takes hold, along with chest pains, a high fever, and chills.

On Thursday [30 Aug 2012], authorities are expected to order those building owners who have not completed a thorough cleaning of their ventilation systems to shut off their cooling towers.

[For a discussion of Legionnaires' disease, see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - UK (02): (Scotland) 20120605.1156972.

In the previous ProMED-mail post of this outbreak in Quebec City (Legionellosis - Canada (04): (QC) fatal, more cases, RFI 20120827.1266801), there were a total of 104 cases of Legionnaires' disease, including 8 fatalities. Now, there are a total of 141 cases, including 9 fatalities.

We are again not told of the species of _Legionella_ involved in the outbreak, but most likely it is _L. pneumophila_, because about 70 percent of cases of Legionnaires' disease in general are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1. We are also not told of the timeline over which the cases have occurred or any commonality linking the cases. For example, do they work or live in the same locality where there are cooling towers?

The authorities are said to suspect the source might be cooling towers of air-conditioning systems in large buildings in the downtown area of Quebec City, which they have been cleaning, in expanding circles, since the 1st report in ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Canada: (Quebec) fatal, cooling tower susp. 20120805.1228680.

The areas of downtown Quebec City in which decontamination of cooling towers have occurred can be seen at http://www.rrsss03.gouv.qc.ca/images/Perimetres_interventions_001.png).

We are not told if genotypes of _Legionella_ isolates from any of these cooling towers match the genotype of any of the clinical isolates.

Sources of _Legionella_-contaminated aerosols that have been implicated in other legionellosis community outbreaks, in addition to cooling towers, include public fountains, hot tub store demonstrations, misting machines that keep vegetables fresh in grocery stores, and car washing facilities. A description of the microbiology and the epidemiology of the Quebec City outbreak would be helpful.
