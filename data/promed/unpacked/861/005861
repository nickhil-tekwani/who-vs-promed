26 Die in Swamp Fever Outbreak
----------------------------------
2 more high school students have died from an outbreak of swamp fever
sweeping parts of western Kenya. The Chesamisi High School boys succumbed
to the bacterial attack -- known to scientists as leptospirosis -- bringing
the death toll within a month to 26.
Villagers struck by the fever continue to be admitted to Webuye district
hospital and in neighboring districts as the disease spreads. Among the
dead are 17 villagers and 2 primary school pupils. 80 of their colleagues
and 12 villagers are undergoing treatment at Webuye Hospital, where no
deaths have occurred since last week.
About 140 students from Chesamisi have yet to return to school from a
week's break [which began in May 2004], and it is feared some may be down
with the disease. Parents have been urged to take them to the school
authorities or hospital.
An entourage that included Director of Medical services James Nyikal,
Western Provincial Medical Officer Olang Onunda and PC Hassan Noor was told
that the disease had struck Sirisia and Kibabii in Bungoma and had also
been detected at Kibuk Girls High School in Mt Elgon district.
The minister ordered Dr Nyikal to send mobile clinics to affected areas and
to strengthen Bungoma's team of doctors to deal with the increasing flow of
patients. She said Kenya Army trucks would supply fresh water to the
school and advised them to stop using water from Sosio River.
Bungoma Medical officer of health Dr Isaac Wasike told the minister that
new cases had been reported in Sirisia on the slopes of Mt Elgon and at
Kibabii near Bungoma Town.
Dr Wasike said that more than 30 students at the nearby Chesamisi Girls
Secondary School and 4 of their teachers had contracted the disease.
Additionally, [Dr Wasike said that] girls at Kibuk Girls Secondary School
were exhibiting symptoms similar to those of patients at Chesamisi and
called for swift action to save them.
The Bungoma District Education Officer, Mrs Peruse Abukuse, reported that
446 pupils and 9 teachers from Chesamisi Primary School had fallen ill and
were not attending class. The dead included 2 pupils from the school.
Dr Nyikal urged provincial medical chiefs to enforce an alert among their
staff so that any swamp fever victims can be identified and treated
swiftly. He said "doctors were unable to detect what it was at first, and
the disease leads to bleeding, kidney failure and heart complications
before the patients die."
Leptospirosis has been occurring in Western Kenya in 10-year cycles. It was
first reported in 1974, 1985, and 2004, but the latest attack was the biggest.

[Other synonyms for leptospirosis include autumnal fever, 7-day fever,
canefield fever, swineherd's disease, Fort Bragg fever, Weil disease,
canicola fever, rice-field fever, cane-cutter fever, hemorrhagic jaundice,
and Stuttgart disease.
In favorable conditions, leptospira can survive in fresh water for as many
as 16 days and in soil for as many as 24 days. This stability could
account for some, perhaps all, of the continuing occurrence of the disease,
although an ongoing water source exposure is probably more likely.
Chemoprophylaxis has been shown to be effective for persons with potential
risk for exposure, such as military troops traveling to endemic areas or
vacationers engaging in aquatic recreation. Doxycycline, 250 mg
administered orally once a week, is shown to be highly efficacious.
However, it is not recommended for persons with long-term or repeated
exposure. In an outbreak such as this one, chemoprophylaxis may play a
significant role in stopping the cases. - Mod.LL]
