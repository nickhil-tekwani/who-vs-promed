[Most mycobacteria of the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex are able to infect zoo and wildlife species. The virulence and infectivity vary widely across species. Camelids were not considered highly susceptible to TB, but several cases have been reported in recent years. Tuberculosis is rare among camels kept under nomadic conditions. The disease occurs more frequently when camels are kept in confinement, as in a zoo.
