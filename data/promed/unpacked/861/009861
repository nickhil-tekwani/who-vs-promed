["Newcastle disease is an infection of domestic poultry and other bird species with virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV). It is a worldwide problem that presents primarily as an acute respiratory disease, but depression, nervous manifestations, or diarrhea may be the predominant clinical form. Severity depends on the virulence of the infecting virus and host susceptibility. Occurrence of the disease is reportable and may result in trade restrictions". https://www.merckvetmanual.com/poultry/newcastle-disease-and-other-paramyxovirus-infections/newcastle-disease-in-poultry

"Velogenic strains of APMV-1 can cause conjunctivitis in humans, usually when the person has been exposed to large quantities of virus. Laboratory workers and vaccination crews are affected most often. Poultry workers are rarely infected, and handling or consuming poultry products does not appear to be a risk. The conjunctivitis usually resolves rapidly without treatment, but APMV-1 is shed in the ocular discharges for 4 to 7 days. All direct or indirect contact with birds should be avoided during this time. Mild, self-limiting influenza-like disease with fever, headache and malaise has also been reported in humans; in some cases, it is uncertain whether the illness was caused by APMV-1 or misdiagnosed by cross-reactions in serologic tests. One report, confirmed by virus isolation, suggested that APMV-1 could cause serious opportunistic infections in people who are severely immunosuppressed. A patient developed fatal pneumonia 18 days after receiving a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. There was no history of contact with poultry, and the isolate was most closely related to APMV-1 viruses from pigeons".
