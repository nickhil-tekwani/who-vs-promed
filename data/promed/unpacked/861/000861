From apple packing houses in Washington state to farm workers in Florida and a California county known as "the world's salad bowl," outbreaks of the novel coronavirus [COVID-19] are emerging at US fruit and vegetable farms and packing plants. A rising number of sick farm and packing house workers comes after thousands of meat plant [and seafood packing plant] employees contracted the virus and could lead to more labor shortages and a fresh wave of disruption to US food production [see COVID-19 update (242): seafood plant outbreak, WHO, global 20200606.7434798 and part 1B below].

The Trump administration said last month [May 2020] it may extend an executive order to keep meat plants operating to fruit and vegetable producers as well, a sign it is concerned fresh produce could be the next sector hit.

While social distancing can be more easily implemented for workers harvesting fruits and vegetables in fields and working outside may reduce some risks for virus spread, plants that package foods such as apples and carrots resemble the elbow-to-elbow conditions that contributed to outbreaks at US meat packing plants.

By late May [2020], there were more than 600 cases of COVID-19 among agricultural workers in Yakima County, Washington. Of those, 62% were workers in the apple industry and other packing operations or warehouses, according to a Reuters review of data from county health officials. With 4834 known cases as of [10 Jun 2020], the county had the highest per-capita infection rate on the West Coast.

"The (production) line moves super fast. And you're working side by side and back to back," said Edgar Franks, political director with local farmworker union Familias Unidas por la Justicia in Washington state. Workers at 6 fruit packing sites in Yakima County went on strike in May [2020] due to concerns they were not being provided adequate protection from COVID-19, Franks said.

The health department in Monterey County, California, known as "the world's salad bowl" for its sprawling vegetable farms, reported 247 agricultural workers had tested positive for coronavirus as of [5 Jun 2020], 39% of county's total cases. Monterey is one of only a handful of health departments in nearly 30 of the largest U.S. fruit and vegetable producing counties that tracks virus cases among agricultural workers, Reuters found.

In adjacent Kern county, a 53-year-old forklift operator at carrot grower Grimmway Farms died on [30 Apr 2020], according to his obituary. His family said they believe he contracted the virus at work. Grimmway grieved the loss of an employee and was supporting the family, a spokesperson said. The company said it did not definitively know where [the employee] contracted COVID-19.

A Grimmway employee said at one point so many workers were out sick his shift dwindled to a 3rd of the needed workers. "They made some announcements to stay 6 feet [2 meters] apart but that's basically impossible when you are loading boxes onto the same pallet," said [this employee], who tested positive for coronavirus himself though he showed no symptoms. "Obviously you are going to be close to your co-workers." Grimmway declined to say how many workers had tested positive for the virus and said it has seen no issues of absenteeism. When a worker falls ill, the company talks to everyone working on that particular shift or department and offers company-funded COVID testing, Grimmway said in a statement.

On [19 May 2020] the US Agriculture Department and Food and Drug Administration [FDA] said the government could use the Defense Production Act to keep fruit and vegetable lines moving. The act would give companies some liability protection if workers fall sick. An FDA spokesperson said the act could be used "to protect the food supply and prevent significant food shortages."

US Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said in an interview with Reuters farm workers face increased risks as fruits like apples and cherries enter harvest season. Stabenow, ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, introduced legislation on [27 May 2020] that would offer companies grants and loans to upgrade machinery and purchase personal protective equipment, fund COVID-19 testing, and facility cleaning. "You can get ahead of this, which is what didn't happen in the meat packing situation," she said. "The best way to protect our supply chain is to keep workers safe."

Meanwhile, coronavirus cases near tomato-growing Immokalee, Florida, are also on the rise. The spread of the coronavirus among Florida farm workers has significant implications for national food production, as many agricultural workers travel north through the summer following the harvest through Georgia, the Carolinas, and into the Northeast. The Florida Department of Agriculture is planning for more on-farm outbreaks by partnering with county health departments, hotels for quarantine housing, and educating workers. A farm worker from Immokalee, said many laborers can't afford to miss work, meaning many cases among farmworkers go undetected. "A lot of workers will hide their symptoms, or say it is just a cold or if they have a fever, just say it is too hot outside," potentially risking more infection, she said.

[While this report is from the USA, based on observations from the outbreaks in meat packing facilities both in the USA and in other countries such as Brazil, I suspect a similar event is occurring in agricultural sectors internationally as the settings are very similar. These are economically fragile workers in the best of times, seasonal employees and migratory following the harvests for those involved with fruit and vegetable harvesting. And as was quoted in the report, there is no monetary compensation for "sick leave" for the harvesters, so the incentive is for people to continue to work when they are ill. Nor is there unemployment insurance should they lose their jobs due to absenteeism. Quarantining contacts of documented cases is not perceived as a viable option. The pandemic is highlighting many populations whose daily subsistence is fragile, with no safety nets that might protect against illness related to their jobs or "permit" non-pharmaceutical preventive disease transmission measures to be successfully implemented.- Mod.MPP]

B. Oregon: seafood plant
Date: Tue 9 Jun 2020 7:49 PM EDT

Newport, a small coastal city, has been a blip on the radar when it comes to confirmed coronavirus cases in Oregon. Until Sunday [7 Jun 2020]. "Up until this point the pandemic has been distant. We have watched it unfold in other communities around the world, but not in our own," Kaety Jacobson, chair of the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners, said during a news conference Monday [8 Jun 2020]. "In the last 48 hours that has changed. We now have a large outbreak in our community."

More than 120 workers at Pacific Seafood, a Newport seafood plant, have tested positive for the virus, the company said Sunday [7 Jun 2020]. "This county has done really well over the last 3 months, [March, April, and May 2020]" said David Long, the health officer for Lincoln County Public Health. "I think many of us felt that it was never really going to hit us here and so, waking up yesterday [7 Jun 2020] and hearing the news about 124 cases at Pacific Seafood was a shock to many of us."

The 1st signs of a possible outbreak came [2 Jun 2020], when Pacific Seafood had its 1st positive case. The next day [3 Jun 2020], there were additional confirmed cases. By Sunday [7 Jun 2020], 376 workers had been tested. Out of those tested, 53 employees and 71 locally-based contractors tested positive, according to Pacific Seafood. About 95% were asymptomatic, state officials said.

The outbreak contributed to Oregon's highest case total in a single day as the state reported 146 cases Sunday [7 Jun 2020]. Health officials have reported about 5000 positive cases, with at least 169 deaths.

Pacific Seafood, which manages all parts of the supply chain from harvesting and fishing to processing, and distribution of seafood, beef, pork and poultry, has since suspended all operations.

Lincoln County Public Health officials are working on contact tracing and urging people who know they have come in contact with someone who has COVID-19, to self-isolate. The county isn't the only area that has seen an uptick in cases coming from the agriculture and food packing industry. In the state's most recent weekly report published [3 Jun 2020], there were 19 worksites with outbreaks. The majority were agriculture or food packing businesses.

Among those worksites are 2 Townsend Farms locations in Multnomah County with 86 cases and National Frozen Foods in Linn County with 41 cases. Officials said the next weekly report, with updated outbreak at worksites tallies, will be published Wednesday [10 Jun 2020].

Six coronavirus deaths have been associated with workplace outbreaks. "A lot of people are working and living in conditions that are higher risk. For example, agricultural workers, many of whom are kind of in labor camps or labor housing, are in close quarters," said Tom Jeanne a deputy health officer at the Oregon Health Authority.

Instead of implementing fines or penalties, Paul Cieslack, the medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations, said the health authority, Department of Agriculture, and county officials are working with agriculture and food packing businesses to create guidelines to reduce the spread of the disease as well as provide more testing.

"We want to work with them and get them to adopt practices that will reduce the risk to everyone," Cieslack said.

For most, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in 2 to 3 weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

[This is our 2nd report on outbreaks associated with seafood plants. This one is in Oregon, the prior one involved a shipboard processing plant, working in the waters off Washington State, Oregon, and Alaska. While the shipboard outbreak may have reflected observations of being confined on a ship, this current outbreak is land bound and reflects the general tight quarters for working in this industry. - Mod.MPP

[2] WHO situation report 143 (as of 11 Jun 2020)
Date: Thu 11 Jun 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200611-covid-19-sitrep-143.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 11 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, has released a statement on the status of the pandemic in the Region. He warns that cases in the region have increased during the past 3 weeks and there is the risk cases will continue to increase as many countries ease restrictions. He reiterated that every country's best defense against COVID-19 is to find, isolate, test, and care for every case and to trace and quarantine every contact.

- Somalia is expanding its Early Warning, Alert and Response Network (EWARN) across the country to facilitate early detection of suspected cases of COVID-19. WHO will be supporting the roll out of the EWARN system to an additional 230 health centres beyond the current 533 reporting sites, with COVID-19 now being a reportable health condition in Somalia.

- In today's 'subject in focus' below, we present interim guidance on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19.

Subject in focus: advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID19 interim guidance published [5 Jun 2020]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO published updated guidance on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 on [5 Jun 2020], replacing the previous guidance originally published on [6 Apr 2020].

WHO continues to advise that masks be used as part of a comprehensive package of prevention and control measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. WHO reiterates that the use of a mask alone is insufficient to protect the user or others, and other community and personal protection measures should also be adopted to suppress spread of COVID-19.

Within the updated guidance, WHO provides practical advice to decision-makers as to who needs to wear a mask, which type of mask should be used, and when it should be worn. It also incorporates new research findings since the previous version. The updated guidance reinforces the use of a risk-based approach to understand the situation for each country, and how masks can be used as part of a comprehensive package of measures to limit the spread of the virus.

Here is a snapshot of what's included in the updated guidance:
- Advice for use of masks in health settings (including long-term care and residential facilities)
In care settings where health workers provide direct care to COVID-19 patients, WHO continues to recommend the use of a medical mask in addition to other personal protective equipment (PPE) that are part of droplet/contact precautions (gown, gloves, eye protection), in the absence of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). In care settings for COVID-19 patients where AGPs are performed, health workers should wear a fit-tested respirator, as part of airborne precautions.

For areas with community transmission of COVID-19, WHO provides new guidance for the targeted continuous use of medical masks for health workers, including caregivers, working in clinical areas. This means that health workers should wear a medical mask during their routine activities throughout the entire shift, apart from when eating and drinking and changing their medical mask after caring for a patient who requires droplet/contact precautions for other reasons.

The use of non-medical masks (fabric masks) is not considered appropriate protection for health workers. In the context of a severe medical mask shortage, face shields may be considered as an alternative. Community health workers should wear a medical mask when providing routine services in areas of community transmission in addition to adhering to standard precautions, including physical distancing measures and hand hygiene.

- Advice for the general public
WHO continues to recommend that a person with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, even if symptoms are mild, should wear a medical mask (and seek medical attention). In areas where COVID-19 is widespread, WHO advises governments to encourage the use of medical masks among vulnerable populations: people aged 60 years and older, and those with underlying comorbidities.

While many countries are recommending the use of non-medical masks (fabric masks) for the general public, this is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence and there are potential benefits and harms to consider. WHO has taken into consideration the available studies evaluating the potential for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, individual values and preferences, as well as the difficulty in implementing many public health and social measures, including maintaining physical distancing of at least 1 metre [3 ft] in many contexts, and has updated our guidance. WHO advises governments to encourage the use of fabric masks for the general public in areas of widespread transmission in settings where 1m physical distance cannot be maintained, and as part of a comprehensive approach to reduce transmission. WHO continues to support and advise decision makers on how to apply a risk-based approach when considering the use of masks for the general public.

The criteria and examples of recommended mask usage in various contexts are provided in the guidance.

Finally, the guidance includes new research findings on features to consider when making a fabric mask, including the materials, number of layers, combination of materials, and shape. Proper usage, maintenance, and management of masks is explained and is essential to ensure safety of the wearer. This is the result of research that WHO requested to better understand how non-medical masks could be used in the context of COVID-19. All scientific references are included in the guidance document.

This site also includes FAQs on mask usage, downloadable posters on do's and don'ts for both medical and non-medical masks, and 2 videos with a technical expert: one on how to put on and maintain a medical mask, and the other on how to do the same with a fabric mask (using the 3-layer composition identified by the research).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 54.6% of the global newly reported cases and 68.8% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 45.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA reported 24.6%, Chile 8.2%, Mexico 6.0%, and Peru 5.8%.

The European region reported 14.0% of the global newly reported cases and 14.8% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 48.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 5.6%, Turkey 5.1%, Belarus 4.5%, Sweden 4.9%, and Ukraine 3.8%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 15.2% of the global newly reported cases and 6.3% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 29.9% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 19.1%, Iran 10.3%, Qatar 8.8%, Egypt 7.5%, and Iraq 5.9%. Note that the Eastern Mediterranean region has reported a greater proportion of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours than the European region for the 3rd consecutive day.

The African region reported 3.7% of the global newly reported cases and 1.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 50.5% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 8.5%, Cameroon at 7.7%, Cote d'Ivoire at 3.9%, Ethiopia at 3.5%, Congo DR at 2.7%, and Senegal at 2.6%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1.0% of the global newly reported cases and 0.22% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 57.3% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 34.9%, South Korea 3.5%, and Japan 3.2%.

The South East Asia region reported 11.5% of the global newly reported cases and 8.0% of global fatalities. India reported 67.8% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 21.6%, Indonesia 8.4%, and Nepal 1.9%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 11 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia and which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases, and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has surpassed the European region, and the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is 'not applicable'; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 7 596 987, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count increased by 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.08 million confirmed cases, now represents 27.5% of the global cases of COVID-19, as other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, and Pakistan are increasing their numbers of cumulative cases significantly. A global total of 423 844 deaths have been reported, an increase of 4972 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, there is major underreporting of numbers of infections with the SARS-CoV-2, possibly 1/10th to 1/20th in order of magnitude. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes unfortunately dying at home and are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India (surpassing Spain and the UK in the last 24 hours), the UK, Spain, Italy, Peru, Germany, and Iran is number 10. China is number 18. In descending rank order, Brazil is number 1 for number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, Pakistan, India, Russia, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh -- the same countries as yesterday (10 Jun 2020) but slightly differing orders.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases, which include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the Western Pacific region -- unchanged in the past 72 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 20 countries with most cumulative cases include 8 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the European region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region -- none from the Western Pacific region. This ordering very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.MPP]
