At least 12 people died and 251 were injured in a chlorine gas leak from a storage tank at Jordan's Aqaba port, officials and state media reported on Monday [27 Jun 2022].

The leak came after a tank filled with 25 tonnes of chlorine gas being exported to Djibouti fell while being transported, officials said.

A video posted on state television's Twitter page showed a storage tank falling from a winch and slamming into the deck of a ship, followed by yellow-coloured gas rising into the air as people ran away.

Health ministry officials said they expected only a handful of people to remain hospitalised by Tuesday [28 Jun 2022].

Chlorine is a widely used disinfectant and water purification agent, but if inhaled, the gas turns to hydrochloric acid, which can lead to internal burning and drowning through a reactionary release of water in the lungs.

Jordan's Aqaba grain silos halted work to allow inspection of its grains and for any signs of contamination, but maritime traffic at Aqaba ports continues, officials said.

There were no vessels unloading any grains cargo at the time of the incident, they added.

Aqaba port at the north end of the Red Sea has long been a major transit route for Iraqi imports and exports.

Prime Minister Bisher al-Khasawneh arrived at Aqaba and headed to a hospital where some of the injured were being treated, state TV reported.

Al-Khasawneh also formed an investigation team into the incident chaired by the interior minister, state TV cited the information minister as saying.

[Chlorine gas is a respiratory irritant, but in high enough concentrations, pulmonary edema may develop. Chlorine gas may also cause headaches, nausea, and vomiting.

Exposure to low levels of chlorine gas for extended periods (chronic exposure) may produce pulmonary problems such as a chronic cough, phlegm production, wheezing, possibly asthma or asthma-like conditions, and eye irritation.

Humans can usually detect odor from chlorine gas at levels below 1 part per million (ppm). Mucous membrane irritation, which occurs at levels above 1 ppm, increases in intensity up to levels of about 15 ppm. Chest pain and shortness of breath usually occur at 30 ppm; pulmonary edema may develop at 40-60 ppm.

There is no specific treatment for those who are ill except to flush the eyes and maybe the nose, and to provide clean, fresh air. Treatment is symptomatic. Washing all affected areas of the body will help eliminate the chlorine on the skin and reduce the pain.

Chlorine gas in high levels is painful to the eyes and the respiratory system, and people exposed to very high levels can die.

Chlorine gas is usually yellow-greenish in color; it is heavier than air, so it remains near the ground.

Large amounts of chlorine in the water may produce chlorine salts and other chemicals when combined with substances in the water. - Mod.TG
