Dengue, situation in Venezuela (epidemiological week 36)
--------------------------------------------------------
For the week ending 11 Sep 2004,* the Venezuelan Ministry of Health
reported 518 cases of dengue, for a year-to-date total of 22 094 cases,
almost 40 per cent more than the number for the same period of 2003 (13 428).
In the same week there were 49 cases of DHF (9.5 per cent) with no deaths,
for a cumulative total (for 2004) of 1436 cases of DHF with 3 deaths.
The dengue case trend has been increasing over the last 10 weeks. All 4
types of dengue are co-circulating. The accumulated morbidity rate is 84.9
per 100 000 pop.

A senior health ministry official is the latest among 201 other Jeddah
residents since February [2004] to come down with dengue fever. The deputy
director of Pharmacy Affairs at the Ministry of Health in Jeddah was
recently hit by the disease. But there is no cause for alarm, according to
Ghazi Sheikh, the director of protective health care affairs in Jeddah
region. No cases were reported in Jeddah region during the last 2 weeks
which is a sign that the disease has been confined and controlled, he said.
Ghazi Sheikh told The Saudi Gazette that infections in the Jeddah region
have dropped over the last 3 weeks and all cases are under control. He said
388 cases of suspected dengue fever were reported in Jeddah since February
[2004] and of them 201 were confirmed positive through laboratory tests.
Sami Badawood, director general of King Fahad Hospital in Jeddah, said
great progress has been achieved since a couple of months ago. He said that
now they receive 20 to 18 suspected cases monthly, which is not a very high
average. Most of the cases are found negative and leave the hospital on the
same day, Badawood said.
[Although some residents of the affected districts expressed
dissatisfaction with the official control measures], the assistant director
of the Jeddah mayor's office, Mohmmad Buhjut, said that several preventive
measures are being taken. "We spray and disinfect all Jeddah's districts,
especially where stagnant water is found," he said. Jeddah residents have
long complained of pools of stagnant water, overflowing septic tanks,
leaking sewage tankers and water pipes and an inadequate drainage system.
These factors help a lot in breeding mosquitoes and spreading disease.
Ghazi Sheikh said that the health ministry holds a weekly meeting with
municipality representatives to discuss the developments about the disease.
A special committee, he added, has been formed in conjunction with Jeddah
municipality and the ministry of agriculture to follow up identified cases
and cooperate in combating the disease. But Ghazi Sheikh believes that
combating mosquitoes is mainly the responsibility of every resident as well
as the municipality. "Households," he said, "should remove all stagnant
water on their premises and spray their gardens. We all have gardens and
pools that we should take care of."

Patients infected with dengue type 3
------------------------------------
Dengue virus type 3 has been isolated from cases in Terrenos Novos, Campo
dos Velhos, Vila Uniao & Junco, in the municipality of Fortaleza [Ceara
state capital]. The testing was done in Fortaleza by the Central Laboratory
(Lacen). As of today [2 Oct 2004] there have been 469 confirmed cases of
dengue and 1 of DHF (non-fatal). Of this total, 279 cases occurred in
Terrenos Novos, followed by Junco with 62. Cases began in May 2004, and
peaked in June and July. In Terrenos Novos the chain of transmission has
been interrupted, but the index of infection by the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito remains high, at 6.3 per cent. Other subdivisions are above 2 per
cent [the WHO standard threshold target for vector reduction. - Mod.JW].
Coordinator of endemic diseases & zoonoses, Raimundo Vieira Dias Neto, said
mosquito breeding was detected at 40 per cent of houses at the subsequent
inspection.
The municipal secretariat for social development and health is carrying out
house-to-house visits, with public education, inspection and the removal of
breeding foci, and a service for closing water tanks with mosquito screens
or lids, biological control with _Trichogaster_ fish [which eat mosquito
larvae. - Mod.JW], and space spraying where there are cases of dengue.
