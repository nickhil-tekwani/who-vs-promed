Health officials are warning Illinois residents to be careful around
unfamiliar animals, after a horse tested positive for the strain of
rabies carried by skunks.
The Illinois Department of Public Health says the horse was in
LaSalle County and 11 people who came into contact with it have been
given preventative treatment [post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP].
The last human case of rabies in Illinois was in 1954, but 50 bats
have tested positive for the disease in 2004. The horse is the only
animal other than bats to be diagnosed with rabies [in the state]
since 1998.
State veterinarian Connie Austin says Illinoisans should stay away
from wild animals and vaccinate their pets.

[Rabies vaccine is cheap compared to the loss of life, whether it is
an animal or a person. There is vaccine approved for horses and for
cattle. In areas where rabies is known to be a concern, vaccinating
horses and cattle is a cheap insurance policy against the devastating
effects of this disease. - Mod.TG]
