One of 2 birds found infected with bird flu in Kuwait has the deadly
H5N1 strain of the virus, health authorities have confirmed. H5N1 is
the strain that has devastated poultry stocks and killed more than 60
people in Asia.
The infected bird was a migrating flamingo found on a Kuwait beach.
The other was an imported falcon found to have the milder H5N2
variant.
The infected birds in Kuwait are the 1st known cases of the virus in
the Persian Gulf region.
A senior official said the government didn't plan to cull any birds
following the confirmation.
"Immediate action was taken ... and the situation is under control,"
said Sheik Fahd Salem Al Ali Al Sabah, chairman of the Public
Authority for Agriculture and Fisheries.
Last month, Kuwait said it had earmarked USD 17 million to buy drugs
to combat bird flu.
The entire Middle East region has been worried about possible
outbreaks because the region sits on important migratory bird
waterways south. Jordan and Israel have been among the other
countries trying to impose precautions to prevent outbreaks.

[The affected bird is, most probably, a Greater Flamingo,
_Phoenicopterus roseus_. This species, the only flamingo recorded in
Kuwait (See Avibase, the world bird database
<http://www.bsc-eoc.org/avibase/avibase.jsphas>), has the most
widespread distribution of all flamingo species. Populations are
found in northwest India, the Middle East, the western Mediterranean
and Africa. Limited numbers can be found over much of northern
Europe, eastward to Siberia. Though generally regarded as
non-migratory, populations that breed in lakes that may freeze over
in the winter, move to warmer areas, and return in springtime. When
flamingos migrate, they do so mainly at night and can travel
approximately 600 km (373 miles) in one night at about 50 to 60 kph
(31-37 mph).
Greater flamingos were among the birds clinically affected by H5N1 in
the Penfold Park, Hong Kong SAR, in November 2002.
Information from knowledgeable sources about migration patterns and
origin(s) of flamingos visiting the Middle and Near East,
particularly the gulf area, will be gratefully received. - Mod.AS]

Re your requests for information about possible transport of H5N1 by
migratory birds, your readers are referred to the BBC nature
programme from Slimbridge (Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust Centre near
Gloucester, UK) which earlier this week held a discussion devoted to
bird flu and wild bird involvement.
During the programme, Prof. Chris Feare pointed out that although
H5N1 outbreaks in Siberia followed migratory bird routes, they were
also close to the Trans-Siberian railway and road corridor and
occurred in summer when birds were moulting and non-migratory,
suggesting human involvement in virus transport.
Programme can be heard again via website:
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/nature.shtml>.
Part 2 of 2-part BBC Panorama investigation into bird flu is to be
broadcast next Sunday [13 Nov 2005] and again, there should be video
feed available on the BBC website.

The wild duck that was positive for H5N1 (but at low pathogenicity,
not dangerous to human health) was a mallard killed by a hunter in
the Modena province 20 days ago. Mauro Delogu, a researcher at
Bologna University, said that they had already cooked it.
Delogu has activated a monitoring network on migratory bird viruses
in Italy and has discovered the 1st case of bird flu in Italy. "The
laboratory of Bologna University made the first tests on the samples
collected among wild fauna in several towns in Italy. When we
registered this 1st suspect case we sent it to the reference centre
in Legnaro (Padua) to identify the virus," he said. The virus was
found in a young male of mallard aged around 1 year, which was killed
by a hunter in Modena province. Delogu said that probably the bird
was not migratory. It was probably born in Italy, due to its young
age. The virus could be also of local origin too.
The tests run in Padua confirmed that it was a low pathogenicity
virus that is [substantially different from] the Asian virus.
"Speaking about the virus as being H5N1 means speaking about a virus
[within a group] that has many differences," the researcher said.
This is the 1st time in 13 years that an Italian researcher has found
an H5N1 virus in Italian wild birds. The discovery is good news,
because the virus has a low pathogenicity and can boost the immune
system of the birds, helping them to resist the Asian strain. "Nature
develops its defences in a marvellous way" he said.

[The above information, if accurate, provides the information
requested in 20051110.3286: species (mallard, _Anas platyrhynchos_),
location (Modena, see map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IT/5/Modena.html>), origin
(probably local) and clinical status (probably non-clinical, hunted
young male).
It will help if data on the methods applied to identify the virus and
determine the (allegedly low) pathogenicity of the involved H5N1
virus strain, are made available.
Surveillance in wild birds has recently become a European Union
priority and guidelines made available (see 20051027.3134). The
guidelines include a provisional list of (15) wild bird species
presenting higher risk in relation to avian influenza. Mallards are
included. - Mod.AS]
