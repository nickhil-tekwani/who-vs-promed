Yemen's Agriculture Ministry is boosting efforts to combat the
livestock disease screwworm, which is threatening the livelihoods of
rural inhabitants, particularly in coastal and central regions,
according to ministry officials.

"Since 1 Nov 2009, we have dispatched dozens of vets to rural areas in
the governorates of Hodeida, Hajjah, Mahwit, Taiz, Ibb, Dhamar and
Raima to treat thousands of infected animals and increase awareness
among pastoralists on how to protect livestock," Mansoor al-Qadasi,
the government's chief vet, told IRIN on 7 Nov 2009.

"Falling temperatures during winter in coastal and central-southern
areas, coupled with unhealthy animal shelters, encourage the rapid
spread of screwworm, putting animal lives at risk," he said.

According to Agriculture Ministry vet Hani Merai, some 7666 cows,
sheep, goats and camels have been treated and over 50 000 vaccinated
[but see commentary] against the disease in the 7 governorates over
the past month. "469 villages were covered by the programme, and 4053
animal shelters were sprayed or cleaned in the same period," he said.

Merai said the ministry had distributed over 3600 leaflets in the most
affected areas in Taiz and Ibb governorates and that more would be
distributed in other governorates in the next couple of months.

Taiz-based epidemic surveillance and control official Nizar Faisal
said increasing the awareness of pastoralists was the best way to
reduce the risk of another screwworm outbreak.

"It is difficult to eliminate the epidemic, but early interventions
can keep deaths to a minimum. Since the epidemic first broke out in
2007, more than 22 000 animals have been infected," Faisal said [see
comment].

The screwworm fly lays its eggs in a cut or open wound on a
warm-blooded animal. Maggots then feast off the living flesh and can
kill the animal if the wound is not cleaned and treated with
insecticide in time.

The Agriculture Ministry initiative is supported by international
organizations such as the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "Earlier this year
[2009], FAO provided us with pesticides, while IAEA offered the
necessary equipment and trained staff at the Central Veterinarian
Laboratory on how to deal with infected animals," chief vet al-Qadasi
said. "But the programme's budget is limited. We still need more funds
from international and local donors to increase the drive against
screwworm."

Al-Qadasi said livestock are the main source of income for 75 percent
of Yemen's rural population (estimated to be 16 million). According to
Anwar Abdullah, a Taiz local council member, a shepherd earns YR 400
(USD 2.00) a day for grazing 50-100 sheep or goats from 8 am until 5
pm, but with fewer animals to graze, their incomes were being hit.

[The above article includes inaccuracies; there is no "vaccination"
against OWS. The use of the term "infection" is also misleading;
"infestation" would be more appropriate.

Old world screwworm (OWS) disease is caused by _Chrysomya bezziana_, a
fly which is an obligate parasite of mammals during its larval stages.
OWS is one of the internationally reportable diseases included in
OIE's list of MULTIPLE SPECIES DISEASES. The internationally agreed
requirements pertaining to OWS are specified in article 2.2.8 of OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Larvae feeding on the skin and
underlying tissues of the host cause a condition known as wound or
traumatic myiasis, which can be fatal. Infestations are generally
acquired at sites of previous wounding due to natural causes or to
animal husbandry practices, but they may also occur in the mucous
membranes of body orifices.

Female flies are attracted to wounds at the edges of which each female
lays an average of 175 eggs. The larvae emerge within 12-24 hours and
immediately begin to feed, burrowing head-downwards into the wound.
After growth involving 2 moults, the larvae leave the wound and drop
to the ground into which they burrow to pupate. The duration of the
life-cycle off the host is temperature dependent, being shorter at
higher temperatures, and the whole cycle may be completed in less than
3 weeks in the tropics.

Treatment is generally effected by application of organophosphorus
insecticides into infested wounds, both to kill larvae and to provide
a residual protection against re-infestation. Preventive measures
include the spraying or dipping of susceptible livestock with
organophosphorus compounds and, more recently, use of avermectins as
subcutaneous injections to animals "at risk." Strict control of the
movement of animals out of affected areas also acts as a preventive
measure.

OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals,
available on-line at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00047.htm>.

The confirmation of the presence and spread of OWS in Yemen by FAO
should ring alarm bells in the Middle and Near East; a map, presenting
the distribution of predicted OWS risk for livestock in the area,
based on eco-climatic suitability, is available at
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/foto/2008/OWS_map.gif>.

Yemen submitted to the OIE its annual report for 2008. According to
the report, 4977 outbreaks of OWS were recorded during 2008, the
number of mortalities being 336 cattle, 11 116 sheep, 4369 goats, 245
camels and 59 wildlife (probably deer or gazelle. For the report, see
