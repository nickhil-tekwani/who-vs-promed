- European Union
All EU member states plan to start vaccinations against COVID from [27 Dec 2020], German Health Minister Jens Spahn says. "In Germany, we will start, if the approval comes as planned, on [27 Dec 2020]. The other countries in the EU want to be able to start ... from [27 Dec 2020]" he said ahead of an online meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and executives from vaccine maker BioNTech. As a member of the EU, Germany is obliged, by and large, to wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to approve the vaccine.

The EU will take up its option to buy up to 100 million more doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine after turning down an opportunity in July for a much bigger deal, according to EU officials and an internal document. The plan comes after some of the vaccine candidates ordered by the EU faced unexpected delays in clinical trials, forcing the bloc and other wealthy nations to rely for now on shots from fewer manufacturers than initially planned.

- Viet Nam
A Vietnamese pharmaceutical company has begun testing a coronavirus vaccine on volunteers in Hanoi, as developing countries jostle with richer nations to access affordable inoculations. Nanogen's Nanocovax is one of 4 vaccines under development in Vietnam, and a company representative said it is expected to cost about $5 a dose. Three volunteers received the jab and will be monitored for 72 hours at the Vietnam Military Medical University.

- Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia kicked off coronavirus vaccinations, its health ministry says, one day after it received 2 shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Footage on al-Ekhbariya TV showed a man and a woman at a medical centre in the capital Riyadh getting vaccinated. Shortly after, Minister of Health Tawfiq al-Rabiah received the vaccine.

Saudi Arabia received its 1st 2 shipments on Wednesday [16 Dec 2020], becoming the 1st country in the Middle East to obtain the vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German partner BioNTech. It approved the use of the vaccine last week. Saudi Arabian authorities asked people to register to be vaccinated via a mobile application; more than 150 000 people registered in 24 hours.

Citizens aged 65 and above, professionals at higher risks of COVID-19 exposure, as well as people with immune deficiency and chronic disease, will be 1st recipients of the vaccine. The 2nd round will see people aged over 50, health practitioners, and those with specific chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes vaccinated. The rest of the population will get the vaccine at the 3rd stage, according to the health ministry.

Saudi Arabia, which has a population of some 34 million, has recorded more than 360 000 coronavirus cases, including 6000 deaths. Earlier this month [December 2020], the United Arab Emirates launched a vaccination programme using another vaccine, Sinovac, after conducting trials with Chinese company Sinopharm.

- Israel
Israel will begin rolling out a significant coronavirus vaccination campaign next week after the prime minister reached out personally to the head of a major drug company. Millions of Palestinians living under Israeli control will have to wait much longer. Worldwide, rich nations are snatching up scarce supplies of new vaccines as poor countries are relying on a WHO programme that has yet to get off the ground.

- Asia Pacific Region
The WHO has said that countries in the Asia-Pacific region are not guaranteed to have early access to COVID vaccines and urged them to adopt a long-term approach to the pandemic. "The development of safe and effective vaccines is one thing. Producing them in adequate quantities and reaching everyone who needs them is another," WHO Regional Director Dr Takeshi Kasai told reporters in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.

- Chile
The Chilean health regulator has approved for emergency use the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine, paving the way for the 1st doses to be administered as early as [25 Dec 2020] to citizens over the age of 16. The Institute of Public Health received the Pfizer request for approval on [27 Nov 2020], and a panel of experts was convened to analyse the vaccine data supplied by the US drug manufacturer.

[B] FDA panel clears Moderna vaccine
Date: Thu 17 Dec 2020
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/health/covid-vaccine-fda-moderna.html


The coronavirus vaccine made by Moderna moved closer to authorization on Thursday [17 Dec 2020], a significant step that would expand the reach of the nation's vaccination campaign to rural areas and many more hospitals.

As the nation buckled from uncontrolled spread of the disease, with 3611 deaths on Wednesday [16 Dec 2020] setting yet another horrific record, a panel of independent experts recommended, by a vote of 20 in favor and 1 abstention, that the Food and Drug Administration authorize the Moderna vaccine for emergency use. The formal decision, expected on Friday [18 Dec 2020], would clear the way for some 5.9 million doses to be shipped around the country starting this weekend.

Moderna would be the 2nd company allowed to begin inoculating the public, giving millions more Americans access to desperately needed vaccine. The 1st, made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, received authorization last week.

The Moderna vaccine can be distributed more widely because it can be stored at normal freezer temperatures and, unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, does not require ultracold storage. It also comes in much smaller batches, making it easier for hospitals in less populated areas to use quickly.

"Moderna can go to more places," Dr Mandy Cohen, North Carolina's secretary of health and human services, said this week. "We hope to be in all 100 counties with some amount of vaccine -- small allocations at 1st -- by the end of next week, assuming Moderna gets approved this week and we get our allocations delivered over the course of next week."

The 2 vaccines, and an ambitious rollout by the federal government, states, and businesses to deploy them, are the 1st signs of hope for an end to the pandemic that has killed more than 300 000 Americans, closed schools and businesses, and left people afraid to go near friends, neighbors, and relatives, especially at the height of the holiday season.

Moderna developed its vaccine in collaboration with scientists from the National Institutes of Health.

A 2nd vaccine couldn't come soon enough. State health officials complained this week after they learned the 2nd shipment of the Pfizer vaccine would be smaller than the 1st one, prompting questions about whether the federal government would meet its goal of giving 20 million people an initial dose of the 2-shot vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna before the end of the year [2020]. The smaller shipment, which appeared to be the result of a scheduling hiccup, ignited tensions between Pfizer and the federal government, who are negotiating over how many vaccine doses Pfizer will sell to the United States in the 1st half of next year [2021].

The vaccines are in short supply, and the initial batches are being given to people at high risk of infection or serious illness: frontline health care workers and the residents and staff of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.

On Saturday [19 Dec 2020], an independent panel of experts will decide whether to recommend that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allow distribution of the Moderna vaccine. And on Sunday [20 Dec 2020], the same panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will decide which "priority group" should be next in line for the vaccine. A subcommittee of the group last month [November 2020] proposed that it be essential workers -- some 80 million teachers, law enforcement officers, bus drivers, restaurant workers and others whose jobs involve close contact with other people. Each state would then decide which essential workers to prioritize, as there will not be nearly enough vaccine in the short term to cover them all.

The subcommittee said next in line should be people 65 and older, as well as people with conditions that put them at high risk for COVID, like diabetes or obesity. It will be up to the larger group to make a final decision on Sunday [20 Dec 2020], which the CDC's director, Dr Robert R Redfield, will have to approve.

At the meeting on Thursday [17 Dec 2020], the FDA's expert panel heard from Moderna, agency scientists and the public. In large clinical trials, both vaccines were about 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, and Moderna's vaccine offered persuasive evidence that it could prevent severe cases of the disease, which is crucial for keeping people out of the hospital and reducing deaths.

Dr Rachel Zhang, a researcher in the FDA's office of vaccines research and review, said that the agency found the vaccine worked equally well in different groups of volunteers defined by race or ethnicity, gender or age. She also said that the data from the trial hinted that protection from the vaccine starts to emerge soon after people get the 1st dose. However, she cautioned that there wasn't enough data to come to a clear conclusion. "For maximum protection, both doses should be given," Dr Tal Zaks, the chief medical officer at Moderna, said at the meeting.

The panel grappled with questions about the potential for allergic reactions after a few cases occurred among people who received the 1st doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech shots have been linked to 3 cases of a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis -- 2 in Britain and one in the United States, in a health care worker in Alaska. A 2nd person at the same Alaska hospital also had a serious allergic reaction, though not anaphylaxis. All have recovered or are recovering.

Neither Moderna nor Pfizer-BioNTech reported serious problems with allergic reactions during their clinical studies, but when drugs or vaccines move out of trials and into broader distribution, rare side effects can emerge. The 2 vaccines are similar, but not identical. Both consist of genetic material, mRNA, encased in a bubble of lipids. The exact composition is not the same, so it is not clear that an allergic reaction to one means the same thing would occur with the other. But the possibility is a concern. Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines in the United States have been rare, with fewer than one in a million cases a year. At the meeting on Thursday [17 Dec 2020], Dr Doran L Fink of the FDA said that the agency and the CDC were investigating the reactions. "We anticipate that there may be additional reports which we will rapidly investigate," Dr Fink said, adding that robust surveillance systems were in place to detect these rare cases. He said there was not enough information to tell if an ingredient in the vaccines had caused the allergic reactions.

Moderna is developing 8 other vaccines that use mRNA. The company has tested them in animals and in 1700 people, and has not had cases of anaphylaxis or other severe allergic reactions linked to the vaccine, Dr Jacqueline Miller of Moderna said. One anaphylaxis case occurred 2 months after vaccination, in a person with a soy allergy. Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines generally occur within minutes or even seconds after the shots are administered. Other side effects -- fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle, and joint pain -- are much more common after getting the Moderna vaccine, especially after the 2nd shot. Although the reported side effects are not dangerous they can be unpleasant, lasting 1 to 3 days. Doctors say the symptoms are comparable to those experienced by many people after getting Shingrix, the vaccine to prevent shingles. People should be prepared to feel under the weather for a day or 2 after each shot, they said, and may need to take a day off work.

Moderna's study found that 91.6 percent of recipients had sore arms, 68.5 percent had fatigue, 63 percent headaches, 59.6 percent had muscle pain, 44.8 percent had joint pain, and 43.4 percent had chills. Some participants also had swollen lymph nodes in the armpit on the side where they received the injection. Company scientists emphasized on Thursday [17 Dec 2020] that the vaccine does not alter a person's genes or interact with DNA, and that the mRNA is quickly broken down and does not linger long in the body. Both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech studies reported a small number of cases of a temporary facial paralysis called Bell's palsy. Moderna found 3 cases in the vaccine group and 1 in the placebo group, and Pfizer had 4 cases, all in the vaccine group. FDA reviewers did not think the disorder was related to the vaccine. On Thursday [17 Dec 2020], Moderna said the company would monitor for the condition.

Shipping of the vaccine will be managed by the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed, but each state will decide where its doses go. Tennessee, for example, plans to disperse most of its anticipated allocation of 115 000 initial doses next week [week of 21 Dec 2020] among all 195 of its local health departments, which will inoculate 1st responders, and to every hospital in the state that did not receive a Pfizer shipment this week. In Kentucky, Gov Andy Beshear told reporters that he expected close to 80 000 doses of the Moderna vaccine in the state's initial shipment, adding, "We're going to ensure we have some allocation for every acute care hospital across the commonwealth. And in Massachusetts, Gov Charlie Baker said Tuesday [15 Dec 2020] that 110 000 of the state's expected 120 000 Moderna doses would go to smaller hospitals and outpatient clinics, including community health centers. Some states will be handing over part of their Moderna allocation to CVS and Walgreens, which have contracts with the federal government to immunize residents and staff in nursing homes starting next week.

Dr Jasmine Marcelin, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, was one of several clinicians who called into the FDA panel's meeting. She mentioned the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on people of color and urged her colleagues to listen to their concerns and include trusted professionals from their communities. "The health care profession has previously betrayed these communities through centuries of structural racism," she said.

Moderna has requested authorization to vaccinate adults, based on its clinical trial in 30 000 people 18 and older. Pfizer included some younger volunteers in its study and was authorized for use in people 16 and older. But neither vaccine was tested in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Many vaccines and drugs are studied in other groups before their safety is assessed in pregnant women. But researchers did not observe any harmful effects of the Moderna vaccine in 13 women who became pregnant during the trial. An estimated 330 000 health care workers are expected to be pregnant or breastfeeding as the vaccines are rolled out. With no evidence of harm, and given the high risk of COVID-19 in these women, the FDA did not exclude pregnant or breastfeeding women from its authorization. An advisory group to the CDC recommended last week [week of 7 Dec 2020] that women who are either pregnant or breastfeeding, or in the planning stages, consult with their doctors before choosing to take the Pfizer vaccine. The committee is expected to make a similar recommendation for the Moderna vaccine this weekend [18-20 Dec 2020].

The one abstention in vote, "Michael Kurilla, the director of clinical innovation at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, part of the NIH, said that he was uncomfortable that wording of the question was too broad and too positive for an emergency use authorization, a protest he had registered before the vote was made. He said afterward that he would have preferred to target the regulatory clearance to people at high risk. "A blanket statement for individuals 18 years and older is far too broad," he said. He also said he would have preferred the vaccines had been made available under what's known as an expanded access protocol -- basically, a big clinical trial -- and not an EUA." <(https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/17/moderna-vaccine-fda-panel/>.

[2] USA: mortality in 25-44-year-olds
Date: Wed 16 Dec 2020
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/opinion/covid-deaths-young-adults.html


New research shows that July [2020] may have been the deadliest month for young adults in modern American history.

The largest burden of COVID-19 has undoubtedly fallen on people older than 65; they account for around 80 percent of deaths in the United States. But if we momentarily eclipse that from our mind's eye, something else becomes visible: The corona of this virus. Young adults are dying at historic rates. In research published on Wednesday [16 Dec 2020] in the Journal of the American Medical Association [see reference below], we found that among US adults ages 25 to 44, from March through the end of July [2020], there were almost 12 000 more deaths than were expected based on historical norms. In fact, July [2020] appears to have been the deadliest month among this age group in modern American history. Over the past 20 years, an average of 11 000 young American adults died each July. This year [2020] that number swelled to over 16 000.

The trends continued this fall. Based on prior trends, around 154 000 in this demographic had been projected to die in 2020. We surpassed that total in mid-November [2020]. Even if death rates suddenly return to normal in December [2020] -- and we know that they will not -- we would anticipate well over 170 000 deaths among U.S. adults in this demographic by the end of 2020.

While detailed data are not yet available for all areas, we know COVID-19 is the driving force behind these excess deaths. Consider New York State. In April and May [2020], COVID-19 killed 1081 adults ages 20 to 49, according to statistics we gathered from the New York State Health Department. Remarkably, this figure towers over the state's usual leading cause of death in that age group -- unintentional accidents including drug overdoses and road accidents -- which combined to cause 495 deaths in this demographic during April and May of 2018, the most recent year for which data are available to the public.

After the Northeast's horrific 1st surge this spring subsided, similar trends began to become apparent in other regions over the summer. As caseloads among the younger population rose nationwide, COVID-19 became a leading cause of death among younger adults in other regions. While deaths from the virus temporarily exceeded opioid deaths among young adults in some areas this year [2020], we are also concerned that unintentional overdose deaths have increased during the pandemic as well.

Nor is it an illusion that people of color constitute a disproportionate fraction of the dead. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among adults 25 to 44, Black and Hispanic people make up not just a disproportionate number but a majority of COVID-19 deaths through [30 Sep 2020]. Stay-at-home policies have saved lives, but their benefits have not been equally distributed. Among essential workers, many of whom are people of color, sheltering-in-place was never a real option.

Take a step back and compare what we are experiencing to what happened in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Before effective treatments became available, we watched in horror as a contagious but preventable disease ravaged young adults in the prime of their lives. It claimed the lives of thousands of working-age adults every month. While too many still become infected, and too many die, public health messaging helped ease the epidemic. Now we must deal with COVID-19. For too long, the message has been repeated -- by us and our colleagues, by government officials and the public -- that COVID-19 is dangerous for the old and that younger people do well. It's true that deaths among adults ages 25 to 44 account for fewer than 3 percent of COVID-19 deaths in the United States, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.

But what we believed before about the relative harmlessness of COVID-19 among younger adults has simply not been borne out by emerging data. In the past, it took us too long to respond to the epidemics of opioids and HIV/AIDS when the young started dying in large numbers. Now that we have similar information about COVID-19, we must immediately address it.

We need to amend our messaging and our policies now. Outreach in the coming weeks and months is imperative. We know it can help. The use of lifesaving medications like methadone and buprenorphine increased after awareness of the devastation of the opioid epidemic became commonly understood, saving many lives. We need to tell young people that they are at risk and that they need to wear masks and make safer choices about social distancing.

This is even more important now that safe and effective vaccines are a reality. Young, healthy people are low on the priority list for the vaccine rollout. That means that modifying behavior now can save thousands of young lives next year [2021]. And that is the crux of it. Our messaging is no longer about merely flattening the curve to prevent hospitals from overflowing. Now with vaccines, our policies and our individual choices can together save a far larger number of lives. That challenge is ours to confront. The sooner that reality sets in, the better.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a marked increase in all-cause deaths in the US, mostly among older adults./1 Although the burden of COVID-19 among hospitalized younger adults has been described, fewer data focus on mortality in this demographic, owing to lower case-fatality rates./2

"Excess mortality reflects the full burden of the pandemic that may go uncaptured due to uncoded COVID-19 and other pandemic-related deaths. Accordingly, we examined all-cause excess mortality and COVID-19-related mortality during the early pandemic period among adults aged 25 to 44 years. Because unintentional drug overdoses are the usual leading cause of death in this demographic, COVID-19 deaths were compared with unintentional opioid deaths.

"Methods
"To determine excess mortality (the gap between observed and expected deaths), projected monthly expected deaths for 2020 were calculated by applying autoregressive integrated moving averages to US population and mortality counts (2015-2019)./3 We examined 2020 population and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages for each of the 10 US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions, which comprise the entire US and are the smallest subdivisions for which 2020 age-stratified COVID-19 mortality data are currently available from the National Center for Health Statistics. Population covariates were used to calculate 95% CIs for expected deaths.

"Observed all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality (coded as either "underlying cause" or "multiple cause" of death) for [1 Mar to 31 Jul 2020], were obtained from provisional National Center for Health Statistics data (released [28 Oct 2020])./4 Unintentional opioid overdose death counts (International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 codes X41-X44, Y11-Y15, and T40.0-6) for the corresponding period of 2018 (the most recently available data) were assembled for each HHS region./3 Incident rates per 100 000 person-months with 95% CIs were calculated for COVID-19 and unintentional opioid deaths using SAS, version 9.4. Statistical significance was defined as a 95% CI that excluded the null value.

"This study used publicly available data and was not subject to institutional review approval.

"Results
"From 1 Mar to 31 Jul 2020], a total of 76 088 all-cause deaths occurred among US adults aged 25 to 44 years, which was 11 899 more than the expected 64 189 deaths (incident rate ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14-1.23]; Table). Nationally, excess mortality occurred in every month of the study period and overall in every HHS region (Table and eTable in the Supplement [see source URL]). Among adults aged 25 to 44 years, 4535 COVID-19 deaths were recorded, accounting for 38% (95% CI, 32%-48%) of the measured excess mortality.

"During surges in HHS Region 2 (New York, New Jersey), the incident rate for all-cause mortality was 2.30 (95% CI, 2.03-2.66) and 80% of deaths were related to COVID-19; during surges in HHS Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas), the incident rate was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.33-1.63) and 48% were related to COVID-19; and during surges in HHS Region 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada), the incident rate was 1.47 (95% CI, 1.36-1.59) and 40% were attributed to COVID-19.

"In contrast, from March through July of 2018, a total of 10 347 unintentional opioid deaths occurred among US adults aged 25 to 44 years. Deaths due to COVID-19 exceeded 2018 unintentional opioid deaths during 1 month in 2020 in HHS Region 2 (April), HHS region 6 (July), and HHS region 9 (July), and either exceeded (HHS Region 6) or were similar to (HHS Regions 2 and 9) unintentional opioid deaths during the entire study period (Table).

"Discussion
"The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in all-cause mortality among US adults aged 25 to 44 years from March through July of 2020. In 3 HHS regions, COVID-19 deaths were similar to or exceeded unintentional opioid overdoses that occurred during several corresponding months of 2018.

"Only 38% of all-cause excess deaths in adults aged 25 to 44 years recorded during the pandemic were attributed directly to COVID-19. Although the remaining excess deaths are unexplained, inadequate testing in this otherwise healthy demographic likely contributed. These results suggest that COVID-19-related mortality may have been underdetected in this population.

"This study has limitations. The provisional data used represent lower-bound estimates due to reporting lags, necessitating future updates. Additionally, although COVID-19 deaths exceeded unintentional opioid deaths in 2018 in some areas, it is possible that simultaneous increases in opioid deaths may have occurred during the pandemic period, making it less clear which of these 2 diseases represents the current leading cause of death among younger adults in areas experiencing COVID-19 surges."

The complete article, tables, supplement, and references are available at the source URL. The data above are confirming the anecdotal reports of increased mortality in this younger age group. As well stated, the need for targeted messaging on NPIs (nonpharmaceutical interventions) and vaccines to overcome potential vaccine hesitancy is clearly there. - Mod.MPP]

PRO/EAFR: COVID-19 update (181): Nigeria, increase 20201217.8025741
Date: Thu 17 Dec 2020
Source: Premium Times [edited]
https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/431662-coronavirus-nigeria-reaches-new-height-in-daily-infections.html



The 2nd wave of COVID-19 appears to have hit Nigeria as the country on [Wed 16 Dec 2020] recorded its highest daily number of cases with 930 new infections. The country reached a new height in infections just 5 days after recording its previous highest daily figures of 796. Until the resurgence of the infections in December [2020], Nigeria never had a higher number of daily infections than the 745 reported on [19 Jun 2020].

The country's total fatalities to the disease remain 1200 as no new deaths were reported on [Wed 16 Dec 2020].

For about 2 weeks, daily cases in the country averaged 500 for the 1st time since the pandemic reached Nigeria in late February [2020]. The total number of infections in the country has now increased to 75 062.

The rising numbers put the nation on the precipice of what could be its worst stretch to date in the pandemic with the spread in infections still concentrated in the country's 2 hardest-hit cities - Abuja and Lagos. But despite the spike, millions of citizens believe the nation had seen the worst of the coronavirus, hence they lowered their guards with the authorities also lax in enforcing control measures.

A majority of about 50 Nigerians engaged online by PREMIUM TIMES for their opinions on a 2nd wave of the virus believe the worst was over, hence the safety protocols are more or less, a mere protocol.

As a consequence of the resurgence, hospitalization is increasing with hundreds of new COVID-19 patients being admitted to hospitals in the past few days. Active cases in the country rose from about 3000 to over 5000 due to a rise in new infections.

Of the over 75 000 infections recorded in Nigeria, 66 775 patients have been discharged from hospitals after treatment. This is according to an update [Wed 16 Dec 2020] night by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The 930 new cases were reported from 22 states. They are Lagos (279), FCT (179), Plateau (62), Kaduna (54), Kano (52), Katsina (52), Imo (42), Jigawa (42), Rivers (38), Kwara (30), Nasarawa (19), Yobe (15), Ogun (13), Borno (10), Oyo (9), Niger (9), Ebonyi (6), Bauchi (6), Edo (5), Taraba (4), Sokoto (2), and Cross River (2). Again, Lagos and Abuja led with 279 and 179 new cases respectively on [Wed 16 Dec 2020].

Bracing for a 2nd wave, the Nigerian government has ordered the reopening of all isolation and treatment centers in the country.

The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has also made a "passionate appeal" to Nigerians to take the COVID-19 prevention advisories very seriously, especially during the Yuletide festivities. This, the doctors said, is necessary to interrupt the transmission, reduce ill-health and deaths from the dreaded disease as "we await" the certification of a vaccine for global usage.

The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has also advised Nigerians to suspend their Christmas and New Year travels to reduce the risk of contracting the virus.

[The ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak in Nigeria has reached the highest recorded daily number of confirmed cases with 930 reported. The number of reported fatalities is 1200. Lagos remains the epicenter of the outbreak. Up till now, Nigeria has tested only 864 104 of its 200 million population. It is also possible that only severe cases are being reported with the mild or asymptomatic cases being missed. There is a need to step up testing and risk communication in the country. - Mod.AA

Union minister for health and family welfare Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the country has "sustained a very high recovery rate along with rapidly declining active cases & low mortality rate."

India reported 24 021 new Covid-19 cases and 355 new fatalities on [Thu 17 Dec 2020] taking the national toll to 9 956 557 total infections and 144 451 fatalities overall. The current active case load in the country is 322 366 patients, accounting for 3.24% of the total positive cases, the ministry said.

The trend of daily recoveries exceeding the daily new infections continues as India recorded 33 291 recoveries in the past 24 hours as against 24 021 new infections. A total of 10 states and Union Territories have contributed to 75.63% of these recoveries, the ministry said. With 5728 patients recovered, Kerala leads the number of recoveries followed by Maharashtra with 3887 patients and West Bengal with 2767 patients -- in the last 24 hours.

Another set of 10 states and UTs [Union Territories] contributed to 78.27% of the new cases reported in India in the last 24 hours, the ministry noted. Kerala also tops the list in the number of daily cases reported, with 6185 infections. West Bengal and Chhattisgarh follow with 2293 and 1661 cases, respectively.

Maharashtra has topped the list of states with maximum daily case fatalities reported with 95 deaths in the past 24 hours followed by West Bengal and Delhi with 46 and 32 deaths respectively.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (234 152), Brazil (68 832), UK (35 383), and Germany (30 951) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 13 122 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (16-17 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (15 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, Germany, Russia (28 214), Turkey (27 515), India (26 762), Spain (23 067), France (18 254), Italy (18 233), Netherlands (12 779), Colombia (12 196), Ukraine (12 047), Poland (11 953), and Mexico (11 799). A total of 62 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 62 countries reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.0%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.9%. [These calculations are reflecting the addition of 1.7 million backlogged cases from Turkey last week). The USA has increased both newly confirmed cases (5.5%) and reported deaths (8.1%).

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with over 745 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.MPP]
