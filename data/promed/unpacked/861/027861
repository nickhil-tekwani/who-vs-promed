TRICHINELLOSIS, PORCINE - USA (MARYLAND) (02): COMMENT
*****************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Date: 21 Jul 2006
From: Guy Hohenhaus <HohenhGS@mda.state.md.us>

Thank you for publishing the report of the trichinellosis cases associated
with the farm in Maryland (ProMED 19 Jul 2006). I agree with the moderator
regarding the high quality of the Baltimore Sun article and that we are
sometimes victims of our own successes in controlling this insidious
parasite. However, I wish the ProMED moderator in subsequent comments had
exercised the same level of journalistic rigor as the Sun.
Commercial pork produced indoors with proper husbandry and hygiene, along with
restrictions on garbage feeding, effective rodent control, and various
surveillance methods has largely eliminated the organism from pork worldwide
produced under those conditions. Those same "modern" husbandry practices were
largely responsible for the rapid disappearance of cysticercosis in Europe
following the Second World War.ï¿½
The low rates of human trichinellosis consistently reported in the US are
largely a result of a very low prevalence of the parasite in the vast majority
of the pork supply coupled with typical thorough cooking practiced in the US.
They are also, as suggested by the moderator, a result of the generally mild
nature (subclinical) of most human infections and no doubt some missed
diagnoses. Without question, one of the most successful public health
education campaigns in US history has been teaching people to properly cook
pork products.
Backyard (meaning "not commercial", outdoor, unrestricted access to rodents,
etc.) producers account for a small but significant fraction of the pork
supply in the US. I agree with the moderator that the parasite is more common
than many in the US would like to believe. I take issue with the assertion
that Maryland Agricultural officials are "whistling" for any reason pertaining
to trichinellosis, now or in the past. The Maryland Department of Agriculture
takes the situation very seriously and have singly and in concert with other
agencies made use of every regulatory and legal tool at our disposal to
protect animal and public health, correct the situations on the farm and
adjoining properties, perform our statutory mission, and ensure respect for
and compliance with due process as required by law.
This investigation and remediation response involves multiple agencies at each
of the 3 levels of government, as there are numerous issues involving both
single and multiple jurisdictions. The level and effectiveness of interagency
cooperation can be held out as a model to other jurisdictions faced with a
complex regulatory challenge.
Contrary to the suggestion advanced by the moderator, The Maryland Department
of Agriculture has made no assertion that live pigs and/or pork products did
not leave the property prior to the initial quarantine of 1 Apr 2006. The
owner operated an on-farm slaughter facility that butchered swine among other
animals. It is extremely likely that pork products left the property prior to
April 2006. Despite the well-reported, relatively free movement of swine on
and off the property (because the owner has thus far failed to effect
meaningful repairs to a perimeter fence in violation of the quarantine order),
we strongly believe pork products are not likely to have left the property
since the quarantine was imposed, nor have potentially infected pigs been
marketed by the owner.
The moderator is a highly respected member of my profession and indeed the
greater public health and biomedical communities. People in science, academia
and regulatory affairs (including this author) as well as the general public
often look to persons such as the moderator as a definitive and knowledgeable
source for information. We place trust and credibility in the words of such
authorities. Persons in those positions of intellectual trust have a much
higher than usual burden to choose their words wisely lest they
unintentionally mislead those readers who largely suspend healthy skepticism
when considering such authoritative commentary. The burden of caution tends
to increase with the size and nature of the audience -- such as ProMED-mail,
since the potential to do harm is greater.
The State of Maryland has longstanding, current, and active programs to
prevent, detect, and control diseases of swine in general and diseases
pertaining to garbage feeding in particular. We carefully regulate garbage
feeding and a Maryland Grand Jury recently handed down indictments against the
owner in question for that charge. We are full and active participants with
the US Department of Agriculture in its surveillance efforts for garbage
feeding and long before this case arose began an initiative to enlist the
assistance of local health departments in order to expand our garbage feeding
surveillance efforts. That the infections ever came to light was the result
of outstanding interagency cooperation and smart, diligent and aggressive work
by veterinary investigators of this Department and the many in support from
outside it. It not the work of an agency wishing to deny a problem or conceal
it.
While we understand the feeling that this investigation and possible punitive
actions are taking a long time, we hope those same parties understand that
this is a complex regulatory situation with equally complex legal issues.
Editorial speculation from those at the sideline is not a substitute for the
facts in the case as they are known by the officials charged with the
investigation. Such speculation, especially in a format such as ProMED-mail,
is not helpful and in many cases harmful. All the agencies are working
together with the resources available in very deliberate effort that we
believe will resolve the issues at hand to protect human and animal health.

[We thank Dr. Hohenhaus for his comments, congratulatory and critical. I would
remind him that I did not dispute his comments about no animals leaving the
farm after the problems had been identified. That is the least one would
expect of his excellent agency and people. However, that infected animals may
have been sold before 1 Apr 2006 had to be pointed out because he had not done
so. And if this had been a long-standing problem -- they usually are with
farms such as this -- one should be aware of the risk and the possible need
for a retrospective re-examination of patients with similar symptoms. If he
was embarrassed by my comments, I am sorry. Having worked for Agriculture
Canada, the UK Ministry of Agriculture, and FAO I am not insensitive to the
complexities, problems, and conflicts of inter-departmental collaboration. I
have been down on the sand in that arena. I would point out that when I
submitted this report for posting it went quietly in parallel to a number of
senior state veterinarians with the advice that maybe they should revisit this
generic problem in each of their dioceses.
That US and Canadian pork products are so safe today owes much to the vertical
integration of this industry and the high efficiency of the now few companies
involved who have to maintain profits for the shareholders in the face of
very, very narrow margins. Their high productivity has driven out of business
the medium and small producers, leaving just the marginal and hobbyists. And
with that came the reduction in infection exposures of a public that now views
cheap, wholesome food as a right, not a privilege. In many ways it parallels
the Public Health benefits starting in the 19th Century from piped water,
water closets, and proper sewage management. Others have played their very
significant parts, certainly, but pig farms today are nothing like what I knew
when I qualified in 1960. Unfortunately, marginal farms, such as this one in
Maryland, can cause problems out of all proportion to their economic worth.
And they need constant watching, for which we thank Dr. Hohenhaus and his
colleagues in Maryland and in the other states & provinces. - Mod.MHJ]
