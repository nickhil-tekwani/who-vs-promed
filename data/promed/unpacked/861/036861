Week 47 : 19 Nov 2012-25 Nov 2012 - Summary
-------------------------------------------
Generally low influenza activity in Europe, but more countries are reporting increasing ILI [influenza-like illness] or ARI [acute respiratory infection] rates.

Levels of influenza activity in the WHO European Region remain low, but more countries are reporting increasing rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) than in the previous week. Sporadic detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and type B continue to be reported, almost exclusively in the north-western part of the Region. The number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is stable, with very few cases testing positive for influenza to date.

Weekly influenza surveillance overview -- week 47/2012 (19-25 Nov 2012)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In week 47/2012, all 28 countries reporting experienced low-intensity activity of influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection.
- Of 519 sentinel specimens tested across 23 countries, only 16 (3.1 percent) were positive for influenza virus.
- No hospitalised laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were reported.
- The number of reported detections of respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) have risen substantially since week 42, as usually happens at this time of year.

Although the proportion of positive sentinel specimens has increased slightly since the early weeks of the season, there is currently little evidence of sustained influenza virus transmission in EU/EEA [European Union/European Economic Area] countries.

Much of the clinical influenza activity is probably due to other respiratory pathogens including RSV.

[Overall there is some indication that the winter influenza season in Europe is approaching. As yet there is no indication that any novel influenza viruses have made their appearance. The number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection is stable, with very few cases testing positive for influenza to date. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) isolations are increasing and RSV may be the predominant respiratory pathogen in circulation at the present time. - Mod.CP]
