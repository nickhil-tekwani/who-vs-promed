Ambon; Outbreak of Rabies Involving Mainly Children
---------------------------------------------------
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) expressed grave concern
over the ongoing epidemic of rabies in Maluku island of Ambon, where
the victims are mostly children. As of Mon 22 Sep 2003, at least 540
cases of rabies had been reported and 11 people, mostly children, had
died.
Coordinator of UNICEF's Ambon branch Willy Kumurur said here on Mon
22 Sep 2003 that the children in Maluku province were facing a number
of problems. "[Conditions have] prompted UNICEF to cooperate with the
Maluku provincial government in the area of health and educational
programs," he said. However, since the rabies cases in Ambon are the
responsibility of the World Health Organization (WHO), he stated that
the UNICEF had no competence to do so.

Ambon: Suspected Outbreak of Rabies
-----------------------------------
A sudden and unprecedented outbreak of (still suspected) rabies has
caused the death of 6 persons in Ambon since 28 Aug 2003. 9 others
are being treated for the same disease. Local health authorities have
issued a number of preventive measures to be taken by the residents
of Ambon and nearby islands.
The Moluccas have always been free of rabies. But the rhabdovirus
[rabies virus is a member of the genus _Lyssavirus_ of the family
_Rhabdoviridae_. - Mod.CP] may have been brought in with dogs
imported from Kupang or Kendari to meet the shortage of dog meat --
which is a favourite dish for Moluccans, locally called "erwe".
[Properly cooked dog meat would not constitute a source of rabies
infection for humans or other canines. Transmission of infection
would have occurred by contact between dogs imported for culinary
purposes and indigenous domestic or wild dogs (or cats). - Mod.CP]

Ambon : Rabies Still Spreading
------------------------------
The number of victims of dog bites on the island of Ambon has risen
to 540, among whom 200 have been identified as infected by rabies
[virus]. The death toll over the last 2 months is 11 persons, as
declared by the head of the Moluccas medical department, Ristinato
Sugiono. The latest victim died the day before yesterday, a
55-year-old woman from the village of Hative Kecil, who had been
bitten 2 months ago and thus was beyond medical help. Meanwhile
appropriate medicine and vaccine are available. Town Mayor Jopie
Papilaya has ordered the killing or chaining of all dogs and cats.
However, from our own observations, we can see many of these animals
still freely running about in town.

[This tragic incident seems to be a consequence of unwitting
introduction of rabies virus-infected dogs into an island previously
free of rabies, whose human population (especially children) had no
awareness of potential risk from close contact with unvaccinated dogs
and cats. The second report suggests that rabies virus has not been
identified unequivocally as the cause of the 11 deaths, whereas the
third report states directly that 200 of the 540 persons suffering
dog bites have been identified as infected by rabies virus. Further
information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
