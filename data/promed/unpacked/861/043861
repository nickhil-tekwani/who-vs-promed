Abstract
--------
Survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection frequently experience lingering neurological symptoms, including impairment in attention, concentration, speed of information processing and memory. This long-COVID cognitive syndrome shares many features with the syndrome of cancer therapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). Neuroinflammation, particularly microglial reactivity and consequent dysregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and oligodendrocyte lineage cells, is central to CRCI. We hypothesized that similar cellular mechanisms may contribute to the persistent neurological symptoms associated with even mild SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection. Here, we explored neuroinflammation caused by mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection - without neuroinvasion - and effects on hippocampal neurogenesis and the oligodendroglial lineage. Using a mouse model of mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection induced by intranasal SARS-CoV-2 delivery, we found white matter-selective microglial reactivity, a pattern observed in CRCI. Human brain tissue from 9 individuals with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits the same pattern of prominent white matter-selective microglial reactivity. In mice, pro-inflammatory CSF cytokines/chemokines were elevated for at least 7-weeks post-infection; among the chemokines demonstrating persistent elevation is CCL11, which is associated with impairments in neurogenesis and cognitive function. Humans experiencing long-COVID with cognitive symptoms (48 subjects) similarly demonstrate elevated CCL11 levels compared to those with long-COVID who lack cognitive symptoms (15 subjects). Impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, decreased oligodendrocytes and myelin loss in subcortical white matter were evident at 1 week, and persisted until at least 7 weeks, following mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. Taken together, the findings presented here illustrate striking similarities between neuropathophysiology after cancer therapy and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and elucidate cellular deficits that may contribute to lasting neurological symptoms following even mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[@ Eric Topol - "In a nutshell, this study illustrates that respiratory-only mild SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to detrimental changes in the brain, likely mediated by inflammatory factors. Similar neuropathobiology may be shared in chemo-brain, post-ICU syndrome and ME/CFS. This study also opens up all kinds of questions and possibilities. For example, therapies that can 1) block inflammatory cytokines, 2) block inducers of such cytokines, or 3) reset reactive microglia can be considered for future clinical trials. "

[2] Self isolation reduced to 5 days

This announcement follows the reduction of the self-isolation period in December [2021] from 10 days to 7, with negative tests on days 6 and 7. From [Mon 17 Jan 2022], those who have negative lateral flow tests on days 5 and 6 will be able to leave self-isolation on the 6th day.

A recent study from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine's Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) looked at this 'test to release' strategy (not yet peer-reviewed). [Quilty BJ, Pulliam JRC, Pearson CAB. Test to release from isolation after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. medRxiv 2022.01.04.21268372; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.04.21268372]

Billy Quilty, research fellow at LSHTM, explains this research and reacts to the news: "Since early in the pandemic, public health authorities have asked people with COVID19 symptoms or who test positive to isolate for 10 days. This was necessary to avert the worst of the pandemic, as curbing transmission led to lower cases, which in turn lowered the rate of new hospitalisations, thus limiting the demands on the healthcare service and ensuring that the standard of care could be kept as high as possible.

"With the recent rapid spread of omicron, the goal remains the same, but has brought new challenges. High prevalence has led to a substantial number of individuals isolating simultaneously, which poses a threat to the running of key services including the health service, this time on the supply side.

"Meanwhile, we have seen lateral flow antigen tests (LFTs) become widely accessible in countries such as the UK, which allow people to rapidly assess whether they are currently infectious or not. The development of tools such as these mean we can now gain and use information we didn't have previously to reassess our approach to managing the pandemic and limit harms holistically.

"We therefore decided to model whether we could use LFTs to reduce the duration of the isolation period by requiring one or more days of negative tests to release. Our preliminary analysis found that requiring at least 2 days of negative tests reduces the risk of transmission from individuals leaving isolation to low levels, regardless of the initial wait, as individuals are unlikely to have infectious viral loads following 2 negative tests.

"Therefore, we estimate that there is low risk associated with reducing the isolation period to 5 days with a policy of 2 tests to release. By allowing those who are no longer infectious to leave isolation early, we can address the issue of staffing absences and reduce the strain on the healthcare system and other key parts of the economy.

"The major limitation of our study is that there is limited data on how viral load changes over the course of someone's infection with omicron, which will determine how infectious they are and how long they test positive for, so we used pre-omicron data. Studies are ongoing to investigate whether this has significantly changed for omicron, which we will incorporate into our analysis once it becomes available."

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20JAN16_1642448282.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative totals reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JAN16WORLD7_1642448298.pdf. It is from this table that the following commentary was derived.

In the past 24 hours, 28 countries -- the USA (331 250), France (278 129), India (257 063), Italy (157 465), Australia (79 131), the UK (70 160), Argentina (65 241), Turkey (54 100), Germany (45 287), Philippines (37 017), The Netherlands (36 231), Colombia (32 317), Portugal (32 271), Brazil (31 229), Russia (29 230), Denmark (24 555), Bolivia (23 611), Canada (19 642), Mexico (19 132), Israel (18 501), Vietnam (15 684), Austria (15 419), Poland (14 661), Serbia (11 248), Ecuador (11 090), Uruguay (12 574), Greece (10 783), and Ireland (10 753) -- all reported more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3963 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 14 Jan 2022 to late 15 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 73 countries reported over 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 39 of the 73 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the South East Asia region, and 11 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 24.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 13.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 19.8% increase in daily reported cases and an 18.9% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Over 1 900 000 newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours, and there are now over 328.77 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.55 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
