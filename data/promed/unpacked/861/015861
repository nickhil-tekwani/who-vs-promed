Outbreak of multidrug-resistant Salmonella infections linked to contact with pig ear dog treats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ serotypes I 4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport, and London infections linked to contact with pig ear dog treats. As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.

Total / 127

Illnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Predicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.

During the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.

Additional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.

Some of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.

On [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.

Information collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.

This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.

As a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5] 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.
