The results of additional testing by the National Institute for Virology
(South Africa), now confirm 5 cases of Marburg fever [in the Democratic
Republic of Congo. Samples from 10 suspected cases have been collected and
tested. Three confirmed cases had been reported previously. The two
additional cases died on 1 May and 14 May 1999. An active surveillance
system is in place and selected staff from the coordination committee*
remain on-site to monitor events.
To date, 72 suspected cases of VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever based on a
revised case definition have been reported.
The exact number of deaths due to VHF has not been established, owing to
the lack of precise information about the clinical picture of those who
have died during the past several months. According to some reports, over
60 deaths had been attributed to the disease, but it is currently
difficult, and may be impossible, to determine accurately the proportion
due to haemorrhagic fever. All 5 confirmed Marburg cases have died.
One case was a woman who died on 7 May. She reportedly had lived 20-30 km
from Durba, and preliminary investigation has not established a link with
other haemorrhagic fever cases or with mining activities. Additional data
about this case are being collected.
On 17 May, the National Institute for Virology (South Africa) reported the
confirmation of the third Marburg case, a miner who died on 13 May. This
is the first death in a miner, linking Marburg fever with the cluster of
deaths previously reported among the gold miners. The outbreak has featured
unusual deaths among young men, the majority of whom were involved in
mining activities in Durba. There have also been reports from several
families of chains of transmission, including a significant number of
deaths. On 10 May, a survivor of a similar outbreak which took place in
1994 was confirmed positive for IgG against Marburg virus by the National
Institute for Virology (South Africa).
A broad serological survey among the population of the affected area
(approx. 1 000 persons) began on 17 May, and an isolation unit was set up
in Watsa (in addition to the one in Durba). Control efforts are now
focusing on finding active and convalescent cases to obtain laboratory
confirmation of the diagnosis of VHF, and tracking contacts. Investigations
will also aim to determine the original source of the outbreak and risk
factors, to follow up on reports of deaths from VHF and to document
secondary transmission. Cases are being actively followed up in Durba, and
an intensive public information campaign is under way. The surveillance and
advance warning systems in the province are being reinforced. In addition,
an ecological team has started collecting specimens from animals for
virological studies.
* The coordination committee is composed of experts from: the Ministry of
Health and local health authorities; WHO headquarters and the African
Region; UNDP; Medecins sans frontieres (Belgium and Holland); Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (United States); Institut Pasteur (France,
French Guiana and Madagascar); Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium).
The ecological team is composed of experts from: the National Institute for
Virology (South Africa) and the Pest Infection Laboratory (Denmark).

[Note that convalescent-phase serum samples are being collected in order to
provide more confirmed diagnoses. This indicates that single serum samples
can provide results useful in making presumptive diagnosis but not confrmed
diagnoses. Quite right. - Mod.CHC
