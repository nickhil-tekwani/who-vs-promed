According to Doctors Without Borders, 6600 children have died of measles since January of 2019. The agency fears the measles outbreak will be put on the backburner in efforts to curb COVID-19 spread.

At the best of times, it's a challenge to get infants inoculated in a country wracked with poverty, poor roads and violence.

"Just getting the vaccinations, they've got a weak healthcare system; you've got fighting and insecurity; you've got logistical challenges, and on their roads you've got to use motorcycles," says Joe Belliveau who is the executive director of the organization's Canadian chapter.

And an Ebola outbreak in 2018 added another layer of adversity. It meant partners who were supporting vaccination campaigns were turning their focus to the Ebola crisis. Just as the Ebola crisis was dying down, the COVID-19 catastrophe grew.

"That means we have to take measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. So, it's even more challenging and more limiting to get the teams to where they need to be," Belliveau says.

Doctors Without Borders now fear the fight against measles will be put on the backburner as the pandemic starts to hit the region as it was beginning to make inroads in reducing the spread of extremely infectious disease.

"They can't just have a one-track focus because other diseases are going to catch up to us, and they are going to have a major and deadly effect," says Belliveau. "Right now, that's the point with the measles which is, in Congo, killing far more people than COVID," Belliveau says.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet and can live in an airspace for hours. 50 000 cases have been identified since January 2020.

Despite the challenges, Doctors without Borders has managed to vaccinate 260 000 children since the beginning of the year [2020] and has treated another 17 000 kids.

He says that when villagers see the doctors coming, they get a big welcome. He describes a scenario a couple of months ago in one of the country's northern provinces.

"My colleagues had to get a bunch of motorcycles and had to endure a 6-hour drive on sandy track. And when they arrived, they were literally cheered by the local community."

Unlike with COVID, children under 5 are the most susceptible. He says even if they survive, the children who develop rashes can get eye infections, sometimes so severely they become blind. They can also be left with respiratory complications and a weakened immune system.

As far as the COVID-19 situation in that country stands, Belliveau points out testing is extremely limited. Only the capital city, Kinshasa, has testing capacity.

[Besides the potentially devastating impact of the disease caused by measles virus, especially in children under 5 years, there is the added problem of generalized immune suppression that these infected children experience. The effect can last for several weeks to months or longer after resolution of disease, resulting in increased susceptibility to other infections. Children have generally not had severe symptoms following infection with SARS CoV-2 (with the exception of rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome), but prior measles infection may exacerbate the disease. Doctors in countries with low vaccination rates must keep this in mind.

Measles incidence has been recorded in Kyrgyzstan since the beginning of 2020. To date, a total of 717 cases of measles have been reported, the Health Ministry said.

Measles cases are being registered in Jalal-Abad, Chui, Osh, Batken regions and in Bishkek and Osh cities. The numbers of this infection have decreased significantly since March 2020.

One-year-old children had the highest rates of infection with measles (52.2%); 14.5% refused vaccination, 5.3% had a medical exemption to vaccination; 2.2% were among migrants.

An investigation into a large measles outbreak in Israel's Jerusalem district in 2018 and 2019 revealed challenges with contact tracing and isolating patients, due to high population density, and that vaccination encouragement from rabbis helped turn the tide. The team reported its findings today [7 May 2020] in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) note from the field [see citation below].

The outbreak began following imported cases, mainly from Ukraine, in March 2018 in Central and Northern districts of Israel, but it spread to Jerusalem in August 2018 because of 2 unvaccinated infected people, a 20-year-old boarding school student and a 2-year-old child. The outbreak spread rapidly though densely populated low-income orthodox Jewish neighborhoods where 1st-dose measles vaccine coverage is lower than for children in other communities.

Transmission intensified during the fall Jewish high holidays. Investigators found inadequate adherence to isolation recommendations among patients and their parents and were challenged by high numbers of close contacts to track.

The response also included postexposure prophylaxis and a vaccine campaign that targeted children ages 1-14 years old. High numbers of cases and the impact on young children triggered community concerns, and the rabbi community helped support the vaccine campaign, which encouraged acceptance and compliance with control activities.

Vaccine coverage climbed from 76.3% to 96.8%, and by December 2018, cases dropped considerably, ending in May 2019. The outbreak totaled 4115 cases, about half from Jerusalem.
