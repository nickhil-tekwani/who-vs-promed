MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIA, OUTBREAK? - USA (KANSAS): REQUEST FOR INFO

I am a flight surgeon at a small Air Force base about an hour east of
Kansas City. In the last two months, I have treated 20 cases of pneumonia,
13 of them being lobar on chest x-ray (CXR). Similarly the other providers
have noted a marked increase this year as compared to any other year. In
fact, the radiologist here said it was the first time in his career where
he will go entire days and not see a single normal CXR.
Until the last month, when it was apparent something was going on, I did
little to work them up other than to assume it was atypical pneumonia and
treated them usually with a macrolide. All rapidly improved. Over this
past month, I did [request tests for] cold agglutinins on three of them,
all of which were negative in the acute phase. I now have acute and
convalescent titres on two patients, one seven and the other 15 years old,
that show a rapid rise in IgM for Mycoplasma. Titres are pending on several
more.
The youngest patient has been 3 years old, and ages range up to the 40's.
One patient, a healthy pilot, was seen by another provider. He was treated
for "pneumonia" with IM ceftriaxone and po Augmentin. He was admitted the
next day with a whited out lung and a pulmonary effusion. A little over
half the patients are concentrated into one of three contact groups,
including two sets of siblings, all with lobar pneumonia on CXR.
Since this is obviously much more pneumonia than I or any of my colleagues
have ever seen in a single season, I wonder if other physicians are seeing
an increase in the prevalence of the old "walking pneumonia." Is there a
propensity for this organism to have sporadic cycles of increased
aggressiveness? In the textbooks, I certainly have not seen any
information about outbreaks of Mycoplasma on the order of what we have seen
here.
I will certainly continue to monitor ProMED-mail to see if others have had
experiences similar to ours.
