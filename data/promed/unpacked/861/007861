TOMATO CURLY STUNT VIRUS, TOMATO - SOUTH AFRICA

Tomato curly stunt [begomo]virus has now spread to Trichardtsdal, Limpopo
Province [formerly Northern Province]. This brings it to within 100 km of
Mooketsi, [approximately 275 km northwest of Johannesburg], where [more
than] 65 percent of South Africa's tomatoes are produced. We are extremely
concerned, expecting the virus to reach this area, probably [during the
coming] winter season ... .
To combat the effects of the virus, producers in Mooketsi and Northern
KwaZulu Natal [southeastern South Africa] (in advance of the virus outbreak
areas) are advised to start proactively treating tomato seedlings at
transplanting and at seedling nurseries with imidochlorprid, and to control
whitefly outbreaks with insecticides with [a range of different] active
ingredients.

[The virus was noted on tomato crops in 1997 in South Africa and in 1998
caused considerable crop loss in the Onderburg area. It has yet to be
formally classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
Based on coat protein sequences and the common region of its genome, it
appears to be most closely related to a cluster of Tomato yellow leaf curl
(TYLCV) begomoviruses which include South African cassava mosaic, East
African cassava mosaic and TYLCV-Israel. Management of the disease by
application of insecticidal sprays in Mooketsi and Northern Kwazulu Natal
will have to be prompt in order to decrease the population of the vector
(_Bemisia tabaci_) and thus reduce virus spread. Of more concern, perhaps,
is the possibility that the virus could become established on solanaceous
hosts in those regions, making disease management more difficult. - Mod.DH]
