--------------------------------------------------------------
In the referenced posting, your moderator [EP] asks for any data on
malaria in Mumbai.

Below is a 1 Jun 2011 report from the Times of India for the months
of January to April 2011:

The Times of India (TOI), Times News Network (TNN)
http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-01/pune/29607570_1_malaria-cases-national-malaria-control-strategy-positive-cases

Rise in pre-monsoon malaria cases
---------------------------------
Even before the onset of the monsoon, Maharashtra has recorded over
28 000 cases of malaria. From January to April this year [2011], 28
400 people were found positive for malarial infection -- an increase
of over 8000 cases as compared to the corresponding period last year
[2010] when 20 091 cases were reported.

With 16 833 positive cases and 11 deaths due to malaria in the last 4
months, Mumbai continues to bear the highest burden of the disease in
the state followed by Thane (709 cases) and Kalyan (182 cases).

"Climactic conditions with temperature up to 30 deg C [86 deg F] and
a humidity level above 70 percent are favourable for
mosquito-breeding. Such conditions prevailed on most days in the last
4 months in Mumbai.

That is one of the reasons why there was a higher number of malaria
cases during the pre-monsoon period," Ashok Bhosale, entomological
consultant to the state government on malaria told TOI [Times of
India] on Monday [30 May 2011].

[ProMED-mail thanks Ronan Kelly for the article in the Times of India
from 1 Jun 2011.

The data do show a clear increase in the number of cases with 40
percent. It would still be interesting to have a comment from the
authorities as to why construction sites are repeatedly singled out as
the source and the high transmission in slum areas is not discussed.
