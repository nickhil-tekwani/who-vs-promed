There is a risk that Danish herds are infected with the severe disease caused by Schmallenberg virus [SBV].

The new virus, SBV, which has caused -- since autumn [2011] -- problems in ruminants in several European countries, [was] found in insects in Denmark [in 2011]. Thus, there is also increased risk that the Danish herds may have been infected with the severe disease. Farmers have already been warned to pay attention and to inform their veterinarians if cases of malformations in newborn animals appear.

[The above information has also been published by the Danish National Veterinary Institute, which clarified that the SBV-infected culicoides were captured in NSW in October 2011; the midges are not found in Denmark during the winter. See at http://www.vet.dtu.dk/Nyheder_fra_instituttet.aspx?guid={A49B4807-49FD-419B-9210-3F9640B19C60}.

As far as is known, no cases of arthrogryposis or hydranencephaly have been reported from Denmark so far. SBV is assumed to affect foeti of ruminants in a pattern similar to that of its close relative, Akabane virus. During experimental Akabane virus studies carried out in the past in Japan in pregnant cattle, it was shown that the type of calf abnormality is dependent on the gestational age of the fetus with hydroencephaly seen at 76-104 days and arthrogryposis at 103-174 days gestation. - Mod.AS
