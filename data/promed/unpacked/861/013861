Animals sold from Cumbrian dairy herd tested positive for bovine TB
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 2 animals sold from the Penrith dairy herd at the centre
of a bovine tuberculosis (TB) outbreak have tested positive for the
disease and been destroyed, it has emerged. Government vets have
traced around 100 animals from Plumpton Head Farm, sold in the months
before the outbreak was discovered. 2 of them at farms in the Penrith
area have reacted to skin tests.

David Wild, regional operations director for Animal Health North
West, said that all cattle on the 2 farms where the reactors were
found will now be tested. But as the source of the infection is known,
he said, the latest development should not add to farmers' concern. He
added: "The animals were removed straight away from the affected
farms. We still have to follow the testing regime on these farms to
make sure those traced animals did not spread it on those farms."

News of the latest development came as Environment Secretary Caroline
Spelman announced plans to push ahead with a badger cull in 2 bovine
TB hotspots in the South West. She told Parliament on Tuesday [19 Jul
2011] that the Government was "strongly minded" to allow a science-led
cull of badgers in the worst affected areas.

Nearly 25 000 cattle were slaughtered in England in 2010 because of
bovine TB, which cost the country BP 90m [USD 146 709 00].

Farmers and landowners could be licensed to carry out controlled
shooting of badgers as part of the Bovine TB Eradication Programme in
areas of at least 150 square kilometers [58 square miles].

Mrs Spelman said: "Bovine TB will cost us BP 1 bn [USD 1 630 100 011]
over the next decade in England alone if we don't take more action.
First we need to stop the disease spreading even further. Then we need
to bring it under control and ultimately eradicate it." She said the
Government was investing BP 20 m [USD 3 260 200] over the next 5 years
to develop a vaccine for cattle and badgers. But she added that a
vaccine was still a long way off and the country could not afford to
wait for it.

Badger control licences would be issued by Natural England under the
Protection of Badgers Act of 1992 to enable groups of farmers and
landowners to reduce badger populations at their own expense. It is
unlikely that any culling would be carried out in Cumbria, which is
relatively free of bovine TB.

She also announced that compensation payments for reactor animals
from herds where TB tests are significantly overdue would be reduced,
while enforcement of TB surveillance and control requirements will be
strengthened.

A 9-week stakeholder consultation on the plans will end on 19 Sep
2011.

Robert Craig, NFU Cumbria county chairman, said: "Cumbria has been
relatively free from bovine TB but the recent outbreak in the Penrith
area shows how it is as much an issue for Cumbria as it is for Devon
and Cornwall. Tackling the disease where it has become established is
vitally important to make sure it does not become established in this
county."

The Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency has renewed its
appeal for the public to report any dead badgers or deer found in a
large area surrounding Plumpton Head. Contact the AHVLA office or a
local vet.
