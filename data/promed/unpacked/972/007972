Public health officials are investigating several cases of pertussis (whooping cough) that have occurred in Transylvania County [North Carolina] in recent months. 5 cases have been confirmed since January [2015].

Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the mouth, nose, and throat. Symptoms usually begin with cold- or flu-like symptoms such as a runny nose, mild cough, watery eyes, sneezing, and a low-grade fever. The cough becomes worse and often includes rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched whoop; the cough can be severe enough to break a person's rib or cause vomiting.

Transylvania County Department of Public Health is working to find any links between the cases and identify people who have had contact with the sick individuals in order to control the spread of the disease. In late 2014, the county had 31 confirmed cases of pertussis and followed up with more than 450 individuals who had possibly been exposed to the disease.

All of the cases in 2015 have been in infants 7 months of age and younger, and 2 of these children have been hospitalized. Infants and young children have a higher risk for serious whooping cough, and are more likely to experience serious illness and complications, such as pneumonia, encephalitis and seizures.

One of the children diagnosed with pertussis was a 4-week-old [girl]. After she developed a cough, she was tested for both RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and pertussis at her pediatrician's office. "She didn't really have a 'whoop' like you hear about," [her mother] said, "But you don't always have that at such a young age." The RSV test was positive, so she was taken to Mission Children's Hospital in Asheville [North Carolina] to begin treatment. Then, the pertussis test results also came back positive. "It was scary," [her mother] said. "She's 4 weeks old. She's little. There's not much you can do."

Suction helped to clear the mucus from [girl's] airways. She and the rest of her family were put on a course of antibiotics, which are used to control the symptoms and help prevent infected people from spreading the disease.

Because pertussis is so contagious, it is very important for infected people to stay away from others and take the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. "It's miserable and awful, but when they say quarantine, you have to stay home," [her mother] said.

The best way to prevent pertussis is through immunization: the CDC recommends 5 doses of "DTaP" [diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus] for young children beginning at 2 months of age. However, the vaccine's protection only lasts 5-10 years, so additional doses of "Tdap" should be given at age 11 or 12 and as an adult. Pregnant women should receive a dose during each pregnancy to fully protect their newborns.

"It's so important to 'cocoon' very young babies by ensuring that all the people around the baby are up-to-date on their pertussis shots," said Elaine Russell, health director for Transylvania County. "This applies not only to mom and dad, but to anyone who spends any significant time with the baby, like grandparents, siblings, and caregivers."

"These immunizations are almost always covered by health insurance, and people who are uninsured can receive the vaccine for no charge here at the health department," Russell said.

Older children and adults who have been fully immunized can still contract and spread pertussis to others, and because they usually have much milder symptoms, they may not even know they are infected. Good hygiene practices -- like hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick -- will also help prevent the spread of the disease.

[The 4-month-old girl] still has a slight cough, which is to be expected: pertussis is often called the '100-day cough' because that cough can linger for several months.

When it comes to pertussis, [the baby's mother] says that other parents should "take it very seriously. Heed the warnings, the cautions, and keep them protected," she said.

[In the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. The news report above fails to tell us if the 4-month-old child's mother received Tdap during her pregnancy, if those in close contact with the infant were also vaccinated, or who was the suspected source of the infant's infection.
