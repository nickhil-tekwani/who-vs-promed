Scientists from the Southern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (SRDDL), Bangalore, on Friday [20 Apr 2012] visited Henberu hamlet coming under Paduvari Gram Panchayat [local self-governments at the village or small town level] near Byndoor [Udupi district, Karnataka], where 83 heads of cattle died over the last week.

Nagaraj Marvanthe, veterinary officer, Byndoor, told The Hindu that the scientists from the SRDDL had investigated the ailing cattle at the Henberu hamlet and also visited the areas where garbage had been dumped in the village. He said there was no death of any cattle on Friday [20 Apr 2012], but confirmed that 2 head of cattle had fallen sick.

The report on the samples of the dead and ailing cattle sent to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals (IAHVB), Bangalore, was expected in a couple of days. The cause of the deaths would be known only after the report was received, Dr Marvanthe said.

Scientists have diagnosed the cause of cattle deaths at Paduvari at Byndoor in Udupi District, to [clostridial] intoxication. In layman's terms -- severe case of food poisoning.

Byndoor veterinary officer Dr Nagaraj Marvanthe told TOI the tests conducted by the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals (IAHVB), Bangalore had diagnosed it as clostridial intoxication.

This had claimed 83 cattle heads in the village, which has 45 families. As of now there are still 4 cattle ailing with the poisoning symptoms and 2 of them are in a serious condition.

According to scientists this type of food poisoning is rare and they will study this case thoroughly. The village was visited by scientists from Southern Regional Disease Diagnostic laboratory, Dr Sripada, Dr Jayakumar, and Dr Sudharshan along with Udupi animal husbandry deputy director Dr Manjunath.

Sources said foodborne botulism is not an infection but an intoxication since it results from the ingestion of foods that contain the pre-formed clostridial toxin. The toxin is released only after the death of cells [bacteria]. The toxin resists digestion and is absorbed by the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and then into the blood, where it affects neurotransmitters resulting in paralysis. The incubation period is 12-36 hours. Dr Nagaraj said identification takes a lot of tests and hence, time in pinpointing the cause.

He said vaccines were not available in India as in the case of the West and some south Asian countries, for cattle immunisation. With this in mind, preventive measures were important, Dr Nagaraj said. These measures include: avoiding cattle access to animal waste, fencing the grazing area to avoid dumping, avoiding stall feeding, and checking the feed for contamination.

Dr Nagaraj said 400 dairy cattle had died in a California herd in 1998, the reason being unintentional contamination of feed from the carcass of a dead cat. He said government or milk unions should provide fodder to avoid such cases.

[The explanatory notes provided by the report are commendably accurate. One of the common sources of the botulism toxins in cattle is feeding with poultry manure. "A dead cat in the silage" used to be a common expression in veterinary schools; still applicable...

It is puzzling why _Clostridium botulinum_ vaccines (types C and D) for ruminants are not readily available in a cattle empire like India. Certainly, cases such as the described above are not less common there than in other countries, worldwide. - Mod.AS
