Charlie's remarks are spot on. And without even considering the dengue
wild card -- effects of global climate change (both temperature and
precipitation) on distribution of vectors and human population densities.
Alas, we will probably need a significant epidemic in the USA before the
public realizes just how interconnected we really are with the tropics and
before the political process is galvanized into action.
