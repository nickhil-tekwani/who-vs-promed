[Animal Pharm is a publication concerned with the world animal health and
nutrition industry.
The UK has encountered its first known case of a dog infected with
_Escherichia coli_ O157. Fecal testing of the animal took place after a
3-year-old child from the same household was hospitalized with a bacterial
infection and subsequently placed in intensive care after developing
hemolytic uremic syndrome.
The investigation focused on unusual possible sources of the bacterium
because the family was vegetarian. The geriatric, mixed-breed dog became
part of the household some 2 months before the child first developed
symptoms of bloody diarrhea and stomach pains.
The animal was doubly incontinent but, nevertheless, spent most of its time
indoors in close contact with 2 young children.
How the dog became infected with the pathogen remains under investigation.
The animal had been largely immobile and confined indoors for the past
several years. While it is known to have been fed on a variety of cheap,
commercially-prepared dry dog foods for the 2-month period before the
incident, its diet prior to that is less certain and may have consisted, to
some extent, of human food scraps.
Linda Gautier, senior technical officer with the Environmental Health
Department of Basingstoke Council, said that department's investigation was
ongoing. She said the State Veterinary Service was expected to publish a
full report on the case in due course.
The manufacture of pet food in the UK is governed by the same legislation
as other animal feed, including that for food-producing animals.
Alison Walker of the UK Pet Food Manufacturers' Association said commercial
dog foods were typically heated and sterilized more than sufficiently [more
sterile than sterile? to kill bacterial pathogens, including _E. coli_ O157.

[If the geriatric dog was fed raw or undercooked eggs or hamburger meat as
part of the variety of foods, it is a possibility it became infected in
this manner. Incontinent dogs can be managed while inside. However, one
wonders about the close contact of the child and the sanitary conditions
within the home. - Mod.TG
[Gastrointestinal disease due to contact with dogs that carry enteric
pathogens has been well described. _Campylobacter jejuni_ can cause
diarrhea in dogs, and commonly colonizes healthy puppies (Hald, B., and M.
Madsen. 1997. Healthy puppies and kittens as carriers of _Campylobacter_
spp., with special reference to _Campylobacter upsaliensis_. J Clin
Microbiol. 35:3351-2). Transmission of _C. jejuni_ from dogs, particularly
puppies, to humans has resulted in human infection (Skirrow, M. B. 1977.
_Campylobacter_ enteritis: a "new" disease. Br Med J. 2:9-11., Wheeler, W.
E., and J. Borchers. 1961. Vibrionic enteritis in infants. Am J Dis Child.
101:60-6), and contact with dogs has been epidemiologically associated with
_Campylobacter_ infection (Brieseman, M. A. 1990. A further study of the
epidemiology of _Campylobacter jejuni_ infections. N Z Med J. 103:207-9.,
Kapperud, G., E. Skjerve, N. H. Bean, S. M. Ostroff, and J. Lassen. 1992.
Risk factors for sporadic _Campylobacter_ infections: results of a
case-control study in southeastern Norway. J Clin Microbiol. 30:3117-21).
_Salmonella_ species, sometimes multiple serotypes at one time, may
colonize the intestinal tract of dogs. Transmission from dogs to humans has
been reported (Morse, E. V., M. A. Duncan, D. A. Estep, W. A. Riggs, and B.
O. Blackburn. 1976. Canine salmonellosis: A review and report of dog to
child transmission of _Salmonella enteritidis_. Am J Public Health.
66:82-3) as has possible transmission from a human to a dog (Morse, E. V.,
K. W. Kersting, L. E. Smith, Jr., E. P. Myhrom, and D. E. Greenwood. 1978.
Salmonellosis: possible transmission from horse to human to dog of
infection. Am J Public Health. 68:497-9).
_Yersinia enterocolitica_ was transmitted from a bitch and its puppies to
16 people in 4 families, resulting in 2 deaths (Gutman, L. T., E. A.
Ottesen, T. J. Quan, P. S. Noce, and S. L. Katz. 1973. An inter-familial
outbreak of _Yersinia enterocolitica_ enteritis. N Engl J Med. 288:1372-7).
At the case report level, the urease-producing gram-negative bacillus. -
