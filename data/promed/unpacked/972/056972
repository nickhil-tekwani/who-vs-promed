A 20-year-old man who had contracted [a] hantavirus [infection] died yesterday [31 Jan 2014] in the Alejandro Korn Hospital in Melchor Romero, where he had been hospitalized for 10 days as a result of this infectious disease.

The disease had been detected at this time after he had been bitten by a rat in his house [in the Los Hornos neighborhood of La Plata, in Buenos Aires province].

Meanwhile, neighbors of the victim reported that there is a house in the area that is an infectious focus due to the carelessness of its owner. "The woman lives with 3 children, and the house is full of trash and truly is a rat's nest," they stated.

[Although hantavirus transmission from rodent bites does occur, it is more common for the virus infection to be contracted following the inhalation of aerosolized rodent excrement containing the virus.

There have been several cases of hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province during the year just ended (2014), 3 of which have been fatal cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). In the above instance, clearly, public education is essential to prevent rodent populations, the reservoir hosts of the virus, from becoming established in houses and other buildings. The hantaviruses involved in the above and in the previous cases are not identified, and ProMED would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus has been laboratory identified.

Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these 2014 Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but these cases in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
