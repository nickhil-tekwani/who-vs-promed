FDA advises restaurants and retailers not to serve or sell potentially contaminated raw oysters from Canada (April 2022)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The FDA is working with federal, state, and local officials and with Canadian public health authorities regarding a norovirus outbreak linked to raw oysters from British Columbia, Canada (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/public-health-notices/2022/outbreak-norovirus-gastrointestinal-illness-linked-raw-oysters-british-columbia.html). The FDA has confirmed that potentially contaminated raw oysters harvested in the south and central parts of Baynes Sound, British Columbia, Canada, were distributed to restaurants and retailers in CA, CO, FL, HI, IL, MA, MN, NJ, NV, NY, OR, TX, and WA. It is possible that additional states received these oysters through further distribution within the USA.

The FDA and the states conducted a trace forward investigation to determine where the raw oysters were distributed and to ensure they are removed from the food supply. Retailers should not serve raw oysters harvested from the following harvest locations within British Columbia, BC 14-8 and BC 14-15, with harvest starting as early as 31 Jan 2022, which will be printed on product tags. Oysters can cause illness if eaten raw, particularly in people with compromised immune systems. Food contaminated with norovirus may look, smell, and taste normal.

Symptoms of norovirus infection
------------------
People of all ages can get infected and sick with norovirus. The commonest symptoms of norovirus are diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain. Other symptoms include fever, headache, and body ache. A person usually develops symptoms 12-48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1-3 days.

If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day. This can lead to dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Symptoms of dehydration include decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and dizziness when standing up. Children who are dehydrated may cry with few or no tears and be unusually sleepy or fussy. If you think you or someone you are caring for is severely dehydrated, call your healthcare provider.

Anyone who eats raw shellfish is at risk of contracting norovirus. Children under 5, the elderly, and those people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe infections.

What do restaurants and retailers need to do?
----------------------------
Restaurants and retailers should not sell the potentially affected raw oysters. Restaurants and retailers should dispose of any products by throwing them in the garbage or returning to their distributor for destruction. Restaurants and retailers should also be aware that the oysters may be a source of pathogens and should control the potential for cross-contamination of food processing equipment and the food processing environment. They should follow the steps below:
- wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process;
- retailers, restaurants, and other food service operators who have processed and packaged any potentially contaminated products need to be concerned about cross-contamination of cutting surfaces and utensils through contact with the potentially contaminated products;
- retailers that have sold bulk product should clean and sanitize the containers used to hold the product;
- regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of food contact surfaces and utensils used in food preparation may help to minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination.

What do consumers need to do?
----------------------
- People should not eat any raw oysters from the locations listed above. If they have any of the listed products, they should throw them in the garbage.
- People who think they might have become ill from eating possibly contaminated raw oysters should talk to their healthcare providers.
- Consumers should always practice safe food handling and preparation measures. Wash hands, utensils, and surfaces with hot, soapy water before and after handling food.
- For food preparation surfaces and food-cutting utensils that may have come in contact with the potentially contaminated oysters, it is very important that the consumers thoroughly clean these areas and items.
- It is also important to be aware that noroviruses are relatively resistant to heat. They can survive temperatures as high as 145 deg F [63 deg C]. Quick steaming processes that are often used for cooking shellfish may not heat foods enough to kill noroviruses.

To protect yourself and others from norovirus:
- wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water often;
- carefully wash fruits and vegetables before preparing and eating them;
- cook oysters and other shellfish thoroughly before eating them;
- do not prepare food or care for others when you are sick and for at least 2 days after symptoms stop;
- clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces;
- wash contaminated laundry thoroughly.

[This notice is connected to the recent ProMED posts about norovirus infections in Canada related to BC oysters (see in the see alsos below).

The following are myths about oysters (adapted from https://www.fda.gov/food/health-educators/raw-oyster-myths):

Myth: Eating raw oysters are safe if you drown them in hot sauce, which kills everything.
Fact: The active ingredients in hot sauce have no more effect on harmful bacteria than plain water. Nothing but prolonged exposure to heat at a high enough temperature will kill bacteria.

Myth: Avoid oysters from polluted waters and you'll be fine.
Fact: Many pathogens in oysters has nothing to do with pollution. Some harmful bacteria thrive naturally in warm coastal areas (such as the Gulf of Mexico) where oysters live.

Myth: An experienced oyster lover can tell a good oyster from a bad one.
Fact: These pathogens can't be seen, smelled, or even tasted. Don't rely on your senses to decide if an oyster is safe.

Myth: Alcohol kills harmful organisms.
Fact: Alcohol may impair your good judgment, but it doesn't destroy harmful bacteria.

Myth: Eating oysters in months with an "R" in their name is safe.
Fact: Even though cold-weather-harvested oysters are likely somewhat safer, many oysters come from warmer climates and are imported into the colder climate.

Myth: Raw oysters are an aphrodisiac and will cure a hangover.
Fact: There is no scientific evidence that either of these commonly held beliefs is true.
