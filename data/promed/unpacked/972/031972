Smuggled birds raise fears of avian flu spread
----------------------------------------------
The small suitcase being carried through the Brussels airport by the
traveler from Thailand looked unremarkable. But when customs officials
opened it on 18 Oct 2004, they found a surprise: 2 rare small eagles, weak
but healthy-looking, taped inside lengths of PVC pipe.
Their surprise turned to horror when tests on the eagles came back 4 days
later: the smuggled birds were infected with avian influenza H5N1, the
South East Asian virus that health authorities fear could blow up into a
pandemic and kill millions.
The finding launched a frantic hunt for the man who carried the eagles, the
officials who inspected them, and the 135 passengers who shared the man's 2
flights. 23 people were tested; 652 birds that had been in the airport,
including the eagles, were destroyed. The episode did not spark an
outbreak, but it shook international health authorities. It demonstrated
that trade in smuggled wildlife could become an inadvertent and efficient
ally in moving a lethal disease around the world.
Underscoring that fear, 3 weeks later, customs officials in Taipei found 28
parrots packed into PVC pipe in a piece of hand luggage that had been
carried from Indonesia, another country grappling with H5N1 flu. [Have
these birds been tested for H5N1 in Taipei? - Mod. AS] "Those are the ones
that were caught. There are almost certainly others that have not been
caught," said Dr Peter Daszak, executive director of the Consortium for
Conservation Medicine in New York.
So far this year [2004], avian influenza H5N1 has caused illness in 44
humans in Thailand and Viet Nam, killing 32 of them, as well as causing the
slaughter, or death from illness, of more than 100 million birds, but it
has not moved beyond 8 countries in South East Asia.
Last Monday [29 Nov 2004] a World Health Organization official warned that,
if avian flu gains the genetic ability to move easily from person to
person, it could cause up to 100 million deaths around the world. Last
month WHO summoned vaccine manufacturers to its Geneva headquarters for an
emergency summit, warning that the world's capacity for making pandemic flu
vaccine stands at only 330 million doses and that vaccine production will
take at least 6 months.
The US Fish and Wildlife Service, the primary federal entity charged with
intercepting smuggled wildlife, has only 100 inspectors spread among US
ports, airports, and border crossings. "The resources that are put into
trying to police the illegal trade are minuscule," said Peter Knights of
the anti-smuggling organization WildAid. "We seem to be extremely worried
about anthrax and bioterrorism, but there is a risk here that we are not
taking seriously enough."

[The spread of the H5N1 avian influenza from south east Asia to other parts
of the world may take place mainly by infected birds. These might be either
domestic (transported legally, or rather, illegally), or wild, migrating
birds. Theoretically, infected humans could also be vectors of H5N1, but
this scenario seems to be rather remote, as long as human to human
infection remains rare. - Mod.AS]
