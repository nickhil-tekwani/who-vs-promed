Update on patient with viral encephalitis contracted in Australia
------------------------------------------------------------------
We reported recently on a 23 year old German who developed viral
encephalitis after his return from Australia. On admission (4 May 2001) the
patient was in a critical condition. He was febrile, disorientated,
restless, and had repeated convulsions. Artificial respiration and
continuous intravenous application of anti-epileptic drugs became
necessary. Apart from aciclovir in the first 2 days, no specific antiviral
treatment was administered.
Fortunately, the condition of the patient has improved gradually in the
following days. He was discharged from hospital on Mon 21 May 2001. He has
made a quick but as yet incomplete recovery. On last examination, he was
fully orientated, had regained his memory, and had no pareses of the
extremities. He still has some spontaneous fasciculations of skeletal
muscles on upper arms and legs and difficulties with complicated manual
procedures. Neurological rehabilitation is planned.
An acute flavivirus infection was suggested after preliminary serological
tests of serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Viral cultures and viral polymerase
chain reaction tests examinations remained negative. Murray Valley
encephalitis (MVE) was diagnosed serologically using specific ELISA tests
(Dr D Dwyer, Westmead Hospital, Australia). Neutralisation assays are still
in process.
The patient was probably infected in the area of Darwin or Alice Springs,
where he remembered being bitten extensively by mosquitoes. He had no
previous vaccination against Japanese encephalitis.
