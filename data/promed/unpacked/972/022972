RABIES, POST_EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (5)
=====================================
Subject: Re: PROMED-AHEAD-EDR: Rabies, post exposure prophylaxis (3)
I would like to respond to John Waters comments concerning the rabies
post exposure treatment. It is important to remember that if Human
Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) was not administered to an individual
at the time of the first post-exposure vaccination, there is a time
limit as to when that individual should receive the HRIG. The time
limit is 7 days, after that time the individual will have developed
an active immune response and the administration of HRIG is not necessary.
In addition a 1.0 ml vial of Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV)
intended for use intramuscularly (im) should not be divided up into eight
0.1 ml doses for intradermal (id) administration. I have studied the
longevity of the presence of antibody in individuals (across the USA
and from the Peace Corps) that received a 5 dose series post exposure
im or a 3 dose series pre exposure, including those that received the
vaccine im and those that received the vaccine id. I concluded that
if the id is not given correctly, the length of time that antibody is
present is significantly decreased. I believe, as do others, that
using a syringe other that the one specifically supplied with the
intradermal HDCV is one reason for the reduced longevity of antibody
after vaccination. The syringe supplied with the id HDCV is specifically
designed to deliver the correct dosage whereas other syringes may not.
In addition, and most importantly, the vaccine company producing the HDCV
will not stand behind the vaccine if a 1.0 ml vial is divided up and given
intradermally.
