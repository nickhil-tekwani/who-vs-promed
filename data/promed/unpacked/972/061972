Leprosy? It is alive and well as there are 4 confirmed cases of it in Costa Rica. Today, about 180 000 people worldwide are infected with leprosy, according to the World Health Organization, most of them in Africa and Asia.

The outbreak is on the Osa Peninsula, in Puntarenas. Those affected are devastated, because of the symptoms and the social stigma that they suffer. It's been handled quietly but has happened in the past. In fact, from 1995-2011, there were 96 cases in the country.

In case you haven't read the Bible or heard of these hidden cases, leprosy is a terrible skin disease. It causes either ulcers or large bumps, depending on the variation of the disease.

The treatment is intense and can last 2 years. The treatment involves 3 drugs and an annual cost of [USD] 7000. The Costa Rican Social Security doesn't pay for this, as they get the treatment donated from the World Health Organization.

All 4 of the current patients are now at home and have daily visits from CCSS personnel who administer medicines. [Costa Rica provides universal health care to its citizens and permanent residents. The Costa Rican Department of Social Security (or Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS, in Spanish) is in charge of most of the nation's public health sector (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Costa_Rica).] The good news is that today leprosy is curable and the affected do not need to be separated from loved ones.

Leprosy is caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_, a slow-growing bacillus that is an obligate parasite with a tropism for peripheral nerves, skin, and mucous membranes in the cooler parts of the body, such as the upper respiratory tract, anterior chamber of the eye, and the testes.

[Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_ and is still a major health problem in the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Because lepromatous patients excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions, the mode of spread is likely respiratory or nasal discharge. A case of lepromatous leprosy poses increased risk for infection for close, long-term contacts, such as household members. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to spread the disease. As the organism is also present in skin, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Armadillos, a mammal native to southeastern US, Central, and South America, are naturally infected with _M. leprae_. Because _M. leprae_ that are shed by lepromatous patients and armadillos can persist on surfaces in the environment, fomites are also a potential source of infection.

Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995; see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml. Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months.

Of the 189 000 leprosy cases registered worldwide at end of the 1st quarter of 2013, about 34 000 cases (18 percent) were from the Americas, 85 percent of which were from Brazil; only 64 cases were from Costa Rica (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf). Of the approximately 233 000 new leprosy cases reported worldwide in 2012, about 36 000 were from the Americas, 92 percent of which were from Brazil; only 6 new cases, none of which were in children, were reported from Costa Rica (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf).

A newly described leprosy agent, named _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_, was discovered in 2008 in patients who died of diffuse lepromatous leprosy (DLL) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19019760 and ProMED-mail post Leprosy, new species - USA, Mexico, Singapore 20081126.3723). DLL is a unique severe form of leprosy that has been endemic in Mexico and Costa Rica for more than a century.

Costa Rica, with a population of approximately 4.6 million in 2011, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica).
