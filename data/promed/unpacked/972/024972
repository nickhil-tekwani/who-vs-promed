A 66-year-old male resident of Banjar Kalang Sari, Nusa Penida,
Klungkung died of rabies. The victim died after being treated at Nusa
Indah Ward, Sanglah Hospital. The victim was a referred patient from
Klungkung Hospital. Once he arrived at Sanglah Hospital on Saturday
(19 Feb 2011) at 16.45 WITA (Central Indonesian Time), he immediately
received intensive care treatment in the Nusa Indah Ward. The victim
finally died on Sunday (20 Feb 2011) at 22.00 WITA.

According to Dr IGB Ken Wirasandhi, the secretary of Rabies Control
Team at Sanglah Hospital the victim had dog bite history 3 months ago
on his right shinbone. And he didn't clean his wound. "The victim
already showed clinical symptoms such as hydrophobia, aerophobia,
hypersalivation, and agitation," said Ken when interviewed on Monday
(21 Feb 2011).

With regard to the death of a Songan village resident, who had died
as a result of rabies virus infection 2 years [after receiving a dog
bite], Dr Ken explained, that rabies is invariably fatal [when the
virus reaches the brain] and [he could not predict precisely] when the
virus would reach the brain. "The location of the bite and the numbers
of bites also determine the length of time taken for the virus to
reach the brain. Also the number of rabies virus particles transferred
by the bite was relevant.

From current data gathered, the number of casualties resulting from
bites by stray dogs on Nusa Penida was now 2. In total the number of
suspected cases of rabies virus infection [in Bali overall] was now
183. Of these 87 people had died [as result of confirmed] rabies virus
infection since 2008 until now [see comment below].

The death toll from the outbreak of rabies in Bali is continuing to
rise, with authorities in Indonesia confirming there are no longer any
areas that are free from the disease. At least 5 people have died in
Bali from rabies so far this year [2011], taking the official total to
119 since an outbreak was declared in November 2008. However, it is
possible the number could be higher because of a lack of proper
reporting of fatalities associated with the disease.

Bali Health Office chief Nyoman Sutedja has confirmed the disease has
now spread to every district on the main island, as well as other
islands that fall under its jurisdiction. Nusa Penida, which was
previously free from rabies, reported its 1st 2 deaths in January
[2011] after a non-resident took his infected dog to the small island
southeast of Bali. "We have managed it with vaccination, limited
elimination, and people's training and we also have opened a rabies
centre there (at Nusa Penida),"

Sutedja said that the actual number of reported cases of rabies had
declined. "It's not actually spreading because the number of districts
affected is still the same, just that the number of villages with the
case have increased from 256 villages to 267 villages."

The Australian government warns that people visiting Bali and other
areas of Indonesia are strongly advised to avoid direct contact with
dogs, cats, monkeys, and other animals that carry the disease. It also
warns that availability of post-exposure rabies treatment in Indonesia
may be limited, which means bite victims may have to return to
Australia or travel to a 3rd country for immediate treatment.

[Regarding the precise number of rabies deaths on Bali, Merritt
Clifton has commented that: "The total of 87 deaths referred to in
item 1 above coincides with my log of deaths whose victims have been
named in media accounts. The overall total of 183 human rabies victims
mentioned above is also plausible. Remember that Bali media for almost
a year now have often stated the numbers of victims at 20-30 more than
the numbers we know about, and that the officially acknowledged total
of victims from 2008, 2009, and 2010 combined came to 151 a few days
ago."

The incubation period for rabies, which is the time period between
exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms, can range from
approximately 3 weeks to 8 weeks, but can be as short as 9 days or as
long as 7 years. The incubation period depends on a number of factors,
including the severity of the wound, the location of the bite and the
susceptibility of the person to infection. People who are
immunocompromised will most likely be more susceptible to rabies. The
variability of the incubation period for rabies is a complicating
factor in the surveillance of the disease and the estimation of the
effectiveness of the ongoing dog vaccination programme on the island.
