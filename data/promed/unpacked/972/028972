[1] Uncertainty over omicron severity

The latest data and projections from the United Kingdom, closely watched as Europe's biggest omicron hot spot, cast doubt on whether infections are less severe than delta variant infections, with South African experts reporting that the milder illness they see might not be due to the virus itself but from preexisting immunity.

Though experts say it typically takes a while to assess severity, the uncertainties have experts on edge. The highly transmissible new variant is taking off in many locations amid holiday travel and gatherings. UK cases today [Mon 20 Dec 2021] soared to another daily record for the 3rd day in a row, as officials added 93 045 new cases.

Also, the country added 3201 more cases to its omicron total, putting the total at 14 909, with about 4 out of 5 of the cases in London.

It its latest assessment, researchers from Imperial College London who examined data on people reporting symptoms and the proportion of cases needing hospitalization found no evidence that omicron infections are less severe than delta. They added, however, that hospitalization data are currently very limited.

The group also found that the risk of reinfection with omicron is 5.4 times greater than with delta, putting protection from earlier infection as low as 19%. They also estimate that omicron cases doubled every 2 days up to [Sat 11 Dec 2021] and that omicron's reproduction number was above 3 during the same period.

The experts found a different pattern for omicron compared with delta, with young adults, London residents, and those with African ethnicity more affected by omicron.

They estimated vaccine effectiveness after 2 doses at 0% to 20%, and effectiveness after a booster dose at 55% to 80%.

In a statement from the college, epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, OBE, said the study adds more evidence of substantial immune evasion from both infection and vaccination. "This level of immune evasion means that omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health," he said.

The UK's Health Security Agency today [Mon 20 Dec 2021] in its latest weekly risk assessment also reflected the uncertainty about omicron severity. "There are insufficient data to fully assess severity, which is expected in the early period of emergence of a new variant," it said. "However, on the data available in the UK, there is no signal that supports a difference in the intrinsic virulence of the omicron virus compared to delta." https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/novavax-covid-vaccine-shows-904-efficacy-against-infection

Meanwhile, at a briefing today in South Africa, Health Minister Joe Phaahla said the early anecdotal reports of milder omicron illnesses might not reflect a less virulent virus but may instead be due to natural immunity from earlier infection or vaccination, according to Reuters.

Michelle Groome, PhD, with the National Institute for Infectious Diseases, said hospitalizations and deaths are rising, but deaths are at a much lower level than in earlier waves.

The World Health Organization (WHO) announced today [Mon 20 Dec 2021] that it has listed a 9th COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, a subunit 2-dose vaccine developed by Novavax and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations. The vaccine is produced by India's Serum Institute, and the WHO's listing paves the way for the vaccine to be used in lower-income countries where more supplies are urgently needed. (See yesterday's CIDRAP News story; https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/novavax-covid-vaccine-shows-904-efficacy-against-infection)

Australia today reported a new daily record high for COVID-19 cases, fueled by a super spreader event in Sydney and clusters in bars and nightclubs, according to Reuters. Both the delta and omicron variants are circulating. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pubs-parties-push-australias-covid-19-cases-record-levels-2021-12-17/

The ZOE COVID survey that focused on positive cases from London suggests that omicron symptoms are similar to cold symptoms, with the most frequent reports being runny nose, headache, fatigue (mild or severe), sneezing, and sore throat. https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/omicron-and-cold-like-symptoms-rapidly-taking-over-in-london

The overall global COVID-19 total today rose to 273 330 045 cases, plus 5 341 760 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/

Dual corneal-graft rejection after mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) for COVID-19 during the first 6 months of follow-up: case report, state of the art and ethical concerns. Vaccines 2021, 9, 1274. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9111274. Published: 3 November 2021
(This article belongs to the Special Issue The COVID-19 Vaccine)

Present mass vaccination against Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is the most widely used health policy and the most promising approach to curb the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic globally. However, new side effects are emerging from the mass vaccination not described during the experimental stages. In the present study, we discuss a case of acute corneal graft rejection, which has occurred 25 years after transplantation and 13 days after the administration of the BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty, BioNTech/Pfizer), which was followed-up for a period of 6 months. In this period, the corneal inflammation appeared twice but was successfully managed with topical therapy and supplementation of Vitamin D. A risk of corneal graft rejection must be included in the list of potential vaccine complications, in order to inform the transplanted patient to undergo a preliminary and a follow-up ocular examination, and eventually to include corneal graft in the list of contraindications to vaccination.

Conclusions. Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying potential transplant failure after immunization against SARS-CoV-2 and to clarify the epidemiological features of this complication.

The Netherlands yesterday [Sun 19 Dec 2021] entered a lockdown aimed at cutting spread over the holidays, as other European nations battling omicron (B.1.1.529) surges considered taking tougher physical distancing measures.

Countries have tried to turbocharge booster dose vaccination, but it isn't enough to quell the quickly spreading variant. As health systems struggle, leaders are looking for other ways to curb the spread, such as physical distancing.

UK, Germany weigh more distancing measures
------------------------------------------
On [Sat 18 Dec 2021], Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced a lockdown over the Christmas and New Year's holidays in an effort to slow COVID-19 spread. The lockdown took effect yesterday [Sun 19 Dec 2021] and ends on [14 Jan 2022], according to Reuters. Nonessential businesses are closed, with schools shuttered until [9 Jan 2022]. https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/ netherlands-set-announce-strict-christmas-lockdown-media-2021-12-18/

In a television address, Rutte said the step was unavoidable, with a 5th wave --this time fueled by the omicron variant-- bearing down on the country and already impacting regular health services. The Netherlands is among the European countries that was already battling a delta (B1617.2) wave when the more transmissible omicron variant arrived on the scene.

One of the country's infectious disease experts projects that omicron will become the Netherlands' dominant variant between Christmas and New Year's Eve.

In the United Kingdom, one of Europe's main omicron hot spots, Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with his cabinet today and said the situation is "extremely difficult" and that officials haven't ruled out taking strong actions. The UK's Health Security Agency (HSA) today [Mon 20 Dec 2021] reported nearly 92 000 new cases, of which about 8000 were confirmed as omicron cases. So far, 129 omicron hospitalizations have been reported, and 14 deaths have been linked to the variant.

Germany's science advisors yesterday [Sun 19 Dec 2021] warned government officials that boosters alone won't be able to contain omicron spread and reducing social mixing will be needed, according to Reuters. Leaders are meeting tomorrow to consider beefed-up restrictions, which could include limiting public venues to vaccinated or recovered people, capping gathering size, and speeding up the booster shot campaign. https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/no-lockdown-before-christmas-germany-says-2021-12-19/

Today [Mon 20 Dec 2021] the country added the United States to its "no fly" list owing to concerns about omicron.

The World Economic Forum announced today [Mon 20 Dec 2021] that it will postpone its January meeting slated for Davos and will reschedule it for early summer.

The global total today rose to 275 170 911 cases, and 5 358 810 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/

[4] US: rapid increase in omicron cases
Date: Mon 20 Dec 2021
Source: STAT News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/20/omicron-variant-now-makes-up-73-of-covid-infections-diagnosed-in-u-s/


The omicron variant now accounts for 73% of COVID-19 infections being diagnosed in the United States, and in some parts of the country 90% of infections are caused by viruses from the omicron strain, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late [Mon 20 Dec 2021].

Though it's been clear from omicron's astonishing spread elsewhere that it would rapidly take over from delta as the dominant variant in this country, the speed is nevertheless startling to witness.

"What we are watching unfold is microbial evolution. This is remarkable," said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy. "But this is what these viruses can do."

According to the CDC, in the week ending [27 Nov 2021], the delta variant accounted for virtually all transmission in the country. The week ending [4 Dec 2021], omicron made up 0.7% of COVID-19 infections; it climbed to 12.6% in the week ending 11 Dec. In the week ending 18 Dec, it reached 73.2%.

"This sharp rise in omicron was expected and is similar to what has been seen worldwide," the CDC said in a brief statement that urged people to use layered prevention strategies to slow the spread of the virus.

Those strategies include getting vaccinated, if you aren't yet, and boosted if you are vaccinated and eligible for a booster. (Everyone 16 and older is eligible for a booster 6 months after their 2nd dose of vaccine.) The agency is also urging people to wear masks in public indoor spaces, regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not. It suggests people who plan to gather with others over the holidays should consider using a COVID-19 rapid test.

In a year of unsettling COVID-19 variants, omicron tops the list, with its extraordinary constellation of mutations and its explosive transmission capacity. Viruses from this clan of the SARS-CoV-2 family are able to evade some of the immunity people have developed over the past 2 years, eroding the protective powers of 2 doses of even the mRNA vaccines and the immunity acquired by previous infections.

It appears, though, that people who are doubly vaccinated retain some protection against developing severe illness if they contract the virus. It also appears that getting a booster shot restores some of the protection the vaccines offered against previous variants.

The rapid spread of omicron worries public health officials because of the sheer potential size of the wave it will create -- both in the United States and globally. If many parts of the world are dealing with explosive transmission at once it will put a great deal more stress on global supply chains and the availability of necessary medical resources, Osterholm warned.

In any one location, more people sick at once will invariably put more pressure on health care systems, which have been struggling for weeks to cope with the punishing delta wave. If breakthrough infections occur among health workers, hospitals that have already canceled elective surgeries and other non-urgent care may be pushed to their limits.

There are some hints that the virus may cause more mild disease -- perhaps because it appears to prefer to replicate in the upper airways rather than descending into the lung to cause COVID-19 pneumonia. Scientists in South Africa, which first reported the existence of the new variant, say fewer patients are requiring supplemental oxygen in this wave of infections and far fewer are ending up in intensive care.

But others caution against drawing conclusions about what level of illness the variant will trigger. For instance, scientists in South Africa are studying whether a wave of infections caused earlier this year [2021] by the beta variant might have helped protect people there from omicron. The beta variant also had mutations that helped it evade the protection generated by vaccines, but it did not spread widely outside of South Africa.

"Estimates for this exposure-to-symptom gap, called the incubation period, clocked in at about 5 days for alpha and 4 days for delta. Now word has it that the newest kid on the pandemic block, omicron, may have ratcheted it down to as little as 3." - Mod.LK]
