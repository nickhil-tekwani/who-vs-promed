ACTINIDIA ROOT ROT, KIWIFRUIT - CHINA: (GUANGXI ZHUANG)

Located in the western and mountainous part of Guangxi, Leye County
has become a major producer of _Actinidia_ (kiwi fruit/Chinese
gooseberry). In recent years, crop yields have been seriously reduced
because of root rot, which causes vines to wilt and die. The disease
is most likely caused by a complex of soil-borne pathogens (including
_Phytophthora cinnamomi_, _Armillaria mellea_ and _Fusarium_ spp.). It
has eliminated 30-50 percent of vines in most of the plantations. If
this disease is not brought under control, _Actinidia_ production will
likely fail, seriously depriving local farmers of a potentially rich
source of income.

There is an FAO-China Technical Cooperation Project: "Action Research
and Training for Prevention and Management of Actinidia Root Rot
Disease among Smallholder Farmers." Activities involving local growers
will attempt to identify, test, and develop a disease prevention and
management strategy. Training of local extension workers and farmers
will be initiated. Implementation of the disease prevention and
management strategy is the main goal.

[A number of fungi have been reported to be associated with root and
crown rots of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species), including species of
_Phytophthora_, _Pythium_, _Armillaria_ and _Sclerotium_. These
diseases destroy the host's access to water and nutrients. Symptoms
often include yellowing and wilting of foliage followed by dieback of
part or the whole of the crown. The host plant may decline slowly, or
sudden death may occur, especially under heat or drought stress. The
pathogens are usually soilborne and also spread with plant material,
by water and mechanical means (often by contaminated equipment and
human activities). Disease management of soilborne pathogens is
difficult and may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures,
nutritional improvements), and removal or burning of affected plants.
