Burundi declares cholera outbreak
---------------------------------
Burundian Public Health and AIDS Control Minister Sylvie Nzeyimana on Sunday evening [1 Jan 2023] declared an outbreak of cholera in the east African country's commercial capital Bujumbura, she said here in a press release.

"Nine suspected cholera cases were identified on 30 Dec 2022 in the northern health district in the commercial capital Bujumbura with symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting, mainly in Bukirasazi neighborhood in Kinama zone. The next day, 2 other suspected cases were identified in Mutakura neighborhood, close to Bukirasazi," said Nzeyimana in the statement.

According to her, another suspected case was notified in Buyenzi, near the Bujumbura city center and the latter had been in contact with 1 of the suspected cases located in the north of Bujumbura.

"Results of the National Public Health Institute (INSP) issued on 31 Dec 2022 have confirmed that it was cholera. Today [2 Jan 2023], we take this opportunity to announce that 5 cholera patients are hospitalized at Prince Regent Charles Hospital while 7 others have already been discharged from hospital," said Nzeyimana.

Nzeyimana said that some preventive measures have already been taken. According to her, they include disinfecting infected households, sensitizing the community on the risks of the epidemic propagation and behavior to be adopted, and the search for other cholera cases in the community.

The cholera outbreak happens at a time when heavy rains hit several parts of Bujumbura and its surroundings from 26 to 31 Dec 2022, causing overflows of toilets. The Burundian health ministry has also banned the sale of cooked and raw food products on the streets in Bujumbura following the disease outbreak.

Malawi shuts schools over worsening cholera outbreak
----------------------------------------------------
Schools in Malawi's 2 largest cities are to remain closed until further notice due to a worsening cholera outbreak, the government said on Monday [2 Jan 2023]. Students were due back in class after the holidays on Tuesday [3 Jan 2023] but the health ministry said the start of the school term for primary and secondary pupils in the capital Lilongwe and the southern city of Blantyre would be delayed by at least 2 weeks.

Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda said in a statement the postponement was "due to the recent and continuing increase in the number of cholera cases and deaths." Authorities regretted "any inconvenience caused by this late advice taken solely in the interest of the safety of our learners", she added. The impoverished southern African country has recorded almost 18 000 cases of the disease and 595 deaths since March [2023] in what the UN has said is the largest outbreak to hit the nation in 10 years.

Cholera is contracted from a bacterium generally transmitted through contaminated food or water. It causes diarrhea and vomiting, and can be especially dangerous for young children.

In September [2022], the WHO warned that after years of decline, the planet was witnessing a "worrying upsurge" in cholera outbreaks, with climate change adding to traditional triggers such as poverty and conflict.

Nine Reported Dead, Others Hospitalized As Cholera Outbreak Hits Ebonyi
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In Akpoha hamlet, Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, there have been 9 cholera-related deaths. Numerous residents in the neighborhood have been admitted to the hospital and are currently receiving treatment. According to official records, there are 30 patients in the hospital, but locals believe there may be more.

On Sunday [1 Jan 2023], the state administration dispatched a State Rapid Response Team to the area to assist in stabilizing the situation. The delegation, which included employees from the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and the state department of health, was led to the town by Uchenna Ibiam, the chairperson of the local government.

The leader of the council expressed worry over the unexpected deaths, some of which were child deaths, in his remarks to the village elders, men, women, and youth of the Akpoha community. He asked the locals to maintain their composure because everything is in order. He praised the state administration for acting quickly, particularly in dispatching the Rapid Response Team to help the Akpoha Health Workers handle the issue.

Health authorities confirm outbreak of cholera in Kitui
-------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Kitui County have confirmed the outbreak of cholera in Kalulu village, Kaghui area in Kyuso. However, Kyuso Sub-County Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Stephen Kioli, confirmed that stringent sanitary and hygiene measures have been put in place in the affected areas to curb the spread of the malady.

Dr. Kioli said out of the 4 samples they took from 4 patients, 2 were positive for cholera. The doctor said 3 other people who are believed to have come into contact with the sick were being held at the hospital for observation.

Dr. Kioli said high hygiene was the 1st line prevention measure and thus people were being encouraged to regularly wash their hands and not to eat fresh food without properly washing them.

On Tuesday [3 Jan 2023], public health officials and police officers visited the affected Kavonokya sect families and found 6 people suspected to be suffering from cholera and took them to Kyuso hospital for admission.

Philippines: Anti-cholera efforts ramped up as cases increase
-------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the data surveillance of the DOH Epidemiology Bureau (EB), there were 6126 cholera cases reported from 1 Jan 2022 to 10 Dec 2022 [in the Philippines]. Despite this, no local governments have declared an outbreak as cases remained manageable thanks to the close coordination of hospitals and the Health Department in monitoring and treating patients.

"We have many teams on-ground addressing our current cholera cases, while we further strengthen our surveillance and response systems nationwide," said DOH Secretary Officer-in-Charge Dr. Maria Rosario Singh-Vergeire. She emphasized that the DOH has been working to urgently improve our systems to lessen the impact of natural disasters on our nation's health.

Among many other causes brought about by natural calamities in 2022, cases were 287% higher compared to the reported cases during the same period in 2021 (1584). Most of these cholera cases were reported from Region VIII (3773), Region XI (810), and Region III (355).

Nationally, there were 74 deaths reported (Case Fatality Rate = 1.2%). This is higher compared to the case fatality rate of 0.8% in the same period in 2021. To reduce this number, the Department has been providing the necessary assistance to critical areas to ensure patients have access to treatments and clean drinking water.

As cholera is caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water, a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach is warranted. The Department is in close coordination with concerned agencies through the Inter-Agency Committee on Environmental Health (IACEH).

The Department is continuously improving its strategies in implementing existing programs and activities on water and sanitation in addressing Food and Water Borne Diseases in the Philippines by coordinating and allocating the resources of all IACEH member agencies in improving their water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in accordance with their mandates and continuous promotion of the health of individuals in all settings (including communities, schools and workplaces), to reduce their risk behaviors leading to diarrheal diseases.

In all settings, the DOH, through the Centers for Health Developments (CHDs) and Local Government Units (LGUs) are continuously implementing drinking water quality surveillance programs to ensure drinking water safety from all the way from water source and catchment up to the consumer. In addition to these are sanitation programs to ensure that open defecation practices are eliminated and to ensure proper disposal of feces and sewage waste. Finally, the DOH strongly advocates for safer food preparation and storage especially at the household level to prevent pathogens from reproducing.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J, eds. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp. 113-136:

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2- or 3-dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80% for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single-dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single-dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products, which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63,64)."
