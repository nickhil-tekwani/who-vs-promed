Seven Indonesians from the same village in North Sumatra have been
hospitalized and are being tested for avian influenza, an official said on
Wednesday [2 Aug 2006], raising fears of new cluster [of] cases in the
country. The group [of cases] comes from Karo district in North Sumatra
province where bird flu killed as many as 7 people in an extended family in
May 2006, triggering fears that the H5N1 bird flu virus had mutated into a
form that could spread easily between people. "Whether it is a new cluster
or not, that must be scientifically proved," said Runizar Ruesin, head of
the bird flu information centre at Indonesia's Health Ministry.
He said the 7 were admitted to the local Kaban Jahe hospital, with 3
referred to a state-run hospital. The latter 3 are children -- 2 siblings
aged 10 and 6 years and their 18 month old neighbour. "I am still waiting
for the result of the tests," Ruesin said. Another official said chickens
in the area where they lived had died and tested positive for bird flu.
Sick poultry is the usual mode of transmission of the disease, endemic in
birds in about 2/3 of the country's provinces.
Health minister Siti Fadilah Supari, agriculture minister Anton
Apriyantono, and welfare minister Aburizal Bakrie travelled to Karo on
Wednesday to assess the situation, but were jostled by villagers angry
about a planned bird culling. At one point, locals tried to rip off the
protective masks being worn by the 2 ministers, who eventually were forced
to take off the white protective suits they were wearing, and the planned
cull was called off as the army restored order.
"This is the 1st time that we have had a rejection of bird culling," the
agriculture minister said. Many in Indonesia oppose culling, contesting
whether their fowl are sick and with compensation of only 12 500 rupiah
[USD 1.37] a bird.
The 7 being tested are from the village of Sumber Mufakat, in the same
district as the case in May, which was the biggest cluster of the disease
the country has recorded and sparked fears of a global pandemic of bird flu
in humans. The World Health Organization said in May 2006 that 2 members of
the cluster, a man and his ailing son, might have caught the virus in a
case of direct human-to-human transmission, but the virus did not spread
very far if this did happen.
Sari Setiogi, the WHO's spokeswoman in Indonesia, said WHO was aware of the
latest suspected cases. "But they are still suspected cases. We have to
wait for the test results."
The 3 children were hospitalised on Tuesday [1 Aug 2006] after showing
symptoms of bird flu, said Luhur Suroso, the director of the Adam Malik
hospital. "Their lungs have not shown signs of pneumonia but we have to
keep monitoring them because in one or 2 days things could change," Suroso
told Reuters.
Indonesia has been criticised for not doing enough to stamp out H5N1, which
still remains essentially an animal disease but experts fear could spark a
pandemic if it mutates into a form that can pass easily among people.
Earlier on Wednesday, the welfare minister said government policy had been
tightened to extend from 1 to 5 kilometres (3 miles) the area in which
birds would be culled. The government has so far shied away from mass
culling of poultry, citing lack of funds and impracticality in a country
with millions of backyard fowl.
Indonesia has recorded 42 deaths from the H5N1 bird flu virus, equalling
Viet Nam, where no one is known to have died of the disease this year.
Human cases of bird flu have been rising steadily in Indonesia since its
first known outbreak in poultry in late 2003. Worldwide, the disease has
killed at least 134 people since it re-emerged in East Asia in 2003.

[The number of individuals in the village of Sumber Mufakat in Karo
district of the province of North Sumatra who have been hospitalized on
suspicion of avian influenza virus infection has increased from 3 to 7 in
the past 24 hours. The village is located in the same district as the
cluster of cases in an extended family where there was some evidence of
human-to-human transmission of infection. At this stage the hospitalization
of the 7 is precautionary since no confirmation of avian influenza virus
infection by laboratory testing has been obtained so far. Furthermore the
first 3 patients (2 siblings and a neighbouring child) are not exhibiting
signs of serious lower respiratory tract infection.
