Main Observation: Outbreak Period until 25 January 2007
--------------------------------------------------------
The current bluetongue serotype 8 epidemic is now into its 24th week, with
the case total having risen to 2081 herds. Out of the 8 additional cases
reported this [week, 19-25 January], only one pertained to a case diagnosed
in the last week. Out of the 2081 cases with correct georeferences, 695
cases were reported from Belgium, 7 from France, 913 from Germany, 458 from
the Netherlands, and 8 from Luxembourg.
This week's new case occurred in cattle again at the fringe of the area
known to be affected thus far in Germany. During the last 3 weeks new cases
have continued to be reported at a low level. Most of these new cases are
detected through clinical case reporting, but some were detected by
serological investigations prior to movements between zones within Member
States or between Member States.
Relative to the number of farms, the 2 areas that were most severely
affected in 2006 are the original cluster of cases where Belgium, Germany,
and the Netherlands share borders and the Bergisches Land region of
Germany. The latter is not a cattle dense region but now represents the
cluster with the largest spatial extent. However, during 2006 the virus
also spread into or close to areas with high cattle density in Belgium,
Germany, and the Netherlands.

According to the data included in table 1 of the full report, "Number of
cases reported by country and by animal species affected", one new case --
in cattle, in Germany -- was reported for the period 19 through 25 January.
Data on the species distribution of the outbreaks per country since the
onset of the panzootic in August 2006 are included in the above table 1.
There are 4 groups: cattle, small ruminants, wild animals, and "mixed". The
recent BTV 8 panzootic in the 5 northwestern European countries was
exceptional because of the involvement of cattle, severely clinically
affected. Previously recorded BT outbreaks (e.g. Africa, Middle East, Asia,
America, southern Europe) were characterized by clinical disease in sheep,
with cases in cattle and goats being rather exceptional. It would be
interesting to note if goats have also been affected during the BTV 8
outbreak, and if such infections have been clinically manifested. - Mod.AS]
