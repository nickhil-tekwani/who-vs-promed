San Juan Basin Health (SJBH) in coordination with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) has identified a human case of septicemic plague in a La Plata County resident. An investigation is underway to determine the source of exposure. The patient is currently receiving treatment. This is the 2nd case of plague in La Plata County this year [2014].

Since 1957, Colorado has identified 65 cases of human plague, 9 (14 percent) of which were fatal.

157 samples have been tested for plague in 2014 at public health laboratories. 2 rodents, a rabbit, a dog and a cat have all tested positive for plague in Colorado. 14 flea samples have also tested positive for plague. Since domestic cats and dogs can carry infected fleas into the home, it is important to consult your veterinarian about how to effectively control fleas on your pets.
