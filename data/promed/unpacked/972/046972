The Ministry of Health reports that a man of 46 years of Vad village, Cahul is suspected of being infected with cutaneous anthrax.

He works in a private firm in the city. There, doctors have found 4 people who had contact with animals suspected of being infected with anthrax. The man claims that a month ago, with 4 people, he slaughtered and butchered a bull, and a week later, they appeared with rashes on their hands.

Since he did not have an insurance policy, he preferred to treat himself at home. But 2 weeks later, the man turned to the doctor. He was admitted with furunculosis to the Cahul district hospital, with the medical board suspecting anthrax infection.

All patients were brought for specific treatment in Chisinau. At the same time, investigation samples were submitted to the laboratory. According to the medical board, the men are currently free of infection and may be discharged within 2 weeks.

Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_. It is more common in cattle, goats and sheep and is transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals.

Anthrax is sporadic in Moldova, with just the occasional reported outbreak. Latterly, there was a bovine case in Riscani in 2012, none in sheep and horses, but 2 cases in pigs in 2011 in Orbei and Stefan-Voda, and a 3rd swine case in 2011 in Rezina. Or put another way, in spite of the claimed universal livestock vaccination, the occasional bovine case is not reported. It is butchered, and the farm pigs feed on the viscera and occasionally die; the vet is called, and anthrax gets diagnosed and reported. In this instance, it came about because of suspicious cutaneous lesions in 4, maybe 5 -- the account is a mite confused -- cases, and an alert medical doctor. - Mod.MHJ
