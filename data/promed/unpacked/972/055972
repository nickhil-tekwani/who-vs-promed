Discovery of avian TB hog case traced to Manitoba farm
------------------------------------------------------
The discovery of the avian (bird) form of tuberculosis (TB) in a hog
destined for a slaughter plant in the United States has been traced back to
a farm in Manitoba that produced "iso-weans", according to government and
industry sources.
The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) Friday confirmed that a case of avian TB was
found in a truckload of hogs that were born in Canada but fed in the US.
Rumors of TB in Canadian hogs circulated through the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's livestock trading pits earlier in the day.
An official with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirmed that
a case of avian TB was indeed traced back to a location in Manitoba. "A
common denominator was found, and that the animals came from a farm that
produced iso-weans for the industry," he said. No further word on the
location of the farm was available. Industry sources said the farm in
question is already believed to have stopped producing iso-weans.
Martin Rice, executive director of the Canadian Pork Council said it is not
unusual to find the disease in pigs. "Slaughter plants, whether in Canada
or in the US, sometime find lesions on the lymph nodes of the hog's head
and sometimes on the remainder of the carcass. If the lesions are isolated
to the head, then that part is removed and disposed of. However, there are
times when the lesions are also found on the carcass and in that case the
whole animal will be destroyed."
Rice stressed that this is not a reportable disease, but it is commercially
sensitive. "It is not a disease that causes food controls or border
measures to be implemented," he said. "It used to be a fairly common
occurrence a number of years back in both the US and Canada, especially
when you had pigs grown in the vicinity of chicken coops."
What will happen is that the pig will become infected, but it will stop
there. The pigs do not spread the disease among themselves, unlike the
other form of TB, which is more normally found in cattle. The CFIA official
said the Canadian government was working in tandem with the USDA on the
discovery.
The avian TB organism "is ubiquitous in nature" and can be found in wild
bird populations, in the soil, in sawdust, straw or hay used for bedding,
and in bird droppings in or around the building where the hogs were housed.

[Mycobacterium avium has been known to cause lung infections in people
susceptible to lung disease, and to cause lymph gland enlargement,
particularly in young children. The frequency of _M. avium_ infections in
man is increasing in AIDS and non-AIDS patients.
Iso-wean is a term applied to the process of weaning piglets in such a way
as to reduce the vertical transmission of certain pathogens and diseases
from the sow to the young piglets. It is a type of weaning in isolation and
is accomplished through the following procedure.
1.newborn piglets receive sufficient high quality colostrum
2.piglets are weaned from the sow at 14 to 19 days of age
3.individuals achieve a weight of 4.5 to 5.5 kg at weaning
4.weaned pigs are effectively isolated from the sow herd and held separate
from all breeder and feeder (and feral) populations of swine of
significantly different age and health status
5.biosecurity measures are in place to minimize disease transmission into
the isolated group.
