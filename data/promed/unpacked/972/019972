[Infection and death of healthcare workers continue to increase. Effort should be made to vaccinate all healthcare workers to protect them from becoming infected when treating very sick and very infectious patients. This is doubly important not only to save their lives but also because when the healthcare workers become infected, they can infect everyone they treat including those who are not infected with Ebola virus. - Mod.LK]

Evolution of the epidemiological situation
------------------------------------------
The 3 main outbreaks of the epidemic during these 21 days are Katwa (44), Vuhovi (32), and Mandima (24) who together reported 62.5% (100/160) of all cases.

Katwa
-----
In Katwa [North Kivu], 23 of the 44 reported cases, more than half of the cases (52.3%), come from the health area of Muchanga. The other health areas in the Katwa area have all reported fewer than 6 new confirmed cases in the last 21 days.

The community death rate remains very high in Katwa with 22 community deaths out of the 44 reported cases, or 50%.

Of the reported cases, 3 are health workers, or 6.8%.

The main difficulties over the last 21 days were the absence of ETC in Katwa following the armed attack, the reluctance of part of the community and insecurity in some health areas following activities of armed groups.

The main interventions of the response in the Katwa area to address these challenges include recommendations made by the population during the community dialogues, including:
Training youth from the community to integrate dignified and secure burial and infection prevention and control (IPC) teams; highlighting local actors on the ground; and the organization of interdisciplinary teams in households to avoid disturbing the families of the sick several times.

Vuhovi
------
In Vuhovi [North Kivu], 17 of the 32 reported cases, or 53.1%, come from the Mutendero health area. The 2nd most affected health area is Isonga with 7 cases, or 21.9%. Other health areas recorded fewer than 2 cases in the last 21 days.

Of the 32 reported cases, 9 were community deaths, or 28%.

Of the reported cases, 2 are health workers, or 6.3%.

Mandima
-------
In Mandima [Ituri], 17 of the 24 reported cases, 70.8%, come from the Biakato Mine health area .

Of the 24 reported cases, 10 were community deaths, or 41.7%.

Of the reported cases, 1 is a health worker, 4.2%.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 94 388 people have been vaccinated.

[WHO - Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/04-april-2019-ebola-drc/en/

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
------------------------------------------------------
This past week saw a marked increase in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. During the last 21 days (13 Mar-2 Apr 2019), 57 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases; 42% of the 135 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 172 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (50), Vuhovi (34), Mandima (28), Masereka (18), Beni (13), Butembo (12), Oicha (8), Kayna (3), Lubero (3), Kalunguta (1), Bunia (1), and Musienene (1). WHO and partners will continue to adapt our strategies and strengthen response efforts to limit the further spread of EVD in these health areas.

Of 1100 cases with reported age and sex, 58% (633) were female, and 29% (320) were children aged less than 18 years.

To date, a total of 338 EVD patients who received care at Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) have been discharged. As part of a broader programme to provide care for Ebola survivors and build sustainable, local response capacity, an eye care training programme and clinic was completed this week in Beni through the combined efforts of WHO, Ministry of Health, and a team of ophthalmologists from Emory University and the University of North Carolina. A total of 252 EVD survivors were screened in the eye clinic and 10 national ophthalmologists were trained to provide higher level eye care in their communities. Feedback from participating national healthcare providers and enrolled survivors was overwhelmingly positive. Of note were some of the clinical findings witnessed in the present cohort of EVD survivors. The team noted that complications such as uveitis were observed at lower rates when compared to cases from the 2014-16 West Africa EVD outbreak.

A Risk Communication and Community Engagement partners meeting was held in Goma from [25-26 Mar 2019], involving more than 80 participants representing the different partners participating in the outbreak response. The discussion focused on engagement strategies that have worked in the past, what is working on the ground currently, and what needs to be improved to build upon our current gains and address future challenges.

The recent shift of emphasis in the response strategy to promoting greater engagement and ownership by affected communities is beginning to produce results. While community reluctance and mistrust remain present in certain areas around Butembo and Katwa, other areas saw a notable decrease in resistance to the presence of response workers. Diligent efforts at engaging with community committees through direct dialogue resulted in the reopening of the ETC in Katwa, bringing the total number of operational facilities providing care up to 6 ETCs in Beni, Butembo, Goma, Komanda, Mangina, and 6 transit centres in Beni, Bunia, Katwa, Kayna, Bwanasura, and Oicha. A more proactive approach to investigating and resolving incidents in the communities is also being undertaken to minimise the risk of misunderstandings and to mitigate potential sources of mistrust between local residents and healthcare providers.

The increase in the number of cases this week highlights the difficult environment the outbreak is occurring in, as well as the multitude of evolving challenges confronting the outbreak response on a daily basis. A holistic approach involving rigorous implementation of proven measures to break chains of transmission, thorough contract tracing, continued vaccination of high-risk contacts, and persistent efforts in community engagement must be persevered with to curtail the spread of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

[Almost 60% of the cases are women and 30% are children under 18 years old. This is a sad statistic. One wonders how the communities will recover from the devastation wreaked by the Ebola outbreak.

It is good news that uveitis is being observed at lower rates when compared to cases from the 2014-16 West Africa EVD outbreak. Could the reason for this be the trial therapeutics being administered to the patients? Or aren't the numbers of those being treated high enough to account for the difference? - Mod.LK]

[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

82 infected health workers
--------------------------
The healthcare worker in Musienene brings the total number of health workers infected during the outbreak to 82 (7.4% of all confirmed or probable cases), and 29 of them have died, the DRC said.

In an update released late yesterday [3 Apr 2019], the DRC recorded 8 new confirmed cases, and 7 deaths, including 5 community deaths. Butembo and Katwa each had a community death, and Mandima recorded 3.

Community deaths have been a compounding factory of this outbreak, as they enable the virus to spread more easily among family members and funeral attendees.

DRC spotlights 3 hot spots
----------------------
"The 3 main outbreaks of the epidemic during these 21 days are Katwa (44), Vuhovi (32), and Mandima (24) who together reported 62.5% (100/160) of all cases," the DRC said yesterday [3 Apr 2019].

In all 3 areas, single neighborhoods housed most of the cases. In Katwa, 23 of 44 cases came from the Muchanga health zone. Half of the cases recorded in Katwa in the past 3 weeks involved community deaths.

"The main difficulties over the last 21 days were the absence of ETC [Ebola treatment centers] in Katwa following the armed attack, the reluctance of part of the community and insecurity in some health areas following activities of armed groups," the DRC said.

In Vuhovi, 17 of 32 reported cases were from Mutendero health zone. 28% of reported deaths were community deaths.

Mandima also reported a significant percentage of community deaths. "Of the 24 reported cases, 10 were community deaths, or 41.7%," the DRC said. About 70% of cases came from the Biakato Mine health zone.

Three healthcare workers in Katwa are among recently confirmed case-patients, as are 2 in Vuhovi and 1 in Mandima.

[Until the community deaths cease, the virus will spread. Efforts are clearly being made to build trust in the communities, which one hopes will translate to use of the Ebola treatment centers. This will be a big step on the path to gaining control over the virus, as treatment centers lead to better prognosis and decreased spread of virus. - Mod.LK]

- Wed 3 Apr 2019. DRC Ebola total hits 1100; study targets secondary spread
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/drc-ebola-total-hits-1100-study-targets-secondary-spread

Research developments: New findings from Guinea's outbreak shed light on the role of Ebola treatment units in preventing secondary spread. In addition, another research team described how blood from vaccine trial participants might lead to new antibody treatments.

The new DRC cases are reflected in the WHO online Ebola dashboard, which notes that 277 suspected cases are still under investigation. The number of deaths held steady, at 683 [see 4 Apr 2019 Ministry data with reported number of deaths at 695 (629 confirmed and 66 probable) and 339 people cured. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ/Mod.MPP]

Guinea: treatment units tied to fewer infections
------------------------------------------------
To help sift out which risk factors are linked to secondary Ebola spread, a research team from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and their collaborators in Guinea analyzed 860 cases in 129 transmission during the last half of Guinea's Ebola outbreak. They described their findings today [3 Apr 2019] in an early online edition of the American Journal of Epidemiology [see reference below].

Ring vaccination was under way during the trial, and, to adjust for it as a confounder, the investigators removed participants from the study analysis.

Focusing on characteristics that led to secondary transmission, they found that admission to an Ebola treatment unit was associated with a 38% decrease in secondary cases in people who did not survive their infections. Another key factor was unsafe burial, which was associated with a nearly doubled transmission rate.

Similar to the results of earlier studies, most cases didn't involve secondary transmission, and a small number of cases were linked to many transmission events. When the researchers analyzed the patterns further, they found that the first generation of each transmission chain was linked to a higher number of secondary cases than those for later chains.

Children and young adults had lower onward transmission, and older adults were more likely to spark numerous secondary cases, perhaps owing to behavioral differences in caring roles, the group wrote.

Three quarters of transmission involved households, with the researchers noting that studies from earlier in the epidemic found higher contributions from funeral and nosocomial transmission.

Analyzing transmission patterns provides key insights and helps guide the public health response, the team concluded. "Recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo indicate the vital importance of epidemiologically-informed control measures in the control of Ebola," they added.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Understanding risk factors for Ebola transmission is key for effective prediction and design of interventions. We used data on 860 cases in 129 chains of transmission from the latter half of the 2013-16 Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Using negative binomial regression, we determined characteristics associated with the number of secondary cases resulting from each infected individual. We found that attending an Ebola Treatment Unit was associated with a 38% decrease in secondary cases (Incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.99) in individuals that did not survive. Unsafe burial was associated with a higher number of secondary cases (IRR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.10, 3.02). The average number of secondary cases was higher for the first generation of a transmission chain (mean = 1.77), compared with subsequent generations (mean = 0.70). Children were least likely to transmit (IRR 0.35 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.57) compared with adults, whereas older adults were associated with higher numbers of secondary cases. Men were less likely to transmit than women (IRR 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.93)). This detailed surveillance dataset provided an invaluable insight into transmission routes and risks. Our analysis highlights the key role that age, receiving treatment, and safe burial played in the spread of EVD.]

- Tue 2 Apr 2019. Butembo, Katwa remain hot spots of Ebola activity
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/who-butembo-katwa-remain-hot-spots-ebola-activity
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

As Ebola cases continue to pile up, WHO today [2 Apr 2019] reiterated that the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will be defeated only with local communities at the helm of response efforts.

The message came from Ibrahima-Soce Fall, MD, WHO assistant director-general for emergency response, who held a brief teleconference this morning from Butembo.

With 72 Ebola cases reported last week [week of 25 Mar 2019] and 56 in the previous week, March [2019] was a low point for responders, as activity spiked and the outbreak topped the 1000-case milestone.

"But of 21 health zones with Ebola, we have only 13 recorded cases in recent weeks, which shows a kind of geographic limitation to the outbreak," Fall said. "We are continuing [to adapt] our tactics."

Fall said Butembo and Katwa remain the hot spots of virus activity. And the outbreak already approaches 1100 cases, with 3 new infections noted today.

Cases follow violence
---------------------
The community-led tactics that Fall described include surveillance and vaccination and, most important, according to Fall, the recruitment of locals in response activities.

Without local health workers, he explained, response teams deal far too often with vaccination hesitancy, refusal of follow-up surveillance, and general mistrust of the "riposte" or foreign-led outbreak response.

According to the most recent outbreak situation report from the WHO's regional African office, Katwa reported 28% (44/160) of all confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Vuhovi, Mandima, Masereka, and Butembo recorded 20%, 15%, 12%, and 8%, respectively.

"Following recent episodes of violence, there has been an increase in the weekly number of cases, after many weeks of overall decline," the WHO said. "Contact follow-up and community reluctance to report suspicious deaths, with subsequent un-safe burials, continue to be a problem."

In the WHO's regional report, the organization noted resistance to vaccination in the Kaniyi health area of Masereka health zone.

http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/1ixibaybkkqq720bx6nkml?email=true&a=11&p=54796147

This past week saw a notable increase in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases, with 72 newly confirmed cases and one new probable case reported in the last seven days; the largest proportion of which were from Katwa and Vuhovi health zones. During the last 21 days (11-31 Mar 2019), 57 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases; 42% of the 135 health areas affected to date. During this period, a total of 164 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (46), Vuhovi (34), Mandima (25), Masereka (19), Beni (12), Butembo (10), Oicha (8), Kayna (3), Lubero (3), Kalunguta (2), Bunia (1), and Musienene (1). WHO and partners remain concerned by these recent developments and are continuing to adapt strategies to strengthen the response to limit the further spread of EVD in these health areas.

Despite these setbacks, it should be noted that the recent shift in strategy of increasing community outreach from earlier weeks, is gradually yielding tangible results on the ground. In Katwa, the Ebola Treatment Centre was reopened after frank and open dialogue with the community. Previously reluctant communities are now permitting access to healthcare providers once again, with residents actively participating in the renewed response efforts at times. Incidents in the community are now also rigorously followed up to minimize any potential misunderstanding, which may inadvertently contribute to community reluctance, refusal, or resistance to response efforts.

In the outbreak hotspots of Katwa, Butembo, and Vuhovi, persistent efforts aimed at encouraging community dialogues saw the establishment of Ebola community committees across 16 health areas. Although these community engagement interventions take time to win over the trust and cooperation of the local population, they are an integral tool in aiding the acceptance of WHO response efforts to curtail the spread of EVD in these challenging social/geographic settings. Successes observed this past week are positive indicators that these measures should be maintained whilst continually adapting to the evolving context.

[3] Rapid spread of outbreak
- Tue 2 Apr 2019
[Independent (Ireland) News Africa, abridged, edited]
https://www.independent.ie/world-news/africa/congo-ebola-outbreak-spreading-faster-than-ever-world-health-organisation-37975129.html

Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola outbreak is spreading at its fastest rate yet, 8 months after it was first detected, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on [Mon 1 Apr 2019].

Each of the past 2 weeks has registered a record number of new cases, marking a sharp setback for efforts to respond to the 2nd biggest outbreak ever, as militia violence and community resistance have impeded access to affected areas.

Less than 3 weeks ago, the WHO said the outbreak of the haemorrhagic fever was largely contained and could be stopped by September, noting that weekly case numbers had halved from earlier in the year to about 25.

But the number of cases hit a record 57 the following week, and then jumped to 72 last week [week of 25 Mar 2019], said WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier. Previous spikes of around 50 cases per week were documented in late January [2019] and mid-November [2018].

More alarmingly, more than half of the Ebola deaths last week occurred outside of treatment centres, according to Congo health ministry data, meaning there is a much greater chance they transmitted the virus to those around them.

"People are becoming infected without access to response measures," Lindmeier told Reuters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract. We describe therapeutic monoclonal antibodies isolated from human volunteers vaccinated with recombinant adenovirus expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV GP) and boosted with modified vaccinia virus Ankara. Among 82 antibodies isolated from peripheral blood B cells, almost half neutralized GP pseudotyped influenza virus. The antibody response was diverse in gene usage and epitope recognition. Although close to germline in sequence, neutralizing antibodies with binding affinities in the nano- to pico-molar range, similar to "affinity matured" antibodies from convalescent donors, were found. They recognized the mucin-like domain, glycan cap, receptor binding region, and the base of the glycoprotein. A cross-reactive cocktail of four antibodies, targeting the latter three non-overlapping epitopes, given on day 3 of EBOV infection, completely protected guinea pigs. This study highlights the value of experimental vaccine trials as a rich source of therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies.

[Currently, there is no specific treatment or cure to tackle the disease; those affected are just given intravenous fluids and body salts to balance their electrolytes, while doctors attempt to maintain their oxygen levels and blood pressure.

Finding an effective cure for the disease would be hugely exciting.

"Treatment of guinea pigs at day 3 of infection with the cross-reactive cocktail of 4 antibodies... resulted in 100 percent protection from a lethal [Ebola virus] infection, without weight loss or clinical signs," the researchers wrote.

If further research shows this treatment to be both safe and effective in humans (a process that unfortunately takes many years), a cure for this devastating disease could be in sight. Next, the team plans on testing their treatment in ferrets.
