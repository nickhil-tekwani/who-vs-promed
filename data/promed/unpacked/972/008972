Malnourished children may be especially susceptible to serious, sometimes
fatal gastrointestinal infection with _Escherichia coli_ 0157:H7 (_E.
coli_) bacteria, according to a study in mice.
Researchers at Japan's Nara Medical University were cited as saying that
many of those children were later found to have "lived on an unbalanced
diet before infection."
Researchers have long suspected that malnutrition might reduce resistance
to _E. coli_ infection, especially among children and the elderly. In the
Japanese study, published in the April issue of the journal Infection and
Immunity, researchers infected young mice with relatively low levels of the
bacteria. Some of mice were well-fed, but others had been placed on a
protein and calorie-reduced diet for 2 weeks prior to infection.
