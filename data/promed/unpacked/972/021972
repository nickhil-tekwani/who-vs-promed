Complications, death in pregnancy rose during COVID-19
------------------------------------------------------
Rates of severe pregnancy-related complications and severe maternal illness and death rose significantly amid the COVID-19 pandemic, find 2 retrospective US studies published late last week in JAMA Network Open.

Role of disrupted obstetric care
--------------------------------
In the first study, a team led by a Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center researcher evaluated pregnancy-related complications, birth outcomes, and length of stay of more than 1.6 million pregnant women who gave birth at 463 US hospitals in the 14 months leading up to the pandemic [1 Jan 2019, to 28 Feb 2020] and in the first 14 months of the crisis [1 Mar 2020, to 31 Apr 2021]. [Rose L. Molina, Thomas C. Tsai, Dannie Dai, et al. Comparison of pregnancy and birth outcomes before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(8):e2226531. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.26531]

The study included 849 544 patients in the prepandemic period and 805 324 during the pandemic. Characteristics were similar in both groups, including age (35 years and older, 18.1% prepandemic, 18.4% pandemic), race (White, 53.7% vs 53.9%, respectively), and health insurance (Medicaid, 43.1% vs 43.0%). Average gestational age at birth was 38.3 weeks during both periods.

During the pandemic, consistent with US Census reports, live births fell 5.2%. Maternal deaths during delivery rose from 5.17 to 8.69 per 100 000 pregnant women (odds ratio [OR], 1.75). Rates of fetal death and stillbirth stayed relatively stable, at about 0.9%, as did rates of preterm and term births (10.7% and 89.3%, respectively). Mode of delivery was similar during both periods (vaginal OR, 1.01; primary cesarean OR, 1.02; vaginal birth after cesarean OR, 0.98; and repeated cesarean OR, 0.96).

Amid the pandemic, the likelihood of gestational high blood pressure (OR, 1.08), obstetric hemorrhage (OR, 1.07), preeclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure; OR, 1.04), and previous diagnosis of chronic high blood pressure (hypertension; OR, 1.06) rose, while length of stay for delivery declined 7% (rate ratio, 0.931), which the researchers said could reflect expedited discharges to minimize in-hospital infection risks.

The odds of sepsis slightly decreased (OR, 0.89), which the authors attributed at least partially to better handwashing and the wearing of face coverings. Preexisting racial and ethnic inequalities in obstetric outcomes were unchanged.

The researchers said that the poorer pandemic outcomes may have been related to substantial disruptions in outpatient prenatal care, including less monitoring for potential complications, limited access to in-person routine care, scarce essential hospital supplies, and avoidance of healthcare settings for fear of COVID-19 infection.

"It is possible that these disruptions and limitations in monitoring via telehealth may have contributed to the slight worsening of pregnancy-related hypertension," they wrote. "Additionally, increased rates of hypertensive disorders may be due to heightened stress provoked by the pandemic, or reluctance to engage in for prenatal care due to concerns about COVID-19 exposure."

In the struggle to provide obstetric services amid rapidly changing recommendations, "the experience of care was dramatically different--especially with respect to restrictive visitation policies, which limited support during a particularly anxiety-provoking hospitalization," the researchers wrote.

"As the nation continues to face ongoing surges, it will be important to mitigate further pandemic-related disruptions on obstetric care and pregnancy outcomes."

Rates of all outcomes worse amid Delta
--------------------------------------
A 2nd study, this one by Ascension Health and University of Texas at Austin researchers, assessed the risk of COVID-19-related severe maternal illness in 3129 infected pregnant women and 12 504 uninfected peers giving birth in 32 hospitals affiliated with a single health system in eight US states from [March 2020 to January 2022]. The median patient age was 29 years. [Mupanomunda, M., Fakih M.G., Miller, C., et al. Comparison of severe maternal morbidities associated with delivery during periods of circulation of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(8):e2226436. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.26436]

The study period spanned the dominance of 4 SARS-CoV-2 strains: wild-type, March -- December 2020; Alpha, January -- June 2021; Delta, July -- November 2021; and Omicron, December 2021 -- January 2022. Hospitals were located in Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Tennessee, and Texas.

The risk of severe maternal respiratory and nonrespiratory illness was significantly greater with the wild-type strain (OR, 2.74) and Alpha (OR, 2.57) but was much higher with Delta (OR, 7.69). Omicron was not associated with higher risk of severe illness.

Similarly, the odds of severe respiratory events for patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection were comparable for the wild-type strain (OR, 12.79) and Alpha variant (OR, 15.56), highest for Delta (OR, 28.14), and lowest for Omicron (OR, 7.05).

And the likelihood of severe nonrespiratory maternal illness for infected patients was similar for the wild-type strain (OR, 2.16) and Alpha variant (OR, 1.96) and highest for Delta (OR, 4.65), while it was not significantly higher for Omicron (OR, 1.21).

"The nonrespiratory SMM [severe maternal morbidity] associated with COVID-19 were driven, in part, by higher than expected rates of blood product transfusion during the Delta variant period," the researchers noted.

"This finding supports prior reports suggesting higher rates of nonpulmonary complications (eg, postpartum hemorrhage and blood transfusions) in pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestation than in the general population."

A 2ary analysis of only nontransfusion-related severe maternal illnesses showed an increase during the wild-type era (OR, 2.16) and Alpha period (OR, 1.96) and a yet significantly higher rise during Delta (OR, 4.65) but not Omicron.

"These findings highlight the importance of the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant individuals and the consideration of infection as a risk factor for adverse peripartum maternal outcomes," the authors wrote.

In a related commentary, Emily Adhikari, MD, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and Catherine Spong, of Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, decried the exclusion of pregnant women in the early clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines. [Adhikari E.H., Spong C.Y. Understanding Acute Obstetric Morbidity Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Variants--Unwrapping the Layers of an Onion. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(8):e2226444. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.26444]

"Inclusion of pregnant patients in early clinical trials of vaccine safety and efficacy, as well as in postmarketing observational studies, is critical to fully understand how to target preventive and therapeutic treatments in people of childbearing age and what infections to prioritize for maternal or neonatal benefit," they wrote.

"Until we move to an environment of inclusion of pregnant individuals in both the design and conduct of studies, optimizing maternal and infant health will continue to lag."

[A] Novavax COVID booster application
Following the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine last month [July 2022] for the primary vaccine series, the company announced today [Mon 15 Aug 2022] that it has applied for an EUA for the vaccine to also be used as a booster in adults ages 18 and older.

In an announcement today [Mon 15 Aug 2022], Novavax said if authorized, the vaccine would be the first protein-based COVID-19 booster for adults. It said its application covers both heterologous (different-brand) and homologous (same-brand) booster strategies.

Stanley Erck, Novavax's president and chief executive officer, said, "It's important for people to have a choice as they evaluate how to stay protected against COVID-19, and boosters are an invaluable tool to build upon immunity obtained from previous vaccinations."

A phase 3 study found that the 3rd dose produced robust antibody responses that met or exceeded levels seen in the primary series. The vaccine also prompted a significant antibody response when used as a heterologous booster.

Local and systemic responses lasted about 2 days and showed an increasing incidence across all 3 doses. Rare instances of myocarditis, pericarditis, and anaphylaxis have been reported outside of clinical trials, and, earlier this month [August 2022], the European Medicines Agency recommended that the vaccine maker carry a warning about the 2 heart conditions.

See [15 Aug 2022] Novavax press release [https://ir.novavax.com/2022-08-15-Novavax-Submits-Application-to-the-U-S-FDA-for-Emergency-Use-Authorization-for-Novavax-COVID-19-Vaccine,-Adjuvanted-as-a-Booster-in-Adults-Aged-18-and-Older]

In other vaccine developments, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency today [15 Aug 2022] approved Moderna's bivalent (2-strain) booster shot, which covers the original SARS-CoV-2 virus plus the Omicron BA.1 variant. The group said it based its findings on clinical trials that showed the booster prompted a strong immune response against BA.1 and the original virus and a good response against Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.

The United Kingdom is the first to approve a bivalent booster vaccine. Companies that make mRNA vaccines are working on bivalent booster shots for the US market that target BA.4 and BA.5.

[B] South Korea: Omicron spike after eased restrictions
Dialing back rules for social gatherings and COVID-19 vaccine passes in South Korea was tied to a record spike in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infections in March [2022], according to an observational study published late last week in JAMA Network Open.

Researchers in South Korea mined daily data on COVID-19 cases and the proportion of Omicron infections from [1 Dec 2021 - 16 Mar 2022]. They multiplied the number of daily cases by the rate of positive Omicron tests to arrive at a proxy of variant activity in the community.

In mid-January 2022, the country relaxed restrictions on social gatherings, stopped requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination in public facilities, expanded community screening, and mandated screening for all schoolchildren.

The Rt, or the average number of cases resulting from a single infected person, was greater than 1 throughout the study period, indicating uncontrolled viral transmission. The easing of limits on social gatherings was linked to an increase in Rt of 20.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.8% to 36.5%), and suspension of COVID-19 vaccine passes was tied to a jump in Rt of 10.9% (95% CI, 3.2% to 24.8%).

The use of community COVID-19 screening centers and mandatory screening in schools, however, was associated with declines in Rt of 16.8% (95% CI, -25.2% to -11.1%) and 18.8% (95% CI, -22.2% to -11.1%), respectively.

The study authors noted that South Korea had successfully controlled SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the use of public health and social measures (PHSMs) without lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, but the world-record spike of 600 000 new daily Omicron cases occurred soon after these measures were relaxed.

The screening protocols appeared to help slow the spread of the virus, they said, but "our finding of a mean Rt greater than 1 during the study period suggested there may have been difficulty in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. The findings suggest awareness of Rt can inform policy planning and practice, including by allowing timely implementation and relaxation of PHSMs."

[3] BCG as vaccine against COVID-19
Date: Mon 15 Aug 2022

The citation and abstract of the article referenced above follows): Faustman D.L., Lee, A, Hostetter E.R., et al. Multiple BCG vaccinations for prevention of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in Type 1 diabetes. Cell Reports Medicine, 2022; 100728 DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2022.100728]

Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), published a new paper in Cell Reports Medicine demonstrating the protective potential of multiple doses of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with type 1 diabetes conducted at the start of the pandemic (before COVID-specific vaccines were available), the researchers found that 12.5% of placebo-treated individuals and 1% of BCG-treated individuals met criteria for confirmed COVID-19, yielding a vaccine effectiveness of 92%.

The BCG-vaccinated group also displayed protective effects against other infectious diseases, including fewer symptoms, lesser severity and fewer infectious disease events per patient. No BCG-related systemic adverse events occurred.

BCG's broad-based infection protection suggests that, in addition to COVID-19, may potentially provide protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens.

The researchers are hoping the results will spur a larger scale study of the effects of the BCG vaccine in patients with type 1 diabetes, considered among the most vulnerable groups to COVID-19.

The BCG vaccine is an avirulent tuberculosis strain _Mycobacterium bovis_ historically given to protect against tuberculosis and, since its introduction in 1921, has been the most widely administered vaccine in the history of medicine.

Considered to be extremely safe, BCG is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and is given to roughly 100 million children per year globally. BCG is also one of the most affordable medicines, costing less than a dollar a dose in many parts of the world.

"Multiple studies have shown that adults with type 1 diabetes who are diagnosed with COVID-19 are at increased risk of severe illness. We found that 3 doses of BCG administered prior to the start of the pandemic prevented infection and limited severe symptoms from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Unlike the antigen-specific vaccines currently in use to prevent COVID-19, BCG's mechanism of action is not limited to a specific virus or infection," says Denise Faustman, MD, PhD, director of the Immunobiology Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The participants in the COVID trial had previously enrolled in a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of the BCG vaccine for type 1 diabetes. Participants in the test group had received multiple vaccinations prior to the onset of the pandemic in early 2020.

"This data set is unique and exciting because the patients were all vaccinated with multiple doses of BCG prior to the onset of the epidemic. Prior to the trial they had no known exposure to tuberculosis or prior BCG vaccination. This eliminates the major confounding factors that have limited other trials.

The results support the idea that BCG needs time to have a clinical effect, but its effects may then be very lasting and durable" says Hazel Dockrell, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, an infectious diseases expert who was not officially involved in the study.

The 144 adult type diabetics (96 BGC treated and 48 placebo) analyzed in the COVID-19 trial were part of an ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial testing BCG as a treatment for adults with established type 1 diabetes. Patients were followed for COVID-19 related outcomes for 15 months.

Outcomes for the COVID-19 trial included: COVID-19 infection rate, COVID-19 related symptoms, reduction overall infections disease and SARS-CoV-2 antibody-level presence and intensity. The type 1 diabetes outcomes were not unblinded as part of this study and will be unblinded at the completion of the trial in 2023.

[Preliminary results with BCG are very promising, i.e., 12.5% of placebo-treated individuals and 1% of BCG-treated individuals met criteria for confirmed COVID-19, yielding a vaccine effectiveness of 92%. It will be informative to see the results of the larger scale study currently underway.

Also see Escobar LE, Molina-Cruz A, Barillas-Mury C. BCG Vaccine Protection from Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19). medRxiv [Preprint]. 2020 Jun 14:2020.05.05.20091975. doi: 10.1101/2020.05.05.20091975. Update in: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Jul 28;117(30):17720-17726.

"A series of epidemiological explorations have suggested a negative association between national BCG vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. Nevertheless, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for the potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density and age structure). Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no-association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect.

Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed." - Mod.LK]

Overview
--------
Globally, the number of new weekly cases decreased by 24% during the week of 8 to [14 Aug 2022], as compared to the previous week, with over 5.4 million new cases reported. The number of new weekly deaths decreased by 6%, as compared to the previous week, with over 15 000 fatalities reported.

As of [14 Aug 2022], 587 million confirmed cases and 6.4 million deaths have been reported globally.

In this edition, we include:
- An update on the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including their geographic spread, prevalence, summary of phenotypic characteristics of the Omicron VOC, and impact of vaccines.
- The COVID-19 epidemiological update at the global and regional levels

Global overview [Data as of 14 Aug 2022]
----------------------------------------
Globally, the number of new weekly cases decreased by 24% during the week of [8 to 14 Aug 2022], as compared to the previous week, with over 5.4 million new cases reported. The number of new weekly deaths decreased by 6%, as compared to the previous week, with over 15 000 fatalities reported. As of [14 Aug 2022], 587 million confirmed cases and 6.4 million deaths have been reported globally. At the regional level, the number of reported new weekly cases decreased across all 6 regions: the African Region (-38%), the European Region (-38%), the Eastern Mediterranean Region (-30%), the Western Pacific Region (-18%), the Region of the Americas (-17%), and the South-East Asia Region (-11%). The number of new weekly deaths increased in the Western Pacific (+31%) and the South-East Asia Region (+12%), while it decreased or remained stable in the African Region (-33%), the European Region (-25%), the Eastern Mediterranean Region (-7%), and the Region of the Americas (-4%).

At the country level, the highest numbers of new weekly cases were reported from Japan (1 395 301 new cases; (-7%), the Republic of Korea (866 830 new cases; +22%), the United States of America (679 653 new cases; -14%), Germany (271 277 new cases; -25%), and Italy (193 305 new cases; -32%). The highest numbers of new weekly deaths were reported from the United States of America (2 907 new deaths; -4%), Japan (1 647 new deaths; (64%), Brazil (1 495 new deaths; +3%), Italy (920 new deaths; -13%), and Spain (573 new deaths; -12%).

Current trends in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths should be interpreted with caution as several countries have been progressively changing COVID-19 testing strategies, resulting in lower overall numbers of tests performed and consequently lower numbers of cases detected. Additionally, data from countries are continuously updated by WHO to incorporate changes in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths made by countries retrospectively.

Special Focus: Update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and variants of concern
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geographic spread and prevalence of VOCs
----------------------------------------
Globally, from [15 Jul to 15 Aug 2022], 172 042 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were submitted to GISAID. Among these sequences, the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) remains the dominant variant circulating globally, accounting for 99.3% (170 905) of sequences.

As the number of submitted sequences continues to decline, interpretation of trends should be made with due consideration of the limitations of surveillance systems, including differences in sequencing capacity and sampling strategies between countries, as well as changes in sampling and sequencing strategies in multiple countries.

There is now a large diversity within the Omicron VOC, an expected phenomenon that is the result of the accumulation of mutations as part of the virus replication process and/or immune pressure from the host. More than 200 descendent lineages of Omicron have emerged; these variants are being monitored by WHO, depending on the specific genetic constellations of mutations, indications of a rise in prevalence in a specific location or geographic spread, as well as any evidence of phenotypic changes.

The current SARS-CoV-2 variant landscape is characterized by the emergence of an Omicron descendent lineage, the increase in the prevalence followed by the spread to many countries globally and replacement of the former dominant descendent lineage(s). The surge of cases linked to a specific descendent lineage is either due to its higher intrinsic transmissibility or higher immune evasion characteristics. The extent to which the emergence of a variant causes a rise in the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in a country depends on a number of factors, including the levels of population immunity following either SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, or a combination of the two, and the stringency of public health and social measures in place.

Figure 4, Table 2 and Annex 5 indicate the proportion of Omicron descendent variants. Notably, BA.1.X, BA.2.X (incl.BA.2.12.1 and BA.2.75) and BA.3.X have a prevalence of <1%, 3% and <1%, respectively, during week 30 [from 24 to 30 Jul 2022]. The prevalence of BA.4.X is 8%, representing a declining trend as compared to previous weeks. BA.5 and its descendent lineages continue to rise in relative prevalence as compared to other descendent lineages and account for 74% of submitted sequences in week 31 [from 31 Jul to 6 Aug 2022].

Genetic diversification of BA.5 has also resulted in multiple descendent lineages, with additional mutations in both the spike and non-spike regions. These are indicated in Table 2 and Annex 5. A total of 35 BA.5 descendent lineages have been assigned a Pango lineage. Among all BA.5 descendent lineages, the relative proportions of BA.5.1, BA.5.2 and BA.5.2.1 are rising, accounting for 29%, 22% and 30% of submitted sequences, respectively during week 31 (from July 31 to 6 August 2022). BA.5.2.1 is the most prevalent variant in all six WHO regions since the week of [7 to 13 Aug 2022].

Among the Omicron descendent lineages that continue to emerge is BA.2.75, with the earliest sequences reported in May 2022. This variant, currently an Omicron subvariant under monitoring, has 9 additional mutations in the spike as compared to its parent lineage BA.2; 4 of these mutations are within the receptor binding domain (RBD), and at least one of these RBD mutations has been associated with immune escape in previous variants. As compared to [18 Jul 2022] when only 250 sequences from 15 countries were submitted to GISAID, more than 2700 sequences from 16 countries have been reported as of [15 Aug 2022]. The majority of the reported sequences are from India. The global prevalence of this variant was highest in week 27 [from 3 to 9 Jul 2022] and has declined in recent weeks, but it is not known if this is a true decline in prevalence or the result of a delay in sequence submissions.

Preliminary laboratory-based studies indicate a relative growth advantage of BA.2.75 as compared to BA.2 and BA.5.2. Further, there is an indication of higher fusogenicity, more efficient replication in lung cells and more pathogenicity in a hamster model as compared to BA.2. More studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings.

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20AUG17WORLD7_1660845466.pdf. Mod.UBA]


[In the past 24 hours, 12 countries; the USA (195 467), South Korea (178 480), Japan (178 286), Germany (67 390), Italy (36 261), France (35 745), Russia (33 106), Taiwan (24 816), Brazil (21 927), Australia (20 008), Hungary (16 249), and India (12 093), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3099 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (16-17 Aug 2022).

A total of 44 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 44 countries are from the European region, 6 are from the Americas region, 3 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 7 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and none from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 17.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 14.2%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 5.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 1.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.95 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 597.88 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.46 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
