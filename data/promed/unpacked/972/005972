2nd Human Pegivirus in HCV-Infected and HCV/HIV-1-Co-infected Persons Who Inject Drugs, China
-------------------------------------------
In 2015, the 2nd human pegivirus (HPgV-2) was independently reported by 2 groups in the USA (1,2). Previous reports have indicated that HPgV-2 (also known as HHpgV-1) is a transfusion-transmitted virus and is associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (1-5). The distribution and prevalence of HPgV-2 infection worldwide are of great importance but remain to be determined. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of HPgV-2 in the southern province of Guangdong and southwestern province of Sichuan in China. We have also identified HCV-infected persons, in particular HCV/HIV-1 co-infected persons who inject drugs (PWID), as populations at high risk for HPgV-2 infection. In addition, our work reveals the difference in the prevalence, distribution, and phylogeny between the first human pegivirus (HPgV; formerly GB virus C or hepatitis G virus) (6,7) and HPgV-2.

The Study
--------------
In our initial investigation of HPgV-2, we screened a total of 367 delinked serum or plasma samples from high-risk groups for infection with HCV and HIV-1 and 500 healthy volunteer blood donors from Guangdong Province, China, by using ELISA (2,5), and a nested reverse transcription PCR targeting both the 5â€² untranslated region and nonstructural protein 3 regions of HPgV-2 (3,5). We observed a low frequency (0.4 percent) of HPgV-2 antibody detection and the absence of HPgV-2 viremia in healthy blood donors tested in our study. Out of 86 HCV-infected patients, 1 (1.2 percent) was positive for both HPgV-2 antibodies and viral RNA (Table 1 [for Tables and Figures, see original URL - Mod. LL]). Furthermore, we did not detect HPgV-2 RNA in men who have sex with men (MSM), although 1 (0.5 percent) of the 211 MSM was weakly positive for HPgV-2 antibodies and negative for HPgV-2 RNA (Table 1; Figure 1).

We observed a relatively high prevalence of HPgV-2 infection in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected PWID in the Guangdong Province; 12.9 percent (9/70) were positive for HPgV-2 antibodies and 5.7 percent (4/70) for HPgV-2 RNA (Table 1). We obtained similar results from 270 PWID from Sichuan Province; 15.9 percent (43/270) were positive for HPgV-2 antibodies and 3.0 percent (8/270) for HPgV-2 RNA (Table 1). Using Fisher exact test, we observed a statistically significant difference between HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients in prevalence of having HPgV-2 antibodies (6.2 percent vs. 0; p under 0.001) and prevalence of having HPgV-2 RNA (5 percent vs. 0; p equal to 0.026). Similarly, we observed a statistically significant difference between HIV-1-positive/HCV-positive patients and HIV-1-positive/HCV-negative patients in prevalence of having HPgV-2 antibodies (10 percent vs. 0; p under 0.001) and prevalence of having HPgV-2 RNA (4 percent vs. 0; p equal to 0.040) (Table 2). These findings indicate a close association between HPgV-2 and HCV infection and synergy between HIV-1 and HCV infection with respect to HPgV-2 infections (5).

Furthermore, we obtained 6 near full-length genome sequences of HPgV-2 by using next-generation sequencing or sequencing of PCR products (5). These strains from China, which included 2 from PWID (IDU31 and SC-LS-01), 2 from HCV-infected patients (HCV-121 and C346), and 2 from HCV-infected blood donors (HCV1241 and HCV1563), exhibited an identity of 93.6-97.8 percent at the whole-genome level. Compared with other HPgV-2 strains from the USA and UK, the nucleotide sequence identity was 93.7-96.2 percent. Sequence divergence was greatest at synonymous sites, with ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions of 0.125-0.150, which are consistent with other reports (1-3). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HPgV-2 strains from China, USA, and UK clustered together to form a separate branch and fell into group 1 with the closely related pegiviruses from bats and rodents (Figure 2). Other pegiviruses from human, simian, and equine sources formed group 2, in which the variants of HPgV fell into a separate clade. These results illustrate the difference between the 2 human pegiviruses (1,2,8) and the low level of genetic diversity of HPgV-2 strains (1-3).

In contrast to the data on HPgV-2 infection, we observed a high frequency of HPgV infection across all 3 populations tested (HCV-infected patients, PWID, and MSM) (Tables 1, 2). The percentage of HPgV viremia was 14.0 percent (14/86) in HCV-infected patients, 19.0 percent (40/211) in MSM, and 40.0 percent (28/70) in PWID (Table 1). Among MSM, prevalence of HPgV RNA was 28.0 percent (28/100) in those who were infected with HIV-1 alone and 33.3 percent (4/12) in those who were HIV-1/HCV co-infected (Table 1). For MSMs who were negative for both HIV-1 and HCV, 7.9 percent (7/89) were positive for HPgV RNA (Table 1).

Conclusions
-----------
We report the detection of the 2nd human pegivirus, HPgV-2, in HCV-infected (in particular HCV/HIV-1 co-infected) persons in Guangdong and Sichuan Provinces, China (Table 1). Our results and those from previous studies demonstrate that the virus occurs in several geographically distinct regions in the world (1-4,9,10).

HPgV and HPgV-2 are the only known human pegiviruses (8), and comparing their association with HCV and HIV-1 infection is of great interest. Consistent with previous reports, we found that the prevalence of HPgV viremia was 7.9 percent in HCV and HIV-1-negative MSM and 33.3-40 percent in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected MSM and PWID (Table 1). In contrast, only 0.5 percent of MSM and 0.4 percent of healthy blood donors were positive for HPgV-2 antibodies, but all were negative for HPgV-2 RNA (Table 1). These results indicate that HPgV-2 infection might be much less frequent than HPgV infection, possibly because of its low transmissibility or high clearance rate (2-4). The dramatic difference of distribution and prevalence between HPgV and HPgV-2 infections in different populations provides a clue for investigation of disease association with HPgV-2. HPgV does not cause human diseases (11) and can inhibit HIV-1 replication as well as prolong survival of HIV-1-infected and Ebola virus-infected patients (12-14). However, possible pathogenicity and disease association of HPgV-2 remain to be elucidated.

The high-risk population susceptible to HPgV-2 infection includes HCV-infected patients and, in particular, HCV/HIV-1 co-infected PWID. Most (93.3 percent) of HPgV-2 infected patients were also co-infected with HCV (1-4). Notably, the relatively high frequency of HPgV-2 RNA detection was observed in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected PWID in the Guangdong (5.7 percent) and Sichuan (3.0 percent) Provinces of China (Table 1) and in the USA (10.9 percent) (9). In contrast, a somewhat lower percentage (1.7 percent) of HCV-positive PWID in the United Kingdom were reported to be HPgV-2 RNA positive, whereas none of the 30 HIV-1 singly infected and 36 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected PWID were positive for HPgV-2 RNA (3). These discordant results warrant more studies in different countries to address the association between HPgV-2 and HCV/HIV-1 co-infection.

Our findings are subject to 2 limitations. 1st, because a limited number of samples from only 2 provinces of China were tested, the results might not represent overall prevalence of HPgV-2 infection throughout all of China. 2nd, this study was a cross-sectional rather than a longitudinal study, and, therefore, the proportion of persistent infection and natural history of HPgV-2 infection remain to be determined.

Future studies should address several questions: whether the close association between HPgV-2 and HCV infection represents a biologic dependence of these 2 viruses; how HCV/HIV-1 co-infection facilitates HPgV-2 infection; and whether HCV or HIV-1 viral proteins enhance the transmissibility or infectivity of HPgV-2. In addition, because the rarity of HPgV-2 detection in MSM could be a result of the low frequency of HCV or HIV-1 infection or the transmission route of HPgV-2, further research should aim to determine if is HPgV-2 more like a transfusion-transmitted virus rather than a sexually transmitted virus.
