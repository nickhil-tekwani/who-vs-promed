Another 3 horses have died from the hendra virus on the far north
coast of New South Wales. The latest cases were recorded on properties
at South Ballina and Mullumbimby.

It brings the number of horses killed by the virus in NSW in the past
8 weeks to 9. Another 10 horses in Queensland have died or been
euthanized since June [2011]. More than 60 people have also been
tested for hendra across NSW and Queensland.

A senior veterinarian with the NSW Department of Primary Industries,
Ian Roth, says there had more recently been hope the disease had
abated.

"The 1st one was about the 28th of June and we had 4 cases in a month.
We then had 3 weeks when we didn't have any cases and I guess we were
a little bit hopeful," Mr Roth said. "But now we've had 3 (properties)
in 2 days so we're not sure what the pattern is but I guess we just
can't relax."

The department announced yesterday that another horse had been put
down on Monday [15 Aug 2011] after contracting hendra on a property
near Ballina.

Researchers are currently working on a hendra vaccine for horses, with
12 million dollars [12 429 995 USD] promised for research by the NSW,
Queensland and Federal governments. Before June [2011] there had only
ever been one previous confirmed case of hendra in NSW.

The virus is carried by flying foxes, and the recent spate of cases
has prompted calls for fruit bat culling.

[We are saddened to hear that the outbreak of Hendra virus is
continuing.

There remains much unknown. For example, what is different this year
than in previous years that has brought such an outbreak. Culling
flying foxes is not likely to the outbreak to stop, but may stress
those remaining bats thus producing more virus. However, keeping fruit
trees, which flying foxes seem to enjoy, away from paddock areas does
seem to be a key. Keeping horses in the barn when the bats may be most
active may help diminish the transfer rate. - Mod.TG]
