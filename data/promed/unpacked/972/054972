[In response to a query as to the original reporting of the Prionics
testing results, Dr. Markus Moser of Prionics replied: - MHJ
An intermediate report (2 animals with BSE-signs out of 1265) was
communicated by the Swiss Veterinary Authorities on September 22nd, 1997
(<http://www.admin.ch/bvet/d/Presse/pm-220997.html>).
The final results were communicated in a "BSE Fact Sheet"
(<http://www.admin.ch/bvet/BSE/BSE-CH/BSEDatenblatt-e.html>), in February
or March 98 (I don't recall the exact date, the site has since been updated
to June 98), Chapter 4, last paragraph.
The current hype in the press might be due to the fact that these (not very
prominently) published facts were previously overlooked by the journalists
and were only recognized later in connection with the Prionics test
validation. It seems that the public wasn't really aware of what was
considered general knowledge by scientists: in a disease with a long
incubation period and a comparatively short period with clinical signs, a
large proportion of the infected individuals would not show clinical signs.
[In reply to the questioning that the six Prionics Test +ve animals would
have developed clinical BSE, he comments:
>From the British pathogenesis study (see also Wells et al Vet Rec 1998 Jan
31;142(5):103-106 ) we know that infectivity (as detected by transmission
to mice) as well as PrP aggregation (as seen by immunohistochemistry) can
be observed within 6 months before the occurrence of clinical symptoms. In
the Swiss culling study, both the immunohistochemical and the Prionics
immunoblot method reacted positive with 6 animals (4 of which were
identical) which may suggest that the sensitivity of the two methods are in
the same order of magnitude (although it may have to be considered that for
immunoblotting, smaller sample sizes were used, and that the samples were
from regions different from those used for immunohistochemistry (as fixed
tissue used for IHC cannot be used for immunoblotting)). If one assumes
that the Swiss and the British immunohistochemical methods have the same
sensitivity, then one may conclude that transmission experiments to mice,
immunohistochemistry and the Prionics immunoblotting test detect animals
within 6 months of the outbreak of clinical disease.
This line of argumentation is rather indirect, I admit, but Prionics does
not have the resources of performing a pathogenesis study by itself in
order to determine the exact sensitivity of the test. The fact that the
earliest detection of protease resistant prion protein coincides with
earliest detection of infectivity is good news and bad news at the same
time: it confirms that both immunohistocchemistry and the Prionics
immunoblotting test are very sensitive tools, but it also shows that the
infectivity studies using transmission to mice, which were used to
establish the "fact" that cattle meat was "safe", are less sensitive than
one would have wished for.
[In reply to a query about abbattoire testing of animals:
If I may answer this for the reference center: immunohistochemistry is not
suitable for mass-testing. The Pronics test is not just based on the
antibody but also on a faster method. Due to unique buffers used during
homogenization and protease incubation, and due to an optimized procedure,
the Prionics test represents an immunoblotting test that provides all the
information of a Western blot (identification and size-shift of PrPBSE upon
protease treatment) but can be performed within less than 7 hours directly
on homogenized tissues. You need a test that can be performed within such
short time periods to put it to work in abbattoirs.
