A total of 2919 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has been
reported in the country so far this year [2011], but there have been
no deaths due to the disease. In fact, the Health Ministry
director-general Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman said Sunday [21 Aug 2011]
in a statement that there appeared to have been a drop in reported
cases compared with 8769 cases reported all of last year [2010].

He said most cases were recorded in 5 states -- Sarawak with 914
cases, Selangor (513 cases), Johor (300), Perlis (300) and Pulau
Pinang (263).

"The National Public Health Laboratory surveillance found that human
coxsackievirus A16 and human enterovirus 71 (EV 71) were the most
common viruses causing HFMD.

The virus is spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva or
faeces of an infected person. The incubation period is between 3-5
days," he said. HFMD usually attacks infants and children under the
age of 10, causing them to run a fever, develop ulcers in the mouth,
especially on the tongue and gums, as well as blisters or rashes on
the hands and feet, he said. Dr Hasan also urged parents and
caregivers to send children to hospital or clinic immediately if they
detected such symptoms. He also asked them to practise good hygiene
and observe cleanliness at all times to prevent the spread of the
disease.

[Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a febrile sickness complex
characterized by cutaneous eruption (exanthem) on the palms and soles
with simultaneous occurrence of muco-cutanous vesiculo-ulcerative
lesions (enanthem) affecting the mouth. Infection is spread from
person to person by direct contact with infectious virus. Infectious
virus is found in the nose and throat secretions, saliva, blister
fluid, and stool of infected persons. The virus is most often spread
by persons with unwashed, virus-contaminated hands and by contact with
virus-contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are most contagious
during the 1st week of the illness.

Outbreaks of HFMDV infection are ubiquitous and only reported in
ProMED-mail when there are fatal outcomes or where the identity of the
etiologic agent has been confirmed by laboratory analysis.

HFMD occurs mainly in children under 10 years old but can also occur
in adults. Children are more likely to be at risk for infection and
illness because they are less likely than adults to have antibodies to
protect them. The illness is caused by a number of enteroviruses, with
human coxsackievirus A16 and human enterovirus 71 as the main
causative agents.

Historically, human enterovirus 71 has been associated with more
severe outcomes and fatalities. The severity of the current outbreak
in Viet Nam has been attributed to prevalence of human enterovirus 71.
However, strains of human enterovirus 71 are genetically diverse and
not always associated with severe outcomes, which may be the reason
why no deaths have been reported during the course of the current
outbreak in Malaysia (See: "Genetic diversity of enterovirus 71
isolated from cases of hand, foot and mouth disease in the 1997, 2000
and 2005 outbreaks, Peninsular Malaysia. Chua KB, Chua BH, Lee CS,
