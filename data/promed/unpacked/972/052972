10 Aug 2013 Schmallenberg virus, Romania
-------------------------------------------------
Due to technical difficulties experienced lately with the ELISA plate reader, which encountered controversial results in several cases studied in the month of July and August [2013] at the Laboratory of Veterinary Epidemiology and Economics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW, Warsaw, Poland, we consider that all the research results obtained during that period are scientifically invalidated, need to be reconsidered and the samples retested, including those that provided support for the 1st notification of the presence of antibodies against Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in Romania.

[We appreciate Dr Kaba's group for the above candid update. This group deserves appreciation and support for their initiative for SBV surveillance in cooperation with university laboratories in other countries.

The same laboratory of the Warsaw university kindly provided, earlier, information on the 1st detection of SBV antibodies in sera of Polish and Serbian cattle. This is a commendable contribution to improved transparency in relation to SBV.

We wish them early solution of the difficulties and look forward to resumption of the surveillance. - Mod.AS
