A fungus [rice blast] has destroyed 5600 hectares (13 840 acres) of
rice in Central Province, which produces the bulk of Kenya's rice,
OCHA [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] said.
This is equivalent to 10 to 20 percent of annual output and means
Kenya will have to increase imports even though global rice prices
have soared by 75 percent in the past 2 months, it said.

"This risks worsening Kenya's food insecurity and makes import of
additional quantities even more expensive," Byrs [OCHA Public
Information Officer, Geneva] said. "It is a fresh blow for this
country, where the situation remains tense."

[A serious outbreak of rice blast is being reported from the area
referred to above (see previous ProMED-mail post no. 20080402.1211).
This disease is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_. It is one
of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide with reported
losses of more than 50 percent in infected fields. Symptoms include
lesions on all parts of the shoot, stem rot, and panicle blight. When
nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield
losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering
stages, plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of
grasses and sedges can be affected by different strains of the
fungus, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited
number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is spread by infected plant debris,
mechanical means, water, and wind. Disease management may include
fungicides and cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant
varieties. The fungus is highly variable, however, and new strains
are emerging, breaking down host resistance.

The current epidemic in Kenya has been attributed largely to heavy
rains, poor cultural practices, and infected rice seed. It has been
reported that control by fungicide applications was attempted, but
that so far it was apparently not effective.
