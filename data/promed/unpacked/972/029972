CDC Confirms Two New Anthrax Cases in US
-------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday
reported 2 new cases of anthrax in New Jersey, one of them the first
person infected who did not work in a mailroom and was not exposed to
letters received at media companies in the past month.
One is an inhalational case in a postal worker and the other is a
cutaneous (skin) case in somebody who is a private citizen who does
not work in a postal facility or a media facility, and may have gotten
it through the mail,'' CDC spokeswoman Cynthia Glocker said.
The new cases brought to 15 the number of confirmed anthrax cases in
New York, New Jersey, Washington and Florida. There are another 5
suspected cases of anthrax in New York and New Jersey.

Washington DC
--------------------
Anthrax found in Supreme Court mailroom; more than 10 Washington
locations contaminated
-----------------------------
The threat of anthrax sent the Supreme Court justices packing off to
an alternative courtroom on Monday and authorities discovered fresh
contamination at the State Department and at least 2 more government
buildings.
With confirmed spores at more than 10 locations in the nation's
capital, Dr. Patrick Meehan, a spokesman for the Centers of Disease
Control and Prevention said residents need *not* fear inhalation
anthrax when they open their mail. He said they "may have a very, very
small risk of cutaneous type anthrax."
There were positive tests for anthrax at a building [Cohen Building
that houses the Voice of America and Food and Drug Administration, a
State Department building and the main Supreme Court building. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the contamination there was
in a mail handling facility across the street from the main State
Department building.
Supreme Court
------------------
The discovery of anthrax last week in a remote mail site several
blocks from the Supreme Court had already forced the closure of the
main Supreme Court building. A court spokeswoman, Kathy Arberg, said
the latest testing detected anthrax in only one place -- a portion of
the basement mailroom. Tests elsewhere in the mailroom and elsewhere
in the building showed no evidence of ontamination. "Based upon the
positive testing in the mailroom, additional testing is being
conducted today," said Arberg. No other Justice facility has tested
positive for anthrax, department spokeswoman Susan Dryden said.
US Embassy in Peru
---------------------------
He added that 6 mail bags at the US Embassy in Peru were tested and
one was found to contain traces of anthrax. "All our mail rooms have
been closed down," Boucher said. [The BBC commented that the pouch had
been sent from the department's off-site mail facility in Sterling,
Virginia, where an employee last week contracted inhalation anthrax. -

Silica in the mix
--------------------
Officials said the anthrax found in a letter to Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle included silica. "We don't know why it would be there,"
said Maj. Gen. John Parker, who heads the Army's Fort Detrick, Md.,
laboratory. Silica, or silicon dioxide, is found in nature as sand,
quartz or flint. It is a colorless, tasteless crystal that is commonly
used as a drying agent in pharmaceuticals and in food production. It
helps control caking or clumping in powered products. Parker said
officials had ruled out the presence of aluminum in the sample. That,
he said, meant there was no bentonite, a lubricant that he said would
make the spores spread through the air more easily. Officials had said
previously that the anthrax in Daschle's mail had been changed to make
it more readily float into the air, and thus become more likely to be
inhaled into the lungs.
[Earlier reports said that mixing bentonite with anthrax was an Iraqi
invention. That ´finding´ has now been discounted. - Mod.JW

[The other news services all repeated what you have read above. It is
clear that if you search, you will find -- spores spread widely from
the mail characterised by the "Daschle" letter. As yet no other
contaminated letters have been found though the spores indicate their
past presence. The quantity & quality of the environmental searches
are impressive. And the bentonite claim has been dismissed. So we are
back to a good quality spore source. - Mod.MHJ
[STOP PRESS: BBC World News announced at 19:00 EST that anthrax
contamination has also been found at a Health Department building. -
