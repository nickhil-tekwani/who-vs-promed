The director of the sexual health unit in Mount Isa [Queensland, Australia] says it has seen an increase in syphilis infection rates this year [2014].

The unit is currently dealing with an outbreak of the sexually transmitted disease and has implemented new regimes to get people tested and treated.

Dr Arun Menon said last year [2013] in the north-west it had about 45 cases of infectious syphilis but it was on the rise. "We're testing about the same number of people in the various locations where we are providing services," Dr Menon said. "So far this year [2014] in the north-west we've had about 50 cases and another 20 that have been linked to the north-west in different parts of Queensland. These are individuals who are from here but they have been diagnosed elsewhere."

He said there was still a long battle ahead to get on top of the disease. "There is a concern because we are still having babies who are being born who are at high risk of having syphilis and we are trying to again get the population to come in and be tested and we are trying to encourage doctors and nurses to test," he said. "I don't think we'll see a reduction anytime soon, I think this will carry on being a long-term problem and that is what we are doing - we are approaching it as a long-term problem."

[Queensland is divided into regions for statistical and administrative purposes. The North West Region, also known as the Gulf Country, is located along the Gulf of Carpentaria coast; its major city is Mount Isa with a population of approximately 25,000. The region has a population of 35 779, 28.1 percent of which is Indigenous and its economy is heavily dominated by the Mount Isa Mines (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Queensland).

In February 2012, ProMED-mail posted a report (Syphilis - Australia: (QL) 20120215.1042038) of a syphilis outbreak in the city of Mount Isa, a Queensland mining town, due to the activities of "illegal", "free-lance" itinerant female prostitutes (http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/coal-girls-hit-paydirt-at-mines/story-e6freoof-1226186661381), in contrast to the rest of Australia, where syphilis was occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM). In May 2012, ProMED-mail posted a report that the outbreak in Mount Isa was occurring mainly among people under 25 years of age (Syphilis - Australia (02): (QL) increased incidence, RFI 20120510.1128901) and approximately 11 per cent of 15-24 year-olds screened had syphilis (https://www.facebook.com/abcnews.au/posts/478547328841417).

Then, in August 2012, ProMED-mail reported that a syphilis outbreak was occurring in remote indigenous communities in the Mount Isa region, which was associated with cases of congenital syphilis (Syphilis - Australia (03): (QL) indigenous, RFI 20120808.1234631). The syphilis outbreak is apparently continuing into 2014 according to the news report above, but no information is given concerning any possible linkage of the outbreaks of syphilis among those who used itinerant prostitutes in Mount Isa and the outbreak among young indigenous people in remote communities in the North West Region. A more detailed description of the epidemiology of this syphilis outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
