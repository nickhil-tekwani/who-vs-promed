The state government, which is already struggling to handle the
increased number of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases in eastern
Uttar Pradesh, now faces the fresh challenge of the acute rise in the
number of cases from Bihar. At BRD medical college in Gorakhpur, about
190 cases have already been reported from Bihar this year [2011].
Doctors at the hospital said the cases are mainly from Siwan and
Gopalganj districts of Bihar. Despite special measures taken by the
government this year like launching special sanitation campaigns to
counter the spread of the disease, about 15 percent rise in the number
of AES cases has already been reported this year in the state.

"About 1360 cases of AES have already been reported this year, out of
which about 190 cases are from Bihar. We get cases from Bihar and
Nepal each year but this year, the number of cases from Bihar has gone
up by 40 percent," said KP Kushwaha, senior doctor from BRD medical
college.

[Curiously, no mention of Japanese encephalitis is made in the above
report. Previous reports from northeastern India indicated that
Japanese encephalitis virus infections were involved in some of the
encephalitis cases. It was encouraging to learn that the Indian
National Institute of Virology and, apparently, the USA CDC were
attempting to determine the etiology of the acute encephalitis
syndrome (AES) cases that are not Japanese encephalitis virus
infections. Apparently, no further information on determination of the
etiology of AES cases has been announced, since the term AES continues
to be used. Control and prevention will remain elusive until the
etiology is defined.

In the last 2 weeks, 9 children have died of suspected encephalitis,
an acute brain infection, in Bihar's Gaya district, a health official
said on Tuesday [6 Sep 2011]. The district health official said that
in the last 72 hours 4 children died of suspected encephalitis, an
infection that causes inflammation of the brain, at Anugrah Narain
Medical College and Hospital in Gaya. "Three children are battling for
life," he said. Ajay Kishor Ravi, who heads the hospital's children's
department, said that till date 36 children with suspected
encephalitis were admitted for treatment; 9 of them died. The children
reported high fever, followed by bouts of unconsciousness, and
convulsions.

Local people termed the mysterious disease as "chamki ki bimari" and
claimed that the symptoms were similar to encephalitis. Bihar Health
Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey said he was not aware of any death due
to encephalitis in Gaya. 2 months ago 51 children died in Muzaffarpur
district but the state government is yet to confirm these as
encephalitis deaths. Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam
Nabi Azad had informed the Rajya Sabha that it was an outbreak of
acute encephalitis syndrome.

[Ronan Kelly of FluTrackers (<ronankelly@comcast.net>) pointed out
that the Indian Ministry of Health and Family welfare has summarized
national totals of cases of AES and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
infections together (http://nvbdcp.gov.in/je-cd.html) as of 23 Aug
2011. The total for 2011 for that period is 3445 and 450 deaths. The
Bihar totals are 288 cases with 54 deaths. Assam Uttar Pradesh states
have had the most with 1189 cases with 228 deaths and 1071 cases with
150 deaths, respectively. It is not possible to determine the
proportion of these cases due to JEV infections. - Mod.TY]
