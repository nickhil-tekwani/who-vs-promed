[1] WHO forecast
Date: Tue 23 Sep 2014

http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/ebola-death-rate-70-percent-who-says-dire-new-forecast-n209226


World Health Organization researchers issued a dire new forecast for the EVD epidemic Tue [22 Sep 2014, one that sees 20 000 cases by 2 November [2014]. And 70 percent of patients are dying. That's a big increase over the previous estimates of a 50 percent fatality rate. Caregivers and health care workers have a high risk. More than 300 health care workers have been infected, and half of them have died.

"These data indicate that without drastic improvements in control measures, the numbers of cases of and deaths from Ebola virus disease [EVD] are expected to continue increasing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months," the WHO Ebola Response Team, led by Dr Christopher Dye, wrote in a report rushed into print by the New England Journal of Medicine.

This projection includes nearly 10 000 people in Liberia alone. WHO said earlier Mon [22 Sep 2014] that more than 5800 people had been infected with EVD and more than 2800 had died of it since the virus first broke out in Guinea in December [2013]. "The true case load, including suspected cases and undetected cases, will be higher still."

It's looking so bad that EVD could take permanent hold in West Africa, they said -- something that's never happened before. "For the medium term, at least, we must therefore face the possibility that Ebola virus disease will become endemic among the human population of West Africa," they said.

What could change that?
-----------------------
Quick action by the world, the experts said. That means sending more people to track down potential EVD cases so they can be isolated and treated, providing better hospital treatment and safer burials, and getting better buy-in from the community. In some places, residents still don't believe EVD is [caused by] a virus, and they have attacked and even killed health workers trying to spread the word about the danger. Patients are also running away and spreading the disease that way. To stop the epidemic, transmission must be cut in half, they said. "Considering the prospects for a novel EVD vaccine, an immunization coverage exceeding 50 percent would have the same effect," they wrote.

The United States is leading a new response, sending troops and supplies and offering to help coordinate help. WHO and the UN are urging other countries to help. Germany, France, Cuba, and China are among countries also sending teams and equipment.

Not as easily transmitted as influenza or measles
-------------------------------------------------
To make the forecast, the team looked at all the available data on the epidemic, which has spread more widely than any previous outbreak of EVD, in part because it broke out in an area where people travel widely across borders. It remains clear that close contact with an infected person or their bodily fluids is needed for infection to happen. There's nothing mysterious about how EVD spreads, and it's not as easily transmitted as influenza or measles.

Hemorrhage in less than 20 percent
-------------------------------
The most common 1st symptoms are fever and fatigue. Hemorrhage -- the most feared symptom -- is seen in fewer than 5 percent of patients, although about 18 percent had unexplained bleeding, the WHO team said. Forget about the tales of horrific bleeding from the eyes, nose, and mouth. Bleeding is one of the most unusual symptoms, the team of experts from around the world said. [There is no mention of hiccups, a characteristic symptom in the Kikwit epidemic & also in Uganda; see ProMED-mail posting Ebola virus disease - West Africa (86): WHO, UNSC, ECOWAS, Guinea, Liberia 20140711.2603448 & CDC MMWR archives. - Mod.JW]

EVD has an [average] incubation period of 11 days, and people cannot infect others before they begin to show symptoms -- unlike flu, which people can pass along before they even feel ill. One important number is how many other people each patient infects. It's different for each country, Dye says -- an average of 1.7 in Guinea and 1.8 in Liberia. In Sierra Leone, an infected person sickens 2 other people on average. Some patients infect many more people than that -- [more] than a dozen mourners were infected at the funeral of a single traditional healer who died in Sierra Leone, for instance. And some die or recover without infecting anybody else.

Another important number is what's called doubling time -- how long it takes for the number of cases to double. This varies greatly from country to country; in Guinea it's just under 16 days, in Liberia it's nearly 23 days, and in Sierra Leone it's 30 days. That's what leads to the projection of 20 000 cases by [2 Nov 2014].

Most of those infected are ages 15 to 44, although people those ages only account for 44 percent of the population in those countries. Older patients are more likely to die, and those who have diarrhea, hemorrhage, difficulty breathing, or confusion also seem more likely to die. Most of those who died succumbed on average 4 days after they were admitted to a hospital or clinic, and if someone survived, it was usually 11 days before they were better enough to go home, on average. It's possible that patients who get hospital care live longer, the researchers said, but there's not enough information to say that for sure.

Patients get vastly different care, depending on where they are treated; 3 out of 4 patients treated in the USA have recovered or nearly recovered and the 4th has released little information about his condition. They all got the best possible care, including carefully measured and balanced rehydration, 24-hour nursing care, immaculate conditions, and experimental treatments, including drugs and transfusions of blood from patients who have recovered. In West Africa, some lucky patients get good hospital care that includes saline [solution] to replace fluids lost to vomiting and diarrhea, antibiotics to prevent other infections, and pain control. But many are given little more than a bed or a space on the floor, and many are also turned away to die at home or in the streets. So it's hard to say what will save someone's life.

The report strongly suggests what doctors are saying is true -- there's nothing unusual about the virus itself, say Dr Peter Piot of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped discover EVD, and Dr Jeremy Farrar of Britain's Wellcome Trust. It's spreading because of dysfunctional health systems, a lack of action by local and international governments, and a population that hasn't caught on immediately to the dangers and what to do about EVD, they wrote in a commentary in the journal.

Stopping the epidemic
---------------------
"Classic 'outbreak control' efforts are no longer sufficient for an epidemic of this size," they added. "Rather, what's required is a large-scale, coordinated humanitarian, social, public health, and medical response, combining classic public health measures with safe and effective interventions including behavioral changes, therapies, and, when possible, vaccination." It will take both a "massive" response and, probably, the use of new treatments and vaccines to control the epidemic, Farrar and Piot wrote.

Laying the groundwork for the effective and coherent action necessary to stop the EVD outbreak in West Africa that has sickened more than 5800 people and killed some 2800, an advance team of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response [UNMEER] arrived today in Accra, Ghana to set up the operation's headquarters.

Another advance team of the Organization's 1st ever mission dealing with a public health crisis, to be known as UNMEER, also arrived in Liberia, one of the countries, along with Guinea and Sierra Leone, which has been hardest hit by the unprecedented outbreak.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric also announced today [22 Sep 2014] that the world body has established the Ebola Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund to ensure a coherent UN system contribution to the overall response. The Fund seeks contributions from Member States, regional legislative bodies, inter-governmental or nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and individuals. Donors can also choose to channel their contributions directly to UN agencies... -- more

1st African Union (AU) EVD team arrives in Liberia
--------------------------------------------------
The African Union (AU) said on Mon [22 Sep 2014] in a statement that its 1st team combating the EVD outbreak in West Africa has arrived in Monrovia, Liberia. The team comprising of both medical and non-medical support personnel is expected to swing into action providing support to the Liberian government in curbing the menace of the deadly Ebola virus disease (EVD).

Deputy chief of protocol at the Liberian ministry of foreign affairs appreciated the willingness of the team and encouraged them in the mission to win what he called "the Ebola war". Re-deployments to different counties in Liberia are expected to commence soon, said the statement.

The UK is leading the international drive against EVD in Sierra Leone
---------------------------------------------------------------------
British military and humanitarian staff have arrived in Freetown to spearhead the UK's GBL 100 million [about USD 164 million] mission to contain and control the outbreak. Construction begins on the UK medical facility in Sierra Leone [see photo at source URL above]. More than 40 military personnel and humanitarian staff have arrived to oversee the construction of the UK's medical facility and assist with the UK's response.

The latest update follows a meeting of the UK's emergency committee COBR [Cabinet Office Briefing Room] this afternoon [23 Sep 2014]. Chaired by the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond from New York, the meeting reviewed progress on the UK's commitment to boost significantly public health provision across Sierra Leone, including support for 700 EVD treatment beds. The UK has published an action plan setting out how it will work alongside the United Nations and Sierra Leone, to mobilise international medical teams and support further treatment centres.

[5] Sierra Leone: more cases found during lockdown

Sierra Leone recorded 130 new cases of EVD during a 4-day lockdown and is waiting for test results on a further 39 suspected cases, Stephen Gaojia, head of the Ebola Emergency Operations Centre, said on Mon [22 Sep 2014]. The country had ordered its 6 million citizens to stay indoors until Sunday night [21 Sep 2014] in the most extreme strategy employed by a West African nation since the start of an epidemic that has infected [more than 5800] people since March [2014] and killed [more than 2800] of them. "The exercise has been largely successful ...

The outreach was just overwhelming. There was massive awareness of the disease," Gaojia said, noting that authorities reached more than 80 percent of the households they had intended to target. Sierra Leone now needs to focus on treatment and case management and it urgently needs treatment centres in all its 14 districts as well as "foot soldiers" in clinics and hospitals, he said. "We need clinicians, epidemiologists, lab technicians, infection-control practitioners, and nurses," he said... -- more

[6] Sierra Leone: nurse evacuated

Child with EVD bites nurse
--------------------------
Swiss authorities say a male nurse who was bitten by an EVD patient while working in West Africa has been flown to Switzerland as a precaution. The health ministry says the unidentified man was working for an international organization in Sierra Leone when he was bitten by a child infected with EVD on Sat [20 Sep 2014]. The ministry says the nurse was wearing protective gear and is unlikely to have contracted the disease. It said the man, who was flown to Switzerland by a private transport company Mon [22 Sep 2014], will be kept under observation at Geneva's University Hospital for the incubation period of 3 weeks. The ministry said it was the 1st medical transport to Switzerland from the EVD-affected region.

[Unless teeth penetrated the protective gear, this sounds like an expensive overabundance of caution. It should have been safe for him and any co-passengers to take a regular commercial flight -- but perhaps none is available any more in Sierra Leone, only charter? - Mod.JW]

120-bed EVD treatment center opens in Liberia
---------------------------------------------
As the opening ceremony for a 120-bed EVD treatment facility constructed by the government of Liberia with technical support from the World Health Organization was going on, 6 ambulances packed with 24 suspected EVD patients were already on standby. At the side entrance of the building were some patients who managed to walk with the help of their relatives to the center at the Old Island Clinic on Bushrod Island [Monrovia]. Some groaned in pain as others lay on the ground under the hot Sunday afternoon sun, waiting and praying for the formalities to be over so the staff could let them in to the facility to begin to receive care... -- more

[8] Liberia, Sierra Leone: community care centres planned

New effort to fight EVD in Liberia would move infected patients out of their homes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking for a new approach to blunt the EVD epidemic sweeping West Africa, the Liberian government, the World Health Organization, and their nonprofit partners are launching an ambitious but controversial program to move infected people out of their homes and into ad hoc centers that will provide rudimentary care, officials said [Mon 22 Sep 2014].

The effort, which is expected to begin in the next few weeks, is an intermediate step, officials said. The goal is to reduce the chances that EVD patients will infect their own families and others while ensuring that they receive basic care -- such as food, water, and pain medicine -- at a time when many hospitals and treatment centers are closed.

The initiative also is a tacit acknowledgment that it could be weeks, even months, before new treatment facilities promised by the USA and others are operational. Continued reliance on home-based care doesn't do much good, officials said, in taming a devastating epidemic in a country where large groups of people live in crowded, urban settings.

The proposed community care centers, as they are dubbed by officials, would have between 15-30 beds. Ultimately, as many 70 centers could be set up across Liberia, if the strategy proves successful. Such a program has never been tried on such a large scale. A similar effort is being discussed for Sierra Leone... -- more

[There is an explanatory graphic of the layout of such a center. I understand that cholera cots are under consideration for beds -- cheap, light, folding, practical camp beds with a hole in the middle for a bucket underneath, easy to disinfect by one person compared to metal frame beds with mattresses which need to be handled and disinfected by 2 people. - Mod.JW
