Pokkah boeng, a new major threat for sugarcane, [is] an issue that has gone under the radar. Farmers are worried about its effects on their crops. The disease targets the base of the plants, which ultimately damages the crops. It is always advised to spray the fields as soon as signs of the disease appear to minimise the yield loss of the crops. There are different types of pokkah boeng, and while sugarcane can resist most of them, some are lethal.

Research [see link below] found that production was affected between 1-90%. It also said that incidents of pokkah boeng were reported in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Assam, Tamil Nadu, and Bihar. One of the main reasons that the disease has become a major concern is because of recent changes that the fungus has gone through that makes it more resistant to high temperatures and other external factors.

However, an early response can save almost all the produce, and thus the farmers must be educated on this matter to adopt measures to save sugarcane from the menace of pokkah boeng.

[Pokkah boeng (PB; derived from Javanese for 'distorted') affects sugar cane and related grasses (_Saccharum_ species and hybrids) as well as sorghum. It is considered a re-emerging disease with recent major yield losses in most sugar cane producing regions, including South Africa, Brazil, Malaysia, India, and China. PB is also considered an emerging disease of sorghum in India (see links below).

The disease is caused by different members of the _Fusarium fujikuroi_ species complex, depending on the region. Symptoms vary with crop varieties and infecting fungi, but may include distortion, malformation, and shortening at the top of the central shoot and on leaves; chlorosis of leaf bases; stem rot; breaks in the rind ('knife cut symptoms'), which may result in stems breaking off. Disease development is favoured by warm, humid conditions.

Spores are mainly spread by air currents, but can also be transmitted with infected setts, irrigation water, splashed rain, soil, and human/insect activities. Disease management may include fungicide sprays (agrochemicals, copper), phytosanitation (removal of affected plants), and use of crop varieties with reduced PB sensitivity.
