France: 9th variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob victim also blood donor
-------------------------------------------------------------
On Tue 23 Nov 2004 the French Health Ministry launched the 2nd hunt
in little more than a month for people who had received blood donated
by a patient with the deadly human form of mad-cow disease. The
individual -- the 9th French case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD] -- had
donated blood several times between 1984 and 2002, the French Health
Ministry said.
"Specific measures have been taken, as these donations were used for
transfusions of red blood cells and platelets and for products
derived from blood," the Ministry said. Platelets are clotting agents
which staunch loss of blood from wounds. "Recipients of the blood and
platelet transfusions will be advised by their doctor as to the
nature of the risk and precautions to take," the Ministry said. "As
for the blood derivation products, the transmission risk has not been
established. If it does exist, it is in any case reduced by the
various stages in the manufacturing process."
On 21 Oct 2004, the Ministry said it was tracing 10 people who had
received a blood transfusion from the country's 8th victim of vCJD.
The patient, "a young person who is still alive," had donated blood
several times between 1993 and 2003.
vCJD is a human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in
which a rogue prion protein proliferates in the brain, turning it
spongy. The disease is believed to have leapt the species barrier to
humans who ate beef from infected cattle. The epicentre of the BSE
outbreak was Britain, which exported cattle and beef products to many
countries within the European Union and further afield. BSE came to
the fore in the late 1980s, but the source was only curtailed in 1996
with the introduction of tough EU-wide laws on animal feed, the
slaughter of suspect animals and the ban on the sale of animal parts
most likely to have the prions.
So far 146 people have died of vCJD in Britain, where there are also
5 suspected cases, according to figures obtained Tuesday on the
official British vCJD website
(<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk>).
After France with 9 cases, come Ireland with 2 cases (one of whom had
lived in England), followed by Canada, Italy and the United States,
with one death each, according to official tallies. [The Canadian and
US cases had also spent time in Britain. - Mod.CP]).

[As yet there is no positive evidence of transmission of vCJD by
blood products. The increasing number of individuals who are known to
have received potentially contaminated donations, however, will
provide the basis for a preliminary risk assessment. - Mod.CP]
