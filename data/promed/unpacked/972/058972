In France, another tomato virus previously not yet recorded in the country has been detected. The Ministry of Agriculture announced that the "Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus" (ToLCNDV) was identified for the 1st time in the country in the regions of Occitanie and Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te-d'Azur.

Zucchini plants were found to be infected in nurseries for production of seed and seedlings, both for commercial use and sale to the public. Precautionary measures have been taken to prevent the virus from spreading on tools or by insects. The infected plants were destroyed under strict safety regulations and government control.

According to the ministry, the source and means of introduction of the pathogen which so far has only a limited distribution in the EU are also being investigated. In the next growing season, controls will be strengthened to ensure the success of eradication.

[_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV; genus _Begomovirus_) has been reported to cause severe yield losses on tomato and watermelon crops on the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the tomato leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades of the genus. Known species in these clades cause similar diseases on solanaceous and other crops and are considered to be the biggest constraint to solanaceous and cucurbit crops, both in terms of yield losses (up to 100 percent in tomato) and loss of fruit quality.

Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes). Many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted. Whiteflies in themselves are serious pests of many vegetable crops. If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control, as well as elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

ToLCNDV was limited to Asia until it was reported from Europe for the 1st time in 2013 on cucurbits in Spain (ProMED-mail post 20131223.2131729). It has since also been reported from several other countries in the Mediterranean region. The source of the Mediterranean incursion so far remains unknown.

Novel viruses have been shown to emerge from recombination events during co-infections of ToLCNDV and other begomoviruses (see links below). Such new viruses have, for example, been identified in the Mediterranean region causing the severe damage to cucurbit crops, but poorly infecting tomatoes. The new recombinant viruses are often more aggressive and have a widened host range, compared to each of the partners, and so pose an increased risk to solanaceous and cucurbit crops worldwide.
