Build-up of Tick Population in the Stavropol Area
-------------------------------------------------
STAVROPOL: An abundance of ticks infected with Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic
Fever (CCHF) virus has been observed in the Stavropol area. The Stavropol
Regional Sanitary Surveillance Centre has reported that the death of a
20-year-old herdsman in the Novoselitsky district was associated with tick
bites, and that more than 100 people are currently under medical
observation. Residents in the region have been encouraged to refrain from
holiday trips to forests.
CCHF has occurred in the territory for 3 years in succession. Last year 3
CCHF virus-infected people died, and 1400 people sought medical attention.
According to local epidemiologists, the tick population has increased
[incrementally because of [repeated warm and snowless winters in the
Stavropol area.

[This report announces the death of the first patient admitted to hospital
in the 2001 seasonal outbreak - see previous post: Crimean-Congo hem. fever
- Russia (Stavropol & Dag... 20010426.0819). CCHF virus is endemic in the
Stavropol region and CCHF may become an increasing problem in the future
because of the apparent build-up of the vector population. Ribavirin
administration is an effective but expensive treatment. Tick
disinfestation, the option favored in Stavropol, will be difficult to
achieve in forested regions. - Mod.CP
