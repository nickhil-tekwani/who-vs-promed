ROUNDWORMS, HUMAN EX RACCOONS - USA (CALIFORNIA)

[This article refers to _Baylisascaris procyonis_ also known as the raccoon
roundworm. Studies have shown up to 50-60% of raccoons are asymptomatically
infected with the organism. In contrast in humans there is neural larva
migrans or cerebrospinal nematodiasis. In the raccoon, the organism (_B.
procyonis_) lives in the small intestine. In humans, dogs and intermediate
hosts it invades other organs, the central nervous system (including the
brain) and the eye.
The organism (_B. procyonis_) is distributed throughout North America with
a predominance in northern rather than southern areas, including Canada, as
well as in Europe.
The adult worm can grow to 14 to 18 cm long by 0.8 cm diameter. The eggs
are ovoid, with a finely pitted outer shell; passed in one-cell stage; 70x
55 microns. The migrating larvae reach a length of 1.5 to 2.0 mm in size.
The adult worms live in the small intestine of the raccoons and lay eggs
that are later shed in the feces. After 3-4 weeks in the environment, the
eggs are infective and are eaten by young raccoons. Older raccoons are
frequently infected by eating an intermediate host such as mouse, squirrel
or bird that is infected with the larvae.
In the case of the intermediate host, approximately 5-7% of the larvae
migrate to the brain where there is extensive damage due to a secondary
inflammatory response in the brain. Larvae can migrate throughout the body,
resulting in fever, enlarged liver and respiratory problems. Larvae have
also been demonstrated to migrate to the eye, resulting in photophobia and
vision loss. - MP]

Raccoon Parasite Poses Risk to Children
---------------------------------------
Eggs from a roundworm parasite transmitted by raccoons are found in high
amounts in some areas of California, and pose a substantial risk of
infection to children.
The study was prompted by a recent near-fatal case of roundworm infection
in a child from Pacific Grove, Dr. Gabriel P. Roussere of San Jose State
University told Reuters Health. The roundworm is not very dangerous in
raccoons, but in children, it can cause brain damage, blindness or even
death, depending on how many eggs the child gets in its mouth. But he
cautioned that infection is pretty rare, considering how many raccoons live
in these areas.

Raccoons like to defecate in common areas called latrines, where the
roundworm eggs can pile up. "Then a child comes along and plays on the
ground where the latrine is and accidentally ingests the eggs," he said.
"That's where you get the problems."
Roussere's team surveyed private residences for raccoon latrine sites in
Pacific Grove and Carmel, which are overpopulated with raccoons, and found
199 latrines at 130 sites. About half of the sites in both places actually
had roundworm eggs. The majority of latrines were either on the roof or on
the ground, with much lower numbers on tree stumps, wood piles, and in the
forks of trees. Roussere pointed out that the parasite can remain
infectious for years, depending on the conditions.
One way to prevent infection is to obviously avoid raccoon latrines,
Roussere said. Latrines can also be cleaned up by putting the feces into a
sealed container while wearing gloves and throwing the container away.
Alternatively, he said that people can burn the feces and the soil with a
torch in cases where the latrines are on the ground.[Sic]
