A recently published investigation has attributed a French outbreak of asymptomatic hepatitis E to the consumption of a piglet prepared with raw pork liver stuffing. "Results of the epidemiological and veterinary investigations suggest that this outbreak was due to contaminated spit-roasted piglet," the researchers wrote. "In industrialized countries, acute [hepatitis E virus (HEV)] infections are an emerging concern and clusters of cases linked to HEV foodborne transmission remain rare and small. To our knowledge, only 4 previously published investigations revealed clinical HEV strains homologous to strains recovered from food leftovers."

In December 2013, 3 cases of HEV on a coastal island in France were reported to the country's public health surveillance. The cases were
detected in serum samples using reverse transcription-PCR, with all strains belonging to the same sequence subtype. Those infected reported attending a wedding where a spit-roasted piglet stuffed with a raw stuffing -- composed of minced liver and heart, vegetables and wheat semolina -- was served.

The researchers also interviewed 111 other attendees via telephone to determine demographics, symptoms, associated medical attention and exposures to food and drink served. Attendees were encouraged to discuss or receive testing with their general practitioners, creating a cohort of 38 sampled participants with no evidence of past HEV infection. Positive cases were compared with the outbreak strain by phylogenetic analysis, as well as with identified samples from the piglet's herd and from wastewater collected from plants on the island.

Along with the 3 confirmed index cases, public health surveillance identified 14 new cases of potential HEV infection. The median age of these patients was 52 years, 82.4 percent were female, 2 were hospitalized and all but 1 were from the island where the incident occurred. Only 5 of the cases showed symptoms, implying that 70.6 percent of identified cases were asymptomatic.

Piglet stuffing was consumed by more than half of identified cases, and consumption was independently associated with acute HEV infection (RR = 1.69; 95 percent CI, 1.04-2.73). All 9 samples collected from the farm where the piglet was reared were positive for HEV, and HEV RNA was detected in wastewater samples collected at 2 treatment stations 6 days after the wedding. Phylogenetic analysis of strains collected from the farm and the wastewater were 100 percent identical and 99-99.6 percent similar to the 3 clinical strains recovered from index cases.

"Our investigation attributed the outbreak to the consumption of undercooked stuffing partly made from a piglet's liver. Our paper illustrates and confirms the need to cook thoroughly pig liver-based food," the researchers concluded.

Of the 4 recognized genotypes of hepatitis E, types 3 and 4 are zoonotic pathogens. The following is in part derived from Pavio N, Meng X-J, Renou C: Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks. Vet Res 2010; 41(6): 46. doi: 10.1051/vetres/2010018; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865210/:

"The particularity of HEV is that, among all known major hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D and E), HEV is the only one with certain genotypes (3 and 4) with animal reservoirs. Swine HEV was initially isolated and genetically characterized from pigs in the USA in 1997, even though HEV antibodies and RNA were reportedly detected from pigs in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, but the identity of the virus infecting the Nepalese pigs was not determined in that study. More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with Hepatitis-Splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits, and rats."

Accumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmission through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan. Thus, zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E raises an important public health concern over food safety and zoonotic risk. - Mod.LL
