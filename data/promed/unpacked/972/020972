It was not the fish of the day that killed [an 81-year-old male
retiree] but, just 12 hours after dining with his wife, at the
upmarket Tables restaurant in Pymble [a Sydney suburb] on Fri 12 Jan
2007, [he] was dead. He had suffered from severe vomiting and
diarrhoea within an hour of leaving the Pacific Highway restaurant
about 9:30 pm to return to the couple's unit, Westmead Coroners Court
heard yesterday [26 Mar 2008].

An investigation by the NSW Food Authority had discovered the toxic
vegetable pathogen _Bacillus cereus_ in an asparagus cream sauce
served to him and 14 other customers that night who had ordered the
fish of the day, snapper, Inspector Dean Lindley of Hornsby police
told the coroner, Jane Culver. It is alleged the sauce, a sample of
which was seized by a Food Authority inspector hours after [the
case's wife] found her husband dead the next morning, was up to 48
hours old when it was served to him. Inspector Lindley told the court
there was evidence that [he] had spent the night vomiting as his wife
slept. A food inspector, Bryan Biffin, went to the restaurant with
police and took samples of the previous night's food stored in a cool
room. That included snapper fillets, potato and smoked salmon salad
and creme brulee, all of which were found to be free of any pathogens.

Inspector Lindley said he was later contacted by Mr Biffin, who said
he had taken a sample of cream asparagus sauce he had found in the
restaurant after police left. It had been served with the fish of the day.

"The sauce had subsequently been analysed by the Division of
Analytical Laboratories and had been found to contain the pathogen
_Bacillus cereus_ at a level of 9.8 million parts ..." he said. "Mr
Biffin informed me that the toxic level of this pathogen is 1 million
parts ..." Biffin further stated that in his experience this pathogen
thrives in an environment where the food is heated and cooled over a
period of time. During the course of the investigation I came to the
opinion that the deceased had eaten the asparagus sauce. The sauce at
the time of consumption was contaminated by the pathogen _Bacillus
cereus_ after having been repeatedly subjected to temperature abuse
in that it was heated and cooled a number of times over 48 hours by
restaurant staff."

Police were only able to locate 7 other patrons of 14 who had dined
on the fish of the day that night at the restaurant. Of those, 2 had
said that they had experienced a reaction to something after they
left. They included a man who broke out in a rash and a woman who
vomited that night. At the time she thought her reaction was due to
her treatment for cancer.

The restaurant co-owner and principal chef Kim de Laive told the
court ... that his fellow chef, Douglas Gunn, had prepared the sauce
dishes, including the cream asparagus, the night before for use that
Friday [11 Jan 2008]. He said it was the restaurant's practice to
dispose of asparagus sauce if it was exposed to room temperature for
more than 4 hours, and was unaware that the Australian food standards
required it to be disposed after 2 hours. Mr de Laive said he could
only assume that one of the apprentices had put the sauce back into
the fridge after its use earlier in the day and it had been taken out
again that night but he had not asked any of the apprentices about it.

When the restaurant's co-owner, Daniel Brukark, entered the witness
box, counsel for the Food Authority counsel, Patrick Saidi, revealed
the authority was prosecuting Mr Brukark's company, Dan Brook
Investments, for failing to place labels with dates on its sauce
containers, an offence which carries a 2-year prison term if a
director or chef is convicted.

The inquest continues today.

[_B. cereus_, a gram-positive aerobic spore-former, causes 2 types of
afebrile, usually self-limited, toxin-induced, food-borne illness.
One (emetic) type, in which the preformed, heat-stable toxin is
produced in the contaminated food, is characterized by nausea,
vomiting and abdominal cramps, and has an incubation period of 1 to 6
hours. It resembles _Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning in its
symptoms and short incubation period. The 2nd (diarrheal) type, in
which the toxin is produced in the bowel lumen following _B. cereus_
bowel colonization, is characterized primarily by abdominal cramps
and diarrhea, following a longer incubation period of 8 to 16 hours;
it resembles food poisoning caused by _Clostridium perfringens_.

The patient in the news release most likely had the emetic type. This
short-incubation form is most often associated with rice dishes that
have been cooked and then held at warm temperatures for several
hours; however, other starchy foods such as potato, pasta and cheese
products have also been implicated. Food mixtures such as sauces,
puddings, soups, casseroles, pastries, and salads have frequently
been incriminated in food poisoning outbreaks. The disease is
diagnosed by the isolation of _B. cereus_ from the incriminated food
in large numbers (greater than 106 organisms/g), indicative of active
growth and proliferation of the organism and is consistent with a
potential hazard to health (see
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap12.html>).
