Update on West Nile Virus Infections in Recipients of Blood Transfusions
-----------------------------------------------
CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Health Resources and
Services Administration, in collaboration with blood collection agencies
and state and local health departments, continue to investigate West Nile
virus (WNV) infections in recipients of blood transfusion. During the
period 28 Aug to 16 Oct 2002, CDC received reports from 14 states of 25
patients with West Nile meningoencephalitis (WNME) and 4 with other
WNV-associated illnesses diagnosed after receiving blood components in the
month before illness onset. All 29 of these patients resided in areas with
high levels of WNV activity. CDC has been notified of one additional case,
but demographic and clinical information is pending. Investigations are
ongoing to determine whether transfusion was the source of WNV
transmission. To date, 4 investigations provide evidence that WNV can be
transmitted through blood transfusion.
Of the 29 cases, 14 (48 percent) were reported since 1 Oct 2002. Of the 24
patients for whom an illness onset date was specified, illness began in
July (2 patients), August (8), September (13), and October (one); one
additional patient, an organ donor, had West Nile viremia at the time of
organ recovery in late July 2002 following receipt of multiple blood
transfusions (1). Among these patients, the reason for hospitalization or
the underlying conditions included a surgical procedure or obstetric
delivery (8); solid organ transplantation (4 patients who received an organ
from different donors who did not have evidence of WNV infection at the
time of organ recovery); hematologic conditions (including myelodysplasia
[3 patients], acute myelogenous leukemia [5], acute lymphocytic leukemia
[one], non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [one], thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
[one]); and other medical conditions (6 patients). These 29 patients
received blood components from a median of 17 donors (range: 2 to 185
donors). Among 9 patients who died, WNME was the probable cause of death.
Among the 4 cases that provided evidence that WNV can be transmitted
through blood transfusion, 2 patients developed confirmed WNME after
receiving different blood components derived from a single blood donation
that was subsequently found to have evidence of WNV (2). In follow-up
testing, this donor seroconverted and developed WNV IgM antibody. In
another case, WNV was isolated from a withdrawn unit of frozen plasma from
the suspected donation, indicating that the virus can survive in some blood
components (1). The donor of this plasma subsequently developed an acute
febrile illness and seroconverted following the suspect collection. In a
fourth case, a patient who had been hospitalized for 65 days developed WNME
after receiving a component derived from a suspected donation that
contained WNV RNA. Follow-up found that the donor had developed a febrile
illness compatible with WNV-associated fever within days of the suspect
donation; serology testing is pending.
Cases of WNV infection in patients who have received blood transfusions
within the 4 weeks preceding illness onset should be reported to CDC
through state and local public health authorities. Serum or tissue samples
should be retained for later studies. In addition, cases of WNV infection
in persons with illness onset within 2 weeks after blood donation should be
reported. Prompt reporting of these cases will facilitate withdrawal of
potentially infectious blood components.
