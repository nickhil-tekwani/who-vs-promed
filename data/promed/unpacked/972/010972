A fatal outbreak of legionnaires' disease that struck Washington Heights in October [2018] sickened a total of 32 people, a city Health Department Spokesman said.

The city Health Department's investigation into the outbreak is "nearing its conclusion," the spokesman said. A previous update from city officials regarding the outbreak occurred on October 11, when acting Health Commissioner Dr Oxiris Barbot revealed that 16 people contracted the disease, with one case proving fatal. While the total patient count has doubled, there remains only one recorded fatal case, a city Health Department spokesman said.

Following the recent outbreak, city health officials tested cooling towers of 20 buildings in Washington Heights for signs of the _Legionella_ bacteria, Barbot said in October [2018]. Preliminary test results at 11 buildings prompted officials to order the buildings to conduct biocide remediation. Preliminary results may indicate the presence of either dead bacteria or bacteria growth. Buildings where the growth of _Legionella_ bacteria is found are ordered to conduct a full cleaning and disinfecting of cooling towers.

The October [2018] outbreak was the 2nd major legionnaires' disease outbreak of the year [2018] for Washington Heights. An outbreak that occurred over the summer sickened 27 people, killing one. The summer outbreak -- which ended in mid August [2018] -- was traced back to The Sugar Hill Project, a high-rise building on St Nicholas Avenue near West 155th Street. Officials ordered The Sugar Hill Project to clean and disinfect its cooling systems due to the building's proximity to the new outbreak. The cleaning was completed on [5 Oct 2018] health officials said.

The city sees an average of 200 to 500 cases of legionnaires' disease each year, health officials said. The disease cannot be spread from one person to another, city health officials said.

[Other than a doubling of cases from 16 to 32, the news report above adds no new information concerning the 2nd legionnaires' disease outbreak in 2018 in the lower Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City. We are not told when the 11 cooling towers were remediated and if cases continued to occur more than 10 days after the last cooling tower was remediated, which would suggest that the source has not as yet been identified.

Washington Heights is a mainly residential neighborhood in the northern portion of the New York City borough of Manhattan, in the US state of New York; Washington Heights is bounded on the south by West 115th Street and on the north by the neighborhood of Inwood (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan).
