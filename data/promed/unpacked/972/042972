Health officials are hunting for the source of the latest cholera outbreak
after two more cases were confirmed yesterday. One of the new victims, a
48-year-old woman from Shamshuipo, had eaten in a restaurant in Wong Tai
Shin which bought seafood from the same Tai Kok Tsui supplier as Causeway
Bay's Tao Heung restaurant, which was ordered closed after three of its
patrons were struck down.
Six cases of cholera have been confirmed in the past week, bringing the
total infected this year to 14 - equal to the number for the whole of last
year.
A 56-year-old man from Sai Kung, who was on the mainland during the 5
days' incubation period, was confirmed to be infected with the less common
0-139 type cholera. There were two more suspected cases - two men, aged 21
and 33.
Health officials said the seafood supplier was a possible source of
contamination.
Supplier Cheung Fat said all its imported seafood had health certificates
from authorities in Australia, where it originated, and Hong Kong. A
health Department spokesman said there was no indication of a large-scale
outbreak.
"Most of the cases have their own confined origins. It doesn't mean there
is a trend for the disease to spread on a large scale," he said.
Health officials will decide today if the Tao Heung restaurant may reopen
after it was disinfected.
Owner of the Tao Heung chain, Chung Wai-ping, said it had stopped ordering
lobster from Cheung Fat. "About four or five shops in our chain used to
order seafood from it," he said.
