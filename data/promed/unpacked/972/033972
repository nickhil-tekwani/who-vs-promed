I collected today at the National Foundation of Health (Fundacao Nacional
de Saude - FNS), Regional Coordination of Santa Catarina, the following
data for 1998:
- foci of _Aedes aegypti_ 2 municipalities;
- foci of _Aedes albopictus_ 16 municipalities;
- foci of both 8 municipalities.
_Aedes albopictus_ is well established in the northeastern part of the State,
in the important industrial city of Joinville. They are having great
difficulty
[with surveillance, due to shortage of money and personnel.
According to the FNS, the foci in the western part of the State are probably
related to the infestation of the nearby Argentinian Province, but they do
not yet have precise information on this. [Can anyone from Argentina
provide information about this?
There are about 16 suspected cases of dengue, 3 of them confirmed, but none
of them was proved to be autochthonous [i.e. they could have come from
out of state - Mod.JW.
