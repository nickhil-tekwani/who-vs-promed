[1] AP policy on reporting suspected cases of Ebola in USA & Europe

Advisory on Ebola coverage
--------------------------
Editors:

We're increasingly hearing reports of "suspected" cases of Ebola in the United States and Europe. The AP has exercised caution in reporting these cases and will continue to do so.

Most of these suspected cases turn out to be negative. Our bureaus monitor them, but we have not been moving stories or imagery simply because a doctor suspects Ebola and routine precautions are taken while the patient is tested. To report such a case, we look for a solid source saying Ebola is suspected and some sense the case has caused serious disruption or reaction. Are buildings being closed and substantial numbers of people being evacuated or isolated? Is a plane being diverted? Is the suspected case closely related to another, confirmed Ebola case?

When we do report a suspected case, we will seek to keep our stories brief and in perspective.

The AP

[Note that the Associated Press (AP) did not refer to suspected cases in Africa. ProMED-mail has been independently following a similar editorial policy in recent weeks. However, in response to a plea to post all unconfirmed reports of suspected Ebola cases and quarantines, in order for readers to be able to make up their own minds as to the severity of the potential threat worldwide, we are posting those that have come to our notice since the beginning of November 2014, and will continue to post similar updates. - Mod.JW]
