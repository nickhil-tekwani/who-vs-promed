For members of the University of California at Berkeley community,
fever, headaches, muscle aches and fatigue could spell more than a
common cold; they could mean a case of the mumps.

The university community is experiencing an outbreak of the viral
infection after several cases of mumps were confirmed in students last
Thursday [29 Sep 2011], campus health officials said. On Tuesday [4
Oct 2011], UC Berkeley's health services website posted an alert about
the outbreak, encouraging all Cal students, faculty and staff --
regardless of their vaccination history -- to receive an additional
dose of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, or MMR. Most people
receive 2 doses of MMR, with the 1st administered at 12 to 15 months
of age and the 2nd given any time at least 4 weeks after the 1st dose.
Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus originating from the
mouth, nose or throat of an infected person.

"University Health Services and the City of Berkeley's Public Health
Division are working closely with the California Department of Public
Health to limit (the) spread of the disease," the alert read. Members
of the UC Berkeley community should review their vaccination history,
and health officials recommend that people seek vaccination if they
are not sure whether they have received 2 doses of MMR. Officials also
said that a 3rd MMR dose may be helpful in stopping mumps outbreaks.

The cases confirmed last week involved students residing on the
Clark-Kerr campus, which is about a half a mile south of the main
campus, and living in the Cloyne student cooperative on the north side
of campus. A suspected case also involved a student residing in the
Cheney Hall dormitory. The number of confirmed cases was not provided
in the alert.

Symptoms generally develop 16 to 18 days after exposure to the virus
but may manifest anywhere between 14 to 25 days after exposure, health
officials said. Those who may have been exposed to mumps should be
alert for symptoms including fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue
and loss of appetite, as well as swollen or tender salivary glands
under the ears, jaw or under the tongue on one or both sides of the
face.

University health officials advise those who may be infected to stay
home and contact a health care provider. UC Berkeley students or Tang
Center patients may contact the nurse advice line at (510) 643-7197.
Calls to representatives from University Health Services and the City
of Berkeley's Public Health Division seeking comment were not
immediately returned today [5 Oct 2011].

[In the absence of information concerning the number of confirmed
cases of mumps virus infection, it is difficult to assess the
seriousness of this outbreak. However, it is likely that this outbreak
of mumps, as has occurred recently in this age group elsewhere, is
another consequence of the recent decline in uptake of the MMR
vaccine, which has been the cause of the recent upsurge in cases of
measles. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
