To win the game of Clue, you have to decipher the killer, the room where the murder happened, and the weapon. For example: Colonel Mustard in the library with a candlestick.

Now, imagine you have no idea what the weapons are.

That's the predicament scientists have been in for over 25 years as they tried to nail down what was killing bald eagles in the southeastern United States. Teams of researchers at the University of Georgia's Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and the Institute of Pharmacy at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany have finally put the clues together and solved the mystery.

Eagles began dying in large numbers in 1994 because of a disease called avian vacuolar myelinopathy that caused holes to form in the white matter of their brains, according to a study published this week [week of 29 Mar 2021] in the journal Science [see reference below]. The disease was soon also found in other birds of prey and waterfowl, amphibians, reptiles, and fish.

"Despite intense research efforts, the cause of this mysterious disease has been elusive," the study said.

The deaths were occurring in man-made lakes in Arkansas, Texas, Georgia, and North and South Carolina where certain cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, was growing on the invasive _Hydrilla verticillata_ plant. The hydrilla thrives in man-made lakes that don't have enough nutrients for native species, according to The Atlantic.

Susan Wilde, an associate professor of aquatic science at the Warner School, first identified the cyanobacteria that were named _Aetokthonos hydrillicola_, Latin for "eagle killer that grows on hydrilla," according to UGA Today [News Center for the University of Georgia].

The researchers assumed _Aetokthonos_ was creating a neurotoxin that caused the brain-destroying vacuolar myelinopathy. However, _Aetokthonos_ cultures grown in the lab did not cause the disease.

It was a mystery. What was the weapon _Aetokthonos_ was using to kill the eagles, turtles, and fish?

Professor Timo Niedermeyer of the Institute of Pharmacy began collaborating with Wilde and her group.

Using a new imaging mass spectrometer, one of Niedermeyer's researchers examined leaves of hydrilla collected in the field. At the molecular level, the researcher found a chemical structure made up of 5 bromine atoms. The cyanobacteria cultures grown in the lab had no bromide.

"The structure is really spectacular," the researcher, Steffen Breinlinger, told UGA Today. "We then added bromide to our lab cultures, and the cyanobacteria started producing the toxin."

The teams proved the bromine molecule does trigger vacuolar myelinopathy. They call their discovery aetokthonotoxin, "poison that kills the eagle."

"Finally, we did not only catch the murderer, but we also identified the weapon the cyanobacteria used to kill those eagles," Wilde said.

Bromine can occur in lakes naturally, but it also gets into the environment from power plants, fungicides, and gasoline additives, the study said. Coincidentally, some herbicides used to control hydrilla also contain bromide.

The study said the consequences of elevated bromide levels on vacuolar myelinopathy should be investigated more, and efforts to control hydrilla should avoid using bromide-containing chemicals.

Wilde said people also should be aware of the possibility of animals and fish being affected by vacuolar myelinopathy before taking them from the man-made lakes. The disease can cause the animals to make erratic movements or have convulsions.

"For fish, it's tough. I would avoid eating fish with lesions or some sort of deformities; we do see affected fish with slow swimming speeds, but anglers won't be able to see that," Wilde said. "We want people to know the lakes where this disease has been documented and to use caution in consuming birds and fish from these lakes."

Maps compiled by Wilde and her students show locations where vacuolar myelinopathy has been documented in birds in the Southeast.

The news of this discovery came the same week the U.S. Department of the Interior announced the number of American bald eagles has quadrupled since 2009. Once on the brink of extinction, bald eagles now number over 300 000.

[Forty years ago, bald eagles (_Haliaeetus leucocephalus_) were in danger throughout most of their range. Habitat protection afforded by the Endangered Species Act, the federal government's banning of DDT, and conservation actions taken by the American public helped bald eagles make a remarkable recovery.

Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM), was first detected in 1994 when 29 bald eagles were found dead during the fall and winter at De Gray Lake in southwestern Arkansas. The most consistent finding across species, locations, and years is a microscopic change or "lesion" in the brain and spinal cord of affected birds.

This disorder is diagnosed by microscopic examination of very fresh brain tissue. It appears as open spaces in the white matter (myelinated areas) of the central nervous system in affected birds. Recent studies had implicated exotic hydrilla and associated epiphytic cyanobacterial species as a link to AVM (Environ Toxicol 20: 348-353).

_Hydrilla_ is an aquatic plant invasive in the United States following release in the 1960s from aquariums into waterways in Florida. It is now established in the southeast from Connecticut to Texas. _Hydrilla_ can be controlled by the application of aquatic herbicides and it is also eaten by grass carp, itself an invasive species in North America. This new study established the mechanism by which a _Hydrilla_-associated cyanobacterium causes AVM by producing a toxin that contains bromide.
