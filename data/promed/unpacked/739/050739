The World Health Organization (WHO) today [15 Jun 2015] released a snapshot of 15 H7N9 avian influenza cases, 3 of them fatal, that it received from China on 12 Jun 2015 [http://www.who.int/csr/don/15-june-2015-avian-influenza-china/en/].

Today's [15 Jun 2015] report didn't include individual details about each patient but rather a broad epidemiologic view of the most recent infections. The WHO said illness-onset dates range from 19 Apr-22 May 2015, and all of the cases involved exposure to poultry environments.

The ages of patients range from 3 to 77 years, and 8 of the people are male. No clusters were reported, and the cases were from 7 provinces and cities: Anhui (4), Zhejiang (4), Jiangsu (3), Beijing (1), Fujian (1), Hubei (1), and Jiangxi (1).

The WHO said it is assessing the epidemiologic situation and conducting further risk assessment. It added, however, that the overall public health risk from H7N9 hasn't changed and that more cases are expected in affected areas and possibly neighboring locations.

The number of cases reported by the WHO today [15 Jun 2015] is similar to those mentioned in a recent China health ministry monthly update, some of which were reported earlier by provinces and cities, according to earlier statements translated and posted by FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board [https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links].

An H7N9 case list maintained by FluTrackers puts the global total for the disease at 681 cases.

[This is the 1st report of human influenza A (H7N9) cases since April2015 -- see archive (110) below. The infections continue to be associated with contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments (such as poultry markets) in China. There is rare evidence of human-to-human transmission. The virus is seasonal, and only occasional reports have been filtering in recently. There appears to be no change in the epidemiology of this virus since it was 1st reported in humans in China in spring of 2013.
