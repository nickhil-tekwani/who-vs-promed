Ongoing surveillance for respiratory diseases in Manitoba swine herds has
detected the novel pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in several herds,
including sow barns, nursery barns, and feeder barns in various locations
in the province.

The novel virus was first suspected in a sow barn when sows that had been
vaccinated against common strains of influenza, began to exhibit
influenza-like symptoms. Samples of from the herds in question were tested
as positive for the novel H1N1 virus in Manitoba Agriculture's Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory, and confirmed by the National Centre for Foreign
Animal Disease in Winnipeg.

Further surveillance confirmed novel H1N1 diagnoses in several additional
barns housing weanling and feeder pigs. Movement of pigs from these
locations was immediately limited to prevent transmission of the virus to
other swine herds. Biosecurity protocols, including the reminder to staff
to wear their personal protective equipment properly, were enhanced to
further protect both pigs and the workers in the barns.

In the herds where the virus has been detected the disease was very mild,
with pigs showing only slight signs of respiratory illness -- mild cough
and nasal discharge, depressed feed intake and rectal temperatures up to
40.5 deg C [104.9 deg F]. No deaths have been reported in these herds.
Animals were monitored by the herd veterinarian and recovered uneventfully
within 4-7 days after onset of illness. The virus did infect piglets born
to infected sows, and the virus subsequently moved through the production
channels to nursery, feeder and finisher sites.

Manitoba's chief veterinary officer has sent letters to veterinarians to
seek their cooperation in detecting and reporting signs of respiratory
illness in swine. Letters have also been sent to pig producers encouraging
the maintenance of strict biosecurity measures to safeguard the health of
their herds and workers. Maintaining usual biosecurity safeguards will
reduce the possibility of spread into the barn, and between barns.

In a recent policy statement, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and the
Council of Chief Veterinary Officers agreed that farms where pigs have been
diagnosed with novel H1N1 do not require quarantine or eradication of the
pigs. The novel virus does not behave any differently in pigs than other
influenza viruses commonly detected in swine herds, and there is no
evidence to indicate that animals play a significant role in the spread of
the virus in the general human population.
