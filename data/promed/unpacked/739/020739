Cases of cholera this year in the metropolitan area of Caracas have
increased almost 100% over those reported last year. A total of 220 cases
(183 in the Federal District, and 37 in the State of Miranda) have been
registered since the second outbreak of the disease began in the month of
June.
The regional epidemiologist of the State of Miranda, Irene Engelka,
reported that most of recent cases detected in the state were 7 inmates in
the Rodeo II prison. All personnel (staff and inmates) received
preventative treatment. She pointed out that the most affected areas are
Los Teques, the prison of El Rodeo, and Cacaguita, and they presume that
those affected became ill by eating products from the Coche Market. She
explained that the market continues to be a source of infection and food.
Samples of fish, shell fish, and lettuce have been positive for _Vibrio
cholerae_ no. 01. For this reason, Dr. Engelke recommended that no one eat
shellfish "until the
bacterium disappears from the country."
The epidemiologist of the Federal District, Juana Salazar, indicated that
they are stepping up work on sanitation in the Coche Market toward the goal
of completely eliminating the focus of infection. Inmerca [the market
administration has contracted more cleaning personnel, and they have
purchased street cleaning tractors. There is a daily health watch, and they
are taking daily samples of foods that arrive. They have installed tanks in
fish market, and they are not charging for use of the restrooms. She said
that at the same time, they are providing health education to prevent a
major outbreak of cholera in crowded areas.
