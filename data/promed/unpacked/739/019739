Provincial health officials expressed alarm over the abrupt increase of
dengue cases here and in neighboring and outlying towns.
The upsurge in dengue cases in the province came shortly after health
authorities in Koronadal, South Cotabato also raised an alert last week
after 159 dengue cases, mostly affecting children, also hit both the
downtown and outlying barangays.
Records from 2 hospitals here showed that they admitted in April 2005 alone
about 93 patients suspected of having dengue fever. The Kidapawan Medical
Specialist Center, the biggest hospital here has admitted 86 patients,
while the Madonna General hospital has also recorded 7 cases. The majority
of the victims were aged 8 to 25 years, and all were residents of this
city, and 3 came from northern Carmen town.
The Makilala Medical Specialist Center in neighboring Makilala town has
admitted 14 patients last month [April 2005].
Dr. Renan Sungcad, assistant chief of the North Cotabato Provincial
Hospital, told radio station DXND that dengue fever is very prevalent
during rainy season and that its occurrence this year [is part of] a 3-year
cycle.
He has urged residents in the 17 towns of North Cotabato to implement the 4
o'clock habit as a preventive measure. The habit involved cleaning
surroundings, draining of water accumulated in tires, bottles, flower
bases, and roof gutters to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.
"The effective way to prevent dengue fever is by maintaining the
cleanliness of our respective backyards. By doing this every day we would
protect ourselves from dengue fever, including our children and other
members of the community," Sungcad said. He also recommended the use of
mosquito nets.

[The local health authorities attribute the general increase of dengue
outbreaks this year to a 3-year-cycle. Further information -- with respect
to serotypes of dengue virus, incidence rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever,
deaths (if any), and the total cases of dengue in the country -- is

During this epidemiological week (24-30 Apr 2005) 432 dengue cases have
been diagnosed, 25 of which were dengue hemorrhagic fever (5.8 percent),
and the ratio for classic dengue/hemorrhagic dengue is 16/1.
Cumulative cases for the year is 9939, 6.2 percent of which were dengue
hemorrhagic fever, and the ratio for classic dengue/hemorrhagic dengue is
15/1. No deaths have been reported so far in 2005. Cumulative morbidity
rate is 37.4 per 100 000 inhabitants. Circulating serotypes are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Cumulative case rate was 26.3 percent lower than the same time period in
2004. A 1-percent increase in the number of cases with respect to last week
was reported, so an epidemiological alert was announced.
People under 15 years old account for 50.9 percent of notified cases, and
people 15 to 24 years old account for 22.0 percent of all cases, becoming
the 2nd most affected group. Federal Areas reporting the largest case
numbers are as follows: Tachira (63), Falcon (62), Carabobo (38), Trujillo
(36), and Barinas (31).

[Out of the cumulative total of 2000 dengue cases so far in 2005, 7.5
percent are attributed to dengue hemorrhagic fever. The ratio for classic
dengue/hemorrhagic dengue is 13/1. The case fatality rate (CFR) in this
equatorial country is 0.35 percent with 7 deaths. No details were given
regarding the circulating serotypes of dengue virus. - Mod.RY]

Unusual dengue strain blamed
-------------------------
Doctors at Ramathibodi Hospital yesterday said a 13-year-old boy died [see
ref: 20050515.1333 below] from the Dengue-4 serotype, which has not been
blamed for a serious outbreak in Thailand for many years.
The boy died last week after suffering severe dengue shock syndrome and
internal bleeding. He was admitted to hospital on 7 May 2005. His case
caught public attention amid fears he suffered from a virulent strain of
the disease which could cause a severe outbreak.
The virus is known to occur in 4 varieties _ Dengue 1, 2, 3 and 4 _ and
usually hits hardest the central and southern regions. Dengue fever tends
to strike urban areas because they have the highest concentrations of
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes which carry the virus.
However, additional tests on the dead boy will be conducted over the next
several weeks, a hospital statement said.
The Disease Control Department reports 8005 people have contracted dengue
so far in 2005 with 15 known deaths. In 2003, 38 000 people contracted the
disease and 40 died, most in the 10-14-year age group.
Sutee Yoksan, head of the paediatric dengue vaccine project at Ramathibodi
Hospital, said dengue fever experts planned to launch a large-scale human
vaccine trial in Ratchaburi within the next 3 years.
''All serotypes of the deadly virus have been found in that western
province. A trial of preventive vaccine should be carried out there as soon
as possible to curb the deadly virus and financial losses,'' he said,
adding that 2-5 billion baht [USD 50-125 million] was spent each year on
dengue prevention and medical treatment.
Dr Sutee said a team of dengue experts from the hospital and the Public
Health Ministry was preparing for the tests. Volunteer recruitment will be
promoted in 2008 and it will cost about 250 million baht [USD 6 million] to
undertake the trial, he said.

[As reported in the previous dengue/DHF update (20050515.1333), the
touching story of the 13-year-old victim of the outbreaks has aroused
public attention in the country. Serotype 4 of the dengue virus was found
to be responsible. The vaccine trial scheduled to take place in 2008 is a
positive development. -Mod.RY]
[ProMED-mail's PRO/ESP (ProMED-Spanish) Moderator Jorge Gonzalez-Mendoza is
based in Peru (Ecuador's southern neighbor) and was recently working on a
dengue outbreak centered around Lima, Peru (see Dengue/DHF update 2005 (09)
20050428.1181 and Dengue/DHF update 2005 (08) 20050423.1139. We queried
him about the seasonality of dengue in coastal areas and received the
following response.
"In the case of dengue in Peru, we reported an outbreak in Lima nearly 6
weeks ago, nearly coincident with the end of summer. The weather in Lima is
quite unique, since we have only 2 seasons: winter from May to November and
summer from December to April, with no transitional period between. Cases
of dengue are tapering off, since winter is not good for the mosquitoes.
However, this is not the case for the rest of our coast. Though it is
winter in the Southern Hemisphere, the northern coast (the northernmost
part is tropical area, the north-central is desert), while cooler than in
summer, maintains adequate temperatures for mosquito breeding. The
Venezuelan states of Falcon, Carabobo, and Trujillo are coastal, while
Tachira and Barinas are not. I do not think that the latter 2 are
considered highland regions." - Mods.JMG/MPP]
