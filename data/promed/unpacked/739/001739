[1] China (Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province), request for information

A total of 102 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna in southwest China's Yunnan province since the disease was first discovered in the prefecture last Thursday [15 Aug 2013]. They include 4 imported cases, according to the prefecture government's information office on Tuesday [20 Aug 2013].

The prefecture government is asking local residents to kill mosquitoes to prevent the disease.

Dengue is a mosquito-borne, potentially fatal disease that affects between 50 and 100 million people in the tropics and subtropics each year, resulting in fever and muscle and joint aches.

[The newswire reports an outbreak of dengue in the Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna in southwest China's Yunnan province, which has infected 102 people since 15 Aug 2013.

This is the 1st report of dengue occurring in Yunnan Province this year (2013) that has been covered on PRO/MBDS. While the wording of the newswire above seems to suggest that this is a new occurrence in the affected area (the Dai Autonomous Prefecture Xishuangbanna), there was a report on PRO/MBDS in 2007 of 68 cases of dengue in Yunnan province, occurring in Dehong, Lincang, and Xishuangbanna, all located near the China-Myanmar border. Of note, in a 21 Jun 2013 press release from ReliefWeb, there was mention of concerns re: major dengue activity in Myanmar this year (2013). According to this newswire, there had been 6448 cases with 13 deaths reported as of 21 Jun 2013, compared with 6033 cases and 27 deaths in all of 2012. (see http://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/burma-faces-dengue-fever-outbreak-officials). Checking the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) dengue reports, as of 7 Aug 2013 there have not been reports of dengue fever cases in China (see http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/DengueSituationUpdates/en/). More information on dengue in Yunnan Province of China and neighboring Myanmar would be greatly appreciated.
