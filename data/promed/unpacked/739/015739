The persistant rains which affect the Atlantic sector and the lack of
interest of the population to combat the disease, are the principal causes
of the recurrent outbreak of dengue in the province of Limon, which
reported 88 percent of the total cases [of dengue reported in the country
since the beginning of the year.
According to data from the epidemiologic surveillance system of the
Ministry of Health, up through the end of last week there were 2389 cases
of dengue reported in the country of which 2089 came from the caribbean
province [Limon.
In the Tony Facio hospital of Limon, yesterday there were 43 persons
admitted for dengue, among which were 10 children. The medical center had
to recondition some areas [of the clinic, because the installations were
not sufficiently large enough to attend to the cases.
When compared with the eighth month of 1998, the country is only (sic) 239
cases
above the total cases of dengue -- transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_ -- reported during the whole year before.
Other regions affected by dengue are the Central Pacific [Region,
especially in the city of Puntarenas, with 42 cases in 8 days, and the
Corotega [Region, where they have seen 14 persons during last week, in an
area near the supermarket Pali, in the city of Liberia.
Xinia Carvajal, Vice Minister of Health, explained that the situation has
not been controlled in the Atlantic Province because the groups organized
against the epidemic had not persisted in their fight.
In addition, he recognized that the population demonstrated disinterest for
the campaigns to erradicate breeding sites [mosquito and fumigation, so
the in many cases the neighborhood did not permit the representatives of
the Ministry to enter the houses or the patios in order to collect garbarge
and wastes.
Because of this, they are trying to establish a new plan of action which
includes
the development associations, musical groups, consolidated unions and the
Basic Teams of Integrated Health Care (Ebais), in order to disseminate the
sanitary measures that should be implemented in the province.
