WEST NILE VIRUS, GEESE - ISRAEL

Israel has ordered the slaughter of several thousand geese infected with
West Nile virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and which can prove
fatal for humans, the agriculture ministry said Sunday.
Breeders said that five farms with a total of more than 6000 birds were
affected. Israel is a major exporter of foie gras, a luxury pate made from
goose liver, and the blow has fallen just as demand was expected to rise
ahead of the end-of-year festive season.
"The head of the veterinary service has ordered the immediate destruction
of infected geese and the vaccination of all other geese being bred for
consumption," a ministry spokesman said. "The virus is spread by
mosquitoes and not [by] consumption of meat," the head of the ministry's
poultry section Shimon Pokomolsky told Israeli radio.
Several cases of West Nile fever, some of them fatal, have been discovered
in the United States caused by infected migratory birds captured in Israel
and shipped there illegally, the radio said.

[First, mention of a vaccine for WNV is news to me. Can anyone comment
knowledgeably about the source, production, availability and other
characteristics of such a vaccine. Second, I wonder how the Ministry knew
that "several thousand" geese were infected. Did they show signs of
illness, were they laboratory diagnosed, or was infection merely suspected
(some other indicator)? As for the U.S. epizoodemic having been caused by
WNV in "infected migratory birds captured in Israel and shipped there
illegally", that would be news to me, if true. Informal mention has been
made that molecular analyses of U.S. isolates indicate very close
similarity of these isolates with a 1998 isolate from an Israeli goose.
Anyone know anything about any of this? - Mod.CHC]
