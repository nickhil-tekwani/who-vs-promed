Dear Dr Blancou
Newcastle Disease in two farms in New South Wales
---------------------------------------------------------------
I wish to inform you of an outbreak of Newcastle Disease on two poultry
farms in New South Wales. I enclose relevant details of this finding in
standard reporting format at Attachment 1. Tests in chickens are presently
being undertaken to confirm sequence, and other information, to confirm that
this is a highly virulent strain. The following disease control measures
have already been implemented by Government veterinary authorities in New
South Wales (NSW):
- imposition of quarantine on the two affected farms and imposition of
restrictions on the movement of poultry, birds and poultry products
- declaration of a restricted zone of approximately 3 km around this farm
- declaration of a surveillance zone of more than 10 km around the infected farms
- all birds on the infected farms will be slaughtered - commencing today
- surveillance and tracing is also being undertaken in surrounding areas.
The two farms are approximately 20 kilometres apart and there is an
epidemiological connection. Determination of the size and scope of the
restricted zone has been based on the nature of the affected poultry farms
and the location of other poultry enterprises in the area.
The disease has been regionalised according to the principles established by
OIE. Therefore no restrictions have been placed on the movement of poultry
or poultry products within Australia, except from the surveillance zone
around the infected farm, i.e. the rest of Australia should be
recognised as a virulent Newcastle Disease-free zone.
Diagnosis has been based on typical clinical signs and post-mortem findings,
and confirmatory laboratory tests. Tests at the Australian Animal Health
Laboratory in Geelong have resulted in the isolation of Newcastle Disease
Virus from the tissues of affected birds. Studies have determined a
pathogenic sequence around the cleavage site of its F protein. There were
positive results for virulent virus in the chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM)
antigen localisation test. The intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) is
currently being determined.
Surveillance is based on monitoring mortality and production records,
serology and dead bird examination.
I have attached a map indicating the location of this poultry farm and
associated control zones (See Attachment 2) so that you will appreciate the
geographical relationship.
I shall keep you informed of developments.
Yours sincerely

Facsimile Contact: 61 6 272 5697
Date of Notification: 21 September 1998
Name of Disease: Newcastle Disease
Nature of Diagnosis: Serological tests, iolation of a Newcastle Disease
virus, Immunohistology, Chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) antigen localisation
test, Gene sequence studies, Determination of Intracerebral pathogenicity
index (ICPI).
Date of initial detection: 16 September 1998
Estimated Date of first infection: 1 August 1998
Number of separate outbreaks: Two
Geographical identification: 33* 40' south, 151* 0' east, near Sydney, NSW.
Details concerning the outbreak:
Serial No: 1
Species: No. of animals
avian 76,000 layers
9000 pullets
10 Geese
ratites 4 ostrich
wild Pigeons many (unknown number)

Comments concerning affected population:
---------------------------------------------------
* These farms supply eggs and meat to the domestic market in the Sydney
metropolitan area;
* No birds, poultry or products have been exported from these properties;
* No poultry have been processed in an export abattoir.
Comments on the epidemiology:
--------------------------------------
Mortalities were first investigated on the 6 August 1998. The disease
picture on this farm was confused due to the fact that there was active
Marek's disease also present.
It does not appear to be rapidly spreading. Samples from feral pigeons on
the farm have indicated acute infection.
Control measures taken to date
-------------------------------------
* The farms were officially placed in quarantine on 17 and 18th September
1998 respectively;
* A surveillance zone has been imposed around the infected zone;
* A comprehensive surveillance program has been instituted;
* The birds on the infected farm are being slaughtered and the property
disinfected.

[ProMED-AHEAD has been informed officially and effectively
simultaneously with the Office International des Epizooties, but
because of the routing of this message & the change in time zones it
will reach our members about 24 hours later than OIE, Paris.
For reasons of file size we have not included Attachment 2 (map of
affected area).
We thank Dr Murray for recognising us, and at the same time wish that
other CVOs would follow his example when afflicted with a significant
disease outbreak - Mod. MHJ
