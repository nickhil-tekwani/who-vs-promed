The 6th case infected with bird flu has died in Salahuddin [Salah ad-Din] province on [Sun 21 Jan 2018], Iraqi medical sources said, indicating doubts over infection of 2 other cases, BasNews reported. The victim, according to the sources, died of bird flu at the outskirts of Balad town, south of Salahuddin. Two other cases are being medically examined. The sources indicated launching vaccination campaigns within the precautionary measures at Balad and al-Dujail towns, fearing the spread of the disease.

Several death cases have been recorded over the past few days across Iraqi provinces due to infection with the disease. Iraqi sources previously said that the 1st case was recorded in Baghdad on [Thu 18 Jan 2018]. A total of 5 other cases died of the disease in Salahuddin [Salah ad-Din].

Last week, a medical source from Nineveh province said an Islamic State member held in custody has succumbed to death after being infected with bird flu in Mosul. Medical workers raised alert in the city, especially with drugs needed to counter the disease short of demand.

Sources from Diyala provinces said on [Thu 18 Jan 2018] that authorities in question killed around 70 000 chicken infected with bird flu at farms in northwest of Baqubah.

The Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health confirmed, earlier this month, the reporting about Diyala, saying that the infection killed 7250 out of 43 000 birds

[Salahuddin (also known as Salah ad-Din) governorate is located to the north of Baghdad. Although the subtype of the avian influenza has not been mentioned in the above report, recent reports of Influenza A/H5N8 infections in poultry have been reported from Iraq. Early identification of avian influenza cases and their contacts can help in limiting the human to human transmission of these novel viruses. - Mod.UBA
