Queensland Health is continuing to investigate an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) [also referred to as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) - Mod.LL] in Brisbane. So far, 32 people are confirmed to have EHEC, and a further 17 people are being tested for the infection. Four people have been hospitalized and have since been discharged.

Acting Senior Director Communicable Diseases Unit Dr Stephen Lambert said anyone displaying symptoms of EHEC, which include bloody and persistent diarrhea, should not attend work, school, or child care until symptoms cease. "We are particularly urging parents to take their children to their GP for testing if they display symptoms of STEC," Dr Lambert said. "If their doctor believes they may have EHEC, they should not attend child care or school until testing shows they do not have EHEC."

Dr Lambert said hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) can develop 2-14 days after diarrhea caused by this particular _E. coli_ organism. "To prevent further spread of this and other similar infections from person to person, people are advised to always wash their hands after going to the toilet, changing nappies, before and after handling food, and before eating," Dr Lambert said.

"When visiting animal nurseries, prevent children from putting potentially dirty hands in their mouth or near their face prior to hand washing: Always wash hands thoroughly after any animal contact, ensuring any faeces are thoroughly washed off with soap and water. Thorough hand washing with soap and water is the key to preventing the spread of these infections," he said.
