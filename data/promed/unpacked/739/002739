Rural anthrax: Cordoba (Villa Maria, La Playosa)
------------------------------------------------
The herd was composed by 200 dairy cows. At the beginning of March
[2008], 2 animals died suddenly at different times. Another animal
died on 23 Mar [2008] and a metacarpus was submitted to a
microbiologic lab to culture the bone marrow. A monoculture of
_Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated. No people were involved in the
manipulation of the carcasses. The elimination of the carcasses will
be done using the "controlled covered" method. The animals were
vaccinated with Sterne strain. [Presumably subsequent to obtaining
the diagnosis. - Mod.MHJ]

The south of Cordoba [province] is similar to the Pampa Humeda in the
province of Buenos Aires but with less precipitation being in the
shadow of the Andes. The area is more agricultural and has a mighty
dairy industry. Possibly the higher working of the soils creates some
telluric competition (bacteria of the ground) with _B. anthracis_?

There was a similar episode in 2007 in Villa Maria (Cordoba province)
dated 2 Feb 2007.

[Unfortunately we do not have a report of the 2007 outbreak. But in
that this area has seen cases before we might presume that there may
be some contaminated soil involved from the earlier outbreak or
outbreaks. The 2 1st cases 'found' the site and having been removed
by death the 3rd, a junior cow, would have moved into grazing their
now-vacated part of the pasture. Unfortunately Ramon is in Azul and
Cordoba is a significant number of kilometres to the west. In that
the area had seen a case or more in 2007 the vaccinal status of the
herd at the time of exposure becomes important. All too often we see
neighbouring herds to outbreaks not being vaccinated and then coming
down in the 2nd year. Our thanks to Ramon for this report.
