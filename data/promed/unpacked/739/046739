5 people have died of cholera in Mazabuka's Chikani area. Town clerk Ekan
Chingangu also said that 12 others had been admitted at Chikani Primary
School, which has since been closed and turned into a cholera center. He
said 4 of the deceased are members of a single family.
Mr Chingangu also revealed that only 1 patient is currently receiving
treatment at Nansenga rural health center while 3 others have been
discharged. He said the disease was first reported at Kasaka, Jila and
Simwambwa villages where villagers are said to drink water from
contaminated sources due to lack of safe drinking water.

The flood-hit Lower Shire valley (Chikwawa and Nsanje districts) is under
threat of a cholera outbreak and is in need of medical supplies to avert
the situation, Nsanje North MP and first deputy speaker Esther Chilenje has
warned.
Chilenje, on Mon 15 Jan 2006, appealed to health workers and the Department
of Disaster Preparedness, Relief and Rehabilitation to provide chlorine for
treating drinking water to contain the looming outbreak.
Nsanje district health officer Jason Kalaya said so far the district has
recorded 6 cases of cholera that are being treated. "The situation is
otherwise normal because we have given chlorine to the villagers. But the
danger is in those people who have moved out of the flood areas because
there is no water and other health facilities in the new areas occupied,"
said Kalaya.
In Chikwawa, 4 suspected cases have been recorded, according to district
environmental health officer Veronica Mkukumila who said interventions were
underway. She said Information, Education and Communication (IEC) officers
have also been deployed to the areas hit by the outbreak to sensitize the
people on how to avoid contracting the disease.
Floods have so far displaced 8309 households in Nsanje and 13 778 families
in Chikwawa.

Hospitals in Zimbabwe are reportedly still treating new cases of cholera,
despite government claims that the outbreak is under control. The Zimbabwe
Standard newspaper and the United Nations' IRIN news service said this week
that new cholera patients are being admitted at 2 infectious disease
hospitals in Harare.
Both news agencies cite unidentified hospital workers as their source.
Hospital officials said they have been ordered not to speak to the press
about the outbreak.
Government health minister David Parirenyatwa said last Wed, 18 Jan 2006,
that no new cholera cases are being reported.

At least 12 prisoners have died from an outbreak of cholera, which started
in December at Sittwe (Akyab) Prison, Arakan State in western Burma. More
than 80 people have also been admitted to the prison clinic, according to

The outbreak was reported to have started from eating cabbages grown on the
