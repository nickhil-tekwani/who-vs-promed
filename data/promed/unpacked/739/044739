[1] Liberia: Ebola re-emergence
Date: Sun 3 Apr 2016

A 2nd case of Ebola has been confirmed in Liberia months after the country had been declared free from transmissions, health officials said [Sun 3 Apr 2016].

The 5-year-old son of the 30-year-old woman who died [Thu 31 Mar 2016] from Ebola has been taken to a treatment center in Monrovia, said Deputy Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah. Authorities are now checking everyone the woman was in contact with and 10 health care workers from the hospital where the woman died are under observation.

There are strong indications the woman came from Guinea when the border was closed, Nyenswah said. The woman, who died on arrival at a hospital [Thu 31 Mar 2016], travelled with 3 of her children.

"We are investigating in both Guinea and Liberia how she entered," he said. "But knowing the porous border we are not surprised; she entered Liberia before getting sick or manifesting signs and symptoms."

The new cases are a setback for Liberia, which had been declared free from transmissions for a 3rd time on 14 Jan 2106. Liberia was first declared free of the disease in May [2015], but new cases emerged twice, forcing officials to reset the clock in a nation where more than 4800 people have died from the deadly virus.

The World Health Organization has said Ebola is no longer an international health emergency, but flare-ups, at decreasing frequency, are expected. ... -- more

[2] Uganda (Masaka): mystery outbreak
Date: Sun 3 Apr 2016

An outbreak in Masaka, Uganda remains a mystery although good news was reported Sun [3 Apr 2016] and 3 serious hemorrhagic fevers were ruled out via preliminary laboratory testing -- Ebola, Marburg, and Rift Valley fever.

Uganda media reports that 6 patients are currently admitted at Masaka Regional Referral Hospital with hemorrhagic fever-like symptoms and another 4 people from the parishes of Kasaka and Mazinga in Buwunga sub-county died in recent weeks of the still unknown ailment. The patients suffer from advanced fever, accompanied by abnormal pain, immense vomiting, passing out bloody stool, and yellow eyes.

Lab testing was performed at the Uganda Virus Research Institute [UVRI] in Entebbe.

District health officer, Dr Stuart Musisi said, "Despite the latest good news, the Ministry of Health together with the district and hospital teams, are working very hard to make sure that we control the spread of this strange disease and we find out what exactly we are dealing with."

While it is good news Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and Rift Valley fever virus have been eliminated as possible causes, the etiology of these cases remains unknown. Further information would be welcome. - Mod.LK

There is no way of knowing if the 4 people who died in recent weeks all had the same illness as the 6 who have been tested. It would be of interest to know if other diseases such as yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and leptospirosis were also excluded. With cases occurring in several localities, the etiological agent involved must occur in several localities. We have asked the UVRI.

A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png.
It does not include the 2 newly reported cases in Liberia. - Mods.LK/JW]
