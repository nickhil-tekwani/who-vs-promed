Suspected Outbreak of Norwalk-like Virus Gastroenteritis among Rafters
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SALT LAKE CITY: Health agencies are investigating an outbreak of
gastrointestinal illness this month among rafters in the Grand Canyon.
Grand Canyon National Park officials said on Mon 17 Jun 2002 that they are
working with public health investigators to determine the identity and
source of the illness, which causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 24
to 48 hours and has affected 51 people so far. The park has not evacuated
any rafters because of the illness.
"Outbreaks like this have occurred over the last several years during the
summer months but the reports came in after the fact," said Grand Canyon
spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge. "To try to zero in on the source and type of
virus, we created a rapid reporting system that requires commercial river
trip operators to contact the Park Service if they have 3 or more cases
show up while they are on the river," she said. The first illness reports
began on 1 Jun 2002 at Colorado River mile 52, at the eastern end of the
Grand Canyon. As of Thu 13 Jun 2002, the park had 19 cases reported
stretching to river mile 164, near National Canyon --- about 20 miles east
of Lake Mead. By Mon 17 Jun 2002, the number had ballooned to 51 cases.
"Recognize that there are as many as 1000 people on the river at any one
time, and we are not sure if this is being passed from trip member to trip
member, but we do believe it is contagious, even with good hygiene habits,"
Oltrogge said. "We're looking for patterns, at high-use areas in the river
corridor and at locations where trips gather to launch, but we have not
zeroed in on anything yet and are working on several hypotheses," she said.
The U.S. Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, Arizona State
Epidemiology Office and the Coconino County Department of Public Health are
assisting in the collection and analysis of samples from the affected
rafters. Investigators say the symptoms mimic those [caused by members of
the virus genus known as "Norwalk-like viruses"]. Water is [a] common
source of Norwalk-like virus outbreaks.

[This outbreak reminds me of an outbreak of probable Norwalk-like virus
infection in Yellowstone National Park, USA, related to a contaminated
water supply in the Park that we investigated in the summer of 1977. At
that time we had a floating denominator of approximately 35 000 people at
risk on a daily basis (staff, day visitors, and overnight guests staying in
Park lodges or camping out) with a large majority of the population mobile,
travelling throughout the park. It is a nice follow-up to see the active
surveillance system that was rapidly implemented here to investigate this
outbreak. In this outbreak there have been cases occurring over a 114-mile
route -- a daunting investigation in a spectacular geographic location. -
