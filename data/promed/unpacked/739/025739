A mosquito control program is to be developed by Sorell Council staff in
response to a dramatic increase in the number of reported Ross River virus
cases in the municipality in 1998-99. Thirty cases were reported compared
with none the previous year, one in 1997 and 8 in 1996. Sorell Council
senior environmental health officer Greg Robertson said all 30 cases
reported were during autumn last year and the 1998-99 summer.
Mr Robertson said the number of notified cases appeared proportional to
summer rainfall, which provided an environment where mosquito larvae could
develop. The most significant habitats in the municipality appeared to be
salt marsh wetlands along the coastline between Dunalley and Lewisham,
focussing on Dodges Ferry and Primrose Sands.
Only a few of the 30 species of mosquitoes in Tasmania are capable of
transmitting the virus, with _Aedes camptorhynchus_ considered the most
significant carrier in the Sorell municipality. This species is found in
brackish to fresh water ground pools associated with coastal swamps and
bushland and some salinity-affected areas.
Those more at risk of contracting the virus live close to a habitat where
mosquito carriers are breeding and also to animals which carry the disease.
Also, people who live in humid areas where rainfall patterns provide
adequate moisture for mosquito larvae growth are more at risk. The council
reminded residents to take action to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes,
including using repellents and wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers.
The control program will include trapping, identification when the mosquito
season starts, and community consultation and education.
