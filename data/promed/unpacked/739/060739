The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has today [29 Sep 2005] confirmed
another fatal human case of H5N1 avian influenza. The patient, a
27-year-old woman from Jakarta, developed symptoms on 17 Sep 2005, was
hospitalized on 19 Sep 2005, and died on 26 Sep 2005. Confirmatory testing
was conducted at a WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong.

Initial investigation has revealed that the woman had direct contact with
diseased and dying chickens in her household shortly before the onset of
illness. The woman is the 4th laboratory-confirmed case of H5N1 infection
in Indonesia.

As a result of intensified surveillance and heightened public concern,
growing numbers of people with respiratory symptoms or possible exposure to
the virus are being admitted to hospital for observation and, when
appropriate, treatment. Until a conclusive diagnosis is made, these
patients are classified by the Ministry of Health as suspect cases. While
many do not have symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of H5N1 infection,
screening of patient samples is being undertaken in national laboratories
as part of efforts to ensure that no new cases are missed.

Laboratory testing to confirm human infection with H5N1 avian influenza is
technically difficult; some tests produce inconclusive or unreliable
results. To ensure a reliable assessment of the situation in Indonesia,
authorities are, after initial screening, continuing to send samples from
people considered likely to have H5N1 infection to WHO reference
laboratories for diagnostic confirmation.

According to FAO, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza is now endemic in
poultry in many parts of Indonesia. As influenza virus activity in
Indonesia may increase during the wet season, from November to April, human
exposure to animal virus could be greater during the coming months. Further
sporadic human cases can be anticipated.

[The deceased patient now confirmed by WHO as the 4th death from avian H5N1
influenza virus infection in Indonesia is the patient whose samples had
given inconsistent test results when tested in Jakarta. The status of the 2
additional fatal cases identified by the Indonesia authorities is unclear,
and results of confirmatory testing in Hong Kong are still awaited. From
the cautious nature of the WHO statement, it may be that not all of the
increasing number of suspected avian H5N1 cases reported in Indonesia will
confirmed. - Mod.CP]
