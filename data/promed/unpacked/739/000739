Study finds H5N1 antibodies in Chinese poultry workers
------------------------------------------------------
A study of blood samples from 306 poultry workers in a Chinese province that has had H5N1 avian flu outbreaks and 2 human cases found that 8 workers (2.6 percent) had serologic evidence of H5N1 infection. Reporting yesterday in BMC Infectious Diseases, [see below] Chinese investigators said they examined samples from 3 counties in Jiangsu province and used a hemagglutinin inhibition assay titer of 1:160 as a measure of seropositivity. They found the rate of seropositive samples varied from 0 to 5.4 percent among the 3 counties but did not specify individual titers or history of exposure to H5N1 viruses. They also reported that, of the 2 strains used in testing, no samples were positive for a 2010 H5N1 strain; all positive samples were for a 2005 H1N1 strain. The authors conclude, "Our findings suggest that avian-to-human transmission of influenza H5N1 virus remains low in China."

Title: Seroprevalence of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus among poultry workers in Jiangsu Province, China: an observational study

Background
In: BMC Infectious Diseases 2012, 12:93 doi:10.1186/1471-2334-12-93

The following is the authors' Abstract

"Background: Since 2003 to 06 Jan 2012, the number of laboratory confirmed human cases of infection with avian influenza in China was 41 and 27 were fatal. However, the official estimate of the H5N1 case-fatality rate has been described by some as an over estimation since there may be numerous undetected asymptomatic/mild cases of H5N1 infection. This study was conducted to better understand the real infection rate and evaluate the potential risk factors for the zoonotic spread of H5N1 viruses to humans.

Methods: A seroepidemiological survey was conducted in poultry workers, a group expected to have the highest level of exposure to H5N1-infected birds, from 3 counties with habitat lakes of wildfowl in Jiangsu province, China. Serum specimens were collected from 306 participants for H5N1 serological test. All participants were interviewed to collect information about poultry exposures.

Results: The overall seropositive rate was 2.61 percent for H5N1 antibodies. The poultry number was found associated with a 2.39-fold significantly increased subclinical infection risk after adjusted with age and gender.

Conclusions: Avian-to-human transmission of avian H5N1 virus remained low. Workers associated with raising larger poultry flocks have a higher risk of seroconversion."

This report is a welcome addition to investigation of avian influenza virus seroprevalence in the human population, studies that have been seriously neglected in the past.
