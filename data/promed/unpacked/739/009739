Virus lowers potato yields in Kabale
------------------------------------
A rampant potato disease reported in Kabale district [Western Region] poses
a danger to people's livelihood. Dr Andrew Kiggundu, a research officer at
the National Agricultural Research Institute, Kawanda [KARI], says the
virus affects the quality and quantity of the crop and research shows that
almost all the potatoes grown in the area have the virus.

The current average potato production in Uganda stands at about 7 tonnes
per hectare, compared with a possible yield of 30 to 40 tonnes per hectare,
if well-managed. "Poor farmers have been planting virus infested potatoes,
rapidly increasing the virus' multiplication," Kiggundu says. The crop is
mainly grown in the districts of Kabale, Kisoro, Kanungu, Mbale, Sironko,
and Kapchorwa.

The virus is spread by insect vectors and through human contact from plant
to plant. The virus can also be transmitted from tuber plants from one
season to another. Symptoms of the disease include curling of leaves,
mosaic, retarded growth, and poor yields. However, a tissue culture
laboratory to deal with the potato disease in the area has been developed
at Kachwekano Zonal Agricultural Research and Development Institute in Kabale.

"Through the use of tissue culture, improved quality seed potato can be
generated and provided to farmers as clean seed to improve yields, even
under sub-optimal soil fertility and rain conditions," Kiggundu says.

[Around 40 viruses have been reported to affect potato, and a number of
them can be spread by insects, including aphids. In addition, since the
crop is vegetatively propagated, many pathogens including viruses such as
_Potato leafroll virus_, _Potato virus X_ and _Potato virus Y_, as well as
_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ are disseminated in tubers. Some viruses, for
example _Potato virus A_, may only have a minor effect on yield if they are
the only infecting virus species and if a crop is newly infected in the
field. If virus-infected seed tubers are used, however, the virus
population will gradually build up during every crop cycle, both in number
of co-infecting (possibly synergistic) virus species and in amounts of
infectious units per species. This invariably leads to severely reduced
plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield.

The virus referred to above may be _Potato leafroll virus_ (PLRV; genus
_Polerovirus_) which is a destructive pathogen causing symptoms similar to
the ones described. It can also affect tubers and is transmitted by aphids
as well as seed tubers. PLRV can also affect tomato and a number of weeds.
Different potato cultivars may show different levels of susceptibility to PLRV.

The important role that tubers play in virus and viroid spread is
recognised by the strict requirements for certified seed potato production
in many countries worldwide. Meristem tip tissue culture, often in
conjunction with heat or cold treatments, has been used to obtain virus
free material for plant propagation. Intra-cellular plant pathogens -- such
as viruses and viroids -- spread from cell to cell and newly formed cells
in the meristem will be invaded. If these cells can be removed before they
are infected, clean cell lines can be obtained. However, it is vital to
verify the pathogen status of the resulting lines since typically not all
cultures will be pathogen free. For example, strains of _Potato spindle
tuber viroid_ have been distributed widely in Russia with tissue culture
lines that had not been successfully cleared of the viroid (see ProMED-Mail
post no. 20070423.1323).
