Date: Mon 17 May 1999
From: ProMED-mail
Source: Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center, Brazil, Foot-and-Mouth
Disease and Vesicular Stomatitis - Epidemiological Reports, 1999

These reports now include a page headed: Syndromes Compatible with Equine
Encephalitis
complete with a map of reported locations of cases.
The report for week #15, ending 17 Apr 1999, which has just arrived by
snail-mail, shows outbreaks in 1 locality in Brazil & 1 in Colombia.
The locality in Brazil is in the quadrant 50oW 25oS, roughly the location
of Curitiba in the state of Parana.
The locality in Colombia is in the quadrant 75oW 7oN, near Medellin.
Previous reports (see above) have indicated that the virus involved in
Colombia is VEE (Venezuelan equine encephalitis).
If anyone has confirmation of this, and of the virus involved in Brazil, we
would like to have it.
