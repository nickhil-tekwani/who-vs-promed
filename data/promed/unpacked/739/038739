Public Health officials are encouraging South Georgians to wear mosquito spray whenever outdoors to guard against mosquito-borne illnesses. A horse in Lowndes County [Georgia, USA] tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and mosquito pools have tested positive for EEE and West Nile virus (WNV) this season.

EEE and WNV are transmitted to humans and animals through the bite of an infected mosquito. "Even though it's rare for a human to be infected with either illness, anyone can become ill after being bit by an infected mosquito. The risk is higher for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or live in wooded or swampy areas," says Sheeley.

Tips to prevent mosquito bites are:
- Use insect repellent containing DEET, picardin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing.
- Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits.
- Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.
- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, wading pools and other containers.
- Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out.
- Be sure to use repellent and wear protective clothing from dusk to dawn or consider indoor activities during these times due to peak mosquito biting hours.

Although there is no vaccine for humans to prevent mosquito-borne illness, there are EEE and WNV vaccines available for horses. Consult with your veterinarian to have your horse(s) vaccinated as early as possible.

Officials have confirmed that a Wilmington [New Hanover County, North Carolina] horse has died from Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

An 11-year-old quarter horse was euthanized at Russell's Reach after receiving extensive veterinary care.

Kimberly Niggel, the stable's owner, said she got the horse from a ranch in Oklahoma. Niggel said she was told the horse had up to date vaccinations, but since EEE is almost non-existent in Oklahoma, the vaccinations didn't include ones for EEE.

"We are deeply saddened by the loss of this beautiful animal," said Niggel. "I wanted to make everyone aware of this incident and urge people to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their animals."

EEE, a mosquito-borne disease, has been reported in horses and chickens in Bladen, Carteret, and New Hanover counties [North Carolina].

With the confirmation of the EEE in New Hanover County, precautionary measures are underway at Russell's Reach. "For the utmost protection of our clients and horses, we are actively participating in the New Hanover County Health Department Mosquito Control Program," said Niggel.

Unlike the rabies vaccination, EEE and West Nile virus vaccinations are not state mandated and are left up to the owner to decide.

According to officials, EEE has never proven to be contagious, and there is no increased danger to humans or other horses exposed to a horse infected with EEE.

[While both of these articles mention vaccination for horses, neither mention that the vaccine must be given every 4-6 months as EEE titers wane quickly. So it is entirely possible the Oklahoma owner did indeed vaccinate the horse, but enough time has passed to allow for immunity to wane, or the horse was vaccinated once, not twice, as is recommend, and then followed with revaccination every 4-6 months.

Yet neither article mentioned using specific equine fly/mosquito spray on the animals.
