A case of _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria was diagnosed in Corsica in August
2006. This is the first case of autochthonous transmission of malaria to be
reported in the region since 1972 [1]. Malaria is a notifiable disease in
mainland France (including the Mediterranean island of Corsica). Rare cases
of malaria have been observed after bites from infected mosquitoes that had
been imported from endemic areas into airports and sea ports or by
transmission via contaminated blood transfusion or tissue grafts [2, 3, 4].
Corsica was endemic for malaria before 1953 and from 1965 to 1971.
Because the Anopheles mosquitoes in Corsica may still have vectorial
competencies for _P. vivax_ [6], antivectorial measures (eradication of
mosquitoes) are still taken. A small number of imported cases from endemic
zones are reported in Corsica each year [1]. Epidemiological and
entomological investigations were carried out into the case in August 2006.
The patient, Patient Y, was a 59-year-old man from southeast France who had
stayed in Porto, a departement of South Corsica, from early to mid summer
2006. At the beginning of August, he developed a fever and gastrointestinal
symptoms, and after several days of illness, he was admitted to hospital.
Malaria was suspected because of thrombocytopaenia (40 000 platelets/mm3).
The diagnosis was made 3 days after admission and the patient was treated
for acute _P. vivax_ malaria and recovered. The patient had never travelled
in endemic malaria areas and had not been inside any airport for at least
10 years. He had travelled to Corsica by ship from mainland France and had
then travelled overland to the Porto area.
Further epidemiological investigations found that another recent case of
_P. vivax_ infection had been reported in the Porto area. Patient X, who
had previously visited southeast and southwest Madagascar, arrived in
France at the end of June. He then travelled to Corsica, and stayed in
Porto for two weeks at the beginning of July. After a week in Corsica, he
developed a fever and was admitted to hospital a week later, where the
diagnosis of _P. vivax_ malaria was made. He was treated and recovered
fully, then returned to Porto where he stayed until 1 August. Both cases of
_P. vivax_ infection were confirmed by the French national reference centre
for malaria.
A retrospective epidemiological investigation undertaken from 1 Jun to 4
Sep 2006 by medical laboratories in Corsica, did not find any other _P.
vivax_ malaria cases that would suggest further circulation of the parasite
in Corsica. So far, excluding the 2 _P. vivax_ cases in Porto, only 4
imported malaria cases (one _P. ovale_ and 3 _P. falciparum_) were detected
in Corsica during the summer of 2006. This is within the expected range
based on available data from previous years. From 4 to 20 Sep 2006,
prospective active surveillance found no other autochthonous malaria cases.
Discussion Madagascar is known to be an endemic country for _P. falciparum_
and _P. vivax_ [7]. The details of the imported case from Madagascar with
onset in July, and of the case with onset in August, caused by the same
species (_P. vivax_) and in the same place (Porto), in a patient with no
travel to endemic areas suggests autochthonous transmission by local
Anopheles mosquitoes [8,9].
This hypothesis was supported by the results of the initial entomological
investigations in the Porto area, which found a mosquito breeding ground
albeit with low numbers of Anopheles mosquitoes, in a fountain on 27 July
2006. The breeding ground was treated the same day using larvicide to
eradicate the mosquito colony. An entomological investigation around the
home of the Patient Y in southeast France at the beginning of September,
did not find any Anopheles mosquitoes, but could not completely rule out
the presence of this mosquito in May and June.
Conclusion:
This autochthonous _P. vivax_ malaria transmission on Corsica in August
2006, probably via the bite of a local Anopheles mosquito infected with _P.
vivax_ from a patient who had acquired infection in Madagascar, appears to
have been unique because studies did not find other autochthonous malaria
cases between 1 Jun and 20 Sep 2006. This first case of autochthonous
malaria in Corsica in 35 years demonstrates the importance of
epidemiological surveillance on the island. Similar events occurred in
Italy in 1997 with one case of autochthonous _P. vivax_ malaria linked to
an imported case from India [10] and in Spain in 2001 with one
autochthonous _P. ovale_ case [11]. This case demonstrates that mosquito
eradication and anti-vectorial measures should be carried out with great
care. Although autochthonous transmission could occur again, the detection
of one exceptional malaria infection transmitted by mosquitoes in Corsica
in summer 2006 does not justify proposing individual malaria protection for
Corsica's residents and tourists. Systematic travel health advice is very
important for individuals who are travelling to tropical countries in order
to reduce the risk of people returning with malaria which can be spread by
local mosquitoes [1].

[Autochthonous malaria occurs occasionally in areas with suitable climatic
conditions and the presence of the Anopheles vector. It is seldom possible
to find the person importing the infection because persons from endemic
areas may be asymptomatic carriers of the parasite. The cases underline
that malaria is a diagnostic possibility even in patients with no travel
history. - Mod.EP]
