Possible link between West Nile virus infection and equine abortions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
University of Kentucky researchers are studying a potential link between
West Nile virus and horse abortions, although they said West Nile virus is
not a suspect in the mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS) outbreak that
afflicted Central Kentucky two years ago.
Veterinarian Bill Bernard, president of the Kentucky Association of Equine
Practitioners, said yesterday that the University of Kentucky has found
evidence of West Nile virus in 20 to 40 aborted fetuses studied by the
school's livestock disease diagnostic laboratory during the last 6 months.
The lab studied 300 to 400 equine abortions during that time.
Bernard, who practices at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington and
works with the University of Kentucky through the Gluck Equine Research
Center, said months of additional research are needed before a relationship
between West Nile virus and abortions can be established or disproved.
"It's too soon to say anything definitive," Bernard said. "This is a
sensitive issue because it has a lot of implications." There is "definitely
not a relationship" between West Nile virus and MRLS, he said.
More than 500 Kentucky horses were diagnosed with the virus last year, the
US Department of Agriculture said. Bernard said the quality of some tissue
being studied is poor because the fetus was dead long before being aborted,
and the presence of West Nile virus does not mean it caused the abortion.
University of Kentucky Agriculture Department spokesman Haven Miller said
his department had nothing to add regarding the laboratory's research. The
University of Kentucky Department of Veterinary Science said on Mon 27 Jan
2003 that 134 equine abortions had been reported to the center in the first
4 weeks of the year, up 35 from the same period in 2002.
