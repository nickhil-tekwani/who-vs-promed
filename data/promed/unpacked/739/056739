[The OIE has recent reports of classical swine fever in Colombia in 2005 (Arauca (1), Cordoba (1), La Guajira (4)); 2006 (Cundinamarca (1), La Guajira (5), Norte de Santander (1)); and in the 1st 6 months of 2007 (Lu Guajira (3)). There is but a single report in Venezuela for the latter half of 2005 (Aragua (1)), which is far to the east of Guajira and near Caracas). Unfortunately, there is no other information available.
