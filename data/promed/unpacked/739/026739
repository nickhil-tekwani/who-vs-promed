[4] USA (Maine): pediatric case
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2022
Source: Maine Government News [edited]
https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=Portal+News&id=8655508&v=article-2017


The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) has identified a case of monkeypox in a Maine resident under age 18. This is the 1st pediatric case of the disease in Maine. Nationally, at least 2 other states, California and Florida, have confirmed cases of monkeypox in people under age 18.

To protect patient privacy, no further information about the case will be released. Maine CDC is working to identify any others who may have been exposed and make vaccination available to close contacts.

Maine has received the monkeypox vaccine, Jynneos, from the federal government and is making the vaccine available to close contacts of identified cases as well as those at risk of transmitting monkeypox or becoming severely ill. Under a recent emergency use authorization from the US. FDA, individuals under 18 may also receive Jynneos. Maine CDC's website has a current list of vaccine locations and criteria for vaccination.

People who think they may have been exposed, or have a new or unexplained rash, should contact a health care provider, who can provide information about vaccination and test for monkeypox and provide treatment if appropriate.

Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus is part of the same family of viruses that causes smallpox. Transmission of monkeypox requires close interaction with a symptomatic person. This includes close, physical, skin-to-skin contact. Monkeypox can cause a rash or sores (pox) and is sometimes preceded by a flu-like illness. In rare cases, it leads to severe illness and hospitalization. Monkeypox is rarely fatal.

Prevention of monkeypox is the best strategy:
- Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that looks like monkeypox.
- Do not touch the rash or scabs of a person with monkeypox.
- Do not kiss, hug, cuddle or have close, personal contact with a person with monkeypox.
- Avoid contact with objects and materials that a person with monkeypox has used.
- Do not share eating utensils or cups with a person with monkeypox.
- Do not handle or touch the bedding, towels, or clothing of a person with monkeypox.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

The current global outbreak of monkeypox began in May 2022. According to the US CDC monkeypox outbreak tracker, as of 11 Aug 2022, there have been 10 768 [11 177 as of 12 Aug 2022] identified cases of monkeypox across the United States.

The US CDC is not reporting the number of pediatric cases nationally at this time. Maine CDC is currently reporting a total of 3 cases of monkeypox, including the pediatric case.

[5] USA (San Francisco, California): contact tracing mostly
Date: Mon 8 Aug 2022
Source: SFist [edited]
https://sfist.com/2022/08/08/report-sf-has-pretty-much-stopped-doing-contract-tracing-for-monkeypox/


As the city now has nearly 450 confirmed monkeypox cases, we learn that the SFDPH [San Francisco Department of Public Health] is only contact tracing for a fraction of those cases, with one department email saying, "Don't want to say too much, or beg more questions."

When San Francisco Mayor London Breed declared a state of emergency over monkeypox in the city 2 weeks ago, it seemed like a real all-hands-on-deck move to throw every resource possible at the problem. But now, with infections still on the rise and currently standing at 444 confirmed cases in the city (as of Thursday's [31 Jul 2022] numbers), we learn the response may not be as thorough as we'd thought. A disconcerting report today [8 Aug 2022] from the Bay Area News Group reveals internal SF Department of Public Health emails showing the city is doing only a very small amount of contact tracing among those who've tested positive, instead basically leaving it up to those people to contact anyone they may have infected.

Per the News Group, the DPH consciously decided to forego most contact tracing "about a month ago," which would be a couple weeks before Breed's state of emergency declaration.

The health department is doing some contact tracing, but only for a few certain, specific demographics. And while they were originally doing contact tracing for every case, they've pulled back on that effort significantly, with the rationale that people just aren't disclosing the names of all of their partners anyway.

"This made it difficult to contact trace all known cases," one DPH email said. "We are currently doing case investigations and contact tracing for youth under 18 years of age; any person who could become pregnant, and people who are pregnant, among others."
(That criteria do not include LGTBQIA+ men and the Latinx populations, who are currently experiencing the highest numbers of cases.)

But there's still a troubling pattern within the internal DPH emails. "Please weigh in -- don't want to say too much, or beg more questions," one medical director wrote in a 21 Jul [2022] email coordinating the department's response.

Another email the next day from a City Clinic medical director said, "I think this response over-emphasizes contact tracing." She added, "We're scaling back (case investigators) and encouraging people to self-refer partners, correct? I think the response should be more in line with our strategy... I don't think we should say: 'we are doing contact tracing for monkeypox.'"

The News Group did not have to look hard to find clinicians who consider it a flawed strategy to forgo contact tracing. "It's critically important to let exposed people know who they've had an encounter with," Yale School of Public Health Dr Scott Roberts told them.

As of the most recent numbers (and this is week-old data at this point), 72% of the nearly 400 infected people had a DPH interview, and another 9% were awaiting those interviews. But again, in those interviews they are just told to contact all their partners, DPH is not doing this proactively. And yes, the cavalry is coming in with thousands more vaccine doses arriving, and DPH says the SF General Hospital vaccine clinic is scheduled to be open again Tuesday [9 Aug 2022]. But just as the vaccine backlog may be showing signs of clearing, we could end up with a different problem if a spike in infections leads to large numbers of people not realizing they're carrying the virus.

[6] USA: 1/5 vaccine dose
Date: Tue 9 Aug 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/08/us-begin-intradermal-injections-jynneos-stretching-supply


This afternoon [9 Aug 2022], the Biden Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that they will begin allowing intradermal injections of Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos monkeypox vaccine, which will allow clinicians to use 1/5 the amount of vaccine per patient and stretch the limited supply in the United States.

Intradermal injections go just under the skin, as opposed to subcutaneous injections, which go under a layer of fat. HHS issued a new emergency declaration allowing regulators to invoke the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) emergency use powers under the public health emergency today [9 Aug 2022].

"This is a game changer in our response and our ability to get ahead of the virus, we encourage jurisdictions to use the dosing as soon as possible," said Bob Fenton, head of the national monkeypox response team. Fenton explained that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will begin sending educational materials to clinicians today explaining how to administer intradermal vaccines. The administration is similar to that of a tuberculosis test.

The United States has made only 1.1 million doses of Jynneos available, of which about 600 000 have been distributed. Under the new intradermal rule, the remaining 441 000 doses turn into just under 2 million doses.

Currently, the CDC recommends vaccinating close contacts and those at risk for contracting the virus, including those who have had multiple sexual partners in the last 14 days in an area with high monkeypox transmission.

FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, MD, first mentioned intradermal dosing last week [week of 1 Aug 2022] during a press conference. Evidence that the technique is effective is limited to one study conducted in 2015, in which 2 intradermal doses produced similar results to subcutaneous injections.

"There has been a lot of midnight oil burned over the last few days in looking at this," said Califf. Peter Marks, MD, PhD, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the Jynneos vaccine was first tested intradermally in Germany in an effort to replicate initial smallpox vaccines.

Califf also said the FDA actions taken today will allow the subcutaneous use of Jynneos in children younger than 18 years, likely a response to the case announced late last week in an Illinois daycare worker. Califf also said those who have gotten a 1st dose subcutaneously can get the 2nd dose intradermally.

As of today [9 Aug 2022], there are 1424 new US cases, raising the nation's total to 8934. After an adult in Montana was confirmed to have the virus yesterday [8 Aug 2022], Wyoming remains the only state without a recorded case.

[A letter reported by CNN on 13 Aug 2022 shows the "US Food and Drug Administration defended the federal government's recent decision to stretch out its limited supply of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine by giving individuals smaller doses using a different method of injection, pointing out in a letter to the company that manufactures the vaccine that a 2015 clinical study showed 'a very similar immune response' to the new method as well as the previously used one. In a letter Friday [12 Aug 2022] to Bavarian Nordic CEO Paul Chaplin, 2 top FDA officials responded to concerns Chaplin had raised earlier this week. They wrote that the agency recently determined that the benefits of stretching its limited supply of the 2-dose Jynneos vaccine by giving individuals smaller doses outweighed the known possible risks."
(https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/13/politics/letter-fda-defended-monkeypox-vaccine-strategy/index.html)

There is another concern about when the vaccine may become available. A 10 Aug 2022 report indicated that "the Biden administration is in talks with multiple companies about bottling millions of new doses of the monkeypox shot, but it could take 3-6 months to get them ready for distribution, according to 2 senior administration officials and 2 other people with knowledge of the matter."

This report raised some concerns about the administration by the intradermal (ID) route. Thinner needles are needed. Vaccinators will need training to successfully administer ID shots. The 2015 trial was a small one.

Ecuador is facing a monkeypox outbreak with 16 cases confirmed, a health official said on Thursday [11 Aug 2022].

"We have an outbreak in Ecuador due to the unusual increase in cases of a pathology that did not exist and we continue to make epidemiological barriers so that the number of cases would stop increasing," said Francisco Perez, undersecretary of national health surveillance of the Ecuadoran Health Ministry at a virtual press conference.

Cases of monkeypox have been detected so far in 7 of the 24 Ecuadorian provinces, with the highest incidence found in Guayas, Los Rios and El Oro in the coastal region.

Of the 6 new confirmed cases, 2 were found in children with one being a 9-year-old who came from abroad and developed the disease in Ecuador, said the Ecuadoran health official.

"This shows that the disease can occur at any age," Perez said, noting that in Ecuador the infections were initially found mostly in men aged 20-40.

Among the 16 confirmed cases, a patient died on Monday [8 Aug 2022] due to a "pre-existing pathology."

According to the Ecuadoran official, the most common symptom is the appearance of pus-filled pimple-like vesicles on the body mainly in the genital area, palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

Meanwhile, 35 people are currently under surveillance for the infection.

Perez called for maintaining biosecurity measures and recommended the use of mask.

The 1st case of this zoonotic disease was confirmed in Ecuador on 6 Jul 2022 in a 30-year-old man in the city of Guayaquil, capital of the southwestern province of Guayas.

[9] Peru: details
Date: Wed 10 Aug 2022

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/peru-registers-583-monkeypox-cases-97182/


According to the monkeypox situation room, with data from the Directorate of Public Health Surveillance of the National Center for Epidemiology, Disease Prevention and Control (CDC-Peru), to date, Peru has registered 583 cases of the monkeypox in 14 regions and there have already been 221 epidemiological discharges.

The [Health Ministry] MINSA details that the continuous monitoring of these patients has allowed them to complete their 21-day isolation period without any problems and any health complications. And it is that since before the cases were reported in the country, MINSA, through the epidemiological surveillance system, began to train health personnel and establishments, which has allowed cases to be detected on a constant basis.

Given this, MINSA states that the incubation period ranges from 6-21 days, and once general symptoms such as fever, headache, general malaise, swollen glands appear, after 3 days lesions appear in the skin, and from that moment the person is more contagious and the disease can last between 3 to 4 weeks.

In this sense, the MINSA points out that after identifying a probable case, the important thing is to cut the chain of transmission, and if the case is detected in the health center, it is easier because the patient is isolated and contagion is reduced.

In addition, for 21 days, the MINSA monitors by telephone and the patient is discharged when that period is completed, the lesions disappear and the person is no longer contagious.

The MINSA comments that very few cases have been complicated worldwide, so close monitoring is important to avoid complications such as secondary infection of the lesions.

[10] Brazil: monkey casualties

Source: Times Union, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]
https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Monkeys-under-attack-in-Brazil-amid-rising-17363064.php


The World Health Organization expressed sorrow on Tuesday [9 Aug 2022] for the killing of monkeys in Brazil amid fears of monkeypox contagion.

Brazilian news website G1 reported on Sunday 7 Aug 2022 that 10 monkeys had been poisoned in less than a week in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, in Sao Paulo state. Similar incidents were reported in other cities.

"People have to know that the transmission we see now is among humans," said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, during a press conference in Geneva.

Contagion can take place from animals to humans, but the recent outbreak is related to human only contacts, according to Harris.

"People certainly should not attack the animals," she said.

Brazil has a long register of attacks on monkeys during yellow fever outbreaks too.

[It is indeed unfortunate and unnecessary to kill monkeys because of monkeypox (MPX). In endemic countries in Africa, MPX virus reservoirs are thought to be rodents. The spillover of MPX virus into the USA involved another rodent -- pet prairie dogs. There is no evidence of monkey involvement in MPX virus transmission or maintenance of the virus in the wild in Brazil. - Mod.TY]

Investigation into monkeypox outbreak in England
Technical briefing no. 5
------------------------
3.1 Current epidemiological situation
Cases of monkeypox infection were confirmed in England from 6 May 2022. As of 1 Aug 2022, there were 2759 laboratory-detected cases of monkeypox in the UK. This includes 2672 confirmed and 87 highly probable cases, collectively referred to as 'cases' in this briefing for simplicity and defined respectively as those who tested positive with a monkeypox and orthopox polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Positive results for orthopox, the genus of viruses that includes monkeypox, are considered highly probable due to the rarity of other orthopox viruses in the UK.

Of all cases, 65 were in Scotland, 24 were in Northern Ireland, 32 were in Wales, and 2638 were in England. The median age of cases in the UK was 37 years old (interquartile range 31 to 44).

Table 3. Number of confirmed and highly probable monkeypox cases by devolved administrations, May 2022 to 1 Aug 2022
UK nation / Total / Confirmed cases / Highly probable cases
England / 2638 / 2551 / 87
Northern Ireland / 24 / 24 / 9
Scotland / 65 / 65 / 0
Wales / 32 / 32 / 0
Total / 2859 / 2672 / 67

In England, a high proportion of cases were known to be London residents (overall 73%, 1906 out of 2626 with reported home address), see Table 4. The number of cases in other regions has been steadily increasing, particularly in the South East and North West of England (Figure 2). The proportion of cases in London has stayed around 66% in July 2022 (Figure 3).

Where gender information was available, 2593 out of 2615 (99.1%) cases in England were men, and 22 were women (Figure 4).

https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-faces-danger-running-out-monkeypox-vaccine-by-this-month-ft-2022-08-09/


Britain will run out of monkeypox vaccines in about 2-3 weeks as the country has little more than 8300 doses of vaccine left, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday [9 Aug 2022].

Shipments of a new order of 100 000 doses will not resume until late September [2022], the report added citing an internal National Health Service letter.

"The NHS has quickly stood up capacity to offer the monkeypox vaccine to those eligible in line with UKHSA's [UK Health Security Agency] guidance and while supply is currently severely limited, the NHS is expecting to receive more doses in the coming weeks," an NHS spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.

"The recent and sudden global outbreak of monkeypox has caused a huge upsurge in demand for these limited stocks around the world," said Dr Mary Ramsay, director of Clinical Programmes at UKHSA.

Last week [week of 1 Aug 2022], UKHSA said that there were "early signs" that the monkeypox outbreak is plateauing across the country and its expansion has slowed.

In June [2022], the British authorities were recommending gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered a vaccine, as the outbreak of the viral disease gathers pace mostly in Europe.

Portugal has registered a total of 770 confirmed monkeypox cases as of Thursday [13 Aug 2022] since the 1st case reported in May [2022], said the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health (DGS).

The Portuguese health authorities said 60 new cases were confirmed last week [week of 1 Aug 2022], indicating "a decreasing trend in the number of new cases."

Cases were detected in the Capital Lisbon and Porto, North Portugal, said the DGS. And 43 percent of the infected belong to the 30-39 age group. The DGS said 99.3 percent of the patients are male, with only 5 cases reported in women.

Since 16 Jul 2022, Portugal has started the vaccination for those who had contact with the confirmed monkeypox cases, and 70.2 percent of the eligible contacts have been vaccinated so far.

The DGS said it is "aware of the epidemiological situation, monitoring, and adapting, when necessary, the implementation of public health measures, namely concerning vaccination."

[14] Spain: clinical case study

Ref: TarÃ­n-Vicente EJ, Alemany A, Agud-Dios M, et al. Clinical presentation and virological assessment of confirmed human monkeypox virus cases in Spain: a prospective observational cohort study. Lancet. 2022: S0140-6736(22)01436-2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
In May 2022, several European countries reported autochthonous cases of monkeypox, which rapidly spread globally. Early reports suggest atypical presentations. We aimed to investigate clinical and virological characteristics of cases of human monkeypox in Spain.

Methods
This multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study was done in 3 sexual health clinics in Madrid and Barcelona, Spain. We enrolled all consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox from 11 May to 29 Jun 2022. Participants were offered lesion, anal, and oropharynx swabs for PCR testing. Participant data were collected by means of interviews conducted by dermatologists or specialists in sexually transmitted infections and were recorded using a standard case report form. Outcomes assessed in all participants with a confirmed diagnosis were demographics, smallpox vaccination, HIV status, exposure to someone with monkeypox, travel, mass gathering attendance, risk factors for sexually transmitted infections, sexual behaviour, signs and symptoms on 1st presentation, virological results at multiple body sites, co-infection with other sexually transmitted pathogens, and clinical outcomes 14 days after the initial presentation. Clinical outcomes were followed up until 13 Jul 2022.

Findings
181 patients had a confirmed monkeypox diagnosis and were enrolled in the study. 166 (92%) identified as gay men, bisexual men, or other men who have sex with men (MSM) and 15 (8%) identified as heterosexual men or heterosexual women. Median age was 37.0 years (IQR 31.0-42.0). 32 (18%) patients reported previous smallpox vaccination, 72 (40%) were HIV-positive, 8 (11%) had a CD4 cell count less than 500 cells per Î¼L, and 31 (17%) were diagnosed with a concurrent sexually transmitted infection. Median incubation was 7.0 days (IQR 5.0-10.0). All participants presented with skin lesions; 141 (78%) participants had lesions in the anogenital region, and 78 (43%) in the oral and perioral region. 70 (39%) participants had complications requiring treatment: 45 (25%) had a proctitis, 19 (10%) had tonsillitis, 15 (8%) had penile oedema, 6 (3%) an abscess, and 8 (4%) had an exanthem. There were 3 (2%) patients who required hospital admission. 178 (99%) of 180 swabs from skin lesions collected tested positive, as did 82 (70%) of 117 throat swabs. Viral load was higher in lesion swabs than in pharyngeal specimens (mean cycle threshold value 23 [SD 4] vs 32 [6], absolute difference 9 [95% CI 8-10]; p<0.0001). 108 (65%) of 166 MSM reported anal-receptive sex. MSM who engaged in anal-receptive sex presented with proctitis (41 [38%] of 108 vs four [7%] of 58, absolute difference 31% [95% CI 19-44]; p<0.0001) and systemic symptoms before the rash (67 [62%] vs 16 [28%], absolute difference 34% [28-62]; p<0.0001) more frequently than MSM who did not engage in anal-receptive sex. 18 (95%) of 19 participants with tonsillitis reported practising oral-receptive sex. The median time from onset of lesions to formation of a dry crust was 10 days (IQR 7-13).

Interpretation
In our cohort, monkeypox caused genital, perianal, and oral lesions and complications including proctitis and tonsillitis. Because of the variability of presentations, clinicians should have a low threshold for suspicion of monkeypox. Lesion swabs showed the highest viral loads, which, combined with the history of sexual exposure and the distribution of lesions, suggests close contact is probably the dominant transmission route in the current outbreak.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The magnitude of the 2022 multi-country monkeypox virus outbreak has surpassed any preceding outbreak. It is unclear whether asymptomatic or otherwise undiagnosed infections are fuelling this epidemic. We aimed to assess whether undiagnosed infections occurred among men attending a Belgian sexual health clinic in May 2022. We retrospectively screened 224 samples collected for gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing using a monkeypox virus (MPXV) PCR assay, and identified MPXV DNA-positive samples from 4 men. At the time of sampling, one man had a painful rash, and 3 men had reported no symptoms. Upon clinical examination 21 to 37 days later, these 3 men were free of clinical signs and they reported not having experienced any symptoms. Serology confirmed MPXV exposure in all 3 men, and MPXV was cultured from 2 cases. These findings show that certain cases of monkeypox remain undiagnosed, and suggest that testing and quarantining of individuals reporting symptoms may not suffice to contain the outbreak.

[This observation of asymptomatic monkeypox virus infection is epidemiologically significant. Virus was detectable in 2 of the 3 asymptomatic infected individuals. If the virus load was sufficient to accomplish transmission to susceptible individuals, surveillance would not detect them and ongoing transmission to others could occur. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In May 2022, an office worker attended their place of work while experiencing prodromal symptoms of monkeypox infection. Environmental sampling performed 4 days later identified only low levels of monkeypox virus [MPXV] DNA contamination of the worker's desk, and no contamination elsewhere within the office. Replication-competent virus was not identified.

Sampling location
In May 2022, an individual working in a non-clinical role in an administrative office within a hospital acquired MPXV infection following non-occupational exposure. The individual worked in a 15-desk open-plan office for one working day following onset of a mild, influenza-like illness, and took steps to reduce mixing and avoid close contact with others. Several COVID-19 control measures were still implemented within this office including a requirement to wear medical masks and regular hand hygiene. In addition, this office had permanent partitions between desk spaces, approximately 1.2 metres high. The individual reported that monkeypox skin lesions appeared 2 days after taking sickness absence and at that point the office was closed to all staff, pending a risk assessment and risk management plan. 17 staff contacts were identified, including 6 category 2 and 4 category 1 contacts according to UKHSA [UK Health Security Agency] contact categorisation [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-contact-tracing]; 4 of these individuals accepted post-exposure prophylaxis with Imvanex(R) vaccine when it was offered according to UKHSA guidelines. No contacts developed symptoms consistent with monkeypox during their 21-day monitoring periods.

Environmental sampling
Prior to decontamination, environmental sampling was performed to identify MPXV contamination. Sampling was performed 4 days after the case was last in the office and 2 days after the office was closed to all staff. Surface samples were collected from non-porous surfaces such as desks and telephones using Copan UTM(R) swabs, and from porous surfaces such as carpets and chair seats using the Sartorius MD8 Airport with gelatine filters. In addition, SKC wearable samplers were utilised during the sample collection process to measure any re-aerosolisation of MPXV. All samples were processed as previously described and analysed for the presence of MPXV DNA using rRT-PCR as previously reported.

Monkeypox virus contamination
Only 3/34 surface samples were positive for the presence of MPXV DNA with all positive samples returning crossing threshold (Ct) values above 34 cycles indicating low-level contamination (Figure 1 [Diagrammatic representation of the office environment]). All 3 positive samples were from the case's desk area including their telephone (Ct 37.7), keyboard (Ct 36.9), and a 10x10cm area of their desk (Ct 34.3). There were 5 other surface samples collected from the case's desk that were negative for MPXV DNA including chair armrest, desk partition, and computer mouse, as were 26 surface samples collected from other desks and high-touch areas throughout the office. All non-porous samples were negative for MPXV DNA, as were both wearable air samples.

[There is no mention if other surfaces with which the case was in contact outside of the immediate office area, such as toilets and other bathroom fixtures, were also sampled.

Interestingly, there is a similar study of virus sampling in the home of an infected person in Dallas, Texas, USA reported on 11 Aug 2022:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"In July 2021, we conducted environmental sampling at the residence of a person in Dallas, Texas, USA, who had travel-associated human West African monkeypox virus (MPXV-WA). Targeted environmental swab sampling was conducted 15 days after the person who had monkeypox left the household. Results indicate extensive MPXV-WA DNA contamination, and viable virus from 7 samples was successfully isolated in cell culture. There was no statistical difference (p = 0.94) between MPXV-WA PCR positivity of porous (9/10, 90%) vs. nonporous (19/21, 90.5%) surfaces, but there was a significant difference (p<0.01) between viable virus detected in cultures of porous (6/10, 60%) vs. nonporous (1/21, 5%) surfaces. These findings indicate that porous surfaces (e.g., bedding, clothing) may pose more of a MPXV exposure risk than nonporous surfaces (e.g., metal, plastic). Viable MPXV was detected on household surfaces after at least 15 days. However, low titers (<102 PFU) indicate a limited potential for indirect transmission."

[17] Alternative imagined futures

Three possible futures of the monkeypox epidemic
------------------------------------------------
Choice 1: The boldest path
Here's the best possible future: The world learns the lessons of COVID and does everything to stop this next threat.

In that option, "every country, whether they have a case or not, is stepping up to do the things that are necessary for containment: vaccinating populations at risk, making testing widely available, investing in therapeutics," says William Goedel, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the Brown University School of Public Health. "This is a different situation than we had with COVID. We have all of the tools from the beginning this time."

Choice 2: The mushy middle
There's a 2nd-best path, and it's the uncertain ground that the US and other industrialized nations now find themselves stumbling through.

This maintains the status quo: distributing vaccines, but not to everyone who wants one. Deploying tests, but not rapidly, because the current assay can't be used until an infected person develops the characteristic pustules. Dispensing drugs, but only after asking prescribers to vault bureaucratic hurdles imposed by the only available treatment being held in a federal stockpile.

Choice 3: The dead end
Then there's the worst case: We don't control monkeypox. In this imagined future, monkeypox slips through the imperfect containment created by insufficient vaccine supplies, leaking from the social networks of men who have sex with other men, through other sexual partners and members of households, and into the rest of society -- particularly people with vulnerable immune systems, including older folks, pregnant people, and kids.

"The epidemiologic worst case is that there is sustained, efficient human-to-human transmission outside of sex," says Jay Varma, a physician and director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. "And then it will spread like chickenpox does, in schools and daycare centers. And we'll be faced with a vaccine that has never been tested in children."

[18] Renaming the virus
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2022 4:47 PM CDT
Source: Houston Chronicle, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]
https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/WHO-plans-to-rename-monkeypox-over-stigmatization-17369961.php


The World Health Organization says it's holding an open forum to rename the disease monkeypox, after some critics raised concerns the name could be derogatory or have racist connotations.

In a statement Friday [12 Aug 2022], the UN health agency said it has also renamed 2 families, or clades, of the virus, using Roman numerals instead of geographic areas, to avoid stigmatization. The version of the disease formerly known as the Congo Basin will now be known as clade one or I and the West Africa clade will be known ascClade 2 or II.

WHO said the decision was made following a meeting of scientists this week and in line with current best practices for naming diseases, which aims to "avoid causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional, or ethnic groups, and minimize any negative impact on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare."

Numerous other diseases, including Japanese encephalitis, Marburg virus, Spanish influenza, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome have been named after the geographic areas where they first arose or were identified. WHO has not publicly suggested changing any of those names.

Monkeypox was first named in 1958 when research monkeys in Denmark were observed to have a "pox-like" disease, although they are not thought to be the animal reservoir.

WHO said it was also opening a way for the public to suggest new names for monkeypox, but did not say when any new name would be announced.

To date, there have been more than 31 000 cases of monkeypox identified globally since May [2022], with the majority of those beyond Africa. Monkeypox has been endemic in parts of central and west Africa for decades and was not known to trigger large outbreaks beyond the continent until May [2022].

WHO declared the global spread of monkeypox to be an international emergency in July [2022] and the US declared its own epidemic to be a national emergency earlier this month [August 2022].

Outside of Africa, 98% of cases are in men who have sex with men. With only a limited global supply of vaccines, authorities are racing to stop monkeypox before it becomes entrenched as a new disease.
