RABIES & LAGOS BAT VIRUS

Re the report on bat rabies in France [ref. above] to Lagos bat
virus being "analogous" to a rabies virus isolate.
Lagos bat virus is a member of the genus Lyssavirus (rabies and
rabies-related viruses) of the family Rhabdoviridae. First isolated
in 1956 from Nigerian fruit bats, it has since been identified also in
a few domestic animals. I'm not aware of any human infections
reported to-date.
For a summary of Rhabdovirus nomenclature and a short history of
the isolations of the rabies-related viruses (pre-Australian bat
Lyssavirus), see:
Smith, J.S. New aspects of rabies with emphasis on epidemiology,
diagnosis, and prevention of the disease in the United States.
Clinical Microbiology Reviews, April 1996, 9(2):166-176.
