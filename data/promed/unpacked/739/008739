A 41-year-old man is interned in Avellaneda [hospital], where he was taken due to a complex clinical picture. Laboratory analysis confirmed the disease [hantavirus infection] and there is an intent to determine the area where he was infected to avoid new cases.

When experiencing the 1st symptoms of the disease, the 41-year-old man went to a private clinic in San Pedro, where the analysis confirmed that this was a case of [a] hantavirus [infection].

"We cannot establish if the infection occurred in his home, in his work place (a paper factory) or on the island," the San Pedro Subsecretary of Health, Mario Bernasconi, since the 41-year-old man had been in the area of the islands before coming down with the symptoms of the disease.

The hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] is an acute viral disease caused by [a] hantavirus. Field mice, mainly long-tailed mice [longtailed pygmy rice rats], transmit [tie virus] to people when they shed virus in saliva, feces and urine.

Fatigue, fever and muscle pain (mainly in thighs, hips, back and shoulders) are the main symptoms of the disease. With the passage of some days, cough appears and difficulty breathing.

[Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2012). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_).

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case. This case may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, is available at:
