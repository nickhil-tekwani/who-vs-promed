Recent Outbreak of Soybean Stem Canker Caused by _Diaporthe phaseolorum_
var. _caulivora_ in the Main Soybean-Producing Region of Argentina.

Agrarias. Plant Dis. 86:1403, 2002; published on-line as D-2002-1010-02N,
2002. Accepted for publication 19 Aug 2002.
The first report of soybean stem canker (SSC) caused by _Diaporthe
phaseolorum_ var. _caulivora_ (Dpc) in South America was published in 2001,
and was based on an isolate obtained in 1999 at Oliveros, Santa Fe (32
degrees 33 min S, 60 degrees 51 min W), Argentina (2). During the 2001 to
2002 growing season, isolates of Dpc were obtained from stems of field-grown
soybeans (_Glycine max_ L.) exhibiting SSC symptoms.
Isolates were collected in 3 localities of the main soybean-producing region
of Argentina: Marcos Juarez, Cordoba (32 degrees 66 min S, 62 degrees 10 min
W); Salto, Buenos Aires (34 degrees 20 min S, 60 degrees 33 min W); and
Diego de Alvear, Santa Fe (34 degrees 21 min S, 62 degrees 10 min W), and
disease incidence in the fields was 10 to 60 percent, 5 to 15 percent, and
10 to 20 percent, respectively.
The pathogen was isolated on potato glucose agar acidified with 0.2 percent
lactic acid culture in the dark at 25 +/- 1 degree C. White colonies with
compact and tufted mycelia were produced and turned yellow and light tan
after 6 days. Appressed and fluffy mycelia were observed in old cultures.
Stromata (2 mm diameter) were produced but pycnidia were not detected. After
20 days in culture at 25 +/- 1 degrees C under a 12-h light and 12-h dark
regime, clustered perithecia developed on stem segments.
For each isolate, 10 perithecia, 90 asci, and 30 bicellular, biguttulate
ascospores were measured. Averages of asci length and width were 28.3 +/-
2.3 and 5.9 +/ 0.7 micrometers, respectively. Averages of ascospores mean
length and width were 8.4 +/- 0.6 and 2.5 +/- 0.4 micrometers, respectively.
These data were similar to those obtained previously (2). Based on these
features, the new isolates were classified as Dpc.
Clustered perithecia, smaller asci and ascospores, and the development of
fluffy mycelia with age were the main characteristics that distinguished Dpc
from _D. phaseolorum_ var. _meridionalis_ [Dpm] (1). In greenhouse
pathogenicity trials on cvs. Tracy M, Crockett, Hutchenson and RA 702,
soybean seedlings were inoculated with mycelium in puncture wounds. Dpc was
recovered from stem portions of symptomatic plans but control plants
remained healthy.
The results reported here show that Dpc is widely disseminated in the main
soybean-producing region of Argentina, where it coexists with Dpm (2). The
coexistence of both varieties indicates pathogen variability in the region
is higher than previously recognized.

[According to The Pest Management and Crop Development Bulletin published by
the University of Illinois, there are 2 different types of soybean stem
canker, northern and southern. Northern stem canker is caused by Dpc and
southern stem canker is caused by Dpm. Both diseases can cause yield
reductions and death of plants, from flowering stage until the end of the
crop year. The pathogens overwinter in infested soybean residue and may be
spread with infested seed. Stem canker is closely related to pod and stem
blight, which is caused by the related pathogen _Diaporthe phaseolorum_ var.
_sojae_.
Disease management involves use of resistant or moderately resistant
cultivars. Resistance genes are available for southern stem canker, but
apparently not for northern stem canker. Delayed planting may be helpful,
and tillage may reduce disease in fields where stem canker has been a
problem. Foliar fungicides are available for disease control.
Do any of our colleagues in Argentina know whether _Diaporthe phaseolorum_
var. _sojae_ causes disease on soybean in the country? Please let me know.
