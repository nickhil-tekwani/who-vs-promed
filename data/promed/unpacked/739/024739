Metabolife recalls energy bars that may have toxic levels of vitamin A
---------------------------------------------
Tuesday, Metabolife International announced it is voluntarily recalling its
nationally distributed energy bars because they may contain toxic levels of
vitamin A.
The recall involves 1.5 million Metabolife Diet & Energy Bars made between
25 Dec 2000 through 4 May 2001.
San Diego-based Metabolife said routine sampling revealed excessive amounts
of vitamin A. The company reported its tests to the contract manufacturer,
which confirmed the results, and then contacted the Food and Drug
Administration.
The bars contain about 32 500 International Units or IUs of vitamin A.
According to Metabolife, vitamin A levels above 25 000 IU can cause severe
liver damage, bone and cartilage abnormalities, increased pressure in the
brain, and birth defects.
No illnesses have been associated with the product so far, but it poses
special risk to pregnant women and people with liver disease or viral
hepatitis. Women who are breast-feeding children could also pass excessive
vitamin A through their milk.
The bars were made by Fairfield-based MLO Products, which makes nutritional
products and supplements. Company president Mel Williamson said a
"transposition error" involving a misplaced decimal resulted in too much
vitamin A being added to the energy bar mix. The bars have a red label and
come in the following varieties: Outrageous Oatmeal Raisin, Perfectly
Peanut, Downright Chocolate, and Lemony Lemon.
Consumers can get more information by calling Metabolife at 1-800-540-7099.

[Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin and has only limited ways of excretion,
so toxic levels can accumulate in the body. Very high levels of Vitamin A
have been used by some in the treatment of certain cancers. Vitamin A
toxicity has been reported to produce blurry vision, excessive
flaky/dry/itchy skin and lips, hair loss, dizziness, and headaches.
Unfortunately, many of the bars produced since December 2000 may already
have been sold and consumed. - Mod.TG]
