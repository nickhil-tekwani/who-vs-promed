Reports have emerged from the southern town of Kufra that a possible outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) has begun to infect livestock there. Suspicions were raised following the deaths of 5 cows on one of the farms, with at least 2 livestock barns feared to have been infected in the town. Tests have yet to confirm the presence of the disease, but [samples] have been flown to Benghazi for analysis.

It is believed that the disease is likely to have been brought to Kufra by imported livestock, much of which comes from nearby Sudan, which has suffered numerous outbreaks of FMD in recent years. Egypt is also suffering from a serious FMD outbreak, with an estimated 6.3 million buffalo and cattle and 7.5 million sheep and goats at risk, according to the UN's Food & Agriculture Organisation.

Libya officially confirmed an outbreak of the SAT2 strain of FMD back in February this year [2012], with the last reported outbreak back in 2003. That outbreak, which was identified in an area south east of Benghazi, was of particular concern because the required vaccination is not widely used in Libya.

Two separate strains continue to circulate at several locations along the coast in the east and west of the country, with the government response including vaccination campaigns, movement controls, and closing of livestock markets where necessary.

[Kufra (Al-Kufrah), in the Kufra district, south eastern Libya, is an oasis situated in the middle of the Sahara desert. A map can be found at: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/LY/08/Al_Kufrah.html.

Confirmation or otherwise would be requested. If confirmed, the identity of the FMDV serotype would be appreciated.

Libya suffered outbreaks of FMDV serotypes SAT2 and O earlier this year (2012). Their respective genotyping results are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/lib.htm.

For an overview of the events earlier in 2012, see commentary in archived post 20120509.1127864. - Mod.AS
