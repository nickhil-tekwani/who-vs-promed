The MOH has announced an additional 23 people confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection, bringing the total number of cases to 87.

17 patients are associated with hospital D [Samsung hospital in Seoul], where case no. 14 sought care in the emergency room during the period 27-29 May 2015.

The remaining 6 patients had contact with case no. 16
Four of them were in hospital F between 25-28 May 2015 on the same ward.
Two of them were in hospital E between 28-30 May 2015 admitted to a ward.

The Task Force has confirmed that the 76th case before isolation was in the Gangdong Kyung Hee University Hospital emergency room during the period 5-6 Jun 2015 and the Konkuk University Hospital Emergency Room during the day on 6 Jun 2015. On 27 May 2015, the case presented to hospital D [Samsung hospital] with hypercalcemia and on 5 Jun 2015 presented with fever.

[The number of cases with MERS-CoV infection confirmed in South Korea continues to grow. With the addition of these 23 new cases, there have now been a total of 87 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 5 deaths. Noteworthy is that 17 of the 23 newly confirmed cases are associated with exposure in the emergency room of hospital D (Samsung hospital) where case no. 14 had been treated.

Information that would be useful at this time relates to the clinical presentations of the cases. Are we really seeing "explosive transmissions" related to 2-3 superspreaders when this hasn't been observed before (or at least hasn't been reported before), or might this have an element of "seek and ye shall find" and its corollary "don't look and it ain't there"? One of the newswires from yesterday [6 Jun 2015] mentioned that the military case was in fact an asymptomatic infection. Is it that the Koreans are doing a massive outreach and testing of all potential contacts and finding a high number of infected individuals with the majority of them asymptomatic or mild disease expression? The recent publication by Muller MA et al in Lancet Infectious Diseases, a nationwide serosurvey conducted between 1 Dec 2012 and 1 Dec 2013 estimated that almost 45 000 individuals had been infected with the MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, whereas by 1 Dec 2013, there had been approximately 117 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia, suggesting that reported cases represented the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of actual infections. (Muller MA, Meyer B, Corman VM, Al-Masri M, Turkestani A, Ritz D, Sieberg A, Aldabbagh S, Bosch BJ, Lattwein E, Alhakeem RF, Assiri AM, Albarrak AM, Al-Shangiti AM, Al-Tawfiq JA, Wikramaratna P, Alrabeeah AA, Drosten C, Memish ZA. Presence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus antibodies in Saudi Arabia: a nationwide, cross-sectional, serological study.

Presumably, more information will become available with time. Right now, the key focus in Korea is interruption of transmission, which, given the massive undertaking currently ongoing in Korea, including implementation of infection control procedures, will hopefully occur soon.

[2] South Korea tracking cell phones - media report
Date: 7 Jun 2015

S. Korea to track cellphones to prevent MERS spread; 5th person dies
- Total cases in outbreak rise to 64
- Over 2000 under quarantine, including entire village
- Health facilities with infections identified
- No need for supplementary budget for now, deputy PM says
------------------------------------------
South Korean authorities will track the cellphones of hundreds of people under quarantine to prevent the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and reported a 5th death in the outbreak, with the number of infections rising to 64.

The government, criticised over its lack of transparency in handling the outbreak, bowed to public pressure on Sunday [7 Jun 2015] and identified 24 health facilities where infections took place or MERS patients visited.

It reported 14 confirmed new cases of MERS, adding to the largest number outside of the Middle East.

"Please understand this is an unavoidable measure for the sake of our neighbours and families," Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan told a news briefing in the central city of Sejong, where he announced the plan to track the mobile phones of people under quarantine to ensure they stay at home.

Over 2300 people in South Korea were under quarantine as of Sunday [7 Jun 2015], some in health care facilities but most at home, including an entire village of about 105 people in the southwest after a resident who visited a hospital where the country's 1st patient with MERS was treated turned out to be infected.

Late last month [May 2015], a South Korean man broke a voluntary house quarantine and flew to Hong Kong and then travelled to mainland China, where he tested positive for MERS.

South Korea's outbreak of the often-deadly MERS virus, 1st reported on [20 May 2015], has prompted fear and the closure last week of more than 1000 schools, with thousands of tourists cancelling plans to visit the country.

Seoul's 2 wealthy Seocho and Gangnam districts, which include a hospital where the 2nd-most MERS cases in the country occurred, will close kindergartens and schools, about 120 in total, until Wednesday [10 Jun 2015], a Seoul education official said.

"We can absolutely control this because all MERS cases in our country are infections in health facilities, not spreading into communities," Choi said.

1st identified in humans in 2012, MERS is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as the one that triggered severe acute respiratory syndrome. But MERS has a much higher death rate at 38 percent, according to World Health Organization figures.

Choi, who is also the country's finance minister, said there was no need for a supplementary budget to help the country's economy weather the outbreak. With the economy already flagging, the MERS outbreak is adding pressure for another interest rate cut, possibly as soon as the central bank's next policy meeting on [11 Jun 2015].

The latest fatality was a 75-year-old man who had been in the same Seoul hospital emergency room where a total of 17 people, including 2 medical staff, are believed to have been infected with MERS, South Korea's health ministry said.

The WHO said on Friday [5 Jun 2015] there was no evidence to suggest sustained human-to-human transmission in the community.

"Even if this arrives in communities, it's very unlikely to become pandemic," said Eom Joong-sik, professor of infectious diseases at Hallym University. "If we prevent transmissions between hospitals, we will see only episodic cases from now on."

Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, added that measures being taken such as isolating suspected cases and monitoring those in contact with patients should stop the outbreak.

"There will be a time lag, since the disease takes some days to develop, but if the proper measures are being taken, there should soon be a large falloff in the number of new cases," he said.

Health experts say the worst-case scenario is that the virus changes and spreads rapidly, as SARS did in 2002-2003, when it killed about 800 people around the world.

[The tracking of cellphones to monitor adherence to quarantine is an interesting strategy, but if people want to get around that, they just leave their cell phones at home when they go out. It will be interesting to see an evaluation of that strategy when data become available.

Noteworthy in the above media report is the mention that 24 health facilities have had MERS-CoV infected individuals attend their facilities thus far. A sizeable number, but at present it appears as though transmission has occurred in at least 4 health facilities (hospitals B, D, E and F), with 2 representing the greatest majority of cases: St Mary's in Pyeongtaek (hospital B) with 37 cases and Samsung in Seoul (hospital D) with 34 cases, accounting for 71 of the 87 cases reported as of today, 7 Jun 2015 (http://www.mw.go.kr/front_new/al/sal0301vw.jsp?PAR_MENU_ID=04&MENU_ID=0403&page=1&CONT_SEQ=323126).

[3] South Korea, 6 hospitals with cases - media report

Government names 24 MERS-related hospitals amid criticism of secrecy
---------------------------------
South Korea on Sunday [7 Jun 2015] disclosed the names of 6 hospitals with confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome along with 18 others that MERS patients have visited, vowing "all-out" efforts to contain the recent outbreak.

The announcement followed intensifying calls for transparent information from the public with the number of MERS patients climbing to 64 as of Sunday [7 Jun 2015] morning, less than a month since the initial outbreak.

Samsung Medical Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, and Seoul Asan Hospital, 3 of the 5 largest hospitals in Seoul, were among those named. The list also included St. Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, which has seen 37 cases of MERS; Asan Seoul Clinic in South Chungcheong Province; and Dae Cheong Hospital and KonYang University Hospital in Daejeon.

"(The announcement) represents shifting the government's strategy toward 'all-out' efforts to end the MERS situation in its early stages," said acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan in an emergency briefing at Seoul Government Complex.

"We are revealing the names of hospitals to show that the government is accurately keeping track of confirmed patients. We will continue to disclose hospital names to actively find infected individuals within the hospital and prevent the spread of the disease," Choi said.

But the authorities said they would not upgrade the alert level for MERS from its current "caution" status, he said, despite ongoing calls to change it. Nor was the government considering creating a new budget to handle MERS, as it would use funds reserved for national emergencies instead, he added.

The acting premier explained that the government had refrained from revealing the information out of fear that it may spark nationwide panic and create a vacuum in medical treatment in hospitals involved. But the authorities, including President Park Geun-hye, have decided that the benefits of disclosing information outweigh the possible side effects, he added.

Earlier in the day, the Health Ministry said the MERS outbreak had infected 64 people and claimed 5 [fatalities], fueling public fear that the situation was en route to an epidemic.

The ministry confirmed the death of a 75-year-old man who was exposed to the virus from [27-29 May 2015], when he shared an emergency room at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul with Korea's 14th MERS patient. He died Friday [5 Jun 2015], and a postmortem test confirmed the disease Sunday [7 Jun 2015].

He was one of the 14 cases confirmed early in the day. Among them, 10 were infected at Samsung Medical Center. With 17 cases to date, the facility is the source of the most MERS cases behind St. Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek.

According to an emergency briefing by the Samsung Medical Center, 893 people came in contact with MERS patients at the facility and are being monitored, for whom the hospital expressed "deep regret."

Both the government and the hospital, however, emphasized that all MERS infections reported so far have occurred within the hospital walls, and that the disease has not yet spread to the general public.

Just 18 days after the country's patient zero was confirmed with MERS, Korea now has the 3rd-highest number of MERS patients in the world behind Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As of Sunday [7 Jun 2015], the MERS scare led 1276 schools and kindergartens across the country to cancel classes.

But there has been nationwide concern that the situation will escalate even further.

On Saturday [6 Jun 2015], a 61-year-old man tested positive for the infection in an initial test in the country's southernmost city of Busan. He was demonstrating some symptoms of the disease such as vomiting, but did not show signs of fever or respiratory problems.

The patient had attended his cousin's funeral in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, where a confirmed MERS patient had also been present. Authorities said they were conducting an investigation on who came into contact with him since the funeral.

[The media report above shows the undercurrent level of panic accompanying the unfolding outbreak. From the information provided, apparently 6 hospitals have been actively treating MERS-CoV infected individuals, but a total of 24 health facilities have had individuals with MERS-CoV infection "visiting" them. Hopefully, this will not result in more generations of cases.

In another media report The director of the Samsung Medical Center (hospital D) was quoted saying "After reviewing medical records and CCTV footage to trace it, we found that 675 patients and 218 medical staff members were exposed to the virus by the 14th confirmed MERS patient.....We immediately informed the 893 people of the possible infection and placed them in quarantine" (http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150607000405. - Mod.MPP]
