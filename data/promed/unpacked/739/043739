Update: AVMA warns of potential new threat to pets
--------------------------------------------------------
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has recently been
made aware of several complaints from pet owners and veterinarians
that multiple brands of jerky treats manufactured in China have been
making pets sick. Signs of illness have included vomiting, diarrhea,
and lethargy. To our knowledge, no deaths have been reported.
The AVMA posted an alert on its Web site on 13 Sep 2007 inform its
members and the public about what was known. Today [14 Sep 2007], the
American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) issued a
statement saying it also has become aware of an unusual number of
dogs presenting similar signs and abnormal test results associated
with consumption of some jerky treats. The ACVIM statement is available at
<http://www.acvim.org/uploadedFiles/Jerky_Treat_Info_September_14.doc>,
and is shown below in [2].
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently testing several
products to see if a contaminant can be found. So far, they have
ruled out melamine, one of the chemicals that led to the massive pet
food recall this spring, but have yet to identify anything that might
be making pets sick.
While a list of brand/product names of affected treats is not yet
available, the AVMA has learned that all complaints have involved
jerky treats from China. We recommend that pet owners use their best
judgment in this matter.
Suspected cases should be reported to the FDA. To find the number for
the FDA district office consumer complaint coordinator in your region, visit
<http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/complain.html>.
The AVMA is monitoring the situation and will provide updated
information on our Web site (<http://www.avma.org>) as soon as it
becomes available. Like all information on our Web site, we will only
post information that is credible and has been confirmed.
For more information, contact Michael San Filippo, AVMA media
relations assistant, at 847-285-6687 (office), 847-732-6194 (cell), or

The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has recently been
made aware of several complaints from pet owners and veterinarians
that multiple brands of jerky treats manufactured in China have been
making pets sick. On Thursday, 13 Sep 2007, they posted a Media Alert
to their website at <http://www.AVMA.org>. Symptoms of illness have
included vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. To their knowledge, no
deaths have been reported.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently testing these
treats to see if a contaminant can be found. So far they have ruled
out melamine, one of the chemicals that led to the massive pet food
recall this spring [2007], but have yet to identify anything that
might be making pets sick.
While a list of brand/product names of affected treats is not yet
available, the AVMA has learned that all complaints have involved
jerky treats from China. They recommend that pet owners use their
best judgment in this matter and continue to consult the Web site for updates.
Diplomates in the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine
(ACVIM), who work in the field of veterinary nephrology and urology,
had become aware of an unusual number of dogs with very similar
presenting complaints and clinico-pathologic testing results
associated with the ingestion of jerky treats from a variety of
brands. No cats have been reported to date.
They report that these are typically small dogs that present with a
history of vomiting, lethargy and anorexia. They have all consumed
jerky treats (mostly chicken jerky) within a few weeks prior to
becoming anorexic. Physical examination has been relatively
unremarkable. Blood chemistry in many of the cases has revealed
hypokalemia and mildly increased liver enzymes. Blood gas analysis
indicated acidosis. Urinalysis has consistently shown glucosuria and
granular casts. These findings suggested an acquired Fanconi syndrome.
Fanconi screens on urine, when submitted, have been positive. The
Metabolic Genetic Disease Testing Laboratory at the School of
Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania can run urine
screens for generalized amino aciduria and lactic aciduria tests of
Fanconi Syndrome and other causes of PRTA [Proximal renal tubular
acidosis]. Their Web site can be found at
<http://w3.vet.upenn.edu/research/centers/penngen/services/metaboliclab/fanconi.html>.
The most common severe abnormalities appear to be acidosis and
hypokalemia. Liberal potassium supplementation appears to be
warranted during hospitalization and often needs to be continued
orally after discharge. Most of the dogs did not require long term
bicarbonate supplementation, although this should be considered based
on repeated blood gas analyses. Azotemia does not appear to be a
consistent finding and therefore cases will likely be missed in the
absence of a urinalysis.
The vast majority of dogs have recovered from their acute disease.
All clinical signs of disease including glycosuria have resolved in
many of the patients within a few weeks of initial presentation.
The cause of this renal tubular/GI [gastrointestinal] toxicity
remains under investigation. Veterinarians should seek a thorough
dietary history including treats when presented with a dog presenting
with acute GI signs or PU/PD [polyuria/polydipsia]. Diagnostics
should include a general blood screen and urinalysis. Treatment
consisting of supportive care, electrolyte and blood gas monitoring
should be instituted if this acquired Fanconi syndrome is identified.
For further recommendations and assistance on a case by case basis,
veterinarians may wish to consult a small animal internist in the
American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine in their community.

[As mentioned in these news releases, the FDA is investigating and
suspected cases should be reported to the FDA.
If you believe your pet has these signs be sure to visit your
veterinarian. - Mod.TG]
[We await further information on the etiology of the above described
illness in small dogs. It is rather curious that the initial reports
are suggestive of imported pet products, again originating in China,
and may reflect the larger problem seen with Chinese exports related
to lack of good manufacturing practices controls. - Mod.MPP]
