The USA and Canada are part of an outbreak affecting Europe because of Salmonella in tahini and halva from Syria.

The USA has reported 6 _Salmonella_ Mbandaka cases, one in 2020 and the rest in 2021. Interviews were conducted with 2 people: both report shopping at international markets that stock mostly Arabic and Middle Eastern foods and ingredients, and ate items containing tahini. Interviews are pending on the remaining ill people. Two have traveled to Syria and have not been reachable by public health officials.

Ill people range from less than 1 to 57 years old, with a median age of 19.5 years. Illness onset dates are from 19 Nov 2020 to 5 Sep 2021.

Canada has 8 confirmed cases: 5 of _Salmonella_ Mbandaka, 2 of _Salmonella_ Havana and 1 of _Salmonella_ Orion from 2019 to 2021.

_Salmonella_ Mbandaka cases have dates of illness onset between November 2019 and July 2021. The _Salmonella_ Havana cases have onset dates in April and June 2019. The _Salmonella_ Orion patient fell ill in May 2021. Canada also has 1 patient with an infection of _Salmonella_ Tennessee with a date of onset in May 2021, who reported consuming pistachio halva.

In Europe, 121 people have been affected since January 2019 in 5 countries with the most recent patient reported in mid-September 2021. There was a notable rise of infections in March 2021. Six different types of _Salmonella_ are behind illnesses in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. The most common serotype is Havana followed by Mbandaka, Orion, Kintambo, Senftenberg, and Amsterdam. Germany has 72 cases, Sweden has 37, Denmark has 9, Norway has 5 and Netherlands has 2.

Sesame-based products were sealed and ready to be consumed, which suggests contamination occurred before they reached the EU, said the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Patient interviews in 4 countries of 8 people revealed consumption of sesame-based products such as halva or tahini prior to illness.

Since November 2019, 14 batches of sesame-based products originating from Syria, tested positive for one or multiple _Salmonella_ outbreak strains. Occurrence of infected people and findings of positive food samples since 2019 indicate contaminated sesame-based products have been on the EU market for more than 2 years, said EFSA and ECDC.

Control measures such as withdrawals, recalls, and destroying implicated batches of sesame-based products have been taking place since August 2020 by food safety authorities in Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. However, it has not prevented occurrence of illnesses up to September 2021, possibly due to the long shelf life of products.

There remains a risk for new _Salmonella_ infections linked to imported sesame-based products from Syria as there is limited information on product manufacturing, including growing, harvesting, and distribution, said EFSA and ECDC.

[Tahini is a paste made from raw sesame seeds. Other products made from sesame seeds include hummus (together with chickpeas) and halvah.

The North American cases are part of the European outbreak.

Previous outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with food products produced from sesame seeds. In a previous ProMED posting (Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 - Australia, Europe 20010822.1980), between 1985 and 2001, the National Enteric Pathogen Surveillance Scheme (NEPSS) in Australia had recorded the isolation of 17 different _Salmonella_ spp. from sesame seeds and sesame seed products, including hummus, tahini, and halvah, on 30 occasions.

Sesame seed products should always be considered when attempting to identify a source of salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
