The directorate of agriculture in Sweida governorate started a free vaccination campaign against nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease] in cattle.

The head of the animal health department in the directorate, veterinarian Camille Morshed, said in a press statement today [Sun 13 Feb 2022] that the campaign, which will continue until the end of [February 2022], targets about 15 000 heads. The vaccines have been provided, free of charge, from the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, based on its importance in limiting the losses to the productivity and the economy of livestock caused by this disease.

Doctor Morshed pointed out that this campaign is in line with the continuation of work during the current period with 3 vaccination campaigns in sheep, against FMD [foot-and-mouth disease], enterotoxemia, and _Pasteurella_. She pointed out that the situation of livestock in the governorate is good with the absence of the spread of communicable and contagious diseases, but the breeders face the problem of lack and high prices of feed.

Over the past year [2021], the directorate of agriculture in As-Suwayda conducted more than 677 000 free-of-charge preventive vaccinations for cows, sheep, and goats against communicable and contagious diseases.

[Sweida (or As-Suwayda) is a southwestern Syrian governorate bordering Jordan; its population is mainly Druze (for a map of Syria's governorates, see http://www.mapsopensource.com/syria-map.html).

Lumpy skin disease (LSD), a capripox viral OIE-listed disease originally affecting cattle across Africa with sporadic introductions into neighboring Middle-Eastern countries, has spread, since 2013, outside the continent with epizootics in Balkan countries, trans-Ural Russia, and throughout Asia. Once the disease has a foothold in a country, the most effective way to control it is by mass vaccination of cattle. LSD was suspected to be circulating in Syria years before being officially reported in 2019.

Information about the vaccination policy in countries is of interest when assessing their animal health situation as well as reviewing their own assessment of the situation in neighboring territories. In the Near East, the transboundary spread of livestock diseases is supported by traditional pasturing patterns prescribed by the arid and semi-arid conditions and seasonal nomadism ignoring international borders.

Notably, sheep and goats in Sweda, bordering Jordan's Irbid governorate, are being vaccinated against FMD, a transboundary, highly infectious viral disease, endemic in the Middle East and currently widely spread in Jordan. It would be interesting to know which FMD virus strain(s) are included in the vaccines applied in Syria and in Jordan.

Enterotoxeamia ("pulpy kidney," a clostridial disease of offspring) is not a transboundary disease and is not OIE-listed. Immunization of lambs with a toxoid vaccine is common in all sheep-raising countries, globally. - Mod.AS
