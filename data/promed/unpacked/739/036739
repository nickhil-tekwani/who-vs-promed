Indonesia: 2 cases of measles confirmed among tsunami survivors in Aceh
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization on Mon 10 Jan 2005 confirmed 2 unconnected
cases of measles in tsunami survivors on the Indonesian island of Sumatra,
and health workers quickly vaccinated more than 1000 people to head off the
spread of the virus.
The cases occurred in separate villages outside the regional capital of
Banda Aceh, the area hit hardest by the 26 Dec 2004 earthquake and tsunami,
according to WHO, which considers just one case of measles an outbreak
because it is so contagious. "2 cases have been reported in 2 separate
villages," said Moira Connolly, who tracks outbreaks for WHO. The United
Nations children's agency, UNICEF, already was in the midst of a campaign
to vaccinate 600 000 people in devastated Sumatra against the disease when
the cases occurred, and it immediately inoculated a ring of 1200 people
living around the villages where each case was confirmed. Malnutrition in
refugee camps has been known to push the death rate as high as 30 per cent,
Connolly said. But malnutrition is not considered an issue yet among
tsunami survivors.
Measles circulates in Indonesia, and there have been several outbreaks
during the last few years, because most children have not been vaccinated.
WHO recommends immunizing more than 90 per cent of children to protect the
population from outbreaks. In Aceh province, only about 25 per cent of the
children were vaccinated before the earthquake, said Dr Georg Petersen,
WHO's representative in Indonesia. As aid agencies flooded into the
province in the wake of the tsunami, mass measles vaccination was a high
priority from the beginning. Overcrowded refugee camps provide
opportunities for the virus to spread out of control.
Vaccinating people living in neighborhoods surrounding a case usually shuts
down transmission very effectively and drastically reduces the severity of
any cases that slip through. Patients are not contagious during the 12 days
they are incubating the disease, which spreads through coughing and sneezing.
So far, there have been no major outbreaks of disease since a magnitude-9.0
earthquake in the Indian Ocean triggered a tsunami that killed more than
150 000 people across southern Asia and Africa.

Measles spreads in relief camps
-------------------------------
NEW DELHI: Despite mass immunisation campaigns, measles seems to be
spreading in relief camps in tsunami-affected areas. At least 13 cases of
measles have been reported among children in relief camps in Andamans and
15 in Tamil Nadu.
Addressing journalists on Friday evening, Union health secretary P K Hota
said the government was on "high alert". He said the cases of measles and
chicken pox reported so far were sporadic and spread over several relief
camps. Hota said there was no major breakdown in health conditions.
As there is no known treatment for chicken pox in the modern system of
medicine, Hota said practitioners of homeopathic medicine had been sent to
the areas. Health teams had been sent to most areas, he added. More than
100 doctors had been mobilised by the centre to supplement the resources of
state governments.
Hota said the government would be alert on all medical needs of the
affected areas for at least another 2 months. The centre was looking out
for 50 doctors and 50 paramedics who would be willing [to work] in the
areas for 2 months.
Experts say cases of typhoid and jaundice may not start appearing for
another month or so as they have a long incubation period. Hota said the
coming few months would also be crucial for monitoring the health of
expectant mothers and babies and that antenatal care would be stepped up.
