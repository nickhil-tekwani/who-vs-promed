[There are now more cases of both WPV and cVDPV reported during 2019 than were reported in 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 and there are still 2 months to go in this year (2019). The report of the cVDPV case in the Ukraine has still not been confirmed by WHO, and there continue to be positive cVDPV1 environmental samples being identified in the greater Manila metropolitan area in the Philippines -- an indication that cVDPV1 is still circulating there. Coverages in many countries have fallen to suboptimal levels following many years of vaccination campaigns. Reasons for the falling coverages may well include campaign fatigue following many years of campaigns, and the growing antivaccination movement in many countries, as well as political reasons. So is it time to get the medical anthropologists involved?

Note, please keep reading this post as there are 3 more cases confirmed in Pakistan.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 23 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

The National Institute of Health (NIH) confirmed 2 new polio cases from Lakki Marwat and Tank districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on [Wed 30 Oct 2019]. According to the details, wild poliovirus has been separated from stool sample of a 14 month old boy, resident of UC Pai, Tank district and a 9 month old boy resident of Bakhmal Ahmed Zai, Tehsil Sarai Norang, Lakki Marwat district.

Both children were zero dose for essential immunization and their status for polio vaccination is under vaccination.

"It is a matter of serious concern that polio continues to disable our children despite the fact that government is making every effort to ensure timely administration of anti-polio vaccine to the children at their doorsteps", said coordinator EOC [Emergency Operation Centre] Abdul Basit. He said that polio vaccine was completely safe, adding that the entire world including Muslim countries has eradicated polio using the same vaccine. Abdul Basit said that parents should not pay attention to anti-polio propaganda and protect their children from permanent disability by administering anti-polio drops to their kids.

[3] Pakistan (Sindh): media report

https://www.samaa.tv/news/2019/10/ninth-polio-case-reported-in-sindh-pakistan-tally-reaches-80/


Another polio case has been reported in Sindh, taking the tally in the province to 9. The total number of polio cases in the country this year (2019)has reached 80.

The victim is a 36 month old boy from Badhar Mohalla in District Sujawal, according to the Emergency Operation Centre for Polio in Sindh. He was malnourished and died as a result of kidney failure before a stool sample could be collected. The child had developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting on [10 Sep 2019] after which he was taken to several healthcare providers. As his condition worsened, his family took him to a local faith healer, who gave him 2 injections on the hips.

The next day the child could not walk properly. He was taken to Civil Hospital Thatta where Dr Maqsood, a paediatrician, examined him. He was diagnosed as a case of acute flaccid paralysis on [14 Oct 2019]. He was then referred to NICH [National Institute of Child Health] Karachi, where the child was admitted in critical condition. His condition deteriorated and he passed away from kidney failure before a stool sample could be collected.

However, 3 contact samples collected from immediate contacts confirmed that the polio virus was actively circulating in the area. The latest statistics show that 5 cases gave been detected in Punjab, 7 from Balochistan, and 59 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this year (2019).
