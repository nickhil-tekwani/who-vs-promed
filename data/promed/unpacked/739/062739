From: Dr. James Chin, CDPC-mail

The number of cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever admitted to two pediatric
hospitals which function as sentinel sites in Phnom Penh [the capital] was
much higher than normal in December 1997 and January 1998. During 1997 the
monthly number of cases had increased from 10 in January to a peak at 220
in November but remained below the monthly epidemic thresholds. The number
of cases fell to 140 in December but then increased again to 227 in January
1998 which is almost five times above the epidemic threshold for that
month. Three of the 227 cases were fatal. Experts from the WHO Office for
the Western Pacific Region are currently in the country to assess the
situation and discuss control strategies with the national health
authorities.
