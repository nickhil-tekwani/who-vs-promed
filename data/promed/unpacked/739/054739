A mysterious child illness called multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported across the Western Cape. According to the provincial Health Department, there have been 35 confirmed cases since June. MIS-C in children is a condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body like the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC).

When it first began emerging in late April/early May [2020], MIS-C or IMS-TS [PIMS is an alternative name for this syndrome -- pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. - Mod.MPP] was initially compared to Kawasaki-disease and toxic-shock syndrome. However, studies have revealed it is a new, distinct illness of its own. In May [2020], the CDC officially announced that MIS-C and COVID-19 are linked. While accurate numbers for private centres and other state hospitals are not readily available, Chris Scott, an associate professor at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital and Paediatric Rheumatology's head of division confirms that Tygerberg Hospital is facing roughly 35 cases. The cases range in severity.

The CDC warns that MISC-C can be serious and even deadly in children, but most who are diagnosed will recover with medical care. Symptoms to look out for in your child include:
- persistent fever
- irritability or sluggishness
- severe abdominal pain
- diarrhea
- vomiting
- rash
- red or pink eyes
- enlarged lymph node gland on one side of the neck
- red cracked lips or red tongue
- swollen hands and feet

The University of Cape Town's (UCT) Faculty of Health Sciences have joined forces with other paediatric specialists to gather and analyse data to help understand the illness better.

[Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported in children and adolescents approximately 2-4 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/06/covid-19-linked-syndrome-kids-new-distinct-studies-suggest).

The syndrome is associated with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. MIS-C cases present with significant elevation of inflammation markers, gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac symptoms, and shock. It remains a major clinical challenge to distinguish MIS-C cases from inflammatory conditions of other infectious diseases. Raising awareness among health care workers will enhance case management with early diagnosis and treatment. - Mod.TU

While the media report above doesn't specify whether these 35 cases have a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection preceding the onset of this illness, one presumes there is the association or they wouldn't be classifying this as MIS-C. Given the high transmission that has been ongoing in South Africa with the Western Cape one of the epicenters in the country, unfortunately, the identification of cases is not surprising. This may well reflect a "seek and ye shall find" phase of surveillance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about the topic?
Community and close contact exposures contribute to the spread of COVID-19.

What is added by this report?
Among children and adolescents aged less than 18 years in Mississippi, close contact with persons with COVID-19 and gatherings with persons outside the household and lack of consistent mask use in school were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas attending school or child care was not associated with receiving positive SARS-CoV-2 test results.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Close contacts with persons with COVID-19 and gatherings contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and adolescents. Consistent use of face masks and social distancing continue to be important to prevent COVID-19 spread.

As of [14 Dec 2020], children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have accounted for 10.2% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported in the United States.* Mitigation strategies to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among persons of all ages, are important for pandemic control. Characterization of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents can inform efforts by parents, school and program administrators, and public health officials to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To assess school, community, and close contact exposures associated with pediatric COVID-19, a case-control study was conducted to compare exposures reported by parents or guardians of children and adolescents aged less than 18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (case-patients) with exposures reported among those who received negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results (control participants). Among 397 children and adolescents investigated, in-person school or child care attendance 14 days or less before the SARS-CoV-2 test was reported for 62% of case-patients and 68% of control participants and was not associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-1.3). Among 236 children aged 2 years or older who attended child care or school during the 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 testing, parents of 64% of case-patients and 76% of control participants reported that their child and all staff members wore masks inside the facility (aOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8). In the 2 weeks preceding SARS-CoV-2 testing, case-patients were more likely to have had close contact with a person with known COVID-19 (aOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 2.0-5.0), have attended gatherings+ with persons outside their household, including social functions (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.5) or activities with other children (aOR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.3-8.4), or have had visitors in the home (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-2.9) than were control participants. Close contacts with persons with COVID-19 and gatherings contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and adolescents. Consistent use of masks, social distancing, isolation of infected persons, and quarantine of those who are exposed to the virus continue to be important to prevent COVID-19 spread

[Methodology available at the source URL above]

Among the 397 participants, 82 (21%) were aged less than 4 years, 214 (54%) were female, 217 (55%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 145 (37%) were non-Hispanic White ([Table -- Characteristics of children and adolescents aged less than 18 years who received positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (N = 397)* -- Mississippi, September-November 2020 available at the source URL above]). Participants were tested in outpatient health facilities (78%) or emergency departments (22%); 53% were tested because they were experiencing symptoms; case-patients were more likely than were control participants to be tested because of close contact with a COVID-19 case (66% versus 41%) (p less than 0.01). Overall, case-patients were more likely to have had close contact with a person with known COVID-19 than control participants (aOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 2.0-5.0); 64% of close contacts of case-patients and 48% of those of control participants were family members (p = 0.02), whereas school or child care classmates were reported as close contacts for 15% and 27%, respectively (p = 0.04). In-person school or child care attendance less than or equal to 14 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test was reported for 62% of case-patients and 68% of control participants and was not associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (aOR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.5-1.3). Among 236 children aged greater than or equal to 2 years who attended child care or school during the 2 weeks before the SARS-CoV-2 test, parents of 64% of case-patients and 76% of control participants reported that their child and all staff members wore masks inside the facility (aOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8).

Compared with control participants, case-patients were more likely to have attended gatherings with persons outside their household, including social functions (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.5), activities with children (aOR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.3-8.4), or to have had visitors at home (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-2.9) during the 14 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test ([Figure -- Adjusted odds ratios (aORs)* and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for close contact, school or child care, and community exposures† associated with confirmed COVID-19 among children and adolescents aged less than 18 years (N = 397) -- Mississippi, September-November 2020]); 27% of all parents whose children attended social gatherings reported mask use by all persons present and 46% reported adherence to social distancing, whereas 16% and 39%, respectively reported mask use and social distancing when having visitors in the home.

Discussion
----------
In this investigation, children and adolescents who received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely than were similarly aged participants who had negative test results to have had reported close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19 and less likely to have had reported consistent mask use by students and staff members inside the school facility. Among participants with close contact with a person with COVID-19, close contacts of case-patients were more likely to be family members and less likely to be school or child care classmates than were those of control participants. Attending in-person school or child care during the 2 weeks before the SARS-CoV-2 test was not associated with increased likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. The majority of respondents reported universal mask use inside school and child care facilities as recommended by Mississippi State Department of Health,** although parents of case-patients were less likely than were those of control participants to report consistent mask use indoors among their child aged greater than or equal to 2 years and staff members. Efforts to reduce COVID-19 in families and communities, in addition to mitigation strategies in schools and child care programs, are important for preventing transmission to children and adolescents.†† With increasing COVID-19 incidence and various behaviors across the country, timely investigations to identify activities associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission can inform targeted mitigation strategies at local levels.

Among children and adolescents with COVID-19, 69% reported close contact with a person with COVID-19, similar to previous findings among children and adults (3-5). Most close contact exposures were to family members, consistent with household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (6-8). Fewer (42%) children who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result reported close contact with a person with known COVID-19. To help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, persons exposed to someone with COVID-19 should stay home, in addition to adhering to recommendations to wear masks, maintain social distance, and wash hands often.// If a family member or other close contact is ill, additional prevention measures can be taken to reduce transmission, such as wearing masks, reducing shared meals and items, cleaning and disinfecting the home, and wearing gloves for those with and without known COVID-19.^^

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the sample included 397 children and adolescents tested during September-November 2020 at health care facilities associated with one large academic medical center in Mississippi and might not be representative of children and adolescents in other geographic areas of the United States. Further, parents of eligible children who could not be contacted or refused to participate could be systematically different from those who were interviewed for this investigation. Second, unmeasured confounding is possible, such that reported behaviors might represent factors, including concurrently participating in activities in which possible exposures could have taken place, that were not included in the analysis or measured in the study. Most respondents were aware of their child's SARS-CoV-2 test results and interviews were conducted several weeks after testing, factors which could have influenced parent responses. Third, parent report of frequency of mask or cloth face covering use at schools and child care programs was not verified. Finally, case or control status might be subject to misclassification because of imperfect sensitivity or specificity of PCR-based testing.

This investigation highlights differences in community and close contact exposures and in-school mask use between children and adolescents who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and those who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result during the beginning of the 2020-21 academic year in Mississippi. Continued efforts to prevent transmission at schools and child care programs are important, as are assessments of various types of activities and exposures to identify risk factors for COVID-19 as children engage in classroom and social interactions (9,10). Exposures and activities in which persons are less likely to maintain mask use and social distancing, including family gatherings and group activities, might be important risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents. Promoting behaviors to reduce exposures to SARS-CoV-2 among children and adolescents in the household and community, as well as in schools and child care programs, is needed to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks at schools*** and child care programs and slow the spread of COVID-19.

[There has been a continual debate ongoing regarding the risks and benefits of in-person schooling for children. Most conclusions have favored in-person schooling for younger children, a finding this study was addressing and also concluded. The mantra continues on the need for continued use of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) such as social distancing, consistent mask wearing, frequent handwashing, and avoiding social gatherings. - Mod.MPP]

SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in the general population and high-risk occupational groups across 18 cities in Iran: a population-based cross-sectional study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2020; Online First; published 15 Dec 2020. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30858-6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
Rapid increases in cases of COVID-19 were observed in multiple cities in Iran towards the start of the pandemic. However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate.

Methods
In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity).

Findings
From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between [17 Apr 2020] and [2 Jun 2020], 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 17.1% (95% CI 14.6-19.5), implying that 4 265 542 (95% CI 3 659 043-4 887 078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (72.6% [53.9-92.8]) and Qom (58.5% [37.2-83.9]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 20.0% (18.5-21.7) and showed little variation between the occupations included.

Interpretations
Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran.

[The authors added the following information:
"Research in context
"Evidence before this study
"Iran was one of the 1st countries to report an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and saw a rapid increase in cases nationwide. However, in the absence of seroprevalence studies, the true infection rate in Iran has remained unknown. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, and the WHO Global Research Database for publications on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, published in English, using the search terms "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "COVID-19", "seroprevalence", "IgG/IgM antibodies", to [30 Aug 2020]. To date, most seroprevalence studies have not been peer reviewed and estimation of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in individuals employed in occupations with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure has been inadequate. Furthermore, in most studies, the overall prevalence estimates were not further stratified by geographical areas (such as cities within a county or country) and did not take the potential variation of infection rate in different regions into account.

"Added value of this study
"In this population-based study, we assessed the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in 18 cities in Iran. This is the 1st seroprevalence study in the Middle East to report the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population as well as in individuals employed in occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings imply that, in the general population, 4 542 265 individuals from the included cities were infected by the end of April 2020, and that 1 522 798 (35.7%) infected individuals in this population were asymptomatic. Seroprevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies showed heterogeneity across the general populations in different cities, ranging from 1.7% to 72.6%. Compared with other seroprevalence studies from around the world, the seroprevalence estimates in the general population of Iran in this study were high.

"Implications of all the available evidence
"The overall 17.1% seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies across the cities in this study confirms that a large proportion of the population in Iran is still susceptible to the virus. Public health policies and adequate personal protective equipment among front-line workers are therefore needed to prevent the potential increase in patient load in hospitals across the country and to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, especially during the 2nd and 3rd waves of infection. The similar seroprevalence estimates between general and high-risk populations has important public health implications, possibly indicating inadequate or low adherence to infection control measures, which requires further investigation."

While the overall seroprevalence is relatively low (17.1%), the seroprevalence of 72.6% in Rasht and 58.5% in Qom are the highest seroprevalence I have seen to date. As a reminder, Qom was the epicenter of the 1st wave of infections in Iran, and Rasht is located on the Caspian Sea and was one of the epicenters of the 2nd wave, attributed to internal movement for holiday time (analogous to what is currently ongoing in the USA associated with Thanksgiving weekend travel and is feared globally for the upcoming Christmas/New Year period.) The sampling included selected high risk groups (front-line physicians and nurses, non-front-line health-care workers, pharmacy staff, taxi drivers, bank employees, and cashiers of supermarket chains).

The study is well worth reading and digesting the findings.

The conclusion that 4 542 265 individuals were infected by the end of April 2020, when the reported number of confirmed cases on 30 Apr 2020 was 93 657 cases (COVID-19 update (144): China, South Korea, countries w/ high local transmission 20200430.7284979), suggests only 2.1% of infections were confirmed. The estimated 35.1% of asymptomatic infections doesn't explain the major discrepancy. Testing kit shortages overwhelmed healthcare facilities and providers and probably a higher proportion of mild presentations that may have been forgotten at the time of interview may explain the major under-reporting.

Given the high seroprevalence in Rasht by the end of April 2020, one can't help but wonder about the transmission rate there now -- is almost 73% seroprevalence high enough to provide "herd immunity"? Or has there been waning immunity and are reinfections being seen? Food for thought.

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
Global summary
In the past week the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths continued to rise with 70 million cumulative cases and 1.6 million deaths globally since the start of the pandemic. The Regions of the Americas and Europe continue to shoulder the burden of the pandemic, accounting for 85% of new cases and 86% of new deaths globally. However as new cases and new deaths continue to rise in the Americas, cases stabilised in Europe for the 3rd week in a row, while deaths continued to decrease. The African and the Western-Pacific Regions have both shown renewed rises in November and December [2020]. This week the African Region reported a rise in new cases and new deaths of over 40% compared with the previous week. In the South-East Asia Region, the number of new cases and deaths continued to decline following a peak in September [2020]. The Eastern Mediterranean Region also reported a decline in new cases and deaths from a peak in mid-November [2020].

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of cases globally were the United States of America (reporting over 1.4 million cases, a 16% increase from the previous week), Brazil (300 000 new a 2% increase), Turkey (220 000 cases, no change from last week), India (210 000 cases, a 15% decrease), and the Russian Federation (193 000 new cases, a 1% increase).

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
Following a decline in July and August [2020] and a plateau in September and October [2020], the number of new cases and deaths has consistently increased since the beginning of November (Figure 3). In the last week, the number of new cases and deaths reported increased by 40% (to 74 500 new cases) and 43% (to 1400 new deaths), respectively compared with the previous week. Several countries in the Region are reporting a resurgence in both cases and deaths including Mali, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa.

South Africa has reported the highest number of cumulative cases and deaths in the Region, with more than 850 000 confirmed cases and over 23 000 deaths. In the last week, 42 500 new cases (700 new cases per 1 million population) and 1000 new deaths (18 new deaths per 1 million population) were reported. 4 provinces including Eastern Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and Western Cape were most heavily affected, collectively accounting for 84% of all newly reported cases. The increase in affected provinces is expected to continue as the number of cases among those aged 15 to 19 years continues to increase. This increase could be partly attributed to end-of-school-year celebrations during which many adolescents gathered in large numbers.

In Uganda, the number of reported cases has continued to increase and in the last 7 days, just under 5000 cases were reported (100 new cases per 1 million population), a 118% increase from the previous week. The districts of Kampala, Kasese, Luwero, Mbarara and Wakiso have consistently reported the highest number of cases for the past 3 weeks, with Kampala the most affected. So far in the pandemic, a total of 1516 cases, including 13 deaths, have been reported among health care workers, with the highest number reported in the week commencing [23 Nov 2020], during which over 150 cases in health care workers were reported.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [13 Dec 2020]

- Region of the Americas
The Region of the Americas has consistently reported the largest proportion of cases and deaths globally, and in the past week accounted for 47% and 40% of global cases and deaths respectively. In the past week, over 2 million cases and nearly 30 000 deaths were reported, which is the highest reported in the Region since the start of the pandemic. This represents an 11% increase in cases and a 12% increase in deaths compared to the previous week (Figure 4).

Last week, the United States of America reported an increase of 16% in cases (1.45 million new cases, 4400 new cases per 1 million population) and a 21% increase in deaths (16 600 new deaths, 50 new deaths per 1 million population), compared to the previous week, as cases continue to rise after the Thanksgiving holiday in November [2020]. The daily number of deaths reported exceeded 3000 during the last week, higher than the peak observed in the spring. Further increases in cases and deaths are expected due to the upcoming holiday season with more people travelling into and around the country. Hospitalization rates for COVID-19 cases have grown considerably since the beginning of October [2020]. Kentucky, Georgia, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Texas are the most affected, with counties reporting high hospital occupancy rates.

Bermuda has reported a cumulative total of nearly 400 cases and 9 deaths since the start of the pandemic. However, since the beginning of December [2020], the number of cases has increased substantially. In the last week, 103 new cases were reported (1650 new cases per 1 million population) a 150% increase from the previous week. Approximately 30% of the total number of cases have been imported. Visitors are not required to quarantine on arrival if they provide a valid negative COVID-19 test taken at least 5 days before arrival. Due to the rapid rise in cases, public health and social measures were implemented on [12 Dec 2020] including a curfew, early closure of businesses, and restrictions on gatherings.

Uruguay has reported a 48% increase in the number of new cases to 2100 new cases (610 new cases per 1 million population) and a 67% increase in the number of deaths to 10 new deaths (3 new deaths per 1 million) in comparison to previous week. The test positivity rate has also increased in the last couple of weeks and is currently 5.1%. The capital, and largest city in Uruguay, Montevideo is the most affected area accounting for over 60% of cases.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [13 Dec 2020]

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
Compared with the previous reporting week, this week the Region reported a 17% decline in new cases to just over 200 000 cases and a 14% decline in new deaths to 4 400 deaths. This extends the decline observed since mid-November [2020] when new cases peaked at around 250 000 and new deaths at just over 6000. The Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Morocco, Jordan, and the occupied Palestinian territory reported the highest number of cases, although all these countries except Pakistan reported declines in the number of new cases in the past week (Figure 5).

Pakistan reported 22 000 new cases (99 new cases per 1 million population) and 420 new deaths (2 new deaths per 1 million population). New weekly cases have risen since the week of [19 Oct 2020], when 4000 cases were reported. This week's new cases and deaths represent a 5% and 17% rise respectively compared to last week. Since the beginning of the pandemic, as of [6 Dec 2020], Pakistan had conducted 5.7 million COVID-19 tests, with a current positivity rate of 7.5%. The Sindh and Punjab Regions account for around 73% of total cases, with around half of current active cases reported from the Sindh Region.

The United Arab Emirates reported 8500 new cases (850 new cases per 1 million population) and 20 new deaths (2 new deaths per 1 million population). New cases per week have remained above 8000 since [12 Oct 2020]. The United Arab Emirates is the 1st country to approve a vaccine produced by Sinopharm, based in China. In the next few weeks, Abu Dhabi is planning to further open the business, tourism, and cultural sectors.

Tunisia reported 7400 new cases (620 new cases per 1 million population) and 310 new deaths (26 new deaths per 1 million population). Similar to the United Arab Emirates, new cases per week have also remained high since the end of September and October [2020], with more than 7000 new weekly cases reported. Since the beginning of the pandemic, as of [6 Dec 2020], 480 000 tests have been conducted, with a current positivity rate of 30%. National authorities have announced an extension to the night curfew until the end of the year [2020].

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [13 Dec 2020]

- European Region
The number of new cases continued to stabilise for the 3rd consecutive week in the European Region. There was also a decline in reported deaths for the 2nd consecutive week, a decrease of 4% compared to the previous week. The number of new deaths reported this week, particularly in eastern and southern countries of the European Region, exceeded 60 per 1 million, the highest globally (Figure 6). In the past week, some countries have announced initial vaccination in the population, while others are preparing for the introduction of the vaccine. Despite this, it is important that public health and social measures, including hand hygiene, mask wearing, physical distancing and adequate ventilation, along with other measures, continue.

The Russian Federation reported 193 000 new cases (1300 new cases per 1 million population), the 2nd highest number of cases in the European Region after Turkey, and 3800 new deaths (26 new deaths per 1 million population). The 2 most populous cities in the country, Moscow and St Petersburg, together with the Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod regions, are reporting the highest numbers of new cases. Since the 1st cases on [31 Jan 2020], over 2.6 million cases and 46 000 deaths have now been reported - the 4th highest global total cases. The number of new cases and new deaths has increased over 5-fold since the last week of August [2020], when 33 500 new cases and 700 new deaths were reported. In the past week, 23 tests per 1000 population were conducted resulting in a test positivity rate of around 6%.

Serbia reported 47 500 new cases (6800 new cases per 1 million population) and 380 new deaths (55 new deaths per 1 million population). This was a slight decrease in new cases from the previous week during which over 50 000 new cases were reported. The number of cases has rapidly increased since September [2020], when there were around 500 new cases per week. The percentage of COVID-19 tests that are positive has increased from less than 10% in September [2020] to over 30% last week during which 19 tests per 1000 population were conducted.

Sweden reported 32 000 new cases (3200 new cases per 1 million population) and 128 new deaths (13 new deaths per 1 million population). New weekly cases have remained above 30 000 since [9 Nov 2020]. However, there was a substantial decrease in deaths reported this week with a 62% decrease compared to the previous week.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [13 Dec 2020]

- South-East Asia Region
In the South-East Asia Region, new cases reported (290 000) showed a 13% decline from the previous week and continued the general pattern of decreasing cases since early September [2020]. New deaths (4400) decreased by 12% in the past week, following a 3 week increase. Only 3 out of 10 countries in the region (Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Thailand) reported an increase in new cases this week (Figure 7).

While India has consistently reported the highest number of cases and deaths in the Region, declining trends in both have been seen over the past month [November to December 2020], with that trend continuing this week. The country reported decreases in both new cases (213 000, a 15% decrease) and new deaths (2800, a 19% decrease) compared with the previous week. A recent study found that very few deaths were recorded in long-term care facilities across the 3 western Indian states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra, states that are among some of the most affected by the pandemic. India has conducted over 153 million tests since the start of the pandemic with 4.9 tests per 1000 population conducted in the previous week and a test positivity rate of around 3.2%.

In Indonesia, the trend in increasing new cases and deaths reported in the past 5 weeks, continued last week. While there was a very minor increase in the number of new cases (42 000, a 1% increase), the number of new deaths reported this week increased by 13% (to just over 1000). In the week ending [6 Dec 2020] just 0.89 tests per 1000 population were conducted with a test positivity rate of 14.2%, suggesting the need to expand testing to ensure all cases are being detected. The highest number of cumulative cases is seen in the provinces of DKI Jakarta, Jawa Timur, and Jawa Tengah.

Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO South-East Asia Region, as of [13 Dec 2020]

- Western Pacific Region
Although cases and deaths in the region still continue to account for a very small proportion of the global total, a 13% increase in the number of new weekly cases (45 000) and a 16% increase in new weekly deaths (500) was observed in the past 7 days in the Western Pacific Region. With the exception of a slight decrease last week, this follows an increasing trend over the past 6 weeks. There are considerable regional differences, with around half of countries reporting decreases and half reporting increases in cases (notably Japan, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea) (Figure 8).

Japan continues to report the highest number of weekly new cases in the Region and this week reported record highs (17 200 cases, 136 new cases per 1 million), following increases over the previous 8 weeks. In an effort to reduce increasing cases and demands on healthcare, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) have sent health workers to Asahikawa city in Hokkaido Prefecture. Osaka prefecture has also requested additional support in healthcare capacity from the JSDF as it is the 2nd most affected prefecture following Tokyo. In the previous week Japan conducted 1.9 tests per 1000 population with a test positivity rate of over 6%.

This is the 5th consecutive week the Republic of Korea has reported an increase in new cases, reaching the highest total of new weekly cases (5 200). The provinces reporting the highest incidence are Seoul and Gyeonggi-do. As a result of these increases, tighter public health and social measures in the Capital area have been implemented until the end of the year [2020]. In the past week, hospital bed shortages in the Seoul area have also been reported, with only 3 out of 62 hospital beds for critically ill patients in Seoul city currently available.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 15 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC15_1608081679.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 48.4% of daily case numbers and 30.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 30.6 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Argentina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Panama, Peru, and Chile. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Uruguay. Costa Rica among others did not report any new cases to WHO in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 37.9% of daily case numbers and 53.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 22.3 million. Countries not reporting cases today (15 Dec 2020) include Sweden, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Turkey, Russia, UK, Germany, Italy, and Poland. There are 20 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours and 4 countries reporting more than 500 but less than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.3% of daily case numbers and 5.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.53 million cases. Iran is dominant, with decreasing daily case counts now around 7500, followed by Jordan, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Iraq, Morocco, Lebanon, and UAE. Tunisia, Sudan, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.7% of daily case numbers and 2.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.64 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, reporting just over 5100 new cases, followed by Algeria, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Namibia, Reunion, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Cameroon, and Zimbabwe. 18 countries and territories in the region did not report cases for the last 24 hours, among which are Madagascar, DR Congo, and Botswana.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.97 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, French Polynesia, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 6.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 6.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.4 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant (although reported just over 22 000 cases), followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on both the regional and country levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 83% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, South Korea continues with high daily reports with the most recent almost 900 cases. Indonesia reported just under 5500 cases. Iran may have "peaked" as seen by decreasing daily new cases. South Africa reported just over 5100 new cases. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis, now reporting just over 180 000 cases in the past 24 hours, and still reflecting weekend reporting slowdowns.
