Is ProMED-mail now taking on the political issue of "gulf war syndrome" by
providing this non-medically based report?
On a medical note, has any physician ever seen/heard of a case of
organophosphate poisoning passed on to the families of victems who had no
exposure to same? If so, I would be interested in the literature - Ian
[The results of organophosphate poisoning in man are well described. For
the medical basis concerning the vaccines, see item [3] below. We are
reporting that:
(a) heavy fogging with insecticides took place over British troop
concentrations,
(b) a never-before-tested combination of vaccines was used on the troops, and
(c) one soldier said his child had developed similar symptoms to his own. -

Is the contradiction in the post so obvious that it needs no comment, or am
I missing something? If Gulf War Syndrome is caused by insecticides and/or
vaccinations, how was it communicated to family members after the veterans
returned home?
[These are two different issues. Opinions about possible transmission
should not be allowed to cloud the fact that soldiers were exposed to a
unique combination of chemical and bacteriological insults that had never
before been tested in lab animals, let alone humans. But how many people
would be complaining today if Iraq had actually used chemical & biological
weapons, and thousands of lives had been saved by this combination?
On transmission, there is plenty of evidence in the literature of the
psychological transfer of symptoms.- Mod.JW]

Headline: Gulf Troops 'Had Too Many Anthrax Jabs'
---------------------------------------
Peter Beaumont Defence Correspondent
[Excerpts]
At a meeting with Defence Minister Earl Howe and the Countess of Mar
this week, the veterans will say some servicemen were given up to five
doses of anthrax treatment -- designed to be spread over nine months
-- in barely three weeks.
Their claims are supported by documents disclosed to two veterans, Ray
Bristow and Shaun Rusling, by senior officers at the Ministry of Defence
[MoD] and passed to Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark.
According to an MoD memorandum on the 'UK Vaccination Programme',
the anthrax vaccine produced by the Public Health Laboratory and the
Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research was intended to be given
in four shots - 'an initial dose followed by doses at 3, 7 and 32 weeks'.
Instead, some soldiers were given three vaccinations in three weeks
plus two extra anthrax shots included in biological warfare vaccines.
Many soldiers say they suffered high fever after the jabs. Robert Lake
from Winnersh, Berkshire, had to be given the kiss of life when he
collapsed after an anthrax injection.
He later developed a food allergy, fatigue, headaches, chest pains,
vomiting, stomach pains, eye problems, poor memory, and diarrhoea --
which Dr John Mansfield, president of the British Society for Allergy and
Environmental Medicine, believed was caused by the injections.
[Because I was then directing Task Force 'Scorpio', an international rescue
team set up to measure contamination levels in affected civilian areas
before the arrival of U.N. and other humanitarian aid personnel, I received
3 doses of that same vaccine at 0, 3 & 5 weeks, followed by a booster after
one year, with no ill effects - Mod.JW]
