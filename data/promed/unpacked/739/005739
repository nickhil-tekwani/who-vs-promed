Seventeen people are suspected to have been poisoned and one person has died in Brazil after drinking beer. Sixteen males and one female aged 23-76 years old are thought to have suffered diethylene glycol poisoning. Four cases have been confirmed, and the remaining 13 are under investigation as they have showed similar symptoms, according to the Minas Gerais State Department of Health.

The 1st person was admitted to a hospital on 30 Dec 2019 suffering from acute renal failure and neurological issues such as facial paralysis, blurred vision, and sensory alteration. For suspected cases, the earliest onset of symptoms is 19 Dec 2019. The average number of days between onset of symptoms and hospitalization was 2.5 days.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (Mapa) has told Cervejaria Backer to recall all products manufactured from October 2019 to the current date. The company has challenged this as it believes only Belorizontina branded beers could be affected.

Analyzes on samples of Belorizontina and Capixaba products made by the brewery have confirmed presence of the contaminants monoethylene glycol and diethylene glycol. The latter substance has also been found in the blood of some of those sick. Both substances are used as antifreeze in the brewing industry.

Mapa has stopped Cervejaria Backer's Tres Lobos unit in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, for precautionary reasons. A total of 139 000 l [36 720 gal] of bottled beer and 8480 l [2240 gal] of draft beer has been seized, and tanks and other production equipment were also sealed.

Only monoethylene glycol is used in the production process, according to the company.

However, tests on a cooling tank used in the production of Belorizontina beer batch L2 1354 came back positive for diethylene glycol. The substance had been detected in samples of 2 beers from batches L1 1348 and L2 1348 provided by family members of patients. Capixaba beer from batch L2 1348 was positive for monoethylene glycol and diethylene glycol.

Bottles from the families of victims and the company were found to be intact and showed no signs of tampering.

Officials believe the beer was contaminated sometime between the 2nd half of November [2019] and the start of December 2019. Several lines of enquiry are being followed including accidental contamination and possible adulteration by a former employee.

A statement from the company said it was focused on patients and their families.

Brewery officials said the firm was collaborating with official enquiries and internally investigating to find out how the lots identified by police were contaminated. Results of independent tests are pending.

[Diethylene glycol (DEG) is a colorless, virtually odorless, hygroscopic liquid with a sweet taste typically used in antifreeze solutions and as a solvent for many products. When consumed, DEG causes severe systemic and neurologic complications, including coma, seizures, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatorenal failure. A patient in an acute condition appears inebriated but has no alcohol on his or her breath. DEG is commonly used in the commercial preparation of antifreeze, brake fluid, cigarettes, and some dyes. It is an excellent solvent for many relatively insoluble substances. DEG is also commonly used in human medications, such as acetaminophen and sulfanilamide, either intentionally or accidentally, leading to episodes of human poisoning, several being fatal.

Pathologic examination has demonstrated severe demyelination, with lesser axonal damage, of virtually all cranial and peripheral nerves sampled (Rollins, Filley, McNutt, Chahal, & Kleinschmidt-DeMasters, 2002). DEG ingestion is often associated with limb weakness, multiple cranial neuropathies including hearing loss and optic nerve involvement, areflexia, and CSF cytoalbuminologic dissociation, mimicking GBS [Guillain-Barre syndrome] (Baldwin and Sran, 2010; Rollins et al., 2002; Zhou, Zabad, and Lewis, 2002). The neurophysiological pattern seen was not thought to be typical for GBS in which conduction velocity slowing and distal latency prolongation are commonly seen in subsequent studies several days after the onset of symptoms.

Additionally, DEG has been used as an illegal adulterant in wine. Because of its toxicity, DEG is not allowed in food and drugs. DEG affects the CNS, heart, respiratory system, liver, pancreas, and kidneys. Biochemical changes associated with toxicity include elevated hepatic enzyme levels, as well as increased serum BUN and creatinine levels. The clinical presentation is characterized by a nonspecific febrile prodromal illness, and within 2 weeks, followed by anuric renal failure, pancreatitis, hepatitis, and neurologic dysfunction, progressing to coma. Histopathology of kidney tissue demonstrates acute tubular necrosis with regeneration and interstitial edema. DEG poisoning shows extensive tubular necrosis; however, the oxalate deposition is of EG (ethylene glycol) poisoning, which causes renal and cerebral damage, and has not been observed in DEG poisoning. Similar to EG, DEG is not toxic, but its metabolites are.

Acute kidney injury is usually the main cause of death, appearing between 8 and 24 hours after exposure to lethal doses of diethylene glycol. Diethylene glycol poisoning can also result in hepatic disease, pancreatitis, and neurologic abnormalities, which appear up to a few days after exposure. Laboratory findings in clinical assessment of diethylene glycol can include an elevated osmolar gap, elevated anion gap, elevated creatinine, and acidosis. Direct quantitation of diethylene glycol and HEAA in serum, urine, and CSF has also been reported, but there is limited clinical guidance on how to use this information beyond confirming exposure.
