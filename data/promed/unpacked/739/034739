Diseases Control Service, Territory of Wallis and Futuna
Dengue fever has appeared in Wallis: a number of cases have been confirmed
due to the presence of the virus in the blood of several patients. This is
an epidemic of dengue 2 virus; the last time the Territory was affected by
this serotype was in 1971.
The disease broke out at the beginning of August in villages in the
island's southern and central districts.
The epidemiological survey conducted did not allow identification of the
initial contaminator, probably a healthy carrier from New Caledonia.
Up to date, the chronological development of dengue fever is as follows,
taking into account the date symptoms began:
* 1st week of August:
South: 4 cases (3 hospitalised, all 4 confirmed)
Centre: 1 case (hospitalised)
* 2nd week of August:
South: 1 case (hospitalised and confirmed)
* 3rd week of August:
South: 4 cases (0 hospitalised, 0 confirmed)
Centre:1 case (hospitalised and confirmed)
for a total of 12 cases, 5 of which were hospitalised and 6 confirmed.
Hyperthermia was the sole cause for hospitalisation. There have been no
cases of severe form of dengue and no deaths.
The epidemic occurred in the "dry" season. There are very few mosquitoes.
Usual prevention measures have been taken.
