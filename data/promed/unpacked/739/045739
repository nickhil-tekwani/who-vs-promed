The Health Protection Agency (HPA) in England has been investigating
an outbreak of measles in the Irish Traveller community. Between 23
Mar and 26 May 2007, 92 cases have been reported from 6 of England's
9 regions: London, East of England, South East, South West, East
Midlands, and Yorkshire and the Humber. A further 6 cases were
reported among unvaccinated Irish Travellers in Norway between 7 and
14 May 2007 following a suspected importation by an infected Irish
Traveller from England [1]. The outbreak in England is thought to
have been associated with a gathering of Irish Travellers in
southeast London on 3 Apr 2007. We describe the ongoing investigation
of this outbreak.
Epidemiological investigation:
For our investigation, we defined a confirmed case as an individual
with a clinical diagnosis of measles and laboratory confirmation of
measles IgM or RNA, with date of onset of illness after 3 Apr 2007,
and who is either a member of the Irish Traveller community or who
had contact with a confirmed case associated with this outbreak
within 4 weeks of date of illness onset. A probable case was defined
as for a confirmed case, but with no laboratory confirmation of
measles IgM or RNA.
Between [3 Apr and 26 May 2007], there were 41 confirmed and 49
probable cases of measles occurring among the Irish Traveller
community in England. However, 2 additional confirmed cases were
identified in Irish Travellers from a site in the East of England
with dates of onset in late March [2007] and with an epidemiological
link to the gathering of Irish Travellers on [3 Apr 2007]. These 2
cases and the subsequent confirmed cases were caused by the same
measles D4 strain (MVs/Enfield.GBR/14.07/).
We therefore included these 2 cases in our investigation, even though
they occurred before the time period of interest of our case
definition. The date of illness onset for the 92 confirmed and
probable cases are shown in Figure 1 [see URL link provided above].
The average incubation period for measles is 10 days (typical range 7
to 18 days). The 1st case occurred on [23 Mar 2007], 11 days before
the gathering in southeast London. The 2nd sibling case and probably
index case occurred on [28 Mar 2007], 6 days before the gathering.
Four distinct peaks can be distinguished in Figure 1. The 1st peak of
10 cases occurred between [14 and 16 Apr 2007], 11 to 13 days after
the gathering in southeast London. There was a 2nd peak of 19 cases
between [23 and 25 Apr 2007], 9 to 11 days after the 1st peak. Ten
cases occurred 9 to 11 days later (between 2 and 4 May). A 4th peak
of 13 cases between 12 and [14 May 2007] occurred 10 to 12 days
later. This pattern suggests ongoing transmission within the Irish
Traveller community.
Cases were identified as living in one of 10 distinct Irish Traveller
sites across 6 English regions (Table 1 [see URL link above]). London
and the East of England regions have experienced the largest number
of cases so far. The smaller number of cases reported from the other
regions have occurred more recently, suggesting that this outbreak
may be spreading to other parts of the country.
Cases were aged between 2 months and 21 years and were equally
distributed between the sexes (Table 2 [see URL link above]). The
majority of cases were between one and 14 years old, with 6 cases
under one year, and 12 cases were 15 years and older. Of 38 confirmed
cases for whom information was available, 36 (95 percent) were
unvaccinated at the period of exposure. The 2 vaccinated confirmed
cases received one dose of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine,
but the date of vaccination was not available.
Clinical symptoms are shown in Table 3 [see URL link above]. Nearly
all cases reported rash and fever, and just under 2/3rds reported
conjunctivitis, cough or coryza. Thirteen cases were admitted to
hospital, although no serious complications arising from measles
infection were reported.
Public health measures:
In affected areas, local Health Protection Units have been working
with local National Health Service providers to offer vaccination
with MMR to Irish Traveller communities. Traveller education liaison
teams from local authorities have been contacted to notify schools
with pupils from the Irish Traveller community. Traveller
organizations and societies have been contacted to help raise
awareness of the importance of MMR vaccination. Information about
this outbreak has been distributed nationally, and Health Protection
Units in non-affected areas have been asked to report any cases of
measles that might be linked with this outbreak.
Discussion:
Measles is a notifiable disease in the United Kingdom (UK) and the UK
childhood immunization schedule includes one dose of MMR vaccine at
13 months and a 2nd dose between 3 and 5 years of age. In England,
vaccination coverage decreased after concerns about the safety of MMR
were published in 2002. Although, coverage for the 1st dose of MMR
has since increased to 84 percent in 2006, it is still below
recommended levels. MMR coverage may be lower still in some
communities, such as Irish Travellers, who report poorer health than
comparable groups of residents from socially deprived inner city
areas, other ethnic minorities and rural residents [2]. There was an
outbreak of measles in the Irish Traveller community in England in
2006, resulting in over 700 cases [3,4]. However, this mostly
involved a B3 strain, suggesting that this current outbreak is a
result of reintroduction of measles into the Irish Traveller
community. Low vaccination coverage and frequent movement of
travelling communities presents a particular challenge for measles
elimination in Europe [5]. This outbreak also emphasizes the
difficulties in eliminating a disease in its end-phase with the
threat of importation/exportation of measles, as happened here with
Norway.

[Trends in reported cases of measles in the UK can be found at
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/measles/data_mmr_confirmed.htm>.
In 2006, there were 736 confirmed cases of measles reported by the
United Kingdom Health Protection Agency (HPA). As of 15 Jun 2007,
there have been 82 cases of measles notified in the UK (see
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/noids/2007/WN0724.PDF>;
there is mention that the number of notified cases may be an
overestimate, as many are found not to be confirmed at a later date).
The above article refers to 41 confirmed cases, with 49 additional
probable cases among this group of travellers -- a total of 90
possible pending cases -- a figure different from that given in the
Health Protection Agency Statutory notifications of infectious
diseases in England and Wales, week 24, 2007.
As mentioned in the above discussion, vaccination coverages with
measles-containing vaccines in the UK have been less than optimal.
The occurrence of an outbreak in a selected small pocket of
unvaccinated individuals is a challenge for the country as a whole,
where vaccination coverages are sub-optimal. - Mod.MPP]
