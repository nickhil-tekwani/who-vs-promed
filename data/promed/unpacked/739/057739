Two people in the Western Division have passed away from leptospirosis, bringing the total number of deaths from leptospirosis to 29 this year [2022]. A total of 21 deaths were recorded in the Western Division, 3 in the Central, and 5 in the North. Permanent secretary for health Dr James Fong says a 23 year old woman from Ba died on 19 Mar 2022, and a 13 year old child from Nadi died on 11 Mar 2022.

Dr Fong says there have been 1394 lab-confirmed cases of leptospirosis this year [2022], and a notable decrease in cases has been noted in the last week, with the weekly case number now below the national outbreak alert threshold.

The leptospirosis bacteria are spread to humans through the urine of infected animals, such as cows, pigs, rats, and dogs. To reduce individual risk, it is important to understand that exposure to animals, soil, mud, and floodwaters during work or recreational activities increases risk of infection.

Important prevention measures include wearing full covered footwear at all times when going outdoors, avoiding wading or swimming in flooded waters, using clean fresh water to wash up after exposure to muddy waters, and keeping all food and drinks covered and away from rats. For workplaces, practice good personal hygiene at all times, cover cuts and wounds well, and use protective equipment, especially footwear when in flooded and/or muddy areas.

[Please see my moderator comments for a discussion of leptospirosis in the prior ProMED post Leptospirosis - Fiji: fatal, flood-related 20220215.8701482.

The news report says that the total lab-confirmed cases of leptospirosis this year (2022) have risen to 1394 cases and deaths to 29; 5 weeks ago, a total of 74 cases and 11 deaths had been reported (see post 20220215.8701482).

The sources for the current outbreak in Fiji have been attributed to Illegal piggeries and the improper disposal of wastewater in informal settlements, in addition to flooding (ProMED post Leptospirosis - Fiji (02): illegal piggeries/improper wastewater disposal, flooding 20220319.8702072).

Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 mi) north east of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls and flooding with fresh water. Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/fiji/weather). - Mod.ML
