Far North Queenslanders who work with animals are being urged to get vaccinated against a bacterial disease carried by animals that has been identified on the Atherton Tablelands.

Cairns Tropical Public Health Services has confirmed 23 recent cases of Q fever in the region, with most cases in the Mareeba area. Q fever is an illness caused by the bacteria _Coxiella burnetii_, carried by animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and kangaroos.

Symptoms of the disease include fever and chills; severe sweats; severe headache, especially behind the eyes; muscle pain; weakness and tiredness; and weight loss. People become infected with the bacteria by breathing in droplets or dust contaminated by birth fluids, faeces, or urine from infected animals. The spread of infection from person-to-person is rare, and the disease can be treated with antibiotics.

Cairns Tropical Public Health Services Public Health Medical Officer Dr Annie Preston-Thomas said there had been more cases than usual, possibly associated with greater numbers of wildlife close to residential areas. "The bacteria that cause Q fever can exist in a variety of domestic and wild animal species such as kangaroos and wallabies," she said. "It can also persist in the general environment in dust and soil, which can lead to infection and disease. If there are obvious animal droppings, please use a P2 mask -- available from hardware stores -- to undertake jobs outdoors such as mowing the lawn. Wash your hands after coming into contact with all animals or their faeces, especially before eating and drinking."

Dr Preston-Thomas said people whose work exposed them to animals, animal products, and animal waste were particularly at risk of developing Q fever. This includes abattoir and meat workers, farmers, veterinarians, animal hunters, wildlife/zoo workers, dog/cat breeders, and other people who work in animal industries. "There is an effective vaccine available to protect people against Q fever," Dr Preston-Thomas said. "Vaccination is recommended for all people who are working in, or intend to work in, a high-risk occupation. High-risk workplaces should have a vaccination program to protect their workforce. Most people make a full recovery from Q fever; however, in about 10-20% of people, chronic fatigue is still present after 12 months, affecting a person's ability to work at full capacity. People may also develop chronic infections that affect the heart, bones, or joints."

Anyone experiencing symptoms of Q fever is urged to contact their local GP, or phone 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84).

People must be screened and tested before they are vaccinated against Q fever. For more information and to check the Australian Q fever register, head to <www.qfever.org> to find a doctor specifically trained for Q fever vaccination services.

[Q fever is an infection caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle.

Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may develop chronic infection, including endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), chronic hepatitis, chronic vascular infections (especially in patients with vascular grafts or arterial aneurysms), osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, and chronic pulmonary infections. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage and chronic infection. Chronic Q fever is rare, occurring in less than 5% of persons with acute infection, occurring within a few months to decades after the initial symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

Q fever is distributed worldwide with the exception of New Zealand (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/1/01-0305_article). Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases occur in people living in urban areas that are downwind from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats.

In Australia, people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants, or farms.

In Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups. However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever).

Serum antibodies to _C. burnetii_ remain detectable for years, or even for life. In the US, 3.1% of the general adult US population has been found to have detectable antibodies to _C. burnetii_ (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm), and the seroprevalence in Queensland, Australia, has been found to be about 5% in rural, as well as metropolitan (Brisbane), settings (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21499708). Because of persistence of a positive serology, a confirmed diagnosis of acute Q fever requires a demonstration of a 4-fold rise in phase II IgG by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) between serum samples from the acute and convalescent phases taken 3-6 weeks apart (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). A single positive convalescent serum sample (IgG phase II greater than or equal to 1:128) in a patient who has been ill greater than one week indicates a probable acute infection. Serum PCR for Q fever is positive for _C. burnetii_ in almost all patients with early acute Q fever, i.e., during the 1st 2 weeks of symptoms, before the antibody response. Chronic Q fever (i.e., endocarditis) is diagnosed by a phase I IgG antibody titer greater than 1:800 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm#Tab2).

Acute Q fever is treated with doxycycline in non-pregnant people for 2-3 weeks. Because early doxycycline treatment (within the 1st 3 days of symptoms) is most effective, treatment of a symptomatic patient suspected of having Q fever should be based on clinical findings and should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). People who have chronic Q fever usually must take a combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for endocarditis or vascular infection for at least 18 months. - Mod.ML
