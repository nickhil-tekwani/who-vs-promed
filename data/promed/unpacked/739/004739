A suspected fungal disease has broken out in Manyinga district of North-Western province leaving several cassava fields destroyed. The disease has also affected some gardens.

An area Agricultural Extension officer who made an on-spot check disclosed that the rotting of tubers and drying up of leaves are caused by [a] fungus suspected to have been carried off from the remains of uprooted indigenous trees that were in the fields before planting cassava.

He revealed that to stop further spread, all the diseased cassava should be uprooted and burnt while the disease tubers can be consumed. He advised farmers in the district to avoid planting cassava in newly cleared fields until all remains of the old vegetation are dug out completely.

[From this report, it is not possible to speculate on the disease referred to. If a suspected pathogen is soil borne, as seems to be suggested, mere removal of root material left from previous vegetation will not be sufficient to prevent crop infection, since some of any potential soil-borne pathogens present in the region (such as fungi, nematodes) may be able to persist in the ground for years without a host. Reliable diagnosis will be crucial for devising management strategies for the farmers, which may need to include long crop rotations with non-host species between cassava crops.
