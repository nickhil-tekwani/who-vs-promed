Amid flooding incidents due to recent heavy rains, the Department of Health (DOH)-Davao has recorded 44 suspected leptospirosis cases with 4 deaths in Davao Region from January to [2 Sep 2019].

DOH-Davao director Dr Annabelle Yumang said on [Tue 3 Sep 2019], that suspected leptospirosis cases is highest in Davao City with 14 patients and 3 who have died; Davao del Norte has 13 cases with no death recorded; Compostela Valley Province with 11 cases and 1 death; Davao del Sur and Davao Oriental recorded 1 case each.

Leptospirosis is an infection spread mainly through contact with water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals, particularly rats. Persons can get the disease by swimming or wading in fresh unchlorinated water contaminated with animal urine or by coming into contact with wet soil or plants contaminated with animal urine.

In the past weeks, Davao Region experienced a series of heavy downpour particularly in Davao City that has caused massive flooding. With this, Yumang advised the public and the flood victims to remain vigilant during the rainy season to prevent from acquiring this fatal disease.

"[It is important that after the flooding, the City Government visits the evacuation areas to administer antibiotic. Anyway, it is easy to administer the antibiotic since it is only a single-dose]," Yumang said.

DOH has given the flood victims doxycycline, the antibiotic drug used as standard prophylaxis for leptospirosis patients. She further assured that there is no shortage of the antibiotic and they are ready to respond should there is a need for these medicines to prevent the disease from being acquired which is caused by the flood.

The symptoms of the infection include fever, chills and severe headache, which usually appear four to 14 days after being exposed to contaminated floodwaters or mud. Aside from that, an infected individual may manifest red eyes, jaundice, tea-colored urine and difficulty to urinate.

"[I advised the flood victims to go to the health centers if they were exposed to contaminated flood water]," Yumang said.

[Leptospirosis is an infection transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, and swine), especially rodents that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

ProMED-mail recently reported on a leptospirosis outbreak after flooding in the Calabarzon region of the Philippines (ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis - Philippines: flooding 20190826.6641939); Calabarzon situated south and east of Metro Manila on the island of Luzon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabarzon).

The leptospirosis outbreak reported in the news article above is occurring following flooding in the Davao Region, situated on the southeastern portion of Mindanao, an island that comprises 5 provinces: Compostela Valley, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental and Davao Occidental, the newly created province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davao_Region). - Mod.ML
