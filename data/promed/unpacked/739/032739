98/210 Tomato chlorosis virus [ToCV: a new whitefly-transmitted closterovirus
Tomato plants showing symptoms similar to those of the previously described
tomato infectious chlorosis closterovirus (EPPO RS 97/35, 98/086) were
observed in glasshouse tomatoes in Florida (US) since 1989. The disease
was called 'yellow leaf disorder' and was characterized by irregular
chlorotic mottling which starts on lower leaves and advances then towards
the growing point, interveinal yellow areas on leaves which develop red or
brown necrotic flecks.
Studies have revealed the presence of a new phloem-limited, bipartite
closterovirus called tomato chlorosis (see also EPPO RS 98/085). Although
tomato infectious chlorosis closterovirus (TICV) and tomato chlorosis
closterovirus (ToCV) cause similar symptoms on tomato, they have been shown
to be distinct viruses (different symptoms on indicator plants, different
serological and molecular characteristics). In addition differences occur
in vector transmission and geographical distribution. ToCV is transmitted
by _Bemisia tabaci_ (biotypes A and B - EPPO A2 quarantine pest),
_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_ and _T. abutilonea_, whereas TICV is only
transmitted by _T. vaporariorum_.
ToCV has been found in greenhouse tomatoes (and is reported to occur on
ornamentals but no details are given) in Colorado, Florida (Baker,
Columbia, Marion and Suwanee counties) and Louisiana. TICV occurs on
greenhouse and field tomatoes (and many vegetable and ornamental crops,
weeds) in California, North Carolina and Italy.
