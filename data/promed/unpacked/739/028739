A rogue rabbit virus, confirmed in Otago, could thwart regional council plans by making the animals immune to its infection operation.

Council chief executive Sarah Gardner yesterday [Mon 3 Dec 2018] said the RHDV2 virus, previously confirmed in the Bay of Plenty and Marlborough, was detected in Central Otago through testing by the regional council. This has been a concern, as it could create immunity among the animals to the RHDV1 "K5" virus it released in March [2018] in a widespread rabbit-cull operation.

In a statement, Mrs Gardner said the council reminded all landowners it was very important to continue rabbit controls in addition to the K5 virus.

In an email sent to chairman Graeme Bell, Mrs Gardner said staff did not know how widespread the virus was or what the level of infection was in the population. A "more comprehensive report" would be presented to councillors at the next committee meeting in late January [2019].

Bell said the council needed data and information to sort the issue. "We need to be proactive," he said, adding that the council was "well aware" it could create immunity to the council-released virus. Bell also said that the council needed to provide information to farmers about the success of the K5 virus, as many thought it was not working.

When the Ministry of Primary Industries was asked about the RHDV2 virus entering Otago, a Biosecurity New Zealand spokesman said it encouraged pet rabbit owners to take practical steps to protect their rabbits. "Vaccines are available through veterinarians. This strain is established in New Zealand. RHDV2 cannot be eradicated or contained now that it has been confirmed in wild rabbits on both the North and South Islands."

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu province of China within a group of commercially bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%). It spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission, and infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes. For these characteristics of RHDV, it was deliberately released in Australia and New Zealand. There, RHD has reduced rabbit abundance, particularly in dry regions, but rabbits in cooler, high-rainfall areas have been able to maintain their populations. In Australia and New Zealand, RHD has raised the prospects for managing rabbits in low-rainfall areas and brought substantial economic and environmental benefits. It is expected that after many generations, the defence strategies of rabbits evolve to resist and/or tolerate RHDV, so introduction of a novel strain might enable boosting the efficiency of RHD as a biological control. K5 is a Korean strain, released in Australia and New Zealand to control rabbit populations.

The occurrence of a 2nd strain, RHDV2, may induce resistance against RHDV1 K5 by conferring cross-immunity. Until May 2018, RHDV2 had not been detected in New Zealand. This strain was identified in a rabbit from Australia in May 2015. RHDV2 (also called RHDVb) was 1st described in outbreaks in France in 2010, then Italy and Spain in 2011, and in Portugal from 2012 onwards. The virus is a genetically and antigenically distinct variant of RHDV, and the immunogenic differences occur at the serotype level, for which the risk of cross-immunity might not be as large as expected. On the other hand, the pathogenicity of RHDV2 has been found to increase in recent years (http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.104132), for which it could be acting as a second pathogen controlling rabbit populations. - Mod.PMB
