Bangladesh (Dhaka). 21 May 2018. Dhaka city is witnessing a rise in the aedes mosquito population, with posh neighbourhoods like Banani, Uttara, Dhanmondi, Mohakhali DOHS [defence officers' housing scheme], Minto Road, and Bashundhara being pinpointed as major breeding grounds for dengue and chikungunya-responsible aedes mosquitos.

The number of dengue patients has suddenly gone up in the city, and 62 people diagnosed with dengue and chikungunya have been admitted to different hospitals. A new government survey has found that some 52 per cent of containers -- plastic barrels, clay pots, buckets, used or abandoned tires and tubes, and water tanks have larvae of this mosquito in them. Stagnant, clean water at construction sites, and other open spaces in the areas provide the ideal breeding environment for aedes.

Sri Lanka (national). 2 Jun 2018. Sri Lanka health officials have reported 20443 suspected dengue cases during the 1st 5 months of 2018. In 2017, the country saw a massive number of dengue cases with 186 101 suspected cases, including 320 deaths. The highest numbers of dengue cases were reported during the 29th week of 2017 [week of 17 Jul 2017]. All 4 virus types of dengue have been seen in Sri Lanka. The outbreak was predominantly due to dengue fever virus type 2 (DEN-2), which was not the usual type circulating in Sri Lanka. According to WHO, this is 4.3-fold higher than the average number of cases for the same period between 2010 and 2016.

- Queensland (Mareeba). 5 Jun 2018. Dengue fever has emerged in Mareeba for the 1st time in 15 years, with public health officials reminding Far North Queenslanders to be vigilante with mosquito protection. It is the 1st locally-acquired case of dengue fever to be recorded in Mareeba since 2003. Public health crews are currently in the town carrying out mosquito control where dengue mosquitoes have been found to be breeding. Mareeba is outside the scope of the World Mosquito Program, formerly known as the Eliminate Dengue program. To date, there have been no cases of dengue in other parts of the Far North where the program released bacteria-infected mosquitoes.

Sudan (national). 3 Jun 2018. Voluntary work activists in Port Sudan reported outbreaks of unknown fevers, believed to be haemorrhagic (severe dengue) fever, in a wide area of the city two weeks ago. Activists told Radio Dabanga that the Port Sudan Hospital wards have been full of people with fever, where a large number of the infected would prefer to receive treatment in their homes.
They said no deaths have been recorded due to the fevers and warned of the worsening situation in the event the health authorities in the state do not take measures to contain the disease. According to the WHO, in 2017, the Sudanese Ministry of Health reported an increase in the number of suspected dengue fever cases during the period between 2 Oct and 8 Dec 2017.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its latest biweekly humanitarian bulletin that a total of 137 suspected cases, including 3 deaths, were reported from Khartoum, East and West Darfur, South Kordofan, River Nile, and El Gezira states, Kassala, and Red Sea states in this period.

Ethiopia (national). 31 May 2018. It is estimated that more than 390 million dengue virus (DENV) infections occur every year, and it is endemic across more than 100 countries, including 34 countries in Africa. In Ethiopia, there were no reports of DENV prior to 2013, but the virus has emerged in multiple regions since. Studies have also indicated that there are many febrile illnesses of unknown causes in Ethiopia, many of which may be attributed to DENV.
In the new work, Getachew Ferede, of the University of Gondar, Ethiopia, and colleagues performed a cross-sectional study of all febrile patients visiting Metema and Humera hospitals in north west Ethiopia between March 2016 and May 2017. Blood samples from each patient were tested for anti-DENV and risk factors for the virus were assessed. Of 600 blood samples tested, the overall prevalence of anti-DENV detected was 33.3 per cent, with slightly higher rates in Metema (40 per cent) compared to Humera (27.5 per cent). The overall prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies against DENV infection was 19 per cent and 21 per cent respectively. The highest prevalence of antibodies was found in the spring and summer, with a peak in August. Residence, occupation, the presence of uncovered water, and lack of mosquito net use were all associated with DENV infection or antibody status.
"The presence of antibodies against DENV infection indicates dengue as one of the causes of undifferentiated febrile illness in the study areas," the researchers say. "This suggests that prevention and control measures should be designed considering the risk factors identified in the study."

- Italy ex Seychelles. 28 May 2018. A previously healthy 45 year old Italian male traveler presented at the emergency department of the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy, on [25 May 2018] with a 4-day history of high fever, headache, dysgeusia [altered taste sensation], retro-orbital pain, and diffuse myalgia unresponsive to antibiotics prescribed by his general practitioner. His symptoms started one day after returning from a 10 day touristic travel in the Seychelles islands. He flew with his partner on [10 May 2018] from Rome, Italy, to Seychelles with short stopover in Doha, Qatar. In Seychelles, he stayed for 4 days in the island of La Digue and after in the island of Praslin. He did not use either repellent spray or other insect bite precaution. He noted some mosquito bites while staying in Praslin in the 2nd part of the travel. Physical examination was unremarkable, blood test showed leukopenia (1360 WBC/mmc, 790 neutrophils/mmc), thrombocytopenia (88 000/mmc), normal C reactive protein, slight increase of transaminases (ALT 57 UI/mL). Haemoglobin and haematocrit were within the normal range values. He was admitted in the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit and tested for dengue NS1 antigen on serum which resulted positive. The patient who did not show any warning signs is receiving supportive treatment. Public health authorities were notified and perifocal vector control activities centered on the case's residence, including spraying for adult mosquitoes and destruction of larval breeding sites were implemented. Dengue serotyping is ongoing.
In April 2017 some dengue cases in tourists returning from the Seychelles had been reported (Lustig Y, Wolf D, Halutz O, Schwartz E. An outbreak of dengue virus (DENV) type 2 Cosmopolitan genotype in Israeli travellers returning from the Seychelles, April 2017. Euro Surveill. 2017 Jun 29;22(26). pii: 30563. doi: 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.26.30563; https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.26.30563). To the best of our knowledge no cases were reported in 2018 in the Seychelles. The here reported case, should alert national and regional Seychelles public health authorities about persistent transmission of dengue in the islands. With the approaching of the warm season, clinicians working in Europe and other non endemic areas and travelers returning from areas with active transmission, need to increase their awareness about dengue especially in country, such as Italy, were competent vectors such as _Aedes albopictus_ are widespread.

[3] Philippines: dengue vaccine related deaths, suspected
Date: Tue 22 May 2018
Source: Rappler [edited]
https://www.rappler.com/nation/203089-doh-report-number-children-dead-dengue-dengvaxia-shot


The Department of Health (DOH) said the latest data showed that 11 out of 87 children who died after receiving at least one dose of Dengvaxia had dengue despite their vaccination.

DOH undersecretary Enrique Domingo gave the figures, which were as of [15 May 2018], to reporters on the sidelines of the House appropriations committee's hearing on the now-approved P 1.16-billion [about USD 2.2 billion] Dengvaxia medical support fund on [Tue 22 May 2018].

(As of [15 May 2018], the number of confirmed cases from our Epidemiology Bureau is that 87 children who have had Dengvaxia vaccination died of dengue or any other illness. As of now, the number of laboratory-tested and confirmed cases, meaning, there was really growth in the culture, or when they checked for the polymerase chain reaction on the blood sample, 11 had dengue.) Domingo, however, clarified the DOH does not have any evidence yet whether or not the Dengvaxia vaccine itself influenced or even caused the deaths. "I think that would take some more time. We have to do a lot of epidemiologic studies in the next few years," he said. This is an increase in the number of official Dengvaxia-related deaths reported by the DOH, so far.

In February [2018], experts from the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) reported 3 out of 14 cases they studied showed the children also died of dengue despite getting at least one shot of Sanofi Pasteur's Dengvaxia dengue vaccine. The DOH had tasked the UP-PGH panel to investigate the 14 cases of death. Domingo also earlier noted that total of 3281 students administered with Dengvaxia were hospitalized in different public and private hospitals due to various illnesses between March 2016 to March 2018.

Dengvaxia was the vaccine used when then-DOH chief Janette Garin launched the dengue vaccination program for public schools students in the National Capital Region, Central Luzon, and Calabarzon in April 2016. Less than 2 years later, Sanofi warned its vaccine may to more severe case of dengue when administered on a person who has not been infected by the virus prior to immunization. Health secretary Francisco Duque III immediately suspended the program, but not before more than 830 000 children received the risky vaccine.

[3] Asymptomatic infection
Date: Mon 21 May 2018
Source: Healio, PLoS (Public Library of Science) Pathog [edited]
https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/emerging-diseases/news/in-the-journals/%7B0b63e4e6-7cff-4069-a8d2-6eaea6e57ce4%7D/silent-transmission-fuels-dengue-epidemic


Researchers estimate that 84 per cent of dengue infections are attributable to patients with mild or no symptoms.

A new study [see reference below] suggests that patients with asymptomatic dengue virus infection are 80 per cent more infectious than symptomatic patients, underscoring the important role of "silent transmission" in spread of the disease, according to researchers.

The findings support recent blood-feeding experiments demonstrating that, despite previous theories, individuals with no "clinically apparent" symptoms are able to infect _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, according to Alex Perkins, Eck Family assistant professor of biological sciences at the University of Notre Dame, and colleagues. "Until a few years ago, it was assumed that individuals with mild to no symptoms contributed relatively little to dengue virus transmission," Perkins said in a press release. "Our research reveals that people showing no symptoms of dengue virus infection are contributing much more than was previously recognized, so that we now have a better idea of the large extent to which they contribute the spread of disease."

WHO estimates that about 390 million people are infected with dengue virus worldwide each year. Of these individuals, only 96 million develop clinical manifestations. It was previously believed that asymptomatic patients were unable to drive transmission because their viremia levels were not high enough to "efficiently infect mosquitoes", according to Perkins and colleagues. However, high seroconversion rates in areas with few reported cases and blood-feeding experiments contradicted this notion. Therefore, the researchers conducted a mathematical modeling study using within-host viral dynamics and human demographic data to determine the association between infectivity, disease severity and transmission in a hypothetical population.

The model revealed that, at the individual level, asymptomatic patients were approximately 80 per cent (95 per cent CI [confidence interval], 0-146) more infectious to mosquitoes than symptomatic patients. At the population level, 88 per cent of all dengue virus infections were transmitted by mosquitoes that previously fed on an infected individual with no apparent signs or symptoms at the time of the blood meal. The model further estimated that 84 per cent (95 per cent CI, 82-86) of all infections were either linked to patients with no symptoms at any point during their infection or those with mild symptoms who may not seek treatment.

Among patients who do eventually develop symptoms, the model projected that 24 per cent were bitten by mosquitoes during the pre-symptomatic phase of infection. Only 1.3 per cent (95 per cent CI, 1.1-1.4) of all infections were attributed to individuals whose infection was detected by surveillance systems.

The researchers concluded that their findings offer "valuable insights" that may have implications for current surveillance and infection control efforts. "Unfortunately, based on our study, those who need to be targeted with intervention are either being identified after they have already contributed to transmission or are not being identified at all," Perkins said in the release. "Our results indicate that it might be necessary to shift emphasis toward more proactive disease prevention strategies that do not rely as strongly on responding to detected cases."
