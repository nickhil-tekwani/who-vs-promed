A farmer in Serere district [Eastern Region] has cut down his 20 acre orange garden following an outbreak of a strange disease. Two years ago, he started recording low yields, something that compelled him to seek advice from agriculture extension workers. The cost of maintaining the oranges shot up following the outbreak. [Another farmer] explains that the trees started drying, causing the oranges to fall down before maturing.

The Serere District Agriculture Officer said she is yet to receive information regarding the strange disease attacking orange trees. She, however, regrets the decision of the farmer to cut down the trees, adding that her team will visit the farm to establish details about the strange disease.

[Numerous diseases of citrus are being reported from the region. It is not clear which specific problem is reported here. While disease management for most citrus pathogens includes clean planting stock and elimination of pathogen reservoirs, conclusive diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved is needed to design effective management strategies.
