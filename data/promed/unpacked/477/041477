Camden County [New Jersey] and state health authorities on Friday [16 Dec 2022] reported a cluster of Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia, in 4 Pennsauken residents.

Camden County Health Officer Paschal Nwako said that officials are trying to determine how and where the people got infected so they can prevent further transmission. The source could be outside Pennsauken, he added.

One person is hospitalized, while the other 3 are recovering at home, Nwako said. The 1st case was confirmed in October [2022]. They all live less than a mile away from one another but did not report being at the same places before becoming sick.

"Right now, the overall risk of Legionnaires' disease among residents or visitors to Pennsauken is low," Nwako said in a statement. Most healthy people exposed to the bacteria called _Legionella_ do not develop the disease, Nwako said. However, people over age 50, especially smokers, or people with certain medical conditions, including weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease, or other chronic health conditions, are at increased risk for Legionnaires' disease, Nwako said. The symptoms are similar to those of COVID-19. People who develop a fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache are advised to visit their health-care provider for further evaluation, officials said.

People who develop symptoms within 2 weeks of visiting or working in Pennsauken are also advised to seek medical attention, officials said.

Legionnaires' disease is not spread person to person, officials said, but instead it is contracted by breathing in small droplets of water containing _Legionella_ bacteria. This water can come from cooling towers, like air-conditioning units for large buildings, hot tubs, cooling misters, decorative fountains, and plumbing systems, officials said. Home air-conditioning units do not use water to cool, so are not a risk for _Legionella_ growth, officials said.

Philadelphia is notoriously linked to the disease. In 1976, attendees of an American Legion convention were stricken and 34 people died. This summer, an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at a nursing home in New York City killed 5 people, authorities confirmed last month [November 2022].

[Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia A M, Goncalves J, Gomes, J P, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can be generated by showerheads, spa pools and hot tubs, misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments, fountains, cooling towers, and car washes.

Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors, wafted in air currents downwind from their source. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in passersby on Broad Street who were near, but never entered, the Philadelphia hotel where the 1976 Legionnaires' disease outbreak occurred during a Pennsylvania Legionnaires' convention (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

Genotyping of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

Pennsauken Township (pop. 37 074 residents in 2020), a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is located in Camden County, in the southwestern portion of the US state of New Jersey (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsauken_Township,_New_Jersey).

More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML
