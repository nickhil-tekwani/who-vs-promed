Zim Faces Vaccine Crisis
-------------------------
The Department of Veterinary Services is in dire need of more than 4
million USD (225 million ZD) to purchase vaccines to contain sporadic and
intermittent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, Standard Business has
established.
The demand for foot and mouth (FMD) vaccines comes amidst an upsurge in the
number of outbreaks of the disease throughout the country.
The latest outbreak occurred in a commercial farming area in Figtree,
Matabeleland South, a week ago and would further jeopardise the country's
chances of resuming beef exports to the lucrative European Union market.
The EU suspended annual beef imports from Zimbabwe worth 1 billion USD in
August 2001 after intermittent foot and mouth outbreaks were reported
throughout the country. Zimbabwe was exporting an annual beef quota of 9100
tonnes before the suspension.
Department of Veterinary Services principal director Stuart Hargreaves
confirmed the shortage of vaccines in the country but said he would comment
on the issue next week. "The vaccines situation in the country is
critical, and we are working flat-out to acquire the drugs, but at the
moment I cannot give you further details, but I will be ready to do so
early next week," said Hargreaves
Zimbabwe has been getting its vaccines from the Botswana Vaccine Institute,
but the country has found it difficult to sustain payment arrangements in
foreign currency, leading to supplies being discontinued.
The veterinary department is expected to meet regional experts next week to
discuss methods of curbing the disease and how Zimbabwe could access
cheaper vaccines.
