Myocarditis and pericarditis [were more] prevalent in COVID-19 vaccine recipients than in the pre-vaccine period of Jan 2019 to Jan 2021, with the incidence still rare but higher than in previous studies, according to a JAMA research letter yesterday [4 Aug 2021]. The researchers used electronic medical records from 40 hospitals in Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Los Angeles County to look at data from 2 000 287 people who received at least one COVID-19 vaccination from February to May 2021.

Twenty people had vaccine-related myocarditis (1.0 per 100 000 people) and 37 had pericarditis (1.8/100 000). No deaths occurred. Previous studies have reported a myocarditis incidence of about 0.48/100 000, or about half the rate in the new study, the authors say. Overall, the average monthly number of myocarditis or myopericarditis [cases rose] from 16.9 to 27.3 during the vaccination period, and pericarditis cases also increased, from 49.1 to 78.8.

Myocarditis occurred a median of 3.5 days after receiving the Moderna (11) or Pfizer/BioNTech (9) vaccine, most commonly in men (75%) and those who were younger (median age 36y). Four instances occurred after the 1st vaccine, and 16 occurred after the 2nd. Two patients went on to receive the 2nd vaccination and didn't report worsening symptoms. Although 19 were hospitalized, all were discharged after a median of 2 days. At a 23.5-day follow-up, 13 patients had no symptoms, and the remaining 7 were improving.

Fifteen people had pericarditis after the 1st vaccination, and 22 after the 2nd. Seventy-three per cent were men, but the median age was older, at 59 years. Twelve received the Moderna vaccine and 23 the Pfizer vaccine. Median onset occurred 20 days after a vaccine dose, and while 13 were hospitalized (median stay 1 day), none needed intensive care. Seven people received a 2nd vaccine, but no further data were available. At 28 days' follow-up, 7 patients had no symptoms, and the remaining 23 were improving.

"This study shows a similar pattern [to previous studies], although at higher incidence, suggesting vaccine adverse event underreporting," the researchers write.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

"Rare cases of cardiac inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported (1-4). We reviewed the clinical records of vaccine recipients to identify cases of postvaccination myocarditis or pericarditis."

Discussion
----------
"Two distinct self-limited syndromes, myocarditis and pericarditis, were observed after COVID-19 vaccination. Myocarditis developed rapidly in younger patients, mostly after the 2nd vaccination. Pericarditis affected older patients later, after either the 1st or 2nd dose.

"Some vaccines are associated with myocarditis (5), including mRNA vaccines (1-4), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported a possible association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and myocarditis, primarily in younger male individuals within a few days after the 2nd vaccination, at an incidence of about 4.8 cases per 1 million (6). This study shows a similar pattern, although at higher incidence, suggesting vaccine adverse event underreporting. Additionally, pericarditis may be more common than myocarditis among older patients.

"Study limitations include cases missed in outside care settings and missed diagnoses of myocarditis or pericarditis (which would underestimate the incidence), as well as inaccurate EMR (electronic medical record) vaccination information. Temporal association does not prove causation, although the short span between vaccination and myocarditis onset and the elevated incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in the study hospitals lend support to a possible relationship."

Post-vaccination cases of myocarditis are rare, and they have resolved successfully, some of them after treatment with pain medication and anti-inflammatory medicine. The risk from natural infection, which may lead not only to heart disease but also lung damage and so many other serious problems, is far greater than the risk of complications from the vaccine. - Mod.LK]

[B] Myocarditis following natural infection

Heart inflammation triggered by some COVID-19 vaccines has been a concern, especially in younger people, but a preliminary study suggests that in those most affected, it is 6 times more likely to occur after a coronavirus infection than after vaccination. In the past few months, some cases of this condition, known as myocarditis, have been recorded following the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. This has prompted concern particularly in the USA and Israel, as these 2 countries have led the way in vaccinating younger people.

The reaction happens most often in men and boys aged under 30 after their 2nd dose, and is usually seen within 10 days, says Alma Iacob at Imperial College London. But many health bodies around the world say the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks for most people.

Now a study in the USA has analysed how often myocarditis occurs following infection with the coronavirus. Researchers analysed the records of healthcare organisations that cover one-fifth of the US population. They found that, during the first 12 months of the pandemic, males aged 12-17 were most likely to develop myocarditis within 3 months of catching COVID-19, at a rate of about 450 cases per million infections.

This compares with 67 cases of myocarditis per million males of the same age following their 2nd dose of a Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, according to figures from the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Researchers added together cases after 1st and 2nd doses to reach a total rate of 77 cases per million in this male age-group triggered by vaccination, one-sixth that seen after infection. "If you're focused on heart inflammation, the safer bet is to take the vaccine," says Mendel Singer at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, who helped carry out the study.

Signs of myocarditis include chest pain, breathlessness and palpitations. Symptoms range from so mild that they go unnoticed to severe, involving permanent heart damage or death. However, extreme forms are rare, and no fatalities have been reported after vaccination in the USA.

The causes of myocarditis are unclear. One idea is that it occurs when the immune system attacks the heart, but this hasn't been proven. Neither is it known why it happens most often in younger males.

Mild cases are usually treated with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, and most people recover within a few months, says Iacob. Other triggers of the condition include flu and the flu vaccine, some medications and some illegal drugs.

The small risk of myocarditis after the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is one reason why the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) hasn't yet recommended this vaccine -- the only one licensed for use in under-18s in the UK -- for most children aged 12 and over. While countries such as Ireland and the USA are letting teenagers get vaccinated, the JCVI said in July [2021] that only younger people who are highly vulnerable or living with someone with a weak immune system could have the jab.

Iacob says people who have been vaccinated or had COVID-19 should be aware of possible symptoms of myocarditis, especially chest pain that is burning or sharp and worsens on changing position.

[2] Australia (VI): lockdown
Date: Thu 5 Aug 2021 15:04 EDT
Source: Bloomberg News [abridged, edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/sydney-s-delta-outbreak-hits-record-as-state-lockdown-extended


About two-thirds of Australia's population is in lockdown as the delta variant spreads across the nation, with authorities in Melbourne enforcing stay-at-home orders for the 6th time since the pandemic began.

Melbourne and the rest of Victoria state will enter a 7-day lockdown from 8 pm local time on Thursday [5 Aug 2021], Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters. The nation's 2nd-largest city last year [2020] endured one of the world's longest and strictest lockdowns, and only emerged from its most recent one on 28 Jul 2021. Sydney, meanwhile, has issued stay-at-home orders until at least 28 Aug 2021.

"The advice to me from the experts if we were to wait even just a few days, there is every chance that instead of being locked down for a week, this gets away from us and we are potentially locked down until we all get vaccinated," Andrews said.

The lockdowns show the limits of Australia's so-called "COVID-zero" strategy, which has relied on closed international borders and rigorous testing to eliminate community transmission of the virus. Its economy, particularly the domestic tourism and retail sectors, is increasingly being hit by the outbreaks.

The move by Melbourne authorities comes on the same day that New South Wales state reported 262 new infections -- a record number since the highly contagious variant leaked into Sydney's community in mid-June [2021]. Five more people died, and 4 of them weren't vaccinated, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in the city, which has been in lockdown for almost 6 weeks.

The outbreak's spread to other regions of New South Wales saw Berejiklian on Thursday [5 Aug 2021] announce that the Hunter Valley region -- including Newcastle, a city of around 500 000 people -- will be placed into a one-week lockdown. "Every jurisdiction around the world is finding delta challenging," Berejiklian said. "We can try and eliminate it, but we know the vaccine is critical to stopping the spread."

Australia's federal government said last week the country would begin reopening and start to avoid snap lockdowns once 70% of the entire adult population had been fully vaccinated. Plans to reopen have been hampered by a tardy vaccine roll-out, with only enough doses to cover 25% of the population administered.

[3] Prospect of more virulent variants

If more Americans don't get vaccinated, there is "ample chance" of another coronavirus variant emerging, one that could be more aggressive and more pervasive than the delta variant, Dr Anthony Fauci warned on Wednesday [4 Aug 2021]. "If another one comes along that has an equally high capability of transmitting but also is much more severe, then we really could be in trouble," Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said in an interview with McClatchy. "People who are not getting vaccinated mistakenly think it's only about them. But it isn't. it's about everybody else, also," said Fauci.

With unvaccinated Americans driving the country's latest surge, experts have stressed that the more the virus continues to spread, the more opportunities it has to mutate -- making it more likely that another variant, which could pose a problem to vaccines, could arise. "If we don't crush the outbreak to the point of getting the overwhelming proportion of the population vaccinated, then what will happen is the virus will continue to smolder through the fall into the winter, giving it ample chance to get a variant which, quite frankly, we're very lucky that the vaccines we have now do very well against the variants -- particularly against severe illness," said Fauci. "We're very fortunate that that's the case. There could be a variant that's lingering out there that can push aside delta."

Roughly 57.9% of the US population has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Roughly 49.7% of the population is fully vaccinated, the data show. At the current pace of vaccinations, it will take until mid-February [2022] to get at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine to all eligible Americans, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data.

More than 90 million eligible people in the USA are still unvaccinated. And though the 7-day average of people initiating vaccination each day is the highest it has been since 4 Jul 2021 at 446 300, many experts say the USA is still not where it needs to be to get the pandemic -- and the rapidly spreading delta variant -- under control. "When you look at the curve of acceleration of 7-day averages of cases per day, it is going up in a very steep fashion," Fauci said in the McClatchy interview.

On Tuesday [3 Aug 2021], for the 1st time since February [2021], more than 50 000 hospital beds across the country were occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to new data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. That number is more than triple what it was a month ago. "We are not crying wolf here. This surge that we're going through right now has every potential to be -- and already looks to be -- the worst surge we've faced so far," former US surgeon general Dr Jerome Adams said during a live online interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday.

Fauci said earlier this week that he would like the USA to be at upwards of one million vaccinations per day. With the spread of the delta variant, it might not be possible to stop the spread of coronavirus completely, National Institutes of Health director Dr Francis Collins said Tuesday [3 Aug 2021]. "But we could still get to a place where this becomes a nuisance instead of a threat to your life."

The delta variant now accounts for an estimated 93.4% of coronavirus circulating in the United States, according to figures published by the CDC. This includes several sub-lineages of delta, all of which are classified as variants of concern. Together, they made up about 93.4% of cases during the last 2 weeks of July [2021]. This number is even higher in certain parts of the country, including the region that includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, where delta accounts for more than 98% of circulating virus.

These figures have shown a rapid increase over the past 2 months. In the 2 weeks ending 22 May 2021, for example, delta's prevalence was estimated around 3%. At that same time in May, another variant first identified in the UK -- alpha, or B.1.1.7 -- was the dominant one in the USA, causing 69% of cases. Now, CDC's most recent estimates put that variant at just under 3%.

Although experts have said data so far do not indicate a need for the general population to get vaccines boosters, Fauci said there is an effort underway to get them for immunocompromised people. Some conditions -- including autoimmune diseases, transplants and cancer treated with chemotherapy -- compromise people's immune systems. "Those individuals we know almost invariably do not have an adequate response, so the need to give them an additional boost is much more emergent than the general population," Fauci said during a virtual event hosted by Virginia governor Ralph Northam on Tuesday [3 Aug 2021].

Vaccine advisers to the CDC have met to discuss whether immunocompromised people may need additional protection from a vaccine booster but have not yet presented a formal recommendation or voted on guidance. "We are trying very hard to get the regulatory mechanism in place very soon to get those individuals a boost that might bring up their immunity to the level where it should be, if possible," Fauci said.

During a discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Tuesday, Fauci said it's "very likely" COVID-19 variants evolved in the bodies of those who are immunosuppressed. People with immune suppression may be unable to fight off COVID-19 infections for weeks or even months, meaning the virus has plenty of time to evolve and change. "Variants, we all know, have emerged because of the pressure that the human immune system has put on the virus, very likely from people who are immunosuppressed...and had virus in them for days and days and days before they cleared it and/or died, and then essentially led to the emergence of a variant," Fauci said.

With the new school year stirring concerns about protecting children from COVID-19, the American Academy of Pediatrics said Tuesday [3 Aug 2021] there's been a "substantial" increase in cases among children. Nearly 72 000 children and teens caught COVID-19 last week -- 5 times as many as at the end of June [2021], the group said. The definition of a child varies by state, but generally includes those up to age 17 or 18. COVID-19 protocols vary across the country, but when children go back to school, districts will need to know how to respond to outbreaks quickly. Districts need to be prepared to enact contact tracing, testing, the quarantining of people who were exposed to the virus and the isolation of people with infections, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told CNN.

While most schools follow those steps to isolate cases, contact trace and test, response plans can vary state by state and school district by school district, Kim Anderson, executive director of the National Education Association, told CNN. "From what we understand, it does depend on what district you are in. The district should have very well thought out outbreak plans that have included the voices of educators and parents and community members in the crafting of those plans, and they should have plans that follow the CDC recommendations," Anderson said. "Our recommendation to all students and school districts is to follow the medical experts and follow the CDC," she said.

"Patients with immunosuppression are at risk for prolonged infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In several case reports, investigators have indicated that multimutational SARS-CoV-2 variants can arise during the course of such persistent cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1-4)."

"Viral adaptation to the human host and viral escape variants are a threat to patient health and COVID-19 pandemic control. Scientific attention to the intersection of SARS-CoV-2 biologic features, host immunologic characteristics, and the unique concerns of immunocompromised hosts is warranted. Additional considerations for immunization and other mitigation strategy guidelines for immunocompromised patients and their close contacts are also needed." - Mod.LK]
