Dozens of people have contracted salmonella after eating at a restaurant in Sarnia and food truck in Corunna during October 2020, according to Lambton Public Health.

On [Mon 9 Nov 2020], the local health unit confirmed that 41 people have now been diagnosed with salmonella after eating at the Barakat restaurant in Sarnia and the Barakat Food Truck in Corunna between [19 and 29 Oct 2020]. In total, the health unit said that more than 180 people have had symptoms consistent with the illness and 9 people have been hospitalized. On [30 Oct 2020], the health unit put out its 1st news release, stating that they were looking into the situation. Days later on [5 Nov 2020], they said there were 33 cases related to the outbreak in people between 9 months and 73 years old. Now the health unit has added several more infected individuals to the list.

Majority of the exposures took place between [21 and 25 Oct 2020].

For anyone else who may have symptoms of salmonellosis, including diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps or vomiting, public health said they are advised to report the illness to Lambton Public Health and contact their health care provider as needed if symptomatic.

In an earlier news release, public health said food and environmental swabs from the location had shown that food samples were negative, though others were still pending. "The owners of the restaurant continue to cooperate with Lambton Public Health and remain closed while LPH ensures there is no on-going risk of illness," the news release from last week states.

An investigation is still ongoing.
