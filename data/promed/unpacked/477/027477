Kazakhstan: Number of HIV-positive children now 96
-----------------------------------------------
The number of children who contracted human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) in southern Kazakhstan in an outbreak blamed on doctors'
negligence has reached 96, health authorities stated on Thu 15 Mar
2007. The 2 most recent victims, aged 3 and 4, were diagnosed with
HIV in the Sairam district and the city of Turkestan respectively,
said regional health department spokeswoman Ayzhan Umarova.
The Kazakhstan nation has been shocked after scores of children and
13 mothers contracted HIV through injections or blood transfusions at
hospitals in the city of Shymkent, some 1000 miles south of the
capital, Astana; 8 children who contracted AIDS in [this incident have died].
The Kazakh medical authorities have been testing thousands of mothers
and children feared to be at risk of contracting HIV. Nationwide
inspections have revealed numerous cases of incompetence and
corruption among doctors and nurses; 21 doctors and health officials
accused of causing the outbreak went on trial in Shymkent in January 2007.
Since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, HIV/AIDS has swept
across the former Communist countries. According to the United
Nations, there were 1.6 million people living with HIV in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia in 2005, a more than 20-fold increase in less
than a decade.
Most of the people with HIV in the region are in Russia and Ukraine,
but the situation has also worsened in Central Asia. According to the
World Bank, the number of HIV/AIDS patients in Kazakhstan has been
doubling annually since 2000, and UNICEF estimates that the true
number of people with HIV is 3 times higher than what it says is the
official figure of about 7000.

[The number of confirmed cases of HIV-infection of Kazakh children
was reported to be 55 on 20 Sep 2006, 72 in early October 2006, and
most recently 91 on 14 Feb 2007. The current estimate of 96 cases
suggests that most of the infected children may now have been
identified. Information from the legal process now underway is
awaited for an understanding of the events precipitating this tragic outbreak.
