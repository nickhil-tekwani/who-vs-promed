Vaccination response to 2 imported cases delayed by vaccine shortage
-----------------------------------------
SOFIA: A vaccination campaign announced after 2 cases of poliomyelitis were
discovered in Bulgaria was postponed on Fri 18 May 2001 for lack of
vaccine. Some 800 000 doses of polio vaccine would be imported within days
with the assistance of the United Nations Children's Fund, said Angel
Kunchev of the Bulgarian Health Ministry.
About 5 per cent of Bulgarian children have never been vaccinated,
according to Mira Kozhuharova, a national epidemiology counsellor who
called the statistic "alarmingly high". Bulgarian health authorities
identified the virus in a 13 month old Roma child in the Black Sea city of
Burgas on 17 Apr 2001. Other Roma, or Gypsy, children were immediately
vaccinated, and the World Health Organization was notified 6 days later.
[Despite this the virus was detected subsequently on Tue 15 May 2001 in a
2 year old Roma girl in Yambol, about 60 miles west of Burgas, health
officials said. Doctors said the girl's legs and left arm were paralyzed.
Laboratories in Paris, Rome, and Atlanta [used genetic sequencing to
identify the infectious agent as poliovirus type 1 and traced it to
northern India, according to a statement from the WHO's European Region
Headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark.
The 2 infections [are the first cases of poliomyelitis in Bulgaria since
1991, according to official statistics. During a poliomyelitis epidemic in
1991, the Bulgarian health authorities identified the virus in 43 children
under the age of 18 months. One died and 42 were disabled. The [recent
cases are the first cases of polio recorded in Europe since November 1998,
when the virus was found in a Turkish province on the Iranian border.

[This article identifies the poliovirus involved as type 1, presumably wild
virus. It is to be hoped that sufficient vaccine will be available to mount
the vaccination campaign indicated to interrupt transmission. - Mod. MPP
