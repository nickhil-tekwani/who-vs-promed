Brazil:
- Source of outbreak. 2 Aug 2018. (published) Zika virus arrived in Brazil via Haiti. The author's results identified the 2014 Haitian ZIKV strain [54] as the most closely related to the French Polynesia isolate placing Haiti as a possible entry point of ZIKV into the Americas, following the same path as DENV and CHIKV as previously stated.
https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijg/aip/6941735/. Zika virus, which caused an epidemic in much of the Americas by the end of 2015, was introduced in Brazil by the immigration of Haitians and a group of Brazilian soldiers who were on humanitarian mission in Haiti, then it spread to other countries.

Indonesia. 9 Sep 2018. (published) Zika virus seroprevalence was established among healthy 1-4-year-old children using a serum sample collection assembled in 2014 representing 30 urban sites across Indonesia. Of 662 samples, 9.1 percent were Zika virus seropositive, suggesting widespread recent Zika virus transmission and immunity. Larger studies are needed to better determine endemicity in Indonesia.

- Risk for California. September 2018. (published) The authors reviewed travel-associated Zika cases in California to assess the potential threat of local Zika virus transmission, given the regional spread of _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes. During November 2015-September 2017, a total of 588 travel-associated Zika cases were reported in California, including 139 infections in pregnant women, 10 congenital infections, and 8 sexually transmitted infections. Most case-patients reported travel to Mexico and Central America, and many returned during a period when they could have been viremic. By September 2017, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes had spread to 124 locations in California, and _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes had spread to 53 locations.

- US territories (American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Puerto Rico, Republic of Marshall Islands, US Virgin Islands). More than 4800 pregnancies had a lab result showing confirmed or possible Zika from 2016-2018. From these pregnancies, 1450 babies were at least one year old and had some follow-up care reported for this analysis. About 1 in 7 (or 14 percent) of the 1450 babies had one or more health problems possibly caused by Zika reported to the US Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry. Some of these problems that were not apparent at birth were identified as the babies grew older.

[2] Evolutionary changes and neurological disease

Barbeito-Andras J, Schuler-Faccini L, Garcez PP. Why is congenital Zika syndrome asymmetrically distributed among human populations?

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a health burden due to the severe neurological abnormalities that arise after congenital infection. Although multiple experimental studies have linked ZIKV with neural birth defects, the scientific community has not been able to fully explain why Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) was only apparent after the virus entered the Americas and why these occurrences have an asymmetric geographic distribution. Here, we review the impact of ZIKV infection on human populations by exploring evolutionary changes in the virus' genome as well as examining the diverse genetic and environmental cofactors of the human hosts.

In conclusion, ZIKV provides an example of how important constant dialogue between experimental, epidemiological, and viral vigilance work is. After ZIKV emerged as a medical concern at the end of 2015, answers to many questions came from the collaborative work of virologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, geneticists, neuroscientists, and developmental biologists, among others. To better understand why CZS is nonhomogeneously distributed among human populations, more interdisciplinary studies are needed. Future advances in understanding the role of cofactors in CZS should result from these interdisciplinary efforts.

[3] Epilepsy in infected infants
Date: Mon 30 Aug 2018
Source: N Engl J Med [edited]
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1716070


Congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection may have severe clinical consequences, including dysmorphic features, orthopedic abnormalities, ophthalmologic and auditory lesions, microcephaly, and hydrocephalus. When ZIKV infection is acquired in utero, it may be associated with epilepsy, and we characterized aspects of this complication in a study performed at our referral center. Patients who were referred to our center had congenital or acquired microcephaly, were asymptomatic or symptomatic newborns who were born to mothers who had confirmed or suspected ZIKV infection during pregnancy, had calcifications (not related to other in utero infections) that were detected by means of neuroimaging studies, or had an unexplained developmental delay and lived in geographic regions where ZIKV infection was epidemic.

Our study included 141 infants, 54.6 percent of whom were girls, who had congenital ZIKV infection that was confirmed by laboratory analysis. The mean age of the patients was 9 months (range, 1 - 14). The prevalence of epilepsy in this cohort was 67 percent, and the mean age of the infants at the onset of epilepsy was 4.9 months. Data from the parents of the infants indicated that the seizures occurred during the first 6 months of life in 74 percent of the infants. At the onset of epilepsy and during follow-up, the main seizure types were epileptic spasms (in 72 percent of the infants), focal motor seizures (in 21 percent), and tonic seizures (in 4 percent) (Table 1). A single seizure type was documented in 77 percent of the infants.

All infants with epilepsy received antiepileptic drugs, and 56 percent received polytherapy. The last evaluation showed that remission was achieved in 62 infants (65 percent); of these infants, 24 received monotherapy (39 percent) and 38 received polytherapy (61 percent).

[Conclusion:] Epilepsy may complicate congenital ZIKV infection.

[This high prevalence of epilepsy in infants infected by Zika virus in utero is an unfortunate additional complication in the lives of the infants and their parents. Readers interested in the details of this study can find them at the above URL. Interestingly, the CDC recommends screening for signs of congenital Zika syndrome and other birth defects by one month of age. The agency also recommends evaluating children for microcephaly until age 24 months and older. However, authors of a recent editorial published in Trends in Microbiology are now suggesting that because the effects of Zika virus infection may extend well into childhood, regular screening may be necessary through adolescence.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a membrane enveloped Flavivirus with a positive strand RNA genome, transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The geographical range of ZIKV has dramatically expanded in recent decades resulting in increasing numbers of infected individuals, and the spike in ZIKV infections has been linked to significant increases in both Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly. While a large number of host proteins have been physically and/or functionally linked to other Flaviviruses, very little is known about the virus-host protein interactions established by ZIKV. Here we map host cell protein interaction profiles for each of the ten polypeptides encoded in the ZIKV genome, generating a protein topology network comprising 3033 interactions amongst 1224 unique human polypeptides. The interactome is enriched in proteins with roles in polypeptide processing and quality control, vesicle trafficking, RNA processing and lipid metabolism. Over 60 percent of the network components have been previously implicated in other types of viral infections; the remaining interactors comprise hundreds of new putative ZIKV functional partners. Mining this rich dataset, we highlight several examples of how ZIKV may usurp or disrupt the function of host cell organelles, and uncover an important role for peroxisomes in ZIKV infection.

[5] Vaccine trials begin

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-begins-clinical-trial-live-attenuated-zika-vaccine


Vaccinations have begun in a 1st-in-human trial of an experimental live, attenuated Zika virus vaccine developed by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. The trial will enroll a total of 28 healthy, non-pregnant adults ages 18 to 50. The experimental vaccine, known as rZIKV/D430-713 used genetic engineering techniques to create a chimeric virus, made by combining genes from multiple viruses. The chimeric virus consists of a dengue virus type 4 backbone that expresses Zika virus surface proteins. The chimeric virus is live but attenuated, or weakened, so it cannot cause disease in recipients. When injected into the body, the weakened virus should prompt an immune response. The Phase 1 clinical trial will analyze this response in participants and assess the safety of the experimental vaccine, which showed promise in earlier tests in rhesus macaques (monkeys). Charles River Laboratories, in Malvern Pennsylvania, manufactured the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.

Patrick K Mitchell Luis Mier-y-Teran-Romero Brad J BiggerstaffMark J Delorey Maite Aubry, et al. Reassessing Serosurvey-Based Estimates of the Zika Symptomatic Proportion.

Abstract
Since the 2007 Zika epidemic in Yap, it has been apparent that not all people infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) experience symptoms. However, the proportion of infections that result in symptoms remains unclear. Existing estimates varied in their interpretation of symptoms due to other causes and the case definition used and assumed perfect test sensitivity and specificity. Using a Bayesian model and data from ZIKV serosurveys in Yap (2007), French Polynesia (2013-14), and Puerto Rico (2016), we found that assuming perfect sensitivity and specificity generally led to lower estimates of the symptomatic proportion. Incorporating reasonable assumptions for assay sensitivity and specificity, we estimated that 27 percent (95 percent credible interval: 15-37 percent) (Yap), 44 percent (26-66 percent) (French Polynesia), and 50 percent (34-92 percent) (Puerto Rico) of infections were symptomatic, with variation due to differences in study populations, study designs, and case definitions. The proportion of ZIKV infections causing symptoms is critical for surveillance system design and impact assessment. Here, we accounted for key uncertainties in existing seroprevalence data and found that estimates for the symptomatic proportion ranged from 27-50 percent, suggesting that while the majority of infections are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, symptomatic infections might be more common than previously estimated.

[There has been a widespread presumption that 80 percent of Zika virus infections are asymptomatic or very mild. The above report indicates that this estimate is too high and that 27-50 percent of infections are, in fact, symptomatic. However, a recent publication based on Zika virus infection cases cautions that case-based surveillance is often biased, depending on whether testing is done and which tests are used. The accuracy of the results depend on a variety of factors including test availability, patient demand, perceptions of transmission, and patient and provider awareness, leading to surveillance artifacts that can provide misleading information on the spread of a disease in a population and having significant public health practice implications. The authors 1st summarize the process that health departments use to generate surveillance reports, then describe factors influencing testing and reporting patterns at the patient, provider, and contextual level. The authors then describe public health activities, including active surveillance, that influence both patient and provider behavior as well as surveillance reports, and conclude with a discussion about the interpretation of surveillance data and approaches that could improve the validity of surveillance reports.

[7] CDC Revised guidance for preconception counseling

Polen KD, Gilboa SM, Hills S, et al. Update: Interim Guidance for Preconception Counseling and Prevention of Sexual Transmission of Zika Virus for Men with Possible Zika Virus Exposure -- United States, August 2018.

[Summary]
CDC has updated the interim guidance for men with possible Zika virus exposure who 1) are planning to conceive with their partner, or 2) want to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus at any time. CDC now recommends that men with possible Zika virus exposure who are planning to conceive with their partner wait for at least 3 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) before engaging in unprotected sex. CDC now also recommends that for couples who are not trying to conceive, men can consider using condoms or abstaining from sex for at least 3 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) to minimize their risk for sexual transmission of Zika virus. All other guidance for Zika virus remains unchanged. The definition of possible Zika virus exposure remains unchanged and includes travel to or residence in an area with risk for Zika virus transmission (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/world-map-areas-with-zika) or sex without a condom with a partner who traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika virus transmission. CDC will continue to update recommendations as new information becomes available.

[Discussion]
Numerous publications have reported on the detection of Zika virus RNA in semen, although this might not indicate the presence of infectious virus at the time of sampling or correlate with the potential for sexual transmission of infectious virus. In the largest published cohort study to date, involving 184 men with confirmed symptomatic Zika virus infection from whom a baseline specimen and serial semen specimens were collected at 2-week intervals, Zika virus RNA shedding in semen declined during the 3 months after symptom onset. Overall, Zika virus RNA was detected in semen in 61 percent (22 of 36); 43 percent (48 of 112); and 21 percent (28 of 131) of participants from whom specimens were collected wit percent in 30, 31-60, and 61-90 days of illness onset, respectively. At over 90 days after illness onset, semen of 7 percent of participants had detectable Zika virus RNA. The estimated mean time to clearance of Zika virus RNA from semen was 54 days (28). Another large cohort study conducted in Puerto Rico followed 117 men, 89 of whom provided semen specimens and reported similar results: at over 90 days after illness onset 11 percent (8 of 74) of men had detectable RNA in semen (Gabriela Paz-Bailey, Division of Vectorborne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC; personal communication, 2018). Similar findings have been observed in smaller cohort studies. Zika virus RNA has been detected in semen for as long as 370 days after symptom onset; however, detection for long periods is rare. Limited data suggest the incidence of Zika virus RNA shedding in semen and its persistence after infection are likely similar for symptomatic and asymptomatic men infected with Zika virus.

[Conclusions]
CDC's last interim guidance released in October 2016 was based on the maximum duration of detection of Zika virus RNA in semen. In the last interim guidance, CDC recommended that men with possible Zika virus exposure wait at least 6 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) before trying to conceive with their partner. New data published since then support an update to that interim guidance. CDC now recommends that men with possible Zika virus exposure who are planning to conceive with their partner wait for at least 3 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) before engaging in unprotected sex. CDC now also recommends that for couples who are not trying to conceive, men can consider using condoms or abstaining from sex for at least 3 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) to minimize their risk for sexual transmission of Zika virus. Recommendations for men with possible Zika virus exposure whose partner is pregnant remain unchanged; these couples should be advised to consistently and correctly use condoms during sex or abstain from sex for the duration of the pregnancy.

[8] Long-term Guillain-Barre outcomes
Date: Wed 22 Aug 2018
Source: Emerging Microbes & Infections [edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41426-018-0151-9.pdf


The purpose of this study was to describe the 2-year clinical course of Z-GBS [Zika virus infection related Guillain-Barre syndrome] in order to provide further insights into disease pathogenesis and prognosis. Clinical and demographic characteristics of the 18 patients infected during the Colombian Zika epidemic with serologically diagnosed Zika infection with GBS are reported. The clinical course of neurologic disease among Z-GBS cases demonstrated the rapid decline from onset of neurologic symptoms to disease nadir in median 5 days and improvement at a median 17 days.

Patients suffered neurologic symptoms for a median total of 27 days. The most common neurologic symptoms were muscular weakness (100 percent), primarily lower extremity weakness (79 percent), inability to walk (89 percent), paresthesias (84 percent), sensory deficit (84 percent), and diminished reflexes (80 percent).

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed elevated protein (91 percent), less than 4 white blood cells (100 percent), and negative bacterial culture (100 percent). Electrodiagnostic study results showed acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) (43 percent), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) (13 percent), sensory motor demyelinating polyneuropathy with axonal involvement (38 percent), and one patient with Miller Fisher variant. Patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (89 percent) and/or plasmapheresis (24 percent). Cases were hospitalized a median of 20 days and spent a median of 6 days in the intensive care unit. None of the patients died.

[Conclusion]
In this report to describe the clinical course of Z-GBS with 2-year follow-up, our primary findings were that the majority of patients had a full recovery but suffered neurologic symptoms for a significant time period (median of 27 days (IQR 12-46)). After 1 year, the Hughes disability score demonstrated that only 60 percent of patients were healthy with 40 percent with some disability. This finding is comparable to classic GBS with 32-65 percent experiencing some disability at 1-year post-GBS.
