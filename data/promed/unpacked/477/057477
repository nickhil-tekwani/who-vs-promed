Viet Nam: 23rd human death from avian influenza virus infection
---------------------------------------------------------------
Another person has died of avian influenza in Viet Nam, bringing the number
of people in the country killed by the virus to 23, a doctor says. A 16
year old girl from Dong Thap province died on Sat 8 Jan 2005 after spending
2 weeks breathing with a respirator at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases
in Ho Chi Minh City, said hospital deputy director Tran Tinh Hien. The
girl, who had earlier tested positive for the H5N1 serotype of avian
influenza virus, had eaten diseased chickens, doctors say.
Hien said the hospital is also treating 2 other patients suspected of
having contracted avian influenza. Tests were in progress, he added. Last
week [1st week of Jan 2005], Viet Nam reported 2 deaths from avian
influenza -- a 6 year old, who died on 30 Dec 2004, and a 9 year old boy
who died on 4 Jan 2005.
World Health [Organization] experts fear that bird flu might mutate and
create the next influenza pandemic. So far, there has been no concrete
evidence of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza. Most patients
have had contact with diseased birds. Only Viet Nam and Thailand have
recorded human deaths from the virus. The World Health Organization has
warned that avian influenza viruses become more active in colder
temperatures. The increase in movement of poultry ahead of the Lunar New
Year festivities in early February 2005 may also increase the risk.
