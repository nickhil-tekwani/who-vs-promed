ENTERIC DISEASE SURVEILLANCE,HUMANS: REQUEST FOR INFO
=====================================================
Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 16:55:02 +0100
From: Noel.McCarthy@smi.ki.se
I am at present trying to find a way to estimate the total burden of
campylobacter and salmonella gastroenteritis in Sweden. We have statutory
reporting for both but clearly that is not very useful for directly
assessing the disease burden when so many cases are not diagnosed (or even
seen by the medical services).
Has anyone found a good method for estimating the total incidence using the
reported data or otherwise? I am interested to receive any information or
contacts in relation to this.
[I apologize for mislaying Noel's posting. In the USA, economic studies
use an figure of 50 cases of Salmonella for every one diagnosed. However,
it appears everyone assumes this is a "wag" of sorts i.e. wild answer and
guesses. No one knows the true incidence at present. However, with
mounting
concern for foodborne diseases, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and
U.S. Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) have put together a model surveillance
system for foodborne disease. It will be most interesting to see what
estimates they come up with. - Mod. pc]
