["Pigs are a primary source of household income in many countries. The spread of ASF across the world has devastated family-run pig farms, often the mainstay of people's livelihoods and a driver of upward mobility. It has also reduced opportunities to access healthcare and education.

"Moreover, pork meat is one of the primary sources of animal proteins, accounting for more than 35% of the global meat intake. Hence, this disease poses a serious problem for food security worldwide.

"This disease is also a concern for biodiversity and the balance of ecosystems, as it affects not only domestic farmed pigs, but also wild boars, including native breeds." Source: https://www.woah.org/en/disease/african-swine-fever/#ui-id-1
