The presence of an invasive and dangerous species of tick has been confirmed in Pennsylvania.

Tests by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa have confirmed the presence of the Asian or longhorn tick, discovered on a wild deer in Centre County. It is known to carry several diseases that infect hogs and cattle [and humans] in Asia. So far, ticks examined in the U.S. do not carry any infectious pathogens.

Easily confused with other tick species, including the rabbit tick, which is common in the Eastern U.S., the species' distinctive "horns" may not be visible without a microscope.

The Asian tick infests host animals in dense clusters of numerous ticks.

Female Asian ticks [can] reproduce asexually, so a single tick can reproduce and lay 2000 eggs after feeding on a host. Cattle, pets, small mammals, birds and humans are all potential hosts.

"Even experts have difficulty distinguishing among tick species, so it is important to take precautions to protect pets, livestock and family members from becoming a host for ticks of any kind," State Veterinarian Dr. David Wolfgang urged. "Scientists don't yet know how this species will adapt to the North American climate and animal hosts, but we know it survived New Jersey's winter and has infested sheep and cattle in this region."

"The discovery of the longhorn tick is another reminder of the importance of tick prevention for Pennsylvanians," Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said. "Ticks can be found in your own backyard, so it is essential to wear long sleeves and pants; use insect repellent containing DEET to help keep you safe from ticks and the diseases they carry. It is also important to check yourself and your pets for ticks, as pets can bring ticks indoors."

Native to East and Central Asia, the tick was originally identified in the U.S. in New Jersey, where it was found in large numbers in sheep in Mercer County in 2017.

It has also been found in Arkansas, New Jersey, New York, West Virginia and Virginia.

[This is the 1st report of a longhorned tick in Pennsylvania. Finding this species of tick on a deer is not surprising because it is known to occur on a variety of animals and humans in Asia.

As noted earlier, the discovery of this tick in several different states in the eastern USA, and now in Pennsylvania, makes one wonder whether this tick has become established in the eastern USA for several years and not just since its 1st report in New Jersey in 2017. Either the tick is spreading rapidly, or surveillance has been intensified, or both. With discovery of this tick in widely divergent localities in the USA in the past 8 months, one wonders whether it is being moved via birds or by infested domestic animals.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. As noted earlier, one wonders whether this tick is capable of transmitting tickborne pathogens that already occur in the eastern USA, such as Powassan virus and Lyme borreliosis. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional bush ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
