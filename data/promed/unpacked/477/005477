Avian influenza has been confirmed at a large chicken farm near
Regina, officials with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)
said Thursday 27 Sep 2007].

The H7N3 strain of the virus found at Pedigree Poultry at Regina
Beach is fatal to birds, but is not dangerous to humans, the agency
said. All 50 000 birds at the farm will be destroyed with carbon
dioxide gas over the next few days.

"We could consider the entire premise to be infected," CFIA
veterinary specialist Sandra Stephens said. Speaking to reporters in
Regina, Stephens said the farm-produced eggs will be hatched at
another facility, but added that the virus couldn't be carried by
chicks born from those eggs.

Stephens said the H7H3 [this was from the original article and likely
a typo; it should be H7N3 - Mod.TG] subtype is not normally
associated with serious human illness. When asked whether any of the
people around the farm have been tested or were sick, Stephens said
that was a question for health officials.

Earlier in the day [27 Sep 2007], the road to the farm was blocked
off about a kilometer (0.6 mi) away, and an official in a car was
making sure nobody tried to get through. The official told a CBC
reporter anyone coming out would be disinfected.

Officials with the local rural municipality were issuing a warning to
the public. "I would advise people to just stay away from the area
because if there is a disease issue, we don't need to have any of
this spread about either in our area, or any other area," said Jim
Hipkins, reeve for the rural municipality of Lumsden.

Vehicles leaving the farm Wednesday [26 Sep 2007] were seen having
their tires washed. People walking in the area were also seen having
their footwear sprayed down.

Stephens said equipment and tools at the facility will be cleaned and
disinfected in the days ahead. A 3-km (2 mi) control zone has been
established around the farm, but the facility is the only one in the
zone with poultry, she said.

However, there is a Hutterite colony with a 65 000-bird chicken
operation about 8 kilometres (5 mi) away from the Pedigree Poultry
site. [Hutterites are a communal branch of Anabaptist Christians who
trace their roots to the Radical Reformation of the 16th century and
are now living in parts of Canada and the northwest United States. - CopyEd.MJ]

Nobody knows how the infection spread to the Regina Beach-area farm,
but the virus is commonly carried by migrating waterfowl, Stephens
said. Regina Beach is about 55 kilometres (34 mi) northwest of Regina.

Health authorities are concerned about avian flu because of the way
the virus can jump to other species, including humans. Some believe
avian flu could someday cause a worldwide pandemic.

Around the world, 200 people have died of avian flu since 2003,
according to the World Health Organization.

An outbreak of one strain of avian flu on a poultry operation in
British Columbia in 2004 saw 2 people infected, but they suffered
only mild flu-like symptoms.

However, the poultry industry took a major blow when the disease
forced the destruction of more than 17 million birds.

[The outbreak of avian influenza in British Columbia in 2004 was
highly pathogenic strain H7N3. This article does not state if this is
a low or high pathogenic strain. Hopefully some testing is being done
on the strain even as they are depopulating the premises. - Mod.TG

Other articles have identified it as a highly pathogenic strain.- Mod.DK
