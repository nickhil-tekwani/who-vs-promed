SALMONELLA MELEANGRIDIS: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Has any one out there been able to identify the source of this serotype?
We are observing an increase in the number of cases here in Canada.
According to The Bureau of Microbiology, LCDC, we had 1 case of _S.
meleangridis_ in 1993, 5 cases in 1994, 4 cases in 1995. We already have
20 cases for 1997, of which 18 are from Ontario, and 1 each from Manitoba
and Saskatchewan. I just got my first case here in Edmonton, but the lady
has been symptomatic off and on for a year making it close to impossible to
fix the incubation period.
There is also very little information as to any sources for _S.
meleangridis_, other than in relation with animal feed in Lebanon and Iraq.

[We seem to be experiencing the same phenomenon in the United States. The
Centers for Disease Control reported only 8 culture confirmed isolates of
Salmonella meleangridis in 1990 but 206 isolates in 1996. Out of 45
isolates the National Veterinary Services Laboratory cultured in 1995, 28
were from bovine and 9 from chickens. - Mod. pc]
