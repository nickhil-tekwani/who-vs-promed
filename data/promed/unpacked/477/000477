Women who gave birth within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test died at a significantly higher rate than their healthy counterparts, finds a Scottish study yesterday [13 Jan 2022] in Nature Medicine. They were also more prone to poor birth outcomes, even if they weren't severely ill, according to a US study in The Lancet Digital Health.

In the first study, University of Edinburgh and Public Health Scotland researchers analyzed national, population-level data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake and SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnant women. [Stock, S.J., Carruthers, J., Calvert, C. et al. SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination rates in pregnant women in Scotland. Nat Med (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01666-2]

From the launch of a COVID-19 vaccination program in Scotland on [8 Dec 2020-31 Oct 2021], 18 457 pregnant women received 25 917 doses. Uptake was much lower in this group than among nonpregnant women ages 18-44 years, with 32.3% giving birth in October 2021 having received 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, compared with 77.4% of other women.

There were 4950 COVID-19 infections among pregnant women. The death rate among women who delivered babies within 28 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis was 22.6 per 1000 births (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.9-38.5), compared with the pandemic background rate of 5.6 per 1000 births (95% CI, 5.1-6.2).

A total of 2364 babies were born to COVID-infected women. Among them, 2353 were live births, of which 241 were preterm, for a preterm birth rate of 10.2% (95% CI, 9.1%-11.6%). The preterm birth rate among babies born within 28 days of maternal COVID-19 diagnosis was 16.6% (95% CI, 13.7%-19.8%).

Among the 2364 births, 11 were stillborn, and 8 live-born babies died within 28 days of birth, for a perinatal death rate of 8.0 per 1000 births after maternal infection at any point in pregnancy (95% CI, 5.0-12.8). Ten stillbirths and 4 neonatal deaths occurred in babies born within 28 days of maternal infection.

Over the study period, the background preterm birth rate was 8.0% (95% CI, 7.8%-8.1%), and the extended perinatal death rate was 5.6 per 1000 births (95% CI, 5.1-6.2).

Overall, 77.4% (95% CI, 76.2%-78.6%) of infections, 90.9% (95% CI, 88.7%-92.7%) of COVID-related hospitalizations, and 98% (95% CI, 92.5%-99.7%) of women requiring critical care, as well as all newborn deaths, occurred in pregnant women who were unvaccinated at diagnosis.

Of all 1st-trimester COVID-19 infections, 6.7% (95% CI, 5.5%-8.1%) led to hospitalization, compared with 10.7% (95% CI, 9.3%-12.2%) of those in the 2nd trimester and 33.5% (95% CI, 31.2%-35.9%) of those in the 3rd trimester. No infections in the 1st trimester led to the need for critical care, compared with 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.8%) of those in the 2nd trimester and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.4%-5.5%) in the 3rd trimester.

"Vaccine hesitancy in pregnancy thus requires addressing, especially in light of new recommendations for booster vaccination administration 3 months after the initial vaccination course to help protect against new variants such as omicron," the study authors wrote. "Addressing low vaccine uptake rates in pregnant women is imperative to protect the health of women and babies in the ongoing pandemic."

In expert comments from the Science Media Centre, Allyah Abbas-Hanif, MBBS, of Imperial College London, said, "We have seen maternal deaths increasing with each progressive wave of the pandemic, a trend reversed in other high-risk groups by the protection afforded by vaccines." [https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-sars-cov-2-infection-and-covid-19-vaccination-rates-in-pregnant-women-in-scotland/]

She called for revisiting the long-term practice of excluding pregnant and breastfeeding women from clinical trials and drug development. "There is now more medication use and disease in pregnancy than ever before, despite this, only one medicine designed for use in pregnancy has been licensed in 4 decades," Abbas-Hanif said. "Moving forwards, the COVID-19 pandemic must catalyse improved research and health equity for pregnant women and their babies."

A study led by Institute for Systems Biology researchers in Seattle showed that pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 have higher odds of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, small size for gestational age, low birth weight, and stillbirth. [SN Piekos, RT Roper, YM Hwang. The effect of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection timing on birth outcomes: a retrospective multicentre cohort study. Lancet Digit Health. Published online 13 Jan 2022 https://doi.org/10.1016/ S2589-7500(21)00250-8]

The team used data from the Providence St. Joseph Health electronic medical records for pregnant women who gave birth at sites in Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon, or Washington from [5 Mar 2020-4 Jul 2021]. None of the women were vaccinated against COVID-19.

A total of 73 666 pregnant women gave birth, 18 335 of whom had at least one COVID-19 test during pregnancy before [14 Feb 2021]. Of the 73 666 women, 882 tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy; 85 in the 1st trimester, 226 in the 2nd trimester, and 571 in the 3rd semester. Overall, 19 769 women never tested positive for COVID-19 and received at least one negative test during pregnancy.

COVID-19 infection conferred an increased risk of preterm delivery and stillbirth, most often in the 1st and 2nd trimesters. Gestational age at diagnosis correlated with and had the most impact on predicting gestational age at delivery. The women all had mild or moderate illness, and disease severity didn't correlate with gestational age at delivery.

Infected women were more likely than their uninfected peers to be Hispanic or another race other than Asian or White and to have Medicaid insurance, lower age, higher body mass index, and lower education level.

"Due to increased risk of maternal-fetal health of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we propose prioritisation of vaccination of pregnant people in areas where vaccine distribution is scarce," the authors wrote.

In an Institute for Systems Biology news release, corresponding author Jennifer Hadlock, MD, said that pregnant women could benefit from increased monitoring after COVID-19 diagnosis. "Both maternal and fetal health are at increased risk with COVID-19," she said. "Therefore, this reinforces the importance of protecting pregnant women." [EurekAlert 13 Jan https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/940002]

In a commentary in the same journal, Elizabeth Barr, PhD, and Damiya Whitaker, PsyD, both of the National Institutes of Health, and Pamela Stratton, MD, of Scientific Consulting Group in Gaithersburg, Md., said that maternal health and COVID-19 disparities in the United States demand attention. [E Barr, D Whitaker, P Stratton. Pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2: an opportunity to systematically study the complexity of maternal health. The Lancet Digital Health. Open Access Published: 13 Jan 2022 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(21)00277-6]

"[COVID-19] has dramatically illuminated both persistent health inequities and the failure of research, clinical care, and medical education to address the social and structural factors that generate and perpetuate these inequities among those at greatest risk of adverse pregnancy outcome," they wrote.

Barr and colleagues called for a more inclusive body of research and a dialog on the importance of maternal healthcare and infectious disease prevention in women. "Piekos and colleagues' recommendation to closely monitor pregnant people who have had a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 1st or 2nd trimester of pregnancy is an essential beginning," they said.

[It is important to note that the deaths occurred in pregnancies among women who were not vaccinated, and no baby deaths occurred in women who had SARS-CoV-2 and were vaccinated.

Vaccination rates of pregnant women are low. Only one-third of pregnant women are vaccinated against the coronavirus, despite the protections afforded by immunization. Early research has found no evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines pose serious risks during pregnancy.

Vaccination rates are low among pregnant women across the board, but are particularly low among younger women and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, the study noted. Future analyses will take these demographic factors and other confounding factors into account, the authors said.

Abstract
Context: Although the increased risk of COVID-19 in carceral facilities is well documented, little is known about the practical barriers to infection control and indirect impacts of pandemic policies in these settings. Evidence in jails is especially scarce.

Methods: Between [8 Jul 2020 and 30 Apr 2021] we performed SARS-CoV-2 serology testing and administered a questionnaire among residents and staff in 4 Northern California jails. We analyzed seroprevalence in conjunction with demographic factors and survey responses of self-perceived COVID-19 risk, recent illness, COVID-19 test results, and symptom reporting behaviors. We additionally assessed COVID-19 policies in practice and evaluated their impacts on court dates, mental health, and routine health care. We engaged stakeholder representatives, including incarcerated individuals and their advocates, to guide study design, conduct, and interpretation.

Findings: We enrolled 788 incarcerated individuals and 380 staff across 4 county jails. Most seropositive individuals had not previously tested positive for COVID-19, despite many suspecting prior infection. Among incarcerated participants, we identified deficient access to face masks and prevalent symptom underreporting associated with fears of isolation and perceptions of medical neglect in jail. Incarcerated participants also reported substantial hindrances to court cases and reductions in routine health care due to COVID-19. Incarcerated individuals and staff both cited worsened mental health due to COVID-19, which for incarcerated individuals was largely attributable to further isolation from loved ones and other pandemic restrictions on recreation and programming.

Conclusions: Perceptions of inadequate protection from COVID-19 were pervasive among incarcerated individuals. Simultaneously, restrictive measures compounded poor mental health and fostered fears of isolation that undermined effective infection control. Custody officials should work to systematically improve provision of masks, understand and mitigate fears and mistrust, and take proactive steps to minimize the detrimental impacts of restrictive policies on residents' mental health and well-being.

[COVID-19 cases are skyrocketing among inmates at Sacramento County jails. There are currently 76 COVID-19 cases at the main jail in downtown Sacramento -- that number has tripled in just the past week. At the Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center (RCCC), located south of Elk Grove, there are currently 48 cases. Last week, there were none.

In an effort to stop the spread, the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office announced an emergency order, authorizing the early release of 203 inmates. They will be released up to 90 days early.

Sgt. Rod Grassmann with the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office said. "This is about having to create quarantine areas for people that are positive." ...

Grassmann said a couple major factors behind the decision are that state prisons are not taking transfers right now -- and the courts are backlogged. That has led more inmates to be inside Sacramento County jails.

"We've got 400 people more than we would normally have," Sgt. Grassmann said. "If those 400 people were in the care of the facilities where they should be, we would not have to do any releases." (https://www.kcra.com/article/some-inmates-released-early-covid-19-outbreak-sacramento-county-jails/38763717)]

[It is nearly impossible to practice social distancing within these facilities, exacerbating the ease of spread of the virus. The decision to release prisoners who do not pose a threat to society is a good approach to control spread of the virus. - Mod.LK]

[3] Anti-virals
[A] Ivermectin: insurance

Needless insurer spending on ivermectin prescriptions for COVID-19, estimated at USD 2.5 million in the United States for the week of 13 Aug 2021 -- the most recent week analyzed -- would extrapolate to USD 130 million annually, US researchers reported yesterday [13 Jan 2022] in JAMA.

Ivermectin has become a hot-button drug because some, especially anti-vaccine advocates, have touted its effectiveness against COVID-19 despite a dearth of supportive data. The Food and Drug Administration has approved it in people for infections caused by some parasitic worms, head lice, and skin conditions like rosacea but warns against taking it for COVID-19.

The study investigators, from the University of Michigan and Boston University, analyzed data from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus for Academics database from [1 Dec 2020], through [31 Mar 2021]. During that period, the database included a convenience sample of 5 million patients with private insurance and 1.2 million with Medicare Advantage across the country.

For each payer type, the authors calculated mean insurer reimbursement, out-of-pocket spending, and total spending per ivermectin prescription. To assess the degree to which insurers covered prescription costs, they divided aggregate insurer reimbursement by total spending.

For each ivermectin prescription, mean out-of-pocket spending was USD 22.48 for privately insured patients and USD 13.78 for Medicare Advantage patients, while mean insurer reimbursement was USD 35.75 and USD 39.13, respectively.

To assess the potential magnitude of what US insurers have spent on ivermectin reimbursement, the researchers looked at prescriptions during the week of [13 Aug 2021], the most recent week with complete data. They assumed that all 88 000 ivermectin prescriptions dispensed that week were for COVID-19 except 3600, the average US weekly dispensing total in the 12 months before the pandemic. They also estimated that 52% (43 888) and 28% (23 632) of the remaining 84 400 prescriptions were paid by private and Medicare plans, respectively, based on prescribing data.

For the week, private and Medicare plans paid an estimated USD 1 568 996 and USD 924 720, respectively, for ivermectin prescriptions for COVID-19. The researchers extrapolated the weekly total of USD 2 493 716 to USD 129 673 240 annually.

The authors say the findings suggest that "insurers could prevent substantial waste by restricting ivermectin coverage; for example, by requiring prior authorization."

[B] Casirivimab-imdevimab reduces symptomatic COVID-19 in phase 3 trial
Date: Fri 14 Jan 2022

A phase 3 clinical trial today [14 Jan 2022] in JAMA finds that only 29.0% of 314 asymptomatic COVID-19-infected people living with an infected household member developed symptomatic illness after receiving the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, compared with 42.3% given a placebo.

Scientists from Regeneron, maker of the casirivimab-imdevimab combination Regen-CoV, led the randomized, double-blind trial at 112 sites in the United States, Romania, and Moldova. The combination is available through an emergency use authorization for high-risk, nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Asymptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 antibody-negative participants 12 years and older who tested positive for COVID-19 within 96 hours of the index case were enrolled from [13 Jul 2020-28 Jan 2021], with follow-up until [11 Mar 2021]. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one dose of subcutaneous casirivimab-imdevimab (158 participants) or placebo (156). Average participant age was 41.0 years.

The drug combination significantly averted progression to symptomatic illness (29.0% vs 42.3% with placebo), for an odds ratio (OR) of 0.54 and an absolute risk difference of -13.3%.

Casirivimab-imdevimab lowered the risk of symptomatic infection from 19.2% to 10%, the duration of COVID-19 symptoms by 5.6 days per participant, and the symptom duration per 1000 participants by 489.8 weeks, relative to 811.9 weeks with placebo. The proportion of participants receiving casirivimab-imdevimab who had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was 33.5%, versus 48.1% for placebo.

In a secondary analysis, none of 100 casirivimab-imdevimab participants were hospitalized or visited an emergency department because of COVID-19, compared with 6 of 104 in the placebo group.

In a related editorial, Jonathan Li, MD, and Rajesh Gandhi, MD, both of Harvard Medical School, said that if casirivimab-imdevimab is authorized for use in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, the combination could be useful for immunosuppressed patients. "In immunocompetent patients, monoclonal antibodies are likely to be reserved for symptomatic individuals as long as there continue to be supply and logistical constraints," they wrote.

"However, casirivimab and imdevimab activity is compromised by the omicron variant, and it is unknown whether the results of this study can be extrapolated to other monoclonal antibody therapies," they added.

"Conclusions and Relevance: Among asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR-positive individuals living with an infected household contact, treatment with subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab antibody combination vs placebo significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 over 28 days."

"...What are the current roles for anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and how might they be used in the future? At this time, anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies are authorized for postexposure prophylaxis and for treatment of nonhospitalized high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. If, in the future, casirivimab and imdevimab therapy is authorized for use in people who are infected but do not have symptoms, this monoclonal antibody combination could potentially be used in high-risk situations, such as for immunosuppressed individuals who are RT-PCR positive but asymptomatic. In immunocompetent patients, monoclonal antibodies are likely to be reserved for symptomatic individuals as long as there continue to be supply and logistical constraints. However, casirivimab and imdevimab activity is compromised by the omicron variant, and it is unknown whether the results of this study can be extrapolated to other monoclonal antibody therapies. ...

"Extraordinary progress has occurred in expanding the role of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19, but several remaining questions must still be addressed. Does treatment of SARS-CoV-2 prevent onward transmission (as has been shown for HIV)? In addition to preventing acute complications, does treatment ameliorate postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2? How might the logistical challenges and supply constraints in delivering monoclonal antibodies be overcome? Do anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies impair development of immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination? How can global equity be achieved in providing these and other effective medications? The answers to these and other questions are critical to realizing the full potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 and to informing the optimal approach to future pandemics." - Mod.LK]

A global total of 7920 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 12 Jan 2022 to late 13 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 74 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 40 of the 74 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 11 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 34.0%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 13.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 19.5% increase in daily reported cases and a 15.8% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 3.2 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 324.23 million cumulative reported cases and more than 5.54 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
