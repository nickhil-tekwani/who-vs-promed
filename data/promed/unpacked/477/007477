Yellow fever in Venezuela
In October 1998, Venezuela reported to Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO/WHO) an outbreak of yellow fever with 14 cases and 3 deaths. The
cases occurred among the Yanomami Indians who live in region of Parima
within the Alto Orinoco County in the State of Amazonas, along the border
with Brazil. The cases were identified between the epidemiological weeks
30th and 36th. Ten cases (71%) were male and 4 (19%) female. The age
distribution of the cases is: 29% over 30 years of age; 50% between 20 and
30 years of age; and 21% between 5 and 19 years. All the cases were
confirmed by laboratory testing: 11 had IgM positive and virus was isolated
from 3 cases. One of the fatalities also had a liver specimen positive by
the immunohistochemical analysis. To prevent new cases a vaccination
program was implemented, targeting 177 Indian villages (population of
8,776). The program was able to reach a vaccination coverage of 86%.
