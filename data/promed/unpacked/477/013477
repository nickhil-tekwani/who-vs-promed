----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this study, the taxonomic position and group classification of the phytoplasma associated with a lethal yellowing-type disease (LYD) of coconut (_Cocos nucifera_ L.) in Mozambique were addressed.

Pairwise similarity values based on alignment of nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (1530 bp) revealed that the Mozambique coconut phytoplasma (LYDM) shared 100â€Špercent identity with a comparable sequence derived from a phytoplasma strain (LDN) responsible for Awka wilt disease of coconut in Nigeria, and shared 99.0-99.6 percent identity with 16S rRNA gene sequences from strains associated with Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) disease of coconut in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. Similarity scores further determined that the 16S rRNA gene of the LYDM phytoplasma shared less than 97.5 percent sequence identity with all previously described members of _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma.

The presence of unique regions in the 16S rRNA gene sequence distinguished the LYDM phytoplasma from all currently described members of _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma, justifying its recognition as the reference strain of a novel taxon, _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma palmicola. Virtual RFLP profiles of the F2n/R2 portion (1251 bp) of the 16S rRNA gene and pattern similarity coefficients delineated coconut LYDM phytoplasma strains from Mozambique as novel members of established group 16SrXXII, subgroup A (16SrXXII-A).

Similarity coefficients of 0.97 were obtained for comparisons between subgroup 16SrXXII-A strains and CSPW phytoplasmas from Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. On this basis, the CSPW phytoplasma strains were designated members of a novel subgroup, 16SrXXII-B.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases of coconut and other palms are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas. LY-type diseases like Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) in Ghana, the "maladie de Kaincope" in Togo and Awka disease (lethal decline, LD) in Nigeria, previously included in 16SrIV group, have been reclassified as the new group 16SrXXII (Nigerian coconut lethal decline (LDN) group; see link below).

Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded and some weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Jumps of LY across apparently unaffected coconut populations have been observed, possibly due to aerial spread of infectious vector insects or human activities.

Commercial control of LY relies on resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used hybrids (ProMED-mail post 20070522.1643) is causing great concern.

In Mozambique, LY has been spreading in the coastal coconut belt in Zambezia province. Quarantine restrictions are in place for the movement of coconut materials to protect areas still free from LY, and some success with replanting certain coconut varieties in LY affected areas has been reported (ProMED-mail post 20100910.3262).
