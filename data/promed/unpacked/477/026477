[Cases continue to be identified in Saudi Arabia at a slow, but steady pace. There have been 18 new laboratory confirmed cases with dates of onset on or after 1 Sep 2014. With the newly confirmed case today (11 Oct 2014), the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia is now 760 including 324 deaths (case fatality rate 42.6 percent). The case fatality rate seems to have somewhat stabilized at about 42.5 percent.

The newly reported case today (11 Oct 2014) is one of the "enigma" cases -- no apparent identifiable risk factor for disease -- non-healthcare worker, no history of pre-existing co-morbidities (which might pre-dispose to healthcare exposures), and no history of animal contact. The last reported case in Najran was confirmed on 15 Sep 2014 and died on 25 Sep 2014. That individual did not have a history of exposure to animals but did have a history of pre-existing co-morbidities.

There was a recovery announced today (11 Oct 2014) in a 65-year-old Saudi male from Taif, who was originally reported on 19 Sep 2014 and reported to be in stable condition at that time.

A map showing the locations of today's announced case and recovery within Saudi Arabia can be found at the source URL above.
