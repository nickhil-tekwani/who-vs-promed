99/127 Wheat China mosaic furovirus: a new virus of wheat in China
-----------------------------------------------------
In Shandong province, China, a soil-borne disease of wheat has been observed
during the last 20 years. The disease is characterized by light chlorotic
streaking on the youngest leaves and bright yellow chlorotic streaking on
older leaves or purple chlorotic stripes on some local wheat cultivars.
Infected plants are severely stunted, wilt and later die. Yield losses of
10-30% are commonly observed, and can reach up to 70% in some cases. Studies
have showed that the disease is caused by wheat yellow mosaic bymovirus
and/or a rod-shaped virus. The disease is also associated with _Polymyxa
graminis_ which is the presumed vector of both viruses.
The rod-shape virus
was described as wheat soil-borne mosaic furovirus on the basis of
serological relationship. However, further characterization studies
(particle morphology, serology, analysis of nucleotide sequences) have shown
that the rod-shaped virus is distinct from wheat soil-borne mosaic furovirus
and is a new virus for which the name wheat China mosaic furovirus is
proposed.

[This report expands our knowledge of the China wheat mosaic virus which was
reported earlier in a private communication by Dr. Chen. Since both viruses
appear to be naturally transmitted by the same fungal vector, it would be
very interesting to know if there are synergistic effects in wheat following
infection by both viruses. -Mod. DH]
