The purpose of this Public Health Advisory is to raise awareness about an increase in the number of syphilis cases reported during the first quarter of 2018. To date, there have been 20 confirmed cases and 2 probable cases of infectious syphilis reported in 2018. By comparison, annual case counts were 20, 20, and 21 for 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.

Most (80 percent) of the cases in 2018 occurred in Anchorage; 90 percent were in males; and ages ranged from 20Â­63 years, with 80 percent of the cases over 30 years of age. Of the males, 80 percent reported having sex with other males (MSM). Some patients have reported finding sex partners through phone apps (e.g., Grindr and Craigslist). Of the 20 confirmed syphilis patients, 5 (or 25 percent) were co-infected with HIV, 15 were White, 3 were Alaska Native people, and 2 were Black. The 2 female patients are of childbearing age.

Alaska's uptick is part of a national trend of increasing rates for syphilis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2016 STD Surveillance Report indicates that there was a 17.6 percent increase in reported primary and secondary syphilis rates nationally from 2015 to 2016; the highest rate reported (8.7 cases per 100 000 population) since 1993. In 2016, Alaska ranked 50th in the nation for syphilis case rate. The CDC Report notes that MSM account for the majority of reported syphilis cases in 2016. The Report also notes that syphilis continues to be characterized by a high rate of HIV co-infection, particularly among MSM.

[With 20 cases of syphilis reported in the past 2.5 months, 80 percent from the city of Anchorage, suggest that this may be another example of what the CDC has recently characterized as a "rapidly growing cluster" (RGC), but in this case of syphilis, not HIV infections. The CDC and co-workers reported 60 RGC of HIV infections in 20 states in all regions of the country. RGC had 5-42 persons during a 12-month period and HIV transmission rates ranging from 21-132 transmission events (median of 44) per 100 person-years compared with the national average of four transmission events per 100 person-years. The 903 persons in RGC were disproportionately young men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly young Hispanic/Latino MSM infected by similar HIV strains on the basis of molecular sequencing (http://www.croiconference.org/sites/default/files/uploads/40.pdf).

Perhaps this syphilis cluster investigation could similarly be aided by molecular typing of _Treponema pallidum_ infecting these patients. The Anchorage cluster may have been facilitated by use of smartphone geolocation apps such as Grindr.

Anchorage, a city with an estimated 301 826 residents in 2017, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Alaska, located in the south-central portion of Alaska (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska).
