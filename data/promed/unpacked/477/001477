Angola: Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak - WHO Update 17
-----------------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 3 May 2005, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 308
cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 277 were fatal. In Uige
Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 297 cases, of which
266 have been fatal, were reported. The large increase in the number of
reported cases for Uige is the result of retrospective investigation and
entry into the database of cases that occurred previously. However, new
confirmed cases and deaths continue to be reported in Uige.
Prevention of opportunities for spread of the virus is essential. Procedures
and assigned responsibilities for safe infection control at the large
provincial hospital in Uige have been agreed this week by ministry
officials, WHO, and Medecins sans Frontieres. Teams are giving particular
attention to screening and admission procedures that prevent suspected cases
from being treated on open wards.
To support these efforts, WHO has deployed additional experts in infection
control drawn from institutions in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response
Network. Massive public information campaigns aimed at ending unsafe
injections have continued this week. 5 new vehicles have been provided by
the Angolan government for use by teams at the outbreak site. This will
provide greater mobility to investigate rumours of suspected cases and
deaths and to follow contacts.

[These figures are slightly lower that those reported in Marburg hemorrhagic
fever - Angola (37) 20050504.1232 (also dated 3 May 2005) and attributed to
the Angolan Ministry of Health; 303 cases in place of 313 and 277 deaths in
place of 280. Whatever the precise figure, the dramatic increase in case
numbers and deaths in the 72 hours up to 3 May 2005 compared with those in
the previous 72 hours is less alarming, since it can be accounted for to a
large extent by updating of database records. - Mod.CP]
