--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The present pandemic produced by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants represents an example of the one health concept in which humans and animals are components of the same epidemiologic chain. Animal reservoirs of these viruses are thus the focus of surveillance programs to monitor their circulation and evolution in potentially new hosts and reservoirs. In this work, we report the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Gamma variant infection in 4 specimens of _Chaetophractus villosus_ (big hairy armadillo/armadillo peludo) in Argentina. In addition to the finding of a new wildlife species susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the identification of the Gamma variant 3 months after its last detection in humans is a noteworthy result, raising the question of potential unidentified viral reservoirs.

[So far, SARS-CoV-2 had been shown to replicate in many mammalian species. Over 40 species have been found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and natural infections have been documented in at least 24 species of distant mammalian orders, including Primata, Rodentia, Carnivora, and Arthiodactyla. This report adds a different order, Xenarthra.

The 4 animals found infected were born in captivity in April 2021 and kept in an academic facility for research purposes. They were initially tested and found negative for SARS-CoV-2, but in March 2022 they developed respiratory signs and were tested again, being all 4 of them positive. Sequencing indicated a variant that was not the one dominating at the time. The significance of the susceptibility of this group -- that is, host competence and virulence -- should be investigated. It is very important to establish whether armadillos may be suitable compartments where the virus may be maintained and evolve, and then perhaps spill back to humans or other animals as a new variant, as suggested by molecular evidence for minks and white-tailed deer.- Mod.PMB
