Canada: norovirus outbreak affects Vancouver courthouse
-----------------------------------------------
More than legal judgements are being handed out at Vancouver's
provincial court. [A norovirus outbreak] has made dozens of people
sick. Judges, lawyers, inmates in the jail, and several people in the
courthouse cafeteria have come down with the intestinal virus.

Health officials believe the virus was spread through the courthouse
cafeteria, Vancouver Coastal Health Authority spokeswoman Viviana
Zanocco said. "We'll know we have it under control when we go a
couple of days without anyone else getting sick," Zanocco said. "That
hasn't happened yet." Zanocco said an environmental health officer is
monitoring the cleanup daily. No one has been serious ill.

[2] Norovirus, suspected, nursing home - USA (Casper, Wyoming)

USA: Wyoming nursing home affected by norovirus outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
At least 62 patients and staff at the Shepherd of the Valley Care
Center have a stomach sickness that health officials think is due to
norovirus infection. Karen James, the center's director of nursing,
said that 50 of the 172 residents, and 12 staff members, have an
illness that can cause vomiting and diarrhea, though not all have
both. She said the 1st people became sick on Mon 26 Apr 2004, but
everyone, at this point, has made a full recovery within 24 to 36
hours. There is no [specific] treatment for [norovirus infection], so
staff are asking visitors to take precautions. "We've posted signs on
our doors for our visitors to please stop at the reception to get a
mask," James said.

City of Casper-Natrona County Health Department spokesman Marty Thone
said that the outbreak is worrisome, since most of the center's
residents are older than 70 and may have suppressed immune systems.
Noroviruses are transmitted through stool and vomit. Health officials
are currently teaching center employees proper hand-washing and
sanitation techniques.

Both Thone and James said that it is unlikely the virus was spread
through food prepared in the centralized kitchen, because the center
is divided into 4 separate units, and entire units have been spared
from the outbreak despite eating the same food.

USA: norovirus outbreak affects passengers on Caribbean cruise
-----------------------------------------------
Passengers on a Norwegian Cruise Lines ship that left Bermuda today
[Sat 1 May 2004] said their Caribbean journey was fraught with
problems, including a stomach bug that left more than 30 people sick,
power outages, and an overpowering fuel smell. The company flew 39 of
the cruise liner's 1111 passengers home after paying for their hotel
stays last night [Fri 30 Apr 2004].

The Norwegian Crown is due back in Philadelphia, in the USA, on Sun 2
May 2004. Norwegian Cruise Lines spokeswoman Susan Robison said tests
had determined that the stomach bug the passengers had contracted was
not linked to food. She said that the crew was taking steps to
disinfect the ship to eliminate the virus. Passengers were also angry
about soot in a hot tub and pool, as well as afternoon power outages
on 2 days that affected elevators, lights, toilets, and water.

In 2003, 55 passengers and 5 crew members on a 7-day Norwegian cruise
to Alaska contracted what appeared to be norovirus infection, a virus
that has caused thousands of cruise ship passengers to fall ill. The
illnesses occurred on the Miami-based Norwegian Cruise Lines vessel
Norwegian Sky.

Noroviruses -- which include Norwalk virus and related viruses -- can
cause diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting for 24 to 48 hours. They
are spread through food, water and close contact with infected people
or with things that they have touched.

[The term norovirus is the collective name for enteric viruses
belonging to the genus _Norovirus_ of the family _Caliciviridae_. The
type species of the genus is _Norwalk virus_ from which the name
norovirus is derived. Norwalk is a town in Ohio where the virus was
1st isolated. Viruses in this genus are associated with epidemic
gastroenteritis in humans, and, previously, were designated according
to their appearance by negative-stain electron microscopy as "small
round structured viruses." - Mod.CP]

[4] Norovirus, suspected, location undisclosed - USA (Fairbanks, Alaska)

USA: suspected norovirus outbreak affects 18 people in Fairbanks (Alaska)
-----------------------------------------------
Public health workers are investigating a small outbreak in Fairbanks
of highly contagious norovirus infection. 18 people have fallen ill
with norovirus-like symptoms, which are diarrhea, nausea, and
vomiting, according to Marc Chimonas, a physician with the Alaska
Division of Public Health, who traveled here from Anchorage in
response to the outbreak. 2 public places believed to have been
contaminated with the virus have been disinfected, Chimonas said. The
doctor refused to name them, citing the potential for stigma.
"Publicly pointing fingers at these 2 places is not going to prevent
spread of the disease," Chimonas said.

5 of the 18 norovirus cases are extremely mild, Chimonas said.
Norovirus is the [collective name for members of the former genus
_Norwalk-like viruses_, now designated by the genus name
_Norovirus_]. Noroviruses are spread person-to-person, typically by
eating food or by drinking water contaminated by the feces of an
infected person, according to a public health fact sheet. [Norovirus
infection] is not deadly, but people who have it "have a distinct
feeling that they've been poisoned," one physician said. The symptoms
typically last about 2 days.

Chimonas is working with local public health workers and officials
with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation to
distribute information about how to prevent the spread of the virus.
"Hand-washing is key," Chimonas said. "Everyone in town needs to be
very vigilant about hand-washing. Since this is very contagious, we
don't want the outbreak to get any bigger. It can be disruptive for
the economy if a lot of people get sick." Chimonas has not tracked
down the source of the virus, and it is unclear whether he will
succeed.

The virus commonly makes its way to Alaska via cruise ships. The
virus has not yet been confirmed through laboratory testing -- final
confirmation is due on Wed 5 May 2004 -- but the symptoms point
almost beyond doubt to norovirus, Chimonas said.

Fairbanks Memorial Hospital is accepting stool samples from residents
with norovirus-like symptoms who want to confirm whether they are
infected, Bullock said. Cups for the samples are available in the
emergency room. Residents suffering from diarrhea, nausea and
vomiting should take care to remain hydrated, Chimonas and Bullock
said.
