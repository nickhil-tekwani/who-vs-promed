The U.S. Embassy, Pristina advises U.S. citizens that Kosovo is experiencing a cyclical outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which is endemic to this area. National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo (NIPH) has recently reported 5 fatal cases of CCHF in the Malisheva/Malishevo, Rahovec/Orahovac and Gjakova/Gjakovica municipalities. Those most at risk are individuals with contact with livestock in endemic regions.

CCHF is a tick-borne disease in humans with a high mortality rate. Fortunately, human illness occurs infrequently. A map of areas in Kosovo where the outbreaks are occurring is attached. In addition, please see instructions from the CDC website about CCHF.

Signs and symptoms of the disease include: Sudden onset of high fever, headache, backache, and abdominal pain, small hemorrhages of the eyes, a type of rash in the mouth and on the trunk of the body [and evidence of a current tick-bite]. There is no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use. People living in endemic regions should avoid areas where there are many ticks, particularly in the spring and summer. The following safety precautions are also recommended:
- Wear light-colored clothing that covers legs and arms;
- If living in an infested area, check your whole body regularly for ticks, remove ticks gently but promptly;
- Examine clothes regularly for ticks;
- Use tick repellents on skin and clothing;
- Tuck trousers into socks, and keep sleeves rolled down;
- Clean areas well where food is prepared or served so as not to attract ticks [?];
- Maintain neatness and cleanliness;
- Check your pets frequently for fleas and ticks, and use flea and tick collars and shampoos.

For health issues, include the following: obtain Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) travel notices, call the CDC at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636) from within the United States or 1-404-639-3534 from overseas, or visit the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/travel.

We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens traveling to or residing in Kosovo enroll in the Department of State's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). STEP enrollment gives you the latest security updates, and makes it easier for the U.S. embassy or nearest U.S. consulate to contact you in an emergency. If you don't have Internet access, enroll directly with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.

Regularly monitor the State Department's website, where you can find current Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and the Worldwide Caution. Read the Country Specific Information for Kosovo.

For additional information, refer to "A Safe Trip Abroad" on the State Department's website. The U.S. Embassy, Pristina is located at 30 Nazim Hikmet St. Arberia/Dragodan, 10 000 Pristina and is open between 8 AM-5 PM, (381) 38-5959-3000.

[CCHF was 1st characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease. CCHF is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union. It is currently distributed throughout the Balkans, northwestern China, central Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent.

Ixodid (hard) ticks, especially those of the genus, _Hyalomma_, are both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF virus. Numerous wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep and hares, serve as amplifying hosts for the virus. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected animal blood or ticks. CCHF can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids. Documented spread of CCHF has also occurred in hospitals due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of injection needles, and contamination of medical supplies.

In humans, the length of the incubation period for the illness appears to depend on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection via tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5-6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days. The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. Therefore, the 5 deaths recorded in Kosovo imply that there may have been more than 15 cases in total.

In those patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness. General supportive therapy is the mainstay of patient management in CCHF infections. Intensive monitoring to guide blood volume and component replacement is required. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in treatment of established CCHF infection with apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective. (Further information can be obtained from the WHO Fact Sheet at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/index.html.
