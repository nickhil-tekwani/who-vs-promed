23 culture-confirmed cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ were reported among
residents of Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York. Dates of illness
onset ranged from July 21 through September 17 [1998.
An investigation coordinated by the New York State Department of Health
determined that 22 of 23 ill persons had eaten or handled oysters,
clams, or crustaceans.The median onset of illness following consumption
of shellfish was 19 hours. Clinical histories were available for 19 of
the 23 ill persons; 89% had gastroenteritis and 11% had bloodstream
infections with lower extremity edema and bullae. Among patients with
gastroenteritis, reported clinical symptoms included diarrhea (100%),
abdominal cramps (94%), nausea (94%), vomiting (82%), fever (47%),
bloody stools (29%), headache (24%), and myalgia (24%). Median duration
of gastrointestinal illness was 5 days.
Traceback investigations by local and state health departments
identified the site of harvest for oysters or clams eaten by 11 of the
16 patients as Oyster Bay off of New York'sLong Island Sound or just off
of Long Island.
During the outbreak period, mean surface water temperature measurements
from 15 Oyster Bay stations was 77.2 F (25.1 C), compared with cooler
1997 and 1996 measurements (74.1 F {23.4 C} and 69.4 F {20.7 C},
respectively). On September 10, Oyster Bay was closed to harvesting of
shellfish, which were recalled. Oyster Bay was reopened to commercial
shellfish harvesting on October 22. The water temperature had declined
and no additional culture-confirmed cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_
infection have been reported.
MMWR Editorial Note: This is the fourth multistate outbreak of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ infections in the United States since 1997, and the
first associated with shellfish harvested from the northeast Atlantic
Ocean. Before 1997, foodborne outbreaks caused by _V. parahaemolyticus_
had been infrequently reported in the United States (1). During
1997-1998, multistate outbreaks of _V. parahaemolyticus_ were associated
with consumption of raw or undercooked oysters harvested from the
Pacific Northwest and Texas (2; Centers for Disease Control [CDC,
unpublished data, 1998).
_V. parahaemolyticus_ is a halophilic, gram-negative bacterium that
naturally inhabits marine and estuarine waters. _V. parahaemolyticus_
infections are usually acquired by persons who eat raw or undercooked
shellfish, particularly oysters, or whose skin wounds are exposed to
warm seawater. The common clinical manifestation of infection is
self-limited gastroenteritis, but infections may result in septicemia
that can be life threatening (3,4). The concentration of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ in seawater increases with rising water temperature
and corresponds with seasonal sporadically occurring cases in warmer
months (4). This outbreak and the recent outbreaks of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ infections in the Pacific Northwest and Texas occurred
during summer months.
To reduce the risk for _V. parahaemolyticus_ and other
shellfish-associated infections, persons should avoid eating raw or
undercooked shellfish, particularly during warmer months. Monitoring of
environmental conditions, such as water temperature and salinity, may
help determine when shellfish harvesting areas should be closed and
re-opened to harvesting.
Guidelines regulating the harvesting of oysters and clams rely on
quantitative measurement of _V. parahaemolyticus_ levels in oyster or
clam meat. However, data from recent outbreaks may require revision of
these guidelines... Oyster samples that were harvested from implicated
beds in the Pacific Northwest in 1997 and Oyster Bay in 1998 yielded
less than 200 _V. parahaemolyticus_ cfu/g of oyster meat, indicating
that human illness can occur at levels much lower than the current
action level.
Infection with _V. parahaemolyticus_ is not a notifiable condition in
most states, including New York. This outbreak was detected only
coincidentally because of enhanced surveillance during an investigation
of a case of _V. cholerae_ O1. Health-care providers treating patients
with gastroenteritis who have a history of recent ingestion of raw or
undercooked shellfish should consider _Vibrio_ spp. infection and
request a stool culture specifically for _Vibrio_. Clinical laboratories
should use thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (TCBS), a
selective medium for culturing for _Vibrio_ spp., and should consider
using TCBS for routine screening of all stools specimens, at least
during summer months.
CDC coordinates a passive Gulf Coast Vibrio surveillance system and the
Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) to monitor the
incidence of Vibrio infections. Because of these multistate outbreaks,
all states should consider making infections with _V. parahaemolyticus_
and other vibrioses reportable, with referral of clinical isolates to
public health laboratories for confirmation and strain subtyping.
