The Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) has issued a warning against
Hipp's baby food. NFSA writes on its website that there are suspicions that
Hipp's fruit puree with banana and apricot may contain [spores of]
_Clostridium botulinum_, following an outbreak of illness in Denmark.

NFSA are now recommending that all parents who have bought jars marked
L35655, with a use-by date of 31 Dec 2008 should throw them away. "NFSA
recommends that the Norwegian importers withdraw the jars of fruit puree in
question, and the importers have themselves initiated this work," says
Annette Haugane, section leader of NFSA at the district office for Oslo.

The Danish Food Safety Authority has sent the fruit puree for test
analysis, and a final confirmation as to whether the food is poisonous will
come at the end of the week. _Clostridium botulinum_ [toxin] is considered
very poisonous even in small doses.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts recalls
even if there are no human cases associated with the food. Most of the food
recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but
not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C.
botulinum_. Here, the posting reports cases in Denmark and ProMED-mail
would appreciate more information about the Danish cases. - Mod.LL
