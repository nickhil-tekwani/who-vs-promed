Meningococcal Meningitis in Rhode Island, A Chronology and Update
March 23, 1998
The following summary describes the events leading to the decision of
our State Director of Health (Commissioner) Dr. Patricia A. Nolan and
Governor Lincoln Almond to offer a meningococcal vaccination program
to all persons 2 to 22 years old in Rhode Island.
Rhode Island is a city-state with a population of approximately 1
million, and a land area approximately 1000 square miles. There is one
centralized Public Health Department, which functions both as the
state and local health department.
During the reporting period 1972 to 1995, the rate of sporadic
invasive meningococcal (probable and confirmed) disease in RI has
ranged from a low of 0.2/100,000 (1977) to a high of 2/100,000 (1986).
The rates for more recent years have been as follows; 1995: 0.9, 1996:
2.5, 1997: 2.4, and to date in 1998, 11 cases have been reported. The
surveillance system has always required reporting by telephone within
24 hours for all cases of invasive meningococcal disease on first
diagnosis.
In 1996 there was a moderate increase in case rates to 2.4 per 100,000
population with a clear concentration of cases in northern Rhode
Island (Providence County-population 500,000). A cluster of 7
serogroup C cases occurred in the northern urban community of
Woonsocket, population 43,000 (the last 4 cases occurred in a 4 week
period), reaching near outbreak levels of transmission (9.2/100,000).
This triggered the response of a mass vaccination effort targeting 2
to 29 year old residents in Woonsocket in October-November 1996. The
enzyme type associated with the outbreak was ET 24. No further cases
of serogroup C disease have occurred in Woonsocket since.
In 1997 the Rhode Island case rate remained steady at 2.4/100,000.
However, almost every sporadic case has continued to receive
concentrated public attention. Sporadic cases occurred more frequently
in communities surrounding the outbreak community with 4 sporadic
cases (3 confirmed serogroup C and one probable) occurring in the
neighboring community of Cumberland (29,000 population) between April
and December 1997. These cases did not meet the criteria defining an
outbreak and/or vaccination response. Extensive and very detailed
education efforts were made with the public and health care providers
to calm fears in northern Rhode Island communities. Nevertheless
during October to December 1997, members of the public and community
leaders (physicians, nurses, city officials and legislators)
repeatedly expressed their desire that vaccine be made available more
widely in Cumberland and elsewhere in the state.
After consulting with the Physician Advisory Committee in December of
1997, the Director of Health issued an advisory to all physicians in
the state, stating that the Department of Health was not discouraging
individual vaccination. Providers could administer vaccine in the
context of the doctor-patient relationship with the understanding that
neither insurance companies nor the state would pay for routine use
outside guidelines issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP).
In January 1998 private citizens organized "independent public
clinics" with support from city officials and medical professionals in
the Town of Cumberland. Eight hundred (800) persons were vaccinated
for cash payment. Overall, 13,000 doses of vaccine were supplied by
the manufacturer to private sector providers in Rhode Island In
addition, a bill was introduced in the General Assembly to make
meningococcal vaccine mandatory for school entry in RI. The Department
of Health opposed the bill on the grounds that invoking the police
powers of the state to bar unvaccinated children from full
participation in school, day care and other normal activities was
unnecessary and inappropriate. The medical inappropriateness had to do
with the negligible impact of vaccinating one cohort of children per
year. Subsequently this bill has passed in one chamber of the
Legislature; the Governor has indicated that he will veto the measure
if enacted.
The first fatality of 1998 was a 2-year-old resident in East
Providence on January 12. This was a "probable" case (purpura
fulminans with negative cultures) and did not receive media attention.
Department of Health policy at that time was not to release
information on sporadic cases, except on a need-to-know basis. When
the media became informed through other sources, the opportunity is
used by the Department for intense public education and risk
communication. A standard public health response of antibiotic
prophylaxis for close contacts is implemented for every sporadic case.

Between January 18 and January 28, a cluster of 4 linked serogroup B
(2 confirmed, 2 strongly suspect) cases were reported. One person in
the cluster was a dorm resident in a northern Rhode Island college.
Media attention was intense. On February 8th, a 19-year-old Woonsocket
resident was reported as a probable case. A second fatality was
reported on February 12th, this time in Woonsocket and involving a
9-year-old--later confirmed to be serogroup Y. The 9-year-old and
19-year-old were not residents of Woonsocket at the time of the
previous mass vaccination campaign in 1996.
The day after the death of the 9-year-old, the Mayor of Woonsocket
announced school and community clinics organized by the city to
vaccinate 2-19 year-olds who had missed the 1996 campaign. The
Governor offered to assist this community, and asked the Department of
Health to facilitate purchase of 50-dose vials of vaccine. Public
interest surged.
In reaction, city officials, legislators and other leaders in
surrounding cities and towns increased their demands for mass
immunization. Key partners in the infectious disease medical community
and health plans signaled their support. The Governor asked the
Director of Health to develop a policy making vaccine routinely
available to RI residents above and beyond the ACIP recommendations.
After hours of deliberation, a policy was formulated recommending
making vaccine available to all Rhode Islanders between the ages of 2
and 22 years. Vaccination was to be administered in a routine manner
through physician offices over a 6 to 12 month period. Health plans
would be asked to include this vaccine as a covered benefit; with the
state taking financial responsibility for the uninsured. The rationale
for targeting 2 to 22 year olds was based higher age-specific attack
rates in 1996 and 1997.
On Monday, February 23rd the Department of Health announced the new
policy. Discussions were being held with health plans to ensure
coverage. At virtually the same hour, a 5-year-old boy from North
Providence died from meningococcal disease. This was the second
serogroup C case for this small community of 31,000 in 2 months. The
incident received immediate and intense media attention as a third
childhood fatality in 6 weeks. The following day the Mayor of North
Providence announced mass vaccination clinics for residents aged 2-22
years. The wave of public concern became overwhelming. During the next
48 hours, doctor's offices and the Department of Health received
thousands of calls from a panicked public seeking vaccination against
a perceived epidemic that had claimed the lives of 3 children. Instead
of an action taken out of an abundance of caution, the Department's
recommendation for vaccination was seen by many, including the media,
as signaling a public health emergency
By the next morning the Department of Health's vaccination strategy
inadvertently had resulted in gridlock among pediatricians, family
physicians and health care institutions across the state. At a 6:00
p.m press conference on Tuesday, February 24th, the Governor announced
that the state would establish community and school-based clinics.
Implementation was immediately shifted to a community based mass
vaccination effort with centralized vaccine purchase and delivery for
the estimated 200,000 to 250,000 targeted individuals. This action was
intended primarily to take the pressure off doctors' offices so that
sick children could be seen. It also assured the public that the
vaccine would be made available to all eligible Rhode Islanders within
6-8 weeks instead of the original 6 to 12 month time frame.
The Department of Health implemented an intense public information
campaign in an effort to reduce the level of panic. The outreach
included extensive radio and television news coverage involving daily
then twice-weekly media briefings (written and oral). In the face of
rising fear, a televised "town hall" was planned and conducted on
Friday, February 27th with the Governor, the Director of Health and
several prominent physicians answering questions. As the vaccine
clinics were set up and vaccine supply was assured, the public's
attention shifted.
Information was also developed in direct support of prevention efforts
and immunization clinics. Public health advisories were sent out to
vaccine providers (physicians and clinics), schools and parents of
school-age children, day care centers and other child care providers.
Questions and answers about meningitis, posters and other information
were distributed through WIC vendors (200), local churches (500),
small businesses (1100) and lottery point of sale sites (1200). Much
of this material was translated into Spanish, Portuguese, Cambodian,
Laotian and other languages. The Department of Health website
(www.health.state.ri.us) became the focus for information
distribution, with near-daily case updates and extensive listings of
school and community clinics.
Vaccine distribution began on February 28. By March 16th, about
275,000 doses had been distributed to physicians' offices, schools and
community-based clinics. The extra doses allowed for flexibility of
distribution. The Department held training sessions for local
government, school and medical authorities on how to organize and
conduct a mass immunization clinic. They were provided with model
parental consent forms, vaccine certificates and clinic logs (for
reporting the characteristics of people who were vaccinated). The
community response and volunteerism was enormous. More than 245
community and school-based clinic sessions were approved and scheduled
in the state 39 cities and towns. As of March 20, 155 clinic sessions
have been conducted resulting in the vaccination of 130,000 Rhode
Islanders. There was no vaccine shortage; the manufacturer has kept
the state well supplied with 50-dose vials, suitable for mass
immunization clinics. The total cost of vaccine alone is estimated at
5 million dollars. Vaccine costs will be recouped from insurance
payers. The state will pay for the uninsured and the Medicaid managed
care portion of costs.
In the first three months of 1998 Rhode Island has experienced 11
reported cases of meningococcal meningitis (6 confirmed, 2 probables
and 3 strongly suspect cases ). A 12th probable cased reported on
March 6, was later downgraded to "under investigation". Two additional
cases under investigation have since been determined not to be
meningococcal meningitis. There have been no additional probable or
confirmed cases since February 23, 1998.
The National Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has been kept informed
of developments in RI. Since the 1996 outbreak, the Department of
Health has sought frequent epidemiologic and laboratory consultation
with CDC's Meningitis Branch. At the state's request, CDC posted an
Epidemiology Intelligence Officer (EIS) and student assistant to Rhode
Island on February 27th. The focus of their investigation is to
determine the significance of the excess in serogroup Y cases and
whether the accelerated sporadic case rates for January-February 1998
are accounted for by chance alone. There is no epidemiologic evidence
to suggest a local outbreak at this time. CDC will also assist in
implementation and analysis of a detailed evaluation plan for this
unprecedented intervention.
