Corn disease could damage yields
--------------------------------
Alison Robertson, Iowa State University, is warning farmers to keep their eyes open for an emerging corn disease, which has the potential to reduce yields to near zero. She said there have been increased sightings of physoderma, a corn disease that had gone unseen in the US for decades but has been spotted more and more since 2007.

The disease is caused by the fungus _Physoderma maydis_, and first appeared in India in 1910. In the 1930s, the disease hit the south eastern region of the US and led to yield losses of between 5 and 10 per cent in the area. Affected crops show one of 2 symptoms: brown spots on the leaves of the plant or stalk rot [of] the lower nodes. Robertson first saw leaf spots in 2007 but said stalk rot began appearing in 2013, and the disease has been seen in several Iowa fields this year [2015].

Robertson said researchers are still unsure as to what exactly is causing the disease's return but said it might have to do with wet springs. "We have no idea why all of a sudden we're starting to see the disease on the stalk," she said. "It could be a function of the resistance in the [maize] hybrids, it could be something to do with how the pathogen is infecting the corn. If we get a big wind, your corn is lying all over the field."

Robertson said fields could be infected for up to 3 to 7 years, and she recommends farmers should rotate [crops], as well as possibly change to a less-susceptible hybrid.

[The fungus _Physoderma maydis_ (Pm) causes brown spot and stalk breakage on maize and teosinte. It is an important disease in areas of abundant rain and high temperatures. For example, up to 20 per cent yield losses have been reported from India. Additional problems are caused by lodging (collapse of plants) which may make harvesting impossible. The leaf symptoms of brown spots resemble some other leaf spot diseases of the host and diagnosis by symptoms is therefore often unreliable. Leaf spots fuse into large lesions which may turn reddish brown or purple and kill off the entire leaf. On stalks, water soaked lesions appear beneath leaf sheaths, which may coalesce to completely girdle the stalk and lead to the collapse of the plant. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions and infection often occurs in the leaf whorl where water tends to accumulate.

The pathogen can be spread with infected plant material and by mechanical means and survives in crop debris. Disease management may include phytosanitation (such as ploughing in of old crop debris), crop rotation and fungicides. Some resistant maize varieties and hybrids are available for most affected areas.

In the US, occasional outbreaks have been reported from several states since the early 1900s. It is not clear from the report above whether increasing incidence of Pm is only observed in Iowa or also elsewhere in the country.
