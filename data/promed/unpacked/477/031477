Health officials have warned residents to protect themselves from mosquito
bites after some mosquitoes trapped near this West Texas city tested
positive for St. Louis encephalitis [SLE virus. In El Paso, an industrial
city on the border with Mexico, health officials said the virus was found
in a batch of mosquitoes trapped October 4 on a Rio Grande levee behind a
metals factory.
There have been no recent reported cases of [SLE virus infection in El
Paso but officials are warning people to try and protect themselves from
mosquitoes.
