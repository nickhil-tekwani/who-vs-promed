Paraguay, the world's 9th-biggest global beef exporter, has been formally certified as free of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] 2 years after an outbreak of the debilitating virus.

The OIE World Organization for Animal Health has certified the country as having eliminated the disease, although a vaccination program for Paraguay's cattle must be maintained, the country's animal health agency Senacsa said Friday [8 Nov 2013].

Beef is Paraguay's leading export after soybeans, and the brief suspension of shipments in 2011 hit the economy hard. The OIE certification will potentially open up new markets to Paraguayan beef shipments and allow it to ship bone-in meat again to current customers.

In 2012, Paraguay exported just over 165 000 metric tons of beef, a 16 percent gain on the year, according to Senacsa. Last year's [2012] shipments were valued at almost USD 820 million.

Russia was by far the largest buyer, importing 114 000 tons of boneless beef from Paraguay. Angola followed with just over 6000 tons, while Israel bought about 5700 tons.

In September 2011, Paraguay suffered the FMD outbreak in the central San Pedro district. The government moved to quickly isolate the area and slaughter the affected herd. Mandatory vaccination in the country helped to contain the outbreak.

FMD is [caused by] an infectious virus affecting cattle, pigs and other animals with cloven hooves. Although rarely fatal, it generally causes serious weight loss in affected livestock, greatly increasing production costs.

South America has had several outbreaks of FMD in recent years.

In October 2005, a major outbreak occurred in Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul state, home to Brazil's largest cattle herd. After the outbreak, 56 nations temporarily banned beef from Mato Grosso do Sul and neighboring states Parana and Sao Paulo.

In February 2006, Argentina experienced an outbreak in the northern province of Corrientes, which borders Paraguay. That led many countries to block Argentine beef imports for a time.

Chile is the only country in the region certified free of FMD without vaccination -- a status it has held since 1981.

[To be certified as FMD-free with vaccination and to have an impending certification just months away is a huge achievement for both countries and is to be celebrated.
