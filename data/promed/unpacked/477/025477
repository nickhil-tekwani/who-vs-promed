Lyme disease isn't the only tick-borne illness threatening Cape Codders. Cases of babesiosis and anaplasmosis doubled in Massachusetts between 2010 and 2011, and much like with Lyme disease, the Cape and Islands are hot spots for the emerging diseases.

Also known as Nantucket fever, babesiosis wasn't even identified until the 1970s. Last year [2011], the Massachusetts Department of Public Health confirmed 191 cases, including 57 in Barnstable County and 46 cases in Dukes and Nantucket counties.

Confirmed babesiosis cases 2011
---------------------
Total for Massachusetts: 191*
Barnstable County: 57
Dukes and Nantucket counties: 46
*41 percent of confirmed cases were hospitalized. Most cases occurred in June, July and August, and only 23 percent of cases reported a recent tick bite. The average age for a confirmed babesiosis case was 62 years, and just over half the babesiosis patients were men.

Caused by a parasite transmitted by a deer tick bite, babesiosis might seem like nothing more than a mild flu, or even prove asymptomatic, in the young and healthy. But for those with compromised immune systems, including the elderly, it can be serious and, in rare cases, fatal.

"I know of 2 people who have been very, very ill, taking a long time to get over it," said Brenda Boleyn, a biologist who is on the Cape Cod Lyme Disease Task Force and the Massachusetts Lyme Commission.

Just last week, someone was admitted to Cape Cod Hospital after falling ill with a high temperature from babesiosis, said Dr. David Pombo, director of infection prevention for Cape Cod Healthcare. "It's just like malaria," he said. Shaking, chills and drenching sweats are symptoms of a medical condition involving the destruction of red blood cells. Patients with a high parasite load are in danger of developing anemia.

Anyone whose immune system is not fully functional is at higher risk of developing a more severe case of babesiosis, said Catherine Brown, state public health veterinarian at the DPH. That includes older people, those going through chemotherapy or steroid therapy, and people who have lost their spleen, she said.

"It's something that can be treated" as long as it's identified early on, Brown said. While babesiosis often occurs in conjunction with Lyme disease, its treatment is different, usually consisting of atovaquone, often used to treat pneumonia and malaria, and the antibiotic erythromycin. The good news is that in acute cases, the parasites responsible for the illness are easy to spot in blood slides, and local emergency departments are trained to look for the disease, said Dr. Sam T. Donta, an infectious disease consultant at Falmouth Hospital.

The ease of identification makes the illness more readily identifiable, unlike Lyme disease, for which "we really don't have a good trail marker" in the lab, Donta said.

Pombo said Lyme disease is still more frequently seen in Cape hospitals, with 3 cases for every one case of babesiosis or anaplasmosis, another potentially fatal disease transmitted by the deer tick. It attacks white blood cells and can cause a little spotted rash, as well as fever, chills, and headaches.

There were 140 cases of human anaplasmosis in Massachusetts confirmed by the DPH in 2011, including 31 on the Cape and Islands. The Berkshires is another hot spot for the illness, which like babesiosis originally was a veterinary disease. Anaplasmosis was 1st identified in humans only about 2 decades ago. The Berkshires had 30 cases in 2011 and 27 in 2010, which was 16 cases more than the Cape and Islands had that year.

"You will get sick pretty quickly" with anaplasmosis, Brown said. It's treated with the same antibiotics that cure Lyme disease, including doxycycline. Older people are most at risk of dying from the disease, but most patients recover, she said.

Brown said the DPH's surveillance reporting for babesiosis and anaplasmosis does not include identification of fatalities. There has been at least one death from babesiosis in recent years on the Cape.

A cause for concern is the fact that babesiosis can be transmitted through blood donations. Brown even knows of a couple of cases in which infants contracted the illness through their mother's placenta.

Blood banks are trying to develop a process to screen for the disease, with a system using DNA and antibody markers showing promise, Pombo said. In the meantime, he said, potential donors are asked during the intake process if they've ever been treated for babesiosis and are rejected if they have.

Babesiosis and anaplasmosis also are endemic in other Lyme disease zones, such as the coasts of New York, Rhode Island and Connecticut, experts say. As with Lyme disease, there is debate on whether the illnesses can become chronic. Some experts think persistent symptoms are likely indicators of chronic Lyme disease but doubt that is occurring with these other two tick-borne diseases.

But Anthony Barbet at the University of Florida has shown in animal studies the existence of recurring cases of babesiosis and anaplasmosis.

[As pointed out in the text, Cape Cod and Nantucket Island are highly endemic for babesia. The risk of infection through blood transfusion is well known (see our 2009 posting below). _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ is a bacterium that causes granulocytic anaplasmosis (GA) in humans and is transmitted by _Ixodes_ ticks.

Anaplasmosis was previously called "human granulocytic ehrlichiosis," but _Ehrlichia_ and _Anaplasma_ are different bacteria. In immunocompetent individuals, it is highly unlikely that babesia and anaplasma can become chronic, persistent infections. To diagnose a chronic infection requires consistent results of serology, detection of specific nucleic acid by PCR, and for babesia, a positive microscopy. Microscopy is the least sensitive method. - Mod.EP
