Nearly 300 suspected HFMD cases detected in Mongolia
----------------------------------------------------
Some 294 suspected hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases had been
detected in Mongolia by Monday [12 May 2008], Mongolia's national TV reported.

Mongolian officials said 134 out of the suspected 294 patients have been
hospitalized, and the others, who have milder symptoms, are quarantined at
home. There have been no reports of deaths so far.

Mongolia has set up an emergency committee headed by deputy prime minister
Miegombyn Enkhbold to take measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
Elementary schools in the country have suspended classes starting from
Monday [12 May 2008]. The 1st suspected HFMD case in Mongolia was reported
Thursday [8 May 2008] in the Mongolian capital [Ulaanbaatar].

HFMD is a common illness of infants and children and characterized by
fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters. Individual cases and
outbreaks of HFMD occur regularly worldwide, more frequently in the summer
and early autumn. In the past decade, major outbreaks of HFMD attributable
to EV71 [human enterovirus 71] have been reported in South East Asia,
including Malaysia in 1997 and Taiwan in 1998.
