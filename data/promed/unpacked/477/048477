39 people in Nyanza Province have succumbed to cholera since January
2008. More than 450 cases have been reported in hospitals in the same period.

The Nyanza Provincial Medical Officer, Dr. Jackson Kioko, said the
epidemic began in Suba and Siaya districts. "The outbreak then spread
to Homa Bay District and Kisumu," Kioko said.

He said health workers had contained the outbreak in Siaya and Rongo,
adding that Migori District was particularly hard hit with more than
10 deaths reported. "We had 30 cases last week, while a similar
number of patients are seeking treatment in various health centres in
the district," he said.

Kioko added that the influx of displaced people and feasting at
funerals contributed to the spread of cholera. "We are asking
residents to stop holding extended funerals to reduce the amount of
food prepared," he said.

The Provincial Public Health Officer, Mr. Tom Andebe, said that
improper disposal of human waste was another contributing factor.
"Only about 30 percent of residents have built pit latrines. People
defecate in bushes," he said. The official added that rain often
washed human stool into water sources.

"In areas where cholera is prevalent, residents use water from dams
and rivers without boiling it," said Andebe.

Meanwhile, a cholera outbreak has been reported in Budalang'i,
Western Province. Western Provincial Medical Officer, Dr. Onudu
Olang'o, yesterday [30 Mar 2008] said 7 people were undergoing
treatment at Port Victoria Sub-District Hospital.

Around 50 people have died in recent weeks of cholera in central
Nigeria's Benue state out of some 150 infected, the press quoted
health officials as saying Sunday [30 Mar 2008]. The Guardian and
other papers said that the state capital Makurdi was worst hit by the
disease which broke out in February 2008.

State health commissioner Jarius Erube attributed the cause of the
disease to drinking contaminated water. He advised residents to
always boil their water before drinking. He said medical officials
and drugs had been sent to the affected areas to treat the victims as
well as contain the spread of the disease.

[5] Cholera - Malawi (Blantyre)

Cholera used to occur mainly in the rainy season when contaminated
water entered the distribution system as a result of floods. Now,
there are instances of the disease throughout the year, as poor
hygiene is conducive to the spread of the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium.

Since the beginning of 2008 at least 8 people have died in a cholera
outbreak in areas around Blantyre, which is located in southern
Malawi. Up to 291 cases of cholera were reported within a 3 week
period in the region.

During a severe outbreak in 2002, more than 1000 people died of
cholera in Malawi.

The health authorities in the northern Mozambican province of Nampula
have sent more doctors to strengthen the team in the Cholera
Treatment Center (CTC), in the provincial capital, Nampula City,
reports the Wed 26 Mar 2008 issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias."

Since the Nampula cholera outbreak began Saturday [22 Mar 2008], 29
people have been diagnosed with the disease, but so far no deaths
have been reported. The head of the community health services at the
Nampula provincial health directorate, Antonio Salimo, told reporters
that "20 patients are still receiving treatment at the Nampula CTC,
and 9 others have been discharged."

It was found that most of the cholera patients come from Nampula
neighborhoods, namely Namicopo, Muatala, Muhala, and Murrapaniua.
They were suffering from a serious shortage of clean drinking water
and poor sanitation conditions.

The Health Ministry on 27 Mar 2008 reported 2 more provinces in the
north, Bac Ninh and Bac Kan, have acute diarrhea patients, raising
the number of localities with this disease to 5. Most of the
patients in Bac Ninh and Bac Kan caught acute diarrhea after eating
raw vegetables, shrimp paste or blood pudding.

Hai Phong still has the lead in the number of patients, 12, followed
by Hanoi with 9. The Health Ministry warned that acute diarrhea could
break out into an epidemic this summer and asked provinces and cities
to tighten control of food safety, especially street food and risky
foods, and to raise people's awareness of food hygiene.

5 people have died of dysentery in a remote area of Morobe Province
in Papua New Guinea. Health officials had initially thought the 5, in
a village near Bulolo and Wau, had had typhoid, but investigations
revealed it was dysentery.

The Post Courier newspaper reports the Provincial health adviser, Dr.
Likei Theo, saying that medical teams were in February 2008 sent into
the area to verify the disease and determine the causes. He says the
outbreak was caused by the village water supply being contaminated
with human and animal waste.
