To the list of potential agents, I would add _Coccidioides
immitis/posadasii_. Its natural range neatly covers the state of San
Luis Potosi
http://www.metapathogen.com/coccidioides/. It is not uncommonly
associated with construction activities
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4944a2.htm.
However, upper respiratory symptoms would be expected, which was not
noted in the current report.

Personally I would consider the bats as possible "red herrings." The
symptom of 'muscle spasm' is likely a cultural and linguistic
misunderstanding when translated into medical English. As you stated,
"A more detailed description of the clinical manifestations,
epidemiology, and laboratory data is clearly needed."

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Dassey for his contribution of
coccidioidomycosis, a fungal disease caused by _Coccidioides immitis_,
to the diagnostic possibilities for the outbreak of a febrile illness
among workers building a highway in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. _C.
immitis_ grow in the soil within a region known as the Lower Sonoran
Life Zone. This semiarid zone encompasses the southern parts of Texas,
Arizona, New Mexico, much of central and southern California, and
semiarid areas in Mexico (Hector RF, Laniado-Laborin R.
Coccidioidomycosis--a fungal disease of the Americas. PLoS Med. 2005
Jan;2(1):e2. Available at:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC545195/?tool=pubmed#pmed-0020002-b8.),
which include the northern portion of San Luis Potosi
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Potos%C3%AD#Geography). The
disease is acquired when susceptible persons inhale the arthroconidia
of _C. immitis_ present in disturbed soil.

San Luis Potosi can be located on a map of Mexico at
