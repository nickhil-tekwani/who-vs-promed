Arizona valley fever cases soar to a record high; diagnoses up 56
percent; dry weather may account for spike
-----------------------------------------------
Valley fever is at epidemic levels in Arizona, afflicting 56 percent
more people last year [2006] than in 2005. A record 5493 Arizonans
were diagnosed with the disease, but as in years past, health
officials say thousands of other cases went unreported. Health
officials are unsure what caused the increase but point to weather
changes as a possible culprit. The wet winter of 2005, followed by
many dry months in 2006, was a probable one-2 punch that has wreaked
havoc on the lungs and joints of many residents. Valley fever is an
infection in the lungs caused by a fungus, _Coccidioides immitis_,
found in soils primarily in southwestern states. The fungus
flourishes in rain, and then is stirred into the air in dry conditions.

About 60 percent of the people who inhale the micron-sized spore and
contract the disease have mild symptoms. The patients may suffer
extreme pain in joints and difficulty in breathing, and sometimes,
the infection migrates to the brain.

28 Arizonans died of valley fever in 2005; the count of deaths in
2006 was unavailable Wednesday [10 Jan 2007].

"It strikes me very much as an epidemic of valley fever," said Shoana
Anderson, program manager for the infectious-diseases division of the
Arizona Department of Health Services.

The dry months of 2006 gave valley fever spores "a field day," said
Will Humble, deputy assistant director for the DHS. "They were just
sitting there waiting for the wind." He explained further: "As the
winter soil starts to dry out, the organism spends its remaining
energy forming spores." Once the wind comes along, the spores spread quickly.

Over the years, several theories have emerged as to the cause of
valley fever, occurring most often in Arizona and other desert
states, Anderson said. "It could be the construction and increased
dust that arises," she said. Some research points to the effects of
drought and rainfall. "But I think the answer is a combination of the
above." It's unknown whether air pollution and its particulates are a factor.

One of the problems that torments patients is that valley fever is
often misdiagnosed. The patients know they are sick, but the medicine
they are given does not work. Some doctors believe their patients
have pneumonia. Once a correct diagnosis is made, "it's very
empowering for the patient; they finally know what's going on," said
Dr. John Galgiani, director of the Valley Fever Center for Excellence
at the University of Arizona and Southern Arizona VA Health Care
System in Tucson. He said physicians need to adjust their diagnosis
strategy, thinking immediately that the disease is a possibility.
Antibiotics don't work on valley fever. The most common treatment is
anti-fungal medication.

Valley fever reaches epidemic level
-----------------------------------------
According to health officials, valley fever is at epidemic levels in
Arizona, afflicting 56 percent more people last year [2006] than in
2005. Cases were already breaking records last May 2006. A study at
that time showed that one in every 3 Arizonans diagnosed with
pneumonia actually had valley fever [coccidiomycosis]. Last June
[2006], governor Janet Napolitano freed up USD 50 000 to fight the
valley fever outbreak by educating doctors. Nearly 5500 Arizonans
were diagnosed with valley fever in 2006, the most ever. Valley fever
is an infection in the lungs caused by a fungus. That fungus is found
primarily in the desert, and it grows and flourishes when the desert
is rainy and wet.

It's found in the soil and, on a day when it's windy and dry, the
spores spread. We actually live near the epicenter for this disease.
Throw in the desert climate and a growing population and "there are
more cases in Arizona than anywhere else in the country, and about
half of the cases in the U.S. come out of Maricopa County," says Galgiani.

Symptoms of valley fever include chest pain, weight loss, rashes,
and, most often, fatigue. The exhaustion can linger for months. Very
seldom, it can lead to other complications that may require life-long therapy.

[ProMED reported 623 cases of coccidiomycosis in 1995, compared to
the 5493 cases reported here, a 10-fold increase in 11 years. The
point raised that the increase may be due to an increasing population
settled in an endemic area is interesting, and we will be happy to
post any data on demographic development in the area over the past
decades. - Mod.EP]
