Even as Kolkata [West Bengal] reels under a dengue outbreak, a new virus is on the prowl and has laid hundreds low with fever, body ache, and respiratory distress. Human metapneumovirus, which is activated by a sudden temperature drop, is active in the city, say experts. Like other seasonal viruses, this one too spreads through cough and sneeze droplets.

The sporadic showers since last week [week of 2 Oct 2017] have cooled the city by a couple of degrees, a condition which is ideal for viruses to thrive, according to Arindam Biswas, senior consultant, general medicine, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS).

Metapneumo[virus], it seems, is the most prevalent this time. The typical symptoms are high fever, body ache, respiratory trouble and fatigue. It affects all age groups, but children and the elderly are more vulnerable. Those suffering from cardiac ailments or high blood sugar could have very severe symptoms due to their low immunity.

Public places like buses, trains, auditoria, and classrooms are ideal locations for the spread of the virus, said Debashish Saha, consultant, AMRI Hospital. "It spreads through sneeze and cough droplets that often collect on bus handles, chairs, window sills, and handkerchiefs. So, hand hygiene is very important. Hands should be washed regularly and tissues should be used instead of handkerchiefs," said Saha.

With schools shut for vacation, the spread has been checked among children so far, said Shantanu Ray, paediatrician. "But once the vacation ends, a spurt is imminent. Children are obviously less careful and so more susceptible to infections due to their low immunity. Metapneumo[virus] leads to respiratory problems in some children and there have been cases where hospitalization was required," said Ray.

With symptoms similar to those of dengue, physicians have often been left confused. Like dengue, metapneumo[virus], too, kicks off with high fever and body ache. In many cases, it has been leading to diarrhoea. "Symptoms have been overlapping with dengue, which too has changed symptoms this season. Previously, dengue never caused diarrhoea, but now it is common. Dengue type 2 and type 4 have been common this year [2017] and both are life-threatening. So, we are taking no chances and recommending a blood test even if we suspect it's a virus like rhino or metapneumo[virus]," said Biswas.

Unlike dengue, metapneumovirus is always accompanied by a respiratory infection. Asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] patients, those suffering from chest infection and children are more vulnerable, according to Irfaan Akhtar, head of microbiology and infection control, Fortis Hospital. "While fever and body ache are the most common dengue symptoms, in the case of metapneumo[virus] it is always accompanied by coughing and wheezing. For those with a history of chest ailments, the symptoms are likely to be more severe," said Akhtar.

But like most other seasonal viruses, metapneumo[virus] too, can be countered with just paracetamol and symptomatic treatment. Antibiotics are not recommended unless there is an accompanying bacterial infection. "Bacterial infections are rare but could lead to severe complications. But seasonal viruses usually recede with time and rest," said Biswas.

[Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an RNA-enveloped virus. hMPV infection is seasonal and occurs in all age groups. hMPV is second only to respiratory syncytial virus as an identifiable cause of lower respiratory tract disease in children. Seropositivity rate approaches 100 percent by age 10 years in several populations studied. Reinfection occurs in adults and outbreaks of severe illness have occurred among elderly persons in long-term care facilities. hMPV may be particularly severe in the elderly and in the immunocompromised. The illness may be asymptomatic or range from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to a lower respiratory tract infection that can be complicated by life-threatening bronchiolitis and pneumonia.

hMPV can be identified in clinical specimens by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR assays for respiratory viruses, including hMPV, may be available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2045291/ and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.20725/full). How the diagnosis of hMPV infection was made in Kolkata patients is not specified in the news report above.
