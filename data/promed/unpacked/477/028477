Varroa mites may be in the Southern Island, NZ
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has imposed movement
controls on bees and hives in North Canterbury after the tiny pest,
capable of destroying whole bee colonies, was detected in
laboratory tests on Friday.
The suspected discovery at an Oxford apiary threatens to cost the
economy more than $300 million over the next 30 years.
The MAF varroa programme co-ordinator Paul Bolger said more
tests were being done to confirm whether the mite had reached the
South Island. Mr Bolger, who hoped further results would be in
tonight, said MAF had no idea how big the problem was. "At the
moment we're not even 100 percent certain we have an
occurrence. The next 24 hours are nerve-racking, until we get our
results and we can tell where we're at."
It was possible the positive test was because of contamination from
previous tests. The mite has already ripped through the North
Island, being first found in 2000.
Varroa, a reddish-brown, oval mite 1mm to 2mm long, is found on
the outside of adult honey bees, is not dangerous to humans and
does not affect honey. Widespread around the world, it attacks
honey bees and their larvae, and wipes out hives by killing the bees
needed to pollinate pastures and crops.

[The varroa mite (_Varroa jacobsoni_) was first discovered
infesting Asian honey bees (_Apis cerana_) in Java; subsequently
this dreaded parasitic infection spread to European honey bees
(_Apis mellifera_), and was discovered in Europe in about 1970
and then in the USA in 1987. Mite eggs are laid in sealed brood
cells and the resultant nymphs feed on bee pupae destined to
become worker bees. Infestations are spread from colony to
colony by fertilized female mites attached to bees. Infestations can
cause colony extinction within 3-4 years if no control measures are
undertaken. Varroa mites transmit viruses to honey bees, such as
Black Queen-cell virus, Sacbrood virus, and Acute bee-paralysis
virus.
Considerably more information on this possible outbreak of varroa
mites in the Southern Island can be found by logging onto the web
site of The New Zealand Herald (see above) and using their search
facilities for varroa. - Mod.MS]
