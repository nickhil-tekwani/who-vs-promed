PEAK INFECTIOUS DISEASES GROUP CALLS FOR ACTION AS WHOOPING COUGH CASES
REACH 7000
Australia's peak infectious diseases watchdog, the Communicable Diseases
Network of Australia and New Zealand (CDNANZ), has urged parents to ensure
that their children are immunised against whooping cough following the
release of figures that show an alarming increase in the disease.
According to the National Centre for Disease Control in the Commonwealth
Department of Health and Family Services, the number of whooping cough
cases reported in Australia to 11 November this year is 6,996.
The Chair of the CDNANZ, Dr Graham Rouch, said today these alarming figures
were a further indication of Australia's inadequate immunisation rate. This
has left many children unprotected from the effects of major disease
outbreaks such as the current epidemic of whooping cough in Australia and
put at increased risk the very young before they can be adequately immunised.
"We are in the grip of a national epidemic of whooping cough. To have 7000
cases of an easily preventable disease such as this in Australia today is
disappointing," Dr Rouch said.
"Quite simply we must have a greater number of our children immunised. We
are very concerned at this high number of cases of what is a preventable
disease. The best way to protect your family, particularly young children,
is to ensure that they are fully immunised.
"The Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Michael Wooldridge, has
been passionate in his support for the campaign to have 90 per cent
immunisation coverage of Australian children by the year 2000. That is a
message we must all embrace if we are to see a reduction in this very high
number of whooping cough cases."
For the period 15 October to 11 November there were a staggering 1,034
cases of whooping cough reported to health authorities in Australia. That
four-week period represented almost one-quarter of all the reported
whooping cough cases in 1996.
There have been nine deaths from whooping cough in the past 13 months. Six
were in New South Wales and one each in Queensland, Victoria and Western
Australia. In the previous 20 years there were 21 deaths. Dr Rouch said
serious bouts of whooping cough have been occurring in Australia every
three or four years and that one in every 200 whooping cough patients under
the age of six months dies from pneumonia or brain damage.
"The tragic side of this current situation is that these eight children
were too young to be adequately immunised but could have been protected if
there was better vaccination coverage in the community," he said.
Pertussis, or whooping cough, is characterised by episodes of coughing
followed by a gasp that results in a "whoop" sound. Not all children
'whoop' and vomiting often follows a coughing spasm.
Vaccination against whooping cough is recommended at two months of age,
four months, six months, 18 months and prior to school entry (four to five
years old). Vaccines are readily available from general practitioners,
local councils and community health centres.
Parents, general practitioners, day care centres, pre-schools and community
services need to make every effort to ensure that all children are fully
immunised.
