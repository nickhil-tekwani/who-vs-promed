Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments:
1. San Luis, Pampanga - Tilapia fingerlings were monitored for RSIV and TiLV using PCR. The results were positive for TiLV. Neither mortality nor clinical signs were observed on the farm. The population was retested and showed negative results. No control measures were applied.
2. Guagua, Pampanga - Tilapia grow-out were monitored for RSIV and TiLV using PCR. The results were positive for TiLV. Neither mortality nor clinical signs were observed on the farm. The population was retested and showed negative results. No control measures were applied.
3. Tanauan, Batangas - Tilapia grow-out were monitored for bacterial infection, parasitic and viral infection (Irido, VNN, and TiLV). Clinical signs were exhibited such as bulging of eyes, distended abdomen and erratic swimming. The population was harvested for consumption. No reports of mortality were noted after restocking.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Fisheries Laboratory (National laboratory) / Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 14 Mar 2018 / Positive
National Fisheries Laboratory (National laboratory) / Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 15 Mar 2018 / Positive
National Fisheries Laboratory (National laboratory) / Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 29 Sep 2018 / Positive

["Tilapines, comprising more than 100 species, are the 2nd most import group of farmed fish worldwide after carp. Global production is estimated at 4.5 million metric tons with a current value in excess of 7.5 billion USD. In some regions they are ecologically important (algae and mosquito control and habitat maintenance for shrimp farming) and an important wild capture species. Introduction of the virus has been shown to cause significant mortality (up to 90%) and thus result in serious economic losses to both farmers and fishers."
