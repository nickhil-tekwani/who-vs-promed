Influenza A Virus (H5N1) Outbreak in Hong Kong S.A.R. - WHO Update 2
--------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 27 Feb 2003, no further cases of human influenza A(H5N1) have
been reported in Hong Kong S.A.R. (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_20/en/>)

To date the current outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong S.A.R. has
been limited to 2 cases, one of whom has died. Both cases were members of
the same family who returned to their home in Hong Kong S.A.R. on 8 Feb
2003 after travelling to Fujian province, China. The mother and children
were in mainland China for 14 days; the father for 9 days.
The father of the family (a 33-year-old man) developed respiratory symptoms
on 7 Feb 2003 whilst in Fujian Province, China. He was admitted to hospital
in Hong Kong S.A.R. on 11 Feb 2003 with pneumonia but died on 17 Feb 2003.
Influenza A virus (H5N1) was isolated from post-mortem specimens on 20 Feb
2003. The man's 9-year-old son also became unwell whilst in Fujian
province. He was admitted to hospital in Hong Kong S.A.R on 12 Feb 2003
with pneumonia. Influenza A virus (H5N1) was isolated from 2 nasopharyngeal
aspirates taken from the boy on 19 Feb 2003. The boy is in a stable
condition. Additional family members have also had respiratory symptoms.
The boy's 8-year-old sister died on 4 Feb 2003 whilst the family was in
Fujian Province, China. The cause of her death is under investigation. The
mother has now recovered from what was thought to have been a parainfluenza
virus infection.
An outbreak of atypical pneumonia occurred between November 2002 and
February 2003 in Guandong province, China. Health authorities in China
investigated the outbreak and identified _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ as the
causative agent. The Ministry of Health in Beijing has informed WHO that
the outbreak in Guandong is over and that there is no evidence of a link
between the outbreak in Guandong and the H5N1 cases in Hong Kong SAR.
The Department of Health in Hong Kong S.A.R has intensified its
surveillance for influenza among patients with influenza-like symptoms or
atypical pneumonia. No unusual increase in influenza activity has been
detected over the past few weeks. WHO is continuing to work closely with
health authorities in Beijing, China and Hong Kong S.A.R. Reagents for
laboratory diagnosis of influenza A(H5N1) virus have been made available to
the Ministry of Health in Beijing, the National Influenza Centres, and
other members of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network.
