SED outbreak in China threatens 4.83 million hectares of wheat
---------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of sharp eyespot disease (SED), which affects cereals, is
threatening 72.46 million mu (4.83 million hectares) of wheat in
China's major producing regions, according to local agricultural authorities.

SED might erode the wheat output by 10 to 20 percent, while a more
serious epidemic could cut output by as much as 50 percent, officials
from the Henan Oil and Grain Product Quality Inspection Center told
Interfax. "As it is still the early growth stage for wheat, the
impact on output might be reduced, although wheat quality may be
downgraded," an official from the center said. Huang Junfei, a senior
commodity analyst with Changjiang Futures, believes SED may well
erode wheat output by around 5 percent on the 4.8 million affected
hectares. As there are still a few months before the harvest, good
farm work may be able to make up the losses.

The outbreak is being blamed on remnants of the disease from last
year [2007], coupled with favourable conditions, including plentiful
water supplies in some regions and weakened resistance caused by a
cold snap earlier this year [2008]. Agricultural authorities caution
that the peak season for SED normally lasts from mid and late March
until mid April. SED outbreaks in major wheat producing regions by 10
Mar [2008] include [in decreasing order of affected area] Henan,
Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and Shanxi provinces.

China's wheat cultivation in 2008 is expected to stay flat at around
23 million hectares with output expected to top 100 million tonnes.

[Sharp eyespot disease (SED) of wheat is caused by the soil-borne
fungus _Ceratobasidium cereale_ (previously _Rhizoctonia cerealis_).
The pathogen can also affect barley, oats, rye, and some grass
species and is prevalent throughout the temperate regions of the
world. Symptoms are sharply defined lesions on the outer leaf sheaths
and the stem. Lesions near the base of the stem have sharply defined
dark margins and are lens shaped. Infected plants or tillers ripen
and die prematurely producing white heads with shriveled kernels, and
they often collapse. Infections are most serious when initiated on
seedlings. Seedlings may be killed, or they may survive through the
season and die before maturity. SED frequently occurs in combination
with other fungal diseases.

The fungus can be spread with plant material and soil, as mycelium or
as small resistant structures (sclerotia). While it is common, the
damage is very dependent on the environment. SED is favoured by cool,
wet conditions from late winter through early spring and often occurs
around wet spots. Acidic soils increase disease risk. Rye and oats
appear more susceptible than wheat or barley. SED can be severe on
wheat when it follows more susceptible crops. Yield loss is related
to disease incidence. It is considered negligible when the incidence
is below 10 percent, but it can be considerable under conducive
conditions. Losses are due to reductions in both grain numbers on
ears and grain weight. Disease management relies mainly on cultural
practices, including improvement of plant vigour, reduction of
inoculum, good drainage, and crop rotation with non-host species.
Fungicide treatments are usually not considered reliable or cost effective.

There is little information on cultivar resistance, although some
wheat varieties appear to differ in their susceptibility to SED. In
China, variation in resistance between cultivars was reported to
range from highly resistant to highly susceptible, but only 4-7
percent of all wheat lines tested, and as few as 1.7 percent of
commercial cultivars were found to be resistant.

A disease with similar symptoms, known as eyespot or strawbreaker, is
caused by an unrelated fungus in a different family (_Oculimacula yallundae_).
