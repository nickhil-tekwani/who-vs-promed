The Department of Health (DOH) said that the 4th confirmed polio case in the country was a 3-year-old girl from Sultan Kudarat. Health Undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo said that the girl visited the Maguindanao province for a month but is actually a resident of Sultan Kudarat.

"It is uncertain where the virus came from in the 2 areas," said Domingo in an interview. The health official also noted that the girl did not receive an oral polio vaccine.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed the 4th polio case in the Philippines in a statement Tuesday [5 Nov 2019] evening. "The test conducted by our Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and the National Institute of Infectious Disease - Japan confirms the 4th polio case in the country," he said.

Last week, the health department confirmed the 3rd polio case that involved a 4-year-old girl from Datu Piang in Maguindanao. In September [2019], 2 confirmed cases of polio were also reported -- a 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur and a 5-year-old boy from Laguna.

"At present, the DOH is implementing a targeted vaccination campaign for all children aged below 5 years old in the municipalities of the 3rd and 4th cases," said Duque. Moreover, the health chief reminded parents on the 2nd round of polio immunization campaign, which will cover the whole of Mindanao starting [25 Nov 2019].

"We can defeat polio, but we need the public to trust and actively participate in our immunization programs," said Duque. Duque reiterated that the best way to prevent the polio disease is through vaccination. "Handwashing will also help in the prevention," he added.

[First, apologies are due. Yesterday's post originally erroneously identified the known location of this 4th case to be Maguindanao, due to an editing error, as Mindanao is not considered a first administrative region. As it turns out, it is unclear where the actual transmission of the virus occurred -- either Maguindanao or Sultan Kudarat, both areas in the southern part of the Philippines -- in Mindanao.

Not surprisingly, the profile of the case is a never-vaccinated child.

A map of the Philippines showing provinces can be found at http://mapsof.net/philippines/philippines-regions-and-provinces. The provinces of Maguindanao and Sultan Kudarat are located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Mindanao.
