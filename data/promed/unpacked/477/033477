A 22-year-old pregnant woman has died of bird flu in Viet Nam,
hospital sources said Tue [31 Jul 2007], bringing the death toll in
the country to 3 in less than 2 months. The woman, who lived in Ha
Tay province outside the capital Hanoi, died on Sat [28 Jul 2007]
after being admitted a week before for treatment, said a source at a
Hanoi hospital who asked not to be named. "Tests were positive for
the H5N1 virus," the source said, adding that the woman had been 7
months pregnant.

Her death brings to 45 the number of people who have died of bird flu
in Viet Nam since 2003. Two people -- a 20-year-old man and a
28-year-old woman -- died in June 2007 of avian influenza, the 1st
fatalities announced since November 2005. Since May [2007], 6 human
cases have been reported here, 3 of them fatal.
Communist Viet Nam, once the nation worst hit by bird flu, contained
earlier outbreaks through mass [poultry] vaccination campaigns, the
culling of millions of poultry and public education initiatives. But
the virus has come back strongly this year [2007], hitting scores of
poultry farms in an unusual summertime outbreak. Outbreaks have been
reported since early May 2007 across 18 of Viet Nam's 64 provinces
and municipalities, mostly among unvaccinated ducks and other waterfowl.
In June 2007, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung told local officials to
keep a close watch on the situation, warning that they would be held
responsible if outbreaks of bird flu devastated their areas. After
authorities stepped up calls for vigilance, the agriculture ministry
recently reported that only 3 provinces were still battling the problem.
As of 25 Jul 2007, the World Health Organization had recorded 319
cases of bird flu in humans worldwide, 192 of which were fatal. The
Geneva-based body has yet to confirm the last 3 deaths in Viet Nam.

A Vietnamese woman who was 7 months pregnant has died of bird flu,
the country's 3rd human death from the virus this year [2007],
doctors say. "She died on Saturday [28 Jul 2007]," said Doctor Tran
Thuy Hanh, chief of the Bach Mai hospital, where the 22-year-old
woman was taken last week from a farm in the northern province of Ha
Tay, the largest poultry supplier to Hanoi. Hanh gave no further
details of the woman, who had been confirmed to have contracted the
H5N1 virus by laboratory tests in Viet Nam.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has not confirmed she had bird
flu, which killed a 28-year-old woman from northern Viet Nam last
month [June 2007]. A doctor in Ha Tay province said there were no
bird flu outbreaks in the area where the latest victim lived. "It
made [it] difficult to pin down how she became infected," he said.
"Earlier, she bought a chicken leg of unknown origin for a meal in
the family, but nobody else got sick."
Ten people who came into contact with the woman have been monitored
for any symptoms and given the anti-viral Tamiflu as a preventive
measure, while her house was disinfected, the doctor from the
provincial Preventive Medicine Centre told Reuters.
Bird flu has killed 45 of the 99 confirmed cases in Viet Nam since
late 2003, including the latest death.
Globally, the H5N1 virus has killed 192 people out of 319 known
cases, according to a WHO tally. Hundreds of millions of birds have
died or been slaughtered. The H5N1 virus remains mainly a virus of
birds, but experts fear it could mutate into a form easily
transmitted from person to person and sweep the world, killing millions.

[According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 25 Jul 2007,
there have been 95 human cases of avian influenza H5N1 virus
infection in Viet Nam since late 2003 and 42 fatalities. As of 31 Jul
2007, the Vietnamese authorities have recorded 99 cases and 45
fatalities. The 3 most recent cases in Viet Nam have still to be
confined officially by WHO. If confirmed, the global total of cases
will become 322, including 195 deaths.
The circumstances of the exposure of the latest case are unclear, but
there is a suggestion of contact with infected poultry.
