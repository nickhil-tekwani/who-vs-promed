Clarification of Case Number
----------------------------
There are now 9 patients in Monroe, Louisiana whose sera showed positive on
IgM tests for "Flavivirus." The test does not differentiate between
antibodies to West Nile virus and St Louis encephalitis virus. More testing
is underway to confirm these tests. The impression is that these will turn
out to be St Louis encephalitis virus.
The number 16 cited in "Viral encephalitis - USA (Louisiana) (03)
20010814.1918" was the number of samples submitted for testing; except for
these 9 "cases," all other sera turned out negative. Additional sera are
being submitted. As usual in the case of an outbreak, sera are being
submitted from individuals who have a low probability of turning out to be
"positive." An investigation is being done now.
