Lets widen the argument to bone grafts. Anyone like to comment?

Subject: CJD through transplanted cornea?
Very recently, The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan recommended that
the use of human dura mater grafts from several companies should be stopped,
because they found the relationship between the occurrence of CJD and the
usage of human dura mater graft in neurosurgical areas.
According to the book of APIC, the transmission of the prion might be
occurred also through the transplanted cornea.
Can anyone show me the reports indicating the risk of the usage of the
transplanted cornea on the occurrence of sporadic CJD in the world?

From: tom pringle <tom@cyber-dyne.com>
I tracked down the citation for CJD possibly associated with a pericardium
transplant: Progressive fatal dementia (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) in a
patient who received homograft tissue for tympanic membrane closure.
Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol 247 (4): 199-201 (1990) Tange RA, Troost D,
Limburg M Department of Otolaryngology, U. Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
We report the case history of a 54-year-old man who developed a fatal
neurological disorder 4 years after a successful tympanoplasty with
homograft pericardium. The final diagnosis of this case was
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This infectious spongiform encephalopathy is
probably caused by a slow virus that can be transmitted by transplantation
materials. The possible accidental transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease
by the use of homograft materials in otologic surgery is discussed.
AND
Dr. Allen Goldenthal of New Zealand has just sent me a thoughtful and
detailed review article on BSE and CJD, too long to reprint here. I have it
posted at www.mad-cow.org/goldenthal.html.
Some excerpts along the lines of recent listserve discussion:
"In Japan, a 38-year-old woman developed neurological deficits in her 20th
week of pregnancy.(46) A cesarean was performed in the 30th week. The baby
was not breast-fed and he is now 6 years old. His mother died 3 y after the
onset of signs and CJD was diagnosed. Specimens of her amniotic fluid,
placenta, blood, and umbilical cord blood were taken, along with samples of
her milk. Brain tissue was taken at postmortem. These materials were
injected intracerebrally into BALB/c mice. The following were found to be
infective; brain tissue, umbilical cord leukocytes, and the milk (colostrum). "
