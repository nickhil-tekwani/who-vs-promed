[During the week 20-25 May, OIE held its 80th Annual Session in Paris. According to the follow-up reports of the 7 countries addressed in item 1 above, SBV was discussed during the Session, apparently concluding that the disease is not considered any longer an emerging disease in Western Europe. SBV, a new disease entity, is not included in OIE's list of reportable diseases. If it is not considered "emerging", there is no obligation to submit reports about its incidence. Links to the web-sits of the respective countries are available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/sbv; we shall try to follow-up their future reports.

It will be interesting to obtain details on the discussions which led to OIE's above conclusion, and to follow OIE's future policy regarding SBV control, diagnosis and any international trade requirements, as well as on reporting from regions outside Western Europe, should it occur. The SBV situation during 2012 vector season in Europe is anticipated with great interest.

Germany's continued reporting on the recent cases is commendable. During the 80th session, the CVO of Germany, Dr Karin Schwabenbauer, was elected as OIE's president for the coming 3 years; our congratulations and wishes for success.- Mod.AS.
