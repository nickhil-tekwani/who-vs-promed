[Infection with infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus means infection with the pathogenic agent Salmonid Novirhabdovirus (also known as infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus [IHNV]) of the genus _Novirhabdovirus_ and Family Rhabdoviridae.

IHNV affects most species of salmonid fish reared in fresh water or sea water. The principal clinical and economic consequences of IHN occur on farms rearing rainbow trout, where acute outbreaks can result in very high mortality. However, both Pacific and Atlantic salmon can be severely affected.

IHNV has been detected in North America, Asia, and Europe, but not in the Southern Hemisphere. Countries reporting confirmed or suspect cases of IHN to the OIE include: Austria, Belgium, Canada, China (People's Rep. of), Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and United States of America. Infections and overt disease have been reported among fish reared in both fresh and sea water.
