The state [California], in response to increasing rates of syphilis, is urging expanded screening for the sexually transmitted infection, especially among those who are pregnant and those who have high-risk factors such as multiple partners.

"In 2018, 329 babies with congenital syphilis were reported in California, representing a 900% increase from 2012, and a magnitude of (congenital syphilis [CS]) burden not observed since 1995," the new state guidance says. "In response to this alarming rise, the California Department of Public Health recognized an urgent need to expand syphilis detection among people who are or could become pregnant in order to ensure detection, timely treatment, and subsequent CS prevention."

Humboldt County has reported spikes in syphilis rates as well.

"Locally, Humboldt County saw syphilis increase 450% in females age 15-44; from 2016 (2 cases) to 2020 (11 cases) with a total incidence of 42 syphilis cases over that time," an email from Humboldt County Health Officer Dr Ian Hoffman to local providers states. "Additionally, in 2020, Humboldt County reported a case of congenital syphilis for the 1st time in over a decade."

The new screening guidelines urge testing of pregnant individuals in the 1st and 3rd trimester as well as people who have high-risk factors, which includes multiple partners in the past year, having an STI [sexually transmitted infection] in the past year, or having sex while using drugs or alcohol, the CDPH [California Department of Public Health] said.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause long-term health problems including brain disease. It also can increase transmission or acquisition of HIV. Congenital syphilis is a condition that is passed on during pregnancy or childbirth. According to CDPH, congenital syphilis can cause "premature birth, low birth weight, birth defects, blindness, and hearing loss."

The most recent data available from California Health and Human Services states there were 28 cases of early syphilis found in Humboldt County residents. In 2010, there were 12 cases and in 2001 there were zero cases, the agency data states. Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Christine Messenger on Tuesday [11 May 2021] said there were 49 cases in 2019, 33 cases in 2020 and as of March 2021, there have been 12 cases.

Fliers promoting safe sex distributed through the county urge residents "don't hook up with syphilis," a reference to the use of hookup apps and the spread of the infection. "We can definitely confirm that hookups contribute to the spread of STDs, and we have had fewer cases of STDs diagnosed in 2020," Supervising Public Health Nurse Hava Phillips told the Times-Standard via email. "Whether that was because fewer people were having sex or fewer were getting tested, either way, we think that is related to COVID."

[According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2018 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/syphilis.htm), after reaching a historic low in 2000 and 2001, the rate of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most contagious stages of syphilis, "has increased almost every year since 2001. This rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis has been primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM account for the majority of P&S syphilis cases, and estimated rates are substantially higher among MSM, compared with women or men who have sex with women only (MSW). The number of cases among MSM has continued to increase, but within the last 5 years, cases among MSW and women have increased substantially as well."

"Although rates of P&S syphilis are lower among women, rates have increased substantially in recent years, increasing 30.0% during 2018-2019 and 178.6% during 2015-2019, suggesting the heterosexual syphilis epidemic continues to rapidly increase." (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis)

The increase in syphilis among women is of particular concern because it is associated with a striking and concurrent increase in congenital syphilis. "The 2013 rate of congenital syphilis (9.2 cases per 100,000 live births) marked the 1st increase in congenital syphilis since 2008. Since 2013, the rate of congenital syphilis has increased each year. In 2019, 1870 cases of congenital syphilis were reported." (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis)

In 2019, the most common missed congenital syphilis prevention opportunity was a lack of adequate maternal syphilis treatment despite receipt of a timely syphilis diagnosis (40.2%). The 2nd most common missed congenital syphilis prevention opportunity in 2019 was a lack of timely prenatal care and subsequent lack of timely syphilis testing (36.3%). (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis)

During 2014-2018, the proportion of primary and secondary syphilis cases that reported injection drug use within the past 12 months doubled among women and MSW but decreased slightly among MSM cases (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/syphilis2018/Syphilis-Surveillance-Supplement-2014-2018_Slide-Notes_January-2020.pdf). The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially cocaine crack, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification.

Humboldt County, with a population of 132 646 residents in 2010, is a densely forested mountainous and rural county in the U.S. state of California, located along the Pacific coast, about 270 miles (435 km) north of San Francisco; its county seat is the city of Eureka (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_County,_California).
