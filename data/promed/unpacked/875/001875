The zoo in the Indian capital Delhi has been temporarily closed after at least 9 birds died of suspected bird flu. Zoo officials have said tests on 2 of the carcasses had confirmed H5N1 avian influenza. The other bodies have also been sent for testing.

The zoo curator said that the zoo was only shut as a precautionary measure and would reopen in a few days. Curator, Riaz Khan, told reporters that the casualties included ducks, pelicans and painted storks.

Delhi's zoo is one of the biggest in India, and has an estimated 2.2 million visitors every year.

This incident marks the 2nd time the Delhi zoo has been shut over a health scare this year [2016]. In May [2016], it was closed for a few days after 46 of its spotted deer died of rabies.
