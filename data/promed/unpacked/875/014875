Sri Lanka
- National. 23 Dec 2017. Sri Lanka has been facing an unprecedented outbreak of dengue fever. Sri Lanka is a tropical country with 2 monsoon seasons. With each monsoon brings in 2 peaks of dengue fever making it an endemic disease in Sri Lanka. However, 2017 started with an exceptionally high number of dengue cases which shot up to an outbreak in May-June 2017, creating the largest dengue outbreak experienced by the country in the past 3 decades.

In the last 11 months of 2017, a total of 174 889 suspected dengue cases have been reported to the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Sri Lanka, with over 320 deaths.

About 42 per cent of dengue cases were reported from the Western province. The highest numbers of dengue cases were reported during the 29th week of 2017 [week of 17 Jul 2017]. All 4 virus types of dengue have been seen in Sri Lanka. The current outbreak is due mainly to dengue fever virus type 2 (DEN-2), which is not the usual type circulating in Sri Lanka. According to the WHO, this is a 4.3 times higher than the average number of cases for the same period between 2010 and 2016.

- Assam. 23 Dec 2017. Cases of dengue are still being reported in Assam though the virus should have petered out by now. Last year, the state recorded 5370 dengue cases during the entire season, but this year 4873 cases have been reported in the state till [11 Dec 2017] and Kamrup (metro) alone witnessed 4405 cases.
https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/north-east/dengue-still-prevalent-in-assam-195594
- Goa (Vasco). 3 Dec 2017. 65 cases in November 2017 alone, 5 confirmed 14 suspected cases from Khariwado locality.
https://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/Vasco-records-sharp-rise-in-dengue-cases-/123493.html
- Punjab/Haryana (Chandigarh). 18 Dec 2017. More than one strain of dengue virus identified in patients this year [2017]. According to health officials, presence of new and multiple strains makes management of the diseases more difficult. PGI [Postgraduate Institute] doctors said that the presence of 2 strains could have been the reason of large number of dengue cases in the city this year. Chandigarh recorded more than 1000 cases of dengue this year, during the summer and monsoon, with the incidence tapering off as the temperature dropped.
"For the 1st time, the city has reported 2 dengue strains," Dr Gaurav Aggarwal, Chandigarh's anti-malaria officer told Chandigarh Newsline. "The same has been reported for the region as well," he added.

- Tamil Nadu. 28 Dec 2017. Dengue death toll in Tamil Nadu now 63. The fever audit by the health department confirmed that at least 10 people who died in Tamil Nadu in the past 2 months had tested positive for dengue. With this, the number of deaths in this year's [2017] outbreak has climbed to 63. Public health officials said the toll is likely to go up as 4 other cases are still pending investigation. Director of public health K Kolandaisamy, however, maintained that the outbreak has been contained.

- Maharashtra. 19 Dec 2017. Public health and family welfare minister Dr Deepak Sawant said on [18 Dec 2017] that the state government recorded over 6800 dengue cases and 7100 malaria cases till November end. No deaths due to dengue were reported in Vidarbha, but in other parts of the state, 34 succumbed to dengue. "The state has 38 laboratories, of which 10 are in Vidarbha. The areas where dengue cases are found in more numbers, more labs would be opened there."

- Maharashtra (Nagpur). 9 Dec 2017. Nagpur Municipal Corporation's Malaria and Filaria Department records show that the city has recorded a total of 22 dengue cases between January and August 2017 and 165 cases between September and November. Usually, September and October are the peak season for dengue, while the virus spread tends to cool down in November. But this year [2017], it has exhibited strange behaviour, with November registering 50 cases, while last November [2016] there were only 12 cases. This is also the 1st time there has been no mortality in the city due to dengue. One patient succumbed to dengue in 2016, 2 in 2015, 4 in 2014, one in 2013, and 3 in 2012.

Germany ex Egypt (Hurghada, Red Sea). 5 Dec 2017.
Like previously reported from Belgium and Austria (see archive 20171202.5478708), 4 cases of dengue fever acquired in Egypt were recently notified in Germany: the adult travelers had spent between 1 and 3 weeks in the Hurghada area (one in private lodgings in Hurghada, one in a beach hotel between Hurghada and El Gouna, one in a hotel near Hurghada airport, one with place of lodging yet unspecified) in the period [19 Sep to 3 Nov 2017]. 2 cases are known to have undertaken day trips: case 1 was on 3 trips on the water off El Gouna/Hurghada and one into the nearby desert to a tourist-accessible Bedouin camp; case 2 reported trips to the old town of Hurghada (mosquito bites recalled) and to the Sakala area. All 4 developed symptoms of dengue fever between [5 Oct and 5 Nov 2017] and were diagnosed by the presence of NS1-antigen (2x) or IgM (2x). A 5th case patient potentially infected in Egypt and diagnosed by NS1-antigen test is an adult Egyptian national, who was hospitalized with dengue fever in Germany in the same time period. Place of residence in Egypt and travel history between Egypt and Germany are unknown and the patient is no longer reachable for questions.

Additional infections in travelers easily could go undiagnosed if dengue virus infection is not considered in the differential diagnosis due to lack of history of dengue fever in tourist areas of Egypt. Since 2001, only 2 isolated cases of dengue fever in adults acquired in Egypt were notified in Germany: one case in June 2015 was diagnosed by NS1-antigen test -- the affected traveler had spent time in the Marsa Alam area on the Southern Red Sea coast. A prior potential case from October 2007, diagnosed only by a single IgM result, was in a traveler undertaking a Nile river cruise.

[2] Vaccination update
Date: Sun 31 Dec 2017
Source: Express Tribune [edited]
https://tribune.com.pk/story/1597100/1-green-signal-dengue-vaccine-import-allowed/


The registration board of the drug regulator after reviewing the cases of dengue vaccine reaction among children in the Philippines and subsequent advisories has allowed its import terming it safe if used in line with recommended guidelines.

The Philippines earlier this month [December 2017] had suspended the vaccine drive ordering an investigation into the immunisation of more than 730 000 children following some reported deaths and an announcement by the French drug manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur that it could worsen the disease in some cases. The company had published clinical trial data showing that its dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, could have unintended consequences in patients who had never been infected with the mosquitoborne virus.

US made dengue vaccine 100 per cent effective in small study. Consequently the process of import in Pakistan was also halted. Pakistan, one of the countries where a large number of dengue cases with deaths are reported, had registered the vaccine 3 months ago on the request of provinces, especially Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa where dengue outbreak had claimed more than 67 lives. In Karachi alone more that 3000 were affected with about 12 deaths.

Health experts were skeptical of its efficacy as there are at least 4 different strains of the virus in Pakistan and hence the vaccine loses its efficiency suggesting source reduction for mosquitoes remain the key. However, the registration board meeting [Fri 29 Dec 2017] reviewed the Philippines case and the World Health Organisation reports and guidelines.

The board approved its import and on [18 Apr 2017] will review again the latest situation. Officials said the vaccine is not for routine immunisation and only used for the passive vaccination meaning patients who already have suffered and recovered from dengue are administered the vaccine to cure them from subsequent exposure.

The vaccine is used in 17 dengue affected countries including Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Philippines, and Pakistan has allowed its import in line with WHO rules, said DRAP [Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan] Registration Board director Dr Obaidullah. It will not be used for routine immunisation as was done in the Philippines which caused side affects or reactions, he said, only affected population [with a] prior history of infection will be allowed to [have it] administered, as per WHO rules.

[3] Research
Date: Thu 7 Dec 2017
Source: Phys.org, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health report [edited]
https://phys.org/news/2017-12-common-fungus-dengue-virus-mosquitoes.html


A species of fungus that lives in the gut of some _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes increases the ability of dengue virus to survive in the insects, according to a study from researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The fungus exerts this effect by reducing the production and activity of digestive enzymes in the mosquitoes. The discovery, reported this week in eLife, illuminates a biological mechanism that could turn out to be a general indicator and modifier of dengue transmission risk in the wild.

"If this common fungus proves to have a significant impact on mosquitoes' ability to transmit dengue virus to people in endemic areas, then we can start to think about ways to translate this knowledge into specific anti-dengue strategies," says George Dimopoulos, PhD, professor in the Bloomberg School's Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology.

Scientists have estimated that hundreds of millions of people suffer dengue virus infections -- known as "dengue fever" -- in tropical regions each year. Dengue infections can involve severe joint and muscle pain and have also been termed "breakbone fever." Although most cases are mild enough that they are never clinically reported, some take a severe hemorrhagic form that require hospitalization and are often fatal.

Dimopoulos and colleagues have discovered certain bacterial species that can live in mosquitoes and affect the insects' ability to transmit dengue and other diseases. In a recent field project in Puerto Rico, as they reported last year [2016], they also discovered a fungus that lives in the gut of anopheles mosquitoes and affects the insects' susceptibility to malaria parasites. In the new study, which stemmed from the same field project, Dimopoulos's team isolated a different type of fungus, from a species [sic: genus] called _Talaromyces_, from the gut of dengue-carrying _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes.

The scientists fed spores of the fungus to aedes mosquitoes via a sugar solution prior to a blood meal laced with dengue virus, and found that mosquitoes harboring the fungus were more likely to become infected by the virus. The dengue-infected mosquitoes that harbored the fungus also tended to have more dengue virus particles in their gut -- meaning that the virus could survive and make copies of itself more easily when the fungus was present.

The researchers then showed that this dengue-enabling effect was due to molecules that are secreted by fungal cells and reduce the activity of mosquitoes' digestive enzymes. The process blocks the activity of genes that encode these enzymes, and also directly inhibits the protein-breaking biochemical activity of some of the enzymes.

"This finding tells us that the protein-digesting activity of the mosquito gut can influence the success of dengue virus in establishing infection in the mosquito," Dimopoulos says. "The virus has a protective envelope called a capsid that is protein-based, so it is possible that this capsid is susceptible to some of these mosquito-gut enzymes." He notes that although many mosquito species feed on human blood, most are not infected by or don't transmit dengue virus -- for reasons that researchers have never fully understood. "It is possible that some of these incompatibilities between mosquitoes and dengue virus relate to this enzyme activity in the mosquito gut that can be modulated by fungi and other microbes," Dimopoulos says.

Talaromyces fungi are common, he adds, and are likely to be found in aedes mosquitoes not just in Puerto Rico but globally, although further field studies are needed to demonstrate their influence over dengue transmission to human populations. If the fungus does have a significant real-world impact, then in principle the presence or absence of the fungus in mosquitoes could be used as a simple marker of local transmission risk. "One also can imagine, for example, anti-fungal solutions being added to the breeding water or to artificial feeding stations to reduce local dengue transmissibility," Dimopoulos says.
