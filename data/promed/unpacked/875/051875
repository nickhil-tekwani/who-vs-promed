Developments re Q fever, Inf@ct update No 11, 22 Jul 2010
---------------------------------------------------------
[Inf@ct is a closed electronic information service on infectious
diseases managed by the Centre for infectious Diseases (Clb) of RIVM
(the National Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment).
The update, in Dutch, was distributed to subscribers on 22 Jul 2010,
translated by the communicator who is gratefully acknowledged. - Mod.AS]

1. Current situation: the public health aspects
So far this year (as of 21 Jun 2010), 421 reports of Q-fever [Qf]
cases in humans have been registered (compared to 1796 in 2009). We
know that 316 of them underwent the 1st day of illness during 2010.
The Clb registered 5 people who reportedly died due to Qf during 2010.
Qf deaths are not notifiable in the Netherlands, however reporting of
chronic Qf infections and deaths at the LCI is necessary to get a good
overview of any connection with Qf. A report form for this purpose can
be downloaded at the RIVM web-site.

2. Current situation: the veterinary aspects
91 farms have been reported as Qf contaminated (detected by the bulk
milk test) from December 2009 till 15 Jul 2010. In the 2 farms which
have been found positive during the current (July 2010) month, no
animals have been killed because none of the animals were pregnant
[due to the breeding ban applied since Dec 2009]. Since all dairy goat
and sheep farms in the Netherlands with more than 50 animals have been
vaccinated, various veterinary requirements/measures could be
discontinued.

[The maintained but adjusted measures are described on the Min of
Agriculture web-site. Since the application of bulk milk testing is
continuing , contaminated farms are expected to be found but they are
not to be culled. Since all farms have been vaccinated, the discovery
of a positive farm will not be followed by warning letters being sent
to neighbouring households. Measures for farms with a public function,
such as petting farms, remain in force despite the liberalisation,
with particular attention to full and timely vaccinations of all
animals in such enterprises. - Mod.AS]

See the policy re cases of Q-fever positive farms (in Dutch) at
<http://rivm.nl/cib/binaries/Bijlage%20I%20Beleid%20bij%20een%20Q-koortspositief%20bedrijf_0710_tcm92-60651.pdf>.

3. GR (Health Council) - advice re Q-fever vaccination:
The council believes (advice of 1 Jul 2010) that vaccination for the
entire Dutch [human] population is not necessary, but advises
vaccination of individuals with the following risks:

- patients who have once had endocarditis;
- patients with a heart valve prosthesis (including bio-prosthesis,
allografts and conduit);
- patients with certain natural cardiac handicaps.

The Ministry of Public Health should maintain vaccine for the above
categories.

The complete scientific advice (in Dutch) is available at:
<http://www.gezondheidsraad.nl/nl/adviezen/vaccinatie-van-mensen-tegen-q-koorts-eerste-advies>.

Minister Klink (Public health) has asked RIVM to prepare an
operational plan for the implementation of the vaccination strategy
according to Council advice. He has announced this to Parliament --
see Letter to Parliament: Vaccination of people
<http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/q-koorts/documenten-en-publicaties/kamerstukken/2010/07/21/brief-aan-de-tweede-kamer-over-q-koorts-vaccineren-van-mensen.html>.

More information about the concrete plan will be given in autumn of this year.

4. Comments:
The incidence of acute Q-fever has dropped considerably during the
recent months, compared to 2008 and 2009. Since large numbers of
Q-fever patients, have developed chronic Qf infection during these 2
previous years, Qf-related deaths will most probably still be reported
in the future.

[It is indeed a relief to note the sharp drop in human Qf infections
during 2010. It will be interesting to hear what role the culling of
infected flocks and mass animal vaccinations, respectively, played in
this achievement.

A curve showing the weekly numbers of human cases during the 1st 28
weeks of 2010 (as of 21 Jul 2010) compared to the weekly numbers
during 2008 and 2009, is available at
