--------------------------------------------------------------
May I expand upon Dr. Sencer's directions to ? In
particular, D.A. Henderson, et al.'s authoritative review article
"Smallpox as a Biological Weapon: Medical and Public Health
Management," J Amer Med Assoc 281:2127-2137, 1999 (June 9, 1999)
is available as a .pdf document at:
.
To spoil the surprise, I note that the information on retention of
immunity in this review article is only about persons vaccinated once
around the age of one year. Although I suspect no information exists,
wouldn't it be interesting (especially for persons like me who were re-
vaccinated for admission to college and graduate school, for military
service, for foreign travel, for high risk, for "ring vaccination" during
the last outbreaks, etc.) to know about the retention of immunity for
the (sometimes multiply) re-vaccinated? With luck, we will never have
to know.

Comment on Re-vaccination Immune Responses
------------------------------------------
There is a fairly large pool of scientists who have been vaccinated (or
re-vaccinated) with vaccinia virus as a precautionary measure before
handling any of many vaccinia virus strains (ATCC will list 139 items
if one does a quick search of their database) that are useful laboratory
tools in cell biology, molecular biology and infectious disease research.
Perhaps they constitute a pre-existing population, vaccinated post-1972,
from which useful information regarding current levels of immunity
could be extracted by a screening survey.
There is, of course, the complicating factor of accidental laboratory
exposure post-vaccination, but such cases should be readily
identifiable. [Dr. Sauri's personal observations below provide some
appropriate data. - Mod.CP

Persistence of Immunity to Smallpox: Personal Observation
---------------------------------------------------------
As an infectious diseases and occupational medicine consultant for
over 70 biotechnology laboratories in the Washington metropolitan
area, I have administered up to 100 vaccinia immunizations per year for
the past decade to researchers, laboratory technicians, and animal
caretakers. Of these vaccinees, about half were between the ages of 30-
60 and had a history of a prior vaccinia immunization.
Without pulling out my files, I can say confidently that only a handful
of immune responses were noted in those individuals with a visible
scar and a history of a vaccinia immunization "greater than 20 years
ago." This is consistent with published material sent by CDC that
projects that less than 5% of the general population currently carries
some protective immunity to smallpox.
Incidentally, over the past year, I have noted a disturbing increase in the
occurrence of cellulitis which did not appear to be related to any
specific host factor or change in operator technique. CDC hypothesized
that it could be related to the "aging" of the current stores of vaccinia
vaccine but was not interested in my sending the vaccine lots back for
bacteriologic testing. All of these vaccine-associated infections were
local cellulitides in individuals who were having a primary response to
the immunization. All of these individuals responded to a 5 day course
of either second-generation cephalosporins, second-generation
macrolides, second-generation quinolones or augmentin (office
samples).
I hope these personal observations are helpful to readers.
