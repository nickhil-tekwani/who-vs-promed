The number of horses infected with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has
tripled in the last 2 weeks in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina,
health officials said on Tuesday. "We usually don't see this level of
activity until late in the summer, so we're concerned," said Debbie Crane
of North Carolina's health department.
South Carolina has 45 horse cases of the disease, which is almost always
fatal to unvaccinated horses. Georgia has reported 32 horse cases and 10
infected birds. North Carolina has reported 13 horse cases. Although it
rarely affects people -- there have only been about 150 confirmed cases of
the disease in the last 40 years -- it can be more deadly than another
mosquitoborne disease, West Nile virus (WNV).
EEE kills about 50 per cent of people who catch it, compared with only 15
per cent for WNV. A Georgia man died from EEE in June 2003 in the nation's
first human case this year. Some owners have vaccinated their horses only
against WNV, Dr Venaye Reece of Clemson University said. Health officials
are urging people to be vigilant about both diseases.

Cases of eastern equine encephalitis are showing up in chickens earlier
than normal this year, prompting state and local environmental health
officials to urge people to take precautions. "People really need to take
care not to get bitten by mosquitoes," said Nolan Newton, chief of the
Public Health and Pest Management Section of the North Carolina Division of
Environmental Health. This is especially true along the coast, as EEE has
already been found in test flocks of chickens, Newton said. So far, 2
chickens in Bladen County, 2 in Currituck County, 1 in Pamlico, 1 in Jones
and 1 in Pender have tested positive for EEE.
"It's very unusual for us to see this kind of activity this early in the
year," Newton said. He said it is normally late August before the state
starts seeing this many cases. He attributed this year's early cases to the
above normal amounts of rainfall that help mosquitoes breed.
There have been no reported cases of EEE in humans in North Carolina yet
this year. There were 2 in 2002, Newton said. One of those was in Pamlico
County. EEE is a viral illness that can occur in humans, horses, and birds.
It is transmitted by some species of mosquitoes and attacks the central
nervous system, causing inflammation of the brain. "It's a very rare
disease, but it is a very serious disease," Newton said. 50 to 70 per cent
of those who contract EEE die, and those who survive usually suffer long
term neurological disorders such as paralysis, he said.
Following confirmation that a chicken in the Maysville area tested positive
for EEE, the Jones County Health Department sent out a notice Tuesday for
residents to take precautions. "We want them to be aware, but not alarmed,"
said Jones County health director Ruth Little.

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been confirmed in a horse in Columbus
County, and a child is being tested for the mosquitoborne disease, health
officials said on Tuesday. The child, who is from the Tabor City area, was
admitted to UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill last week, said Marian Duncan, the
Columbus County health director. Results of the tests should be available
this week, she said.
The horse was kept on Arthur Collier Road north of Evergreen. Duncan is
asking residents to protect themselves against mosquitoes, which transmit
the disease.
"Eastern equine encephalitis is a rare disease in humans, but it can be
serious and even fatal," Duncan said. "The presence of the virus in animals
tells us that it is in the area, and that means taking more precautions
against mosquito bites." Wild birds serve as reservoirs for the virus.
Mosquitoes bite the birds and can then transmit the virus to humans and
animals. "People should use mosquito repellent with DEET and follow the
instructions on the label, she said. Wear long pants and long-sleeved
garments when outside," Duncan said, "and avoid going out at dusk and dawn,
when mosquitoes are most active."
People should also:
-Remove containers that can hold water, even a small amount
-Keep gutters clean and in good repair
-Repair leaky outdoor faucets and change the water in birdbaths and pet
bowls at least twice a week
-Use screened windows and doors and make sure screens fit tightly and are
not torn.
The viral illness attacks the central nervous system, and about half of the
people infected with the disease die. Young children and the elderly are
most at risk. North Carolina averages about one case in humans each year.
Symptoms in people, which resemble those of the flu, include fever and
headache. A vaccine for horses is available, but a human vaccine does not
exist.

[A release from the North Carolina Health Department may have included some
of these same precautions about clothing and eliminating places for
mosquitoes to breed. However, the release also contained the statement: "A
health department release advises residents to use mosquito repellant or
wear long sleeves and long pants when outside." Mosquito repellants should
not be used on children younger than 6 months, the release states. Products
made for children, with no more than 10 per cent DEET, may be used once
daily on those 6 months to 2 years. Children from 3 years to 12 years can
use a children's strength product up to 3 times a day and those 13 and
older can use products containing up to 30 per cent DEET, the release states.
EEE is endemic in the southern and eastern regions of the United States.
Southern portions of Louisiana and Texas have been experiencing early
outbreaks of EEE for several years. Horse owners are encouraged to
vaccinate. Initially, 2 vaccinations about 3 weeks apart are recommended
followed by yearly boosters thereafter, but immunity to EEE is short. In
areas where the mosquito season is very long, horse owners may want to
consider vaccinating twice during the year. It is best to check with a
veterinarian in your area.
Though chickens and other birds are good sentinels, emus seem especially
sensitive to EEE. This was important to the emu breeder when that market
was high; however, owners of those birds still need to be aware the birds
are susceptible to the virus. - Mod.TG]
