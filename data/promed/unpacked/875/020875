At least 720 people have died in South Sudan from a protracted outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis [kala-azar], a parasitic disease, and the number of deaths could be much higher, the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) reported today [Sat 28 Oct 2017].

WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva that more than 18 000 cases of the disease have been recorded in South Sudan since the outbreak emerged in September 2009, with children mostly affected.

The outbreak has since spread to other areas of the newly independent country, and the number of new cases so far this year [2017] is a third higher than the equivalent figures from last year [2016], he added.

WHO is working with national health authorities to reduce the number of deaths in the outbreak, in part by increasing the number of health-care facilities providing treatment for the tropical disease.

Visceral leishmaniasis occurs in 3 clinical forms, and the current outbreak in South Sudan involves kala-azar, the most serious form. Kala-azar, which is transmitted by the bite of sandflies, can cause death by attacking a person's internal organs and bone marrow and has a mortality rate of 95 per cent if it is not treated.

Daniel Dagne, a medical officer for WHO, said the number of deaths from the outbreak was likely to be under-reported in South Sudan, which has little infrastructure and numerous remote communities.

[South Sudan and Sudan are highly endemic for Leishmaniasis. The statement that "more than 18 000 cases of the disease have been recorded in South Sudan since the outbreak emerged in September 2009, with children mostly affected" is most probably an underestimation of the true number of cases.

A recent review of the distribution of Leishmaniasis (Alvar J, VÃ©lez ID, Bern C et al. & the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671. Supplementary material S81, available at: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671) which provides detailed data from South Sudan, reports that more than 90 percent of global visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases occur in 6 countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. The annual number of reported cases in Sudan is estimated between 15 700 and 30 300, and in South Sudan between 7400 and 14 200 with an estimated underreporting of up to 8-fold in both countries. However, asymptomatic cases occur and the proportion of the population infected without symptoms is not known. Around 10 percent of VL cases in South Sudan are estimated to be co-infected with HIV, and malnutrition is further adding to the risk of developing clinical leishmaniasis. - Mod.EP
