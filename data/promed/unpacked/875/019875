Vaccination
-----------
- 9560 people were vaccinated from 14 Feb to 10 Apr 2020, with the 2nd dose of the 2nd Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) in the 2 health areas from Karisimbi to Goma;
- 20 339 people were vaccinated, as of 29 Feb 2020, with the 2nd vaccine of Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo (Johnson & Johnson) in the 2 health areas from Karisimbi to Goma;
- A total of 2129 people were vaccinated from 11 Apr to 20 May 2020 around the resurgent cases of Beni;

- This new vaccine complements the 1st, rVSV-ZEBOV, a vaccine used until then (since 8 Aug 2018) in this epidemic manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, after approval by the Ethics Committee on 20 May 2018. It was recently pre-qualified for certification.

Entry point surveillance
------------------------
- Since the start of the epidemic, the cumulative number of travelers checked (temperature taking) at health checkpoints, as of 9 Jun 2020 is 179 347 795;
- To date, a total of 50 entry points (PoE) and health control points (PoC) are operational out of the 109 set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri in order to protect large cities in the country and to avoid the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

[The government update has resumed for North Kivu and now also includes Equateur.

Note: 2 new confirmed cases in a new location: Bolomba, Equateur province. Good news that there are no new confirmed cases in North Kivu or Ituri for 44 days.

Helen Branswell tweets (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell): "The case count in Equateur Province in western DRC is up to 16 (13 confirmed, 3 probables) & 10 people have died...." These numbers are higher than the report above likely because they apparently are 1 day later than the report posted. - Mod.LK]

[2] Summaries
- Thu 11 Jun 2020. Disease Outbreak News
[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/11-June-2020-ebola-drc/en/

No new confirmed cases of ebolavirus disease (EVD) have been reported in Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since 27 Apr 2020 (see Figure 1 at source URL).

The source of infection of the cluster reported in April 2020 remains unconfirmed.

From 4 to 10 Jun 2020, an average of 3357 alerts were reported per day, of which 3346 (more than 99%) were investigated within 24 hours. Of these, an average of 545 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule out EVD. The number of reported and validated alerts has remained stable in recent weeks. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided from 8 laboratories. From 1 to 7 Jun 2020, 3130 samples were tested, including 2421 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 331 swabs from community deaths; and 378 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, the number of samples tested by the laboratories increased by 4% compared with the previous week.

As of 9 Jun 2020, a total of 3463 EVD cases, including 3317 confirmed and 146 probable cases, have been reported, of which 2280 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 66%) and 1171 have recovered. Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n = 1970) were female, 29% (n = 1002) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n = 171) were healthcare workers.

Handover of outbreak response and surveillance activities from the central government and international partners to the Provincial Health Department (DPS) started on 1 Jun 2020 and is ongoing.

- Tue 9 Jun 2020. External situation report 96
[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/332320/SITREP_EVD_DRC_20200610-eng.pdf?ua=1

Data as reported by 8 Jun 2020:

The ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), continues since its declaration on 1 Jun 2020 by the Ministry of Health. Since our last situation report on 2 Jun 2020 (external situation report 95), 4 additional confirmed EVD cases and 4 deaths have been reported. As of 8 Jun 2020, a total of 12 EVD cases (9 confirmed and 3 probable), including 8 deaths (case fatality ratio, 66.7%), have been reported from 6 health areas in 3 health zones. Of the 8 deaths, 4 occurred in the community. The case fatality ratio among confirmed cases is 55.6% (5 deaths/9 confirmed cases). Two health workers are among the confirmed cases since the start of the outbreak, 18.2% of all cases. Of the 4 confirmed cases still alive, 2 are under treatment in the Ebola treatment centre and 2 are in the community [see updated numbers under Case updates - Mod.LK].

The health zones reporting EVD cases are Mbandaka (6 confirmed, 3 probable, 3 deaths), Wangata (2 confirmed, 1 death) and Bikoro (1 confirmed and 1 death).

Sequencing of the initial confirmed specimen (swab) conducted at the Institute National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB), Kinshasa, indicated the Zaire ebolavirus isolated in Equateur Province is not linked to the outbreak in eastern DRC. Additional samples have been sent to the INRB for sequencing. Investigations around the origin of this outbreak are ongoing.

As of 8 Jun 2020, a total of 289 contacts have been identified for follow up, of which 255 (88%) were seen on the reporting day.

[3] Equateur outbreak: genetics

Sequencing suggests separate introduction in new DRC Ebola outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Genetic sequencing of the Ebola virus in the new Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak suggests that it isn't related to the large outbreak in the east of the country or to a small 2018 outbreak in the same area of Equateur province, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [9 Jun 2020] in a statement.

Though an investigation into the source is still underway, the event likely reflects a new introduction from an animal source. Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, director of the WHO's African regional office, said the findings from the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa aren't surprising because the 2 outbreaks are located far apart, and there is a flight ban due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Ebola is endemic in animal reservoirs in the DRC, so it was expected that new cases would emerge," she said. "While the new Ebola outbreak in Mbandaka represents a challenge, it's one we are ready to tackle. With each experience we respond faster and more effectively."

Twenty WHO staff are on the ground to support the health ministry and its partners, and more will arrive this week. So far, 2200 vaccine doses have been delivered, and 600 people have been vaccinated in Mbandaka and Wangata health zones.

So far, 12 illnesses have been reported, with 9 confirmed and 3 listed as probable. Eight people have died from their infections. The 2018 outbreak in the same part of the northwestern DRC resulted in 54 cases, 33 of them fatal.

[See ProMED-mail Ebola update (25): Congo DR (EQ, NK) cases, response WHO, new spillover 20200606.7432964. The sequencing analysis of virus from the current outbreak suggests the virus strain likely represents a new spillover event and the 11th EVD outbreak in the DRC, the 3rd outbreak in 2 years.

Coronavirus special podcast 19: When COVID-19 and Ebola strike at the same time

One global pandemic is enough of a health crisis. But the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is now dealing with an Ebola epidemic in the northwest of the country as well as rising coronavirus infections. DW looks at what may be in store for the DRC by meeting citizens and healthcare workers from a country that managed to get Ebola under control: Liberia.
