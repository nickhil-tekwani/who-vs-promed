Chicken prices in South Korea are likely to jump next month [January 2017] due to a possible undersupply following the deadliest outbreak of avian influenza (AI), industry sources said [Thu 22 Dec 2016].

South Korea has destroyed more than 20 million chickens and ducks at nearly 400 farms across the nation since the 1st case of bird flu was reported in mid-November [2016] at a chicken farm on the southwest coast.

According to the Korea Broiler Council, nearly half of some 1500 broiler farms nationwide are unable to bring in newly hatched chicks as the government has banned the movement of poultry in bird flu-hit areas, despite a slim possibility of broilers catching the virus.

Bird flu is known to rarely affect broiler farms, which have modernized disinfection facilities and butcher chickens after raising them without much contact with humans. As of [Wed 21 Dec 2016], birds at only 2 broiler farms tested positive for the disease, with just a small number slaughtered.

The council said broiler prices have dropped somewhat due to decreased consumption, but they could surge beginning in [January 2017] as the supply of fresh chickens is feared to drop sharply. Making matters worse, broiler farms could face a double whammy due to plunging chicken consumption as the bird flu outbreak has made people reluctant to eat the meat, it said. "Chicken farmers may be hit hard should chicken consumption drop further," said Kim Soo-yong, a spokesman of the council. "A price hike would not be of great help to their income because of weaker demand."

Indeed, sales of chicken at E-Mart, South Korea's leading discount chain, plunged nearly 23 percent from 21 Nov 2016 from the previous one-month period, with turnover at other stores nationwide sinking about 20 percent.

The country's largest AI outbreak has also sent egg prices soaring due to a record number of slaughtered chickens.

[According to S. Korea's last available official information on the HPAI H5N6 event, dated 2 Dec 2016 (OIE follow-up report No 2) http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000021771_20161202_191509.pdf, the epidemiological statistics as of the said date were summarized as follows:

Total outbreaks: 20 (submitted)
Species/ Susceptible / Cases/ Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds/ 240 624 / 4790 / 4790 / 235 834 / 0

The updated information in the current media report, in case confirmed, reporting that the total number of destroyed chickens and ducks has risen to 20 million "at nearly 400 farms across the nation", is indicative of strikingly increased incidence/spread of the virus throughout S. Korea during the recent 3 weeks. An updated official follow-up report is warranted.

Earlier, during March/Apr 2016, S. Korea experienced a limited event (2 outbreaks) caused by HPAI virus H5N8, which was eradicated by stamping-out and declared resolved as of 7 Apr 2016 (follow-up/final report, submitted 7 Sep 2016, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=20243). It will be interesting to note if the numerous HPAI outbreaks during Nov/Dec 2016 have all been determined to be caused exclusively by the HPAI H5N6 virus strain.

On [19 Dec 2016], CIDRAP published the following information: "For the first time this year, South Korea is reporting that H5N8 [has been recorded] at a chicken farm south of Seoul, according to an official report translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary (AFD), an infectious disease news blog. It's unknown how many birds are infected at this time. South Korea is currently experiencing a H5N6 outbreak, and this is the 1st time the 2 strains have appeared in the country concurrently. In 2014, H5N8 paralyzed South Korea's poultry industry" (see at http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/12/h5n8-appears-nigeria-south-korea).

This new, concerning information is in need of official confirmation, and - in case affirmative - of reporting.

While HPAI is zoonotic, no human health hazard by HPAI H5N8 has been identified so far.

Japan is currently undergoing an event of HPAI H5N6 which reportedly started on [29 Nov 2016], causing, so far, 6 outbreaks on poultry farms. For an interactive map showing the 6 outbreaks spread throughout the country and for links to Japan's follow-up reports (the recent one published 19 Dec 2016), see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21714.

The summarized epidemiological statistics of the said Japanese event, as of [19 Dec 2016], are the following:

Total outbreaks: 6 (submitted)
Species/ Susceptible / Cases / Deaths/ Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 978 865 / 375 / 375 / 978 490 / 0

Japan's swift response to the event has been exemplary. - Mod.AS
