Treatment of Dog-Bite Victims with Anti-rabies Vaccine Ineffective
------------------------------------------------------------------
RAWALPINDI: [A senior doctor has stated that the anti-rabies vaccine
available in [Rawalpindi hospitals for dog-bite treatment is not
effective. Another doctor stated that the vaccine, which is manufactured by
the National Institute of Health, was not recommended by the World Health
Organization. To make matters worse, there was [an inadequate supply of the
vaccine. The shortage was not only in rural areas, but also in the major
hospitals of the twin cities. Doctors at the Holy Family Hospital said that
the Polyclinic also referred patients to them whenever there was a shortage
of the vaccine.
About 1271 cases of dog-bite were reported at different health-care
facilities in the Rawalpindi district last year, according to statistics
available from the Director of Health Services. None of the hospitals in
the city kept a supply of Human Diploid Cell (HDC) vaccine, which the
doctors said was the most effective treatment in dog-bite cases. Patients
were given 5 injections of this vaccine in the arm, whereas [in case of the
locally produced anti-rabies vaccine, a total of 14 injections were
required in the stomach.
HDC vaccine is quite expensive and a single injection costs Rs500, which
many patients cannot afford. The total cost of HDC vaccine treatment comes
to Rs2500. Asked as to why HDC vaccine was not available in hospitals, the
Medical Superintendents of the city's 3 major hospitals said there was no
provision for it in their budgets. "The hospitals are only allowed to
procure medicines according to the approved list provided by the Health
Department," they said. "For dog-bite cases, the health department had
recommended [the locally produced anti-rabies vaccine and thus the
hospitals were bound to stock it, [notwithstanding the fact that it was
the least effective." Doctors [have to ask patients to obtain the
alternative costlier HDC vaccine from the open market, but those who cannot
afford it are left with no other option but to be vaccinated with the
ineffective vaccine.
Another doctor said that the most effective [treatment after bite by a
rabid dog was administration of immunoglobulin, which was even costlier.
Only a single injection of immunoglobulin is required, however.
On Monday the Science and Technology Ministry allocated Rs33 million to
allow the National Institute of Health to install modern machinery for the
production of vaccines, as the present machinery has outlived its usefulness.

[The same report was received by ProMED-mail from R.A. Chotani, MD, MPH
<Rashid.Chotani@jhuapl.edu>. Under the prevailing circumstances, the
leashing or muzzling of dogs would be a more cost-effective interim method
of protecting both the dog population and the human population in the
absence of adequate supplies of animal and human vaccines. - Mod.CP
