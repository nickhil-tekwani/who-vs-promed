Summary
----------
What is already known about this topic?

As more persons are exposed to and infected by SARS-CoV-2, reports of patients who experience persistent symptoms or organ dysfunction after acute COVID-19 and develop post-COVID conditions have increased.

What is added by this report?

COVID-19 survivors have twice the risk for developing pulmonary embolism or respiratory conditions; one in 5 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-64 years and one in 4 survivors aged ≥65 years experienced at least one incident condition that might be attributable to previous COVID-19.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Implementation of COVID-19 prevention strategies, as well as routine assessment for post-COVID conditions among persons who survive COVID-19, is critical to reducing the incidence and impact of post-COVID conditions, particularly among adults aged ≥65 years.

A growing number of persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have reported persistent symptoms, or the onset of long-term symptoms, ≥4 weeks after acute COVID-19; these symptoms are commonly referred to as post-COVID conditions, or long COVID (1). Electronic health record (EHR) data during March 2020-November 2021, for persons in the United States aged ≥18 years were used to assess the incidence of 26 conditions often attributable to post-COVID (hereafter also referred to as incident conditions) among patients who had received a previous COVID-19 diagnosis (case-patients) compared with the incidence among matched patients without evidence of COVID-19 in the EHR (control patients). The analysis was stratified by 2 age groups (persons aged 18-64 and ≥65 years). Patients were followed for 30-365 days after the index encounter until one or more incident conditions were observed or through 31 Oct 2021 (whichever occurred first). Among all patients aged ≥18 years, 38% of case-patients experienced an incident condition compared with 16% of controls; conditions affected multiple systems, and included cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, renal, endocrine, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric signs and symptoms. By age group, the highest risk ratios (RRs) were for acute pulmonary embolism (RR = 2.1 and 2.2 among persons aged 18-64 and ≥65 years, respectively) and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR = 2.1 in both age groups). Among those aged 18-64 years, 35.4% of case-patients experienced an incident condition compared with 14.6% of controls. Among those aged ≥65 years, 45.4% of case-patients experienced an incident condition compared with 18.5% of controls. These findings translate to one in 5 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-64 years, and one in 4 survivors aged ≥65 years experiencing an incident condition that might be attributable to previous COVID-19. Implementation of COVID-19 prevention strategies, as well as routine assessment for post-COVID conditions among persons who survive COVID-19, is critical to reducing the incidence and impact of post-COVID, particularly among adults aged ≥65 years (2).

A retrospective matched cohort design was used to analyze EHRs during March 2020-November 2021, from Cerner Real-World Data, a national, deidentified data set of approximately 63.4 million unique adult records from 110 data contributors in the 50 states. Case-patients (353,164) were adults aged ≥18 years who received either a diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (case-patient index encounter) in an inpatient, emergency department, or outpatient settings within a subset of health-care facilities that use Cerner EHRs. Control patients (1 640 776) had a visit in the same month as the matched case-patient (control index encounter) and did not receive a COVID-19 diagnosis or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during the observation period. Controls were matched 5:1 with case-patients.

Discussion

The findings from this analysis of a large EHR [electronic health record]-based database of US adults indicated that COVID-19 survivors were significantly more likely than were control patients to have incident conditions that might be attributable to previous COVID-19. One in 5 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-64 years and one in 4 survivors aged ≥65 years experienced at least one incident condition that might be attributable to previous COVID-19. Independent of age group, the highest RRs were for acute pulmonary embolism and respiratory symptoms.

These findings are consistent with those from several large studies that indicated that post-COVID incident conditions occur in 20%-30% of patients (6,7), and that a proportion of patients require expanded follow-up care after the initial infection. COVID-19 severity and illness duration can affect patients' health-care needs and economic well-being (8). The occurrence of incident conditions following infection might also affect a patient's ability to contribute to the workforce and might have economic consequences for survivors and their dependents, particularly among adults aged 18-64 years (5). In addition, care requirements might place a strain on health services after acute illness in communities that experience heavy COVID-19 case surges.

COVID-19 survivors aged ≥65 years in this study were at increased risk for neurologic conditions, as well as for 4 of 5 mental health conditions (mood disorders, other mental conditions, anxiety, and substance-related disorders). Neurocognitive symptoms have been reported to persist for up to one year after acute infection and might persist longer (9). Overall, 45.4% of survivors aged ≥65 years in this study had incident conditions. Among adults aged ≥65 years, who are already at higher risk for stroke and neurocognitive impairment, post-COVID conditions affecting the nervous system are of particular concern because these conditions can lead to early entry into supportive services or investment of additional resources into care (10).

As the cumulative number of persons ever having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 increases, the number of survivors suffering post-COVID conditions is also likely to increase. Therefore, implementation of COVID-19 prevention strategies, as well as routine assessment for post-COVID conditions among persons who survive COVID-19, is critical to reducing the incidence and impact of post-COVID conditions, particularly among adults aged ≥65 years (2). These findings can increase awareness for post-COVID conditions and improve post-acute care and management of patients after illness. Further investigation is warranted to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with increased risk for post-COVID conditions, including by age and type of condition.

[B] Persistent multi-organ damage

A multicenter Scottish study reveals persistent multisystem abnormalities among 159 COVID-19 patients 28-60 days after release from the hospital, including cardio-renal inflammation, diminished lung function, worse quality of life, and poor outcomes [see citation below].

In the study, published yesterday [23 May 2022] in Nature Medicine, a team led by University of Glasgow researchers collected serial blood biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes and performed digital electrocardiography, chest computed tomography (CT) with pulmonary and coronary angiography, and cardio-renal (heart-kidney) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the hospital and 28-60 days later. For longer-term outcomes, the researchers accessed electronic health records.

Patients were screened from 22 May 2020 - 16 Mar 2021. The 159 COVID-19 patients were, on average, 55 years old, and 43% were women, 87% were White, 9% were Asian, 3% were Arab, 1% were Black, 46% had a history of cardiovascular disease or treatment, 40% were in the highest quintile of social deprivation, 23% were healthcare workers, and nearly all were unvaccinated.

Their results were compared with those of 29 matched control patients who underwent the same tests at a single visit from 13 Apr - 2 Jul 2021.

Twenty-two patients (15%) had normal chest radiologic results during COVID-19 hospitalization, 1.2% patients had received a single dose of vaccine before hospitalization, 9% required extra oxygen, 20% received noninvasive respiratory support, and 9% needed invasive ventilation.

"The implication of multisystem injury pathways as mediators of post-COVID-19 syndrome should help to inform clinical guideline updates, and the findings support the prioritization of targeted preventive therapy development for post-COVID-19 syndromes in hospitalized patients."

From the editorial team of Nature Medicine: "Understanding the sequela of post-acute COVID-19 is fundamental to the development of better management strategies to improve patient quality of life and care, as well as contributing to the as-yet-underdeveloped knowledge base of the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This work provides deep clinical phenotyping of patients with post-acute symptoms following hospitalization with COVID-19 and demonstrates persistence of multisystemic involvement and cardiac complications."

As cases continue to rise and variants continue to emerge, health-care systems will be increasingly burdened with patients with long-term sequelae, and new long-term pathologies will come to light. Acute COVID is just the tip of the iceberg. This makes it even more important that the public continue to follow public health measures to protect themselves and prevent spread of the virus. - Mod.LK]

Among the many confounding aspects of the coronavirus is the spectrum of possible symptoms, as well as their severity and duration. Some people develop mild illness and recover quickly, with no lasting effects. But studies estimate that 10-30% of people report persistent or new medical issues months after their initial coronavirus infections -- a constellation of symptoms known as long COVID. People who experience mild or moderate illness, as well as those without any underlying medical conditions, can nonetheless experience some debilitating long-term symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, an erratic heart rate, headaches, dizziness, depression, and problems with memory and concentration.
