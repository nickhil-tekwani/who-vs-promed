Dog and cat owners planning journeys of 2 months or more will be able to
escape British quarantine laws from this summer. Diplomats, Service
personnel and business people seconded abroad will benefit. An exception to
the two-month rule will be made for the deaf and the blind.
Holidaymakers crossing the Channel for just a short break will have to wait
until 2001 before they can take advantage of the scheme. The Government
wants to be sure the system works before extending it.
Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, said the plan would be tested this
year at Heathrow airport, at Dover and Portsmouth ferry terminals and on
the Channel tunnel rail-link.It will apply to countries within the European
Union and European Economic Area and to rabies-free islands including
Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Brown will shortly announce
arrangements for North America, where rabies is prevalent among wild animals.
Mr Brown said: "We are determined to press on with this. I believe it is
right to test the procedures before introducing them. The protection of the
public has to be paramount."
Travelling pet owners will need to obtain a certificate verifying their
animal has been vaccinated and have them fitted with a microchip matching
the code number given on the document. Mr Brown has rejected the option of
trying out the system on just one long-haul route to continental Europe,
opting instead to make the pilot scheme available to a greater range of
people.
But the two-month minimum has been introduced so that the ports are not
deluged by pet lovers wanting to take part in the scheme from the outset.

[I wonder if all the microchips across Great Britain will be of the same
type so there is one universal reader for the chips. There are several
companies that make/sell the chips in the US which can make standardization
difficult in times of crisis, such as natural disasters where animals and
people are displaced. - Mod.TG
