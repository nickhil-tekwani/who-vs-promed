The red tide on the Pacific Coast, which paralyzed the work of more than
300 fisherman and poisoned at least 30 people who ate contaminated
mollusks, may disappear in the next 2 weeks, authorities announced yesterday.
Sanitary technicians collected water specimens from various sites along the
coast today and will determine the status of the [red tide, said the
president of the Costa Rican Institute of Fisheries and Marine Farming
(Incopesca), Herbert Nanne.
