An 11-year-old boy infected with rabies was pronounced dead at the Sarawak General Hospital (SGH) here [Kuching] at about noon today [Thu 3 May 2018].

The boy's death brings the number of fatalities from an outbreak of rabies which began in Serian in June last year [2017] to 8.

In a statement, Health Ministry director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the victim, who was from Kampung Sebangkoi Baru, Simunjan, succumbed to rabies encephalitis (acute inflammation of the brain).

"The victim started developing signs and symptoms (related to rabies), including weakness in his right hand and vomiting, on [Wed 18 Apr 2018].

"His parents brought him to a private clinic, which referred his case to the Serian Hospital the following day.

"The victim was diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis, and his condition worsened despite receiving treatment at the hospital," he said.

Dr Noor Hisham said the boy suffered a seizure about 4 days after he was admitted to the Serian Hospital. The following day, he was transferred to SGH, where tests revealed that he had rabies.

"We believe that the boy had (been bitten) by a dog, based on a wound, which had just healed, found on his body.

"His parents, however, cannot recall their son being been bitten by a dog or any other animal which (could have) infected him with the virus," he added.

Dr Noor Hisham said Sarawak has recorded 9 cases of human rabies contraction, with 8 of them - including the latest victim - succumbing to the virus.

It is learnt that a 7-year-old boy who recovered from his rabies infection is in critical condition and on life support at his home in Kampung Kuala, Serian near here.

[The discovery of rabies circulating in East Malaysia, a territory regarded earlier as rabies-free, was made by human sentinels. The Sarawak General Hospital in Kuching notified on [Thu 22 Jun 2017] rabies in 3 children from the village Serian. This led the veterinary authorities to perform surveillance in the dog and cat populations in Serian. According to their findings, as initially notified to the OIE on [Tue 11 Jul 2017] (see 20170712.5170101), out of the 461 owned dogs, 29 were found rabies positive; out of the 782 owned cats, 3 were found rabies positive. The diagnosis was based upon direct fluorescent antibody (FAT) test, performed on all samples on [Sat 8 Jul 2017] by Malaysia's National laboratory, namely the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI).

Since then, the event continued, affecting animals and, unfortunately, costing additional human lives. The Malaysian authorities submitted 10 follow-up reports so far, the most recent one on [Wed 2 May 2018], addressing the event described above; see at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=26523.

The term "recovered", as related to the other rabies-suspected human case (final sentence in the above media report) deserves to be read with reservation. Details will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]

[2] UK, bat, human exposure suspected

An 8-year-old girl was given anti-rabies injections after being bitten by a bat in her kitchen.

[HB], of Billingsley, Shropshire, was bitten on the finger when she tried to remove the bat from her home with a tea towel.

After being warned of the risk of contracting rabies, [H's] mother [AB] took her to a GP who gave her the jabs, The Sun reported.

She said: "[H] is OK now, but some of the injections were quite painful."

The bat flew in through patio doors in the kitchen on [Fri 20 Apr 2018] and [H] was bitten after it "wriggled out" of the tea-towel it was in.

[H] has since had 5 injections and must have 2 more.

[Ms B], 38, who run Shropshire Donkey Rescue Centre, said: "[H] yelped and showed me the tiny mark. "I called 111 and was shocked they told me to take her to hospital over the rabies risk. I had no idea, if I had I wouldn't have let her go near it."

The family went to Kidderminster Hospital but [H] was sent home without treatment.

"They were useless. When we got home, I contacted the Bat Conservation Trust who sent me information to give to our GP," [Ms B] said.

"We went and [H] was given the jabs, some of which had to go into the muscle in her arm. It was quite painful for her. "But she's seen the positive side of it all. She said if a bat comes into the house again, at least she can help it out without being at risk."

According to the Bat Conservation Trust, some bats carry a rabies virus called European bat lyssavirus, which differs from the type of rabies associated with dogs.

A spokesperson for Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Trust which runs Kidderminster Hospital said it "cannot administer rabies injections" and "in this very rare instance" they advised [Ms B] to attend "an appropriate alternative health service."

According to UK's official OIE information, this last indigenous case of rabies in animals was recorded in 1970.

In the absence of information on the bat species involved and its behaviour, and since it has not been tested, it is not possible to assess the actual risk the bitten child has undergone.

Rabies-related viruses (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) have been reported in bats from several European countries. Bats suffering from these viruses show signs of disorientation, malcoordination, and occasional aggression. No case of indigenous human rabies from animals other than bats has been reported in the UK since 1902.

Rabies-related bat viruses do not appear to readily infect other mammals. There are about 17 species of bats present in the UK. Under a passive surveillance scheme in the UK, a considerable number of bats of several species have been tested for rabies since 1987. All positive cases were Daubenton's bats. - Mod.AS

[3] WHO's new guidelines and recommendations on rabies immunization
Date: Fri 20 Apr 2018
Source: WHO press release [summ., edited]
http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/news/guidelines-and-recommendations-on-lifesaving-immunization/en/


The World Health Organization (WHO) today [Fri 20 Apr 2018] published the 3rd report of its Expert Consultation on Rabies, which incorporates the latest recommendations on rabies immunization made in October 2017 by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization; these recommendations are also published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record.

The report, requested by countries, provides hands-on guidance to drive progress towards rabies elimination. It is based on evidence and programmatic experience on the multiple facets of rabies prevention, control and elimination. Engagement with international partners to accelerate country and regional programme implementation is required in order to achieve the target of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030.

The key updates include:
- surveillance strategies, including cross-sectoral linking of systems and suitable diagnostics;
- the latest recommendations on human and animal immunization;
- palliative care in low-resource settings;
- risk assessment to guide management of bite victims; and
- a proposed process for validation and verification of countries reaching zero human deaths from rabies.

The meeting of experts supported the recommendations endorsed by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts [SAGE] on Immunization in October 2017 to improve access to affordable rabies biologicals, especially for underserved populations, and increase programmatic feasibility in line with the objectives of universal health coverage. The updated WHO position on rabies vaccines, also published today [Fri 20 Apr 2018], concerns the 2 main immunization strategies for people at risk, namely recommendations on vaccination for post-exposure prophylaxis and vaccination for pre-exposure prophylaxis, including the use of rabies immunoglobulins.

The capacity required for rabies elimination is an investment not only in the elimination of this fatal but preventable disease but also in building capacity in the world's most neglected regions.

Rabies is a 100 percent vaccine-preventable disease and providing support to countries will end the pain and suffering due to rabies that burdens people, especially children.

The collaborative mechanisms required to prevent rabies are a model for collaboration on One Health at every level and among multiple stakeholders, and are a recipe for success.

[4] Israel, jackal, decreased incidence

Rabies: a rabid jackal has been reported from Nahalal, more than a month after the previous case in Israel's northern valleys region during 2018. The current case is number 45 in animals since the start of 2018.

[For the location of Nahalal, where the mentioned new case in a jackal has been detected [Wed 2 May 2018], see map at https://tinyurl.com/ybcharwm.

The current one is Israel's 45th rabies case in animals since the start of 2018, of which 35 are jackals. This is the 1st jackal since [Wed 4 Apr 2018]. It seems that the jackal epizootic has peaked and expected to decrease during the coming months.

Since early 2018, the distribution of rabies vaccine baits for wildlife has been enhanced in northern and other parts of Israel. As can be seen in the updated rabies map, published on [Wed 2 May 2018] by the rabies laboratory in the Kimron Veterinary Institute, the epizootic has not continued its spread further southwards along the coast; http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/Documents/mapa_kalevet_05_02.jpg.

The rabies explosion, in the dense jackal population in the northern valleys, started on Israel's north eastern borders with Jordan and Syria in October 2017. Out of Israel's 47 rabies cases in jackals during 2017, 37 were recorded during less than 3 months, between 8 Oct and 31 Dec 2017. This event has thus continued during the 1st trimester of 2018; hopefully the observed decrease heralds the end of this unusual event.

In spite of the considerable number of human exposures, no human cases have been reported in Israel since 2003. Updated statistics of post-exposure treatments (vaccinations) since September 2017, compared to similar months in earlier years, will be useful.
