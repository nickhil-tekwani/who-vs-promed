Graham County health officials said they're keeping watch on the number of pertussis cases in Greenlee County, in hopes of stopping an outbreak from occurring here. "Our local health-care providers and schools are aware of the pertussis outbreak in Greenlee County and are taking proper measures to bring this occurrence to a close," said Brian Douglas, Graham County Health director.

There are 8 confirmed cases of pertussis -- known as whooping cough -- in Greenlee County, with contact in Graham. In an e-mail, Douglas said pertussis "is highly contagious, and one of the most commonly occurring vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States. People with pertussis usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others, who then breathe in the pertussis bacteria. Many infants who get pertussis are infected by older siblings, parents, or other caregivers who might not even know they have the disease. Pertussis is most severe for infants. This is the age group we're most concerned about when it comes to this infection."

He said pertussis occurs in a cyclical pattern, with the number of cases peaking every three to five years. He also said that even with the success of pertussis vaccines, people continue to get pertussis because no vaccine is guaranteed 100 percent effective.

Pertussis symptoms include: cold-like symptoms for the 1st one to 2 weeks with cough becoming more severe; after the initial few weeks, bursts of numerous, rapid coughs with difficulty in catching one's breath after the coughing episode; [and] possible vomiting from sticky mucus.

To reduce the risk of contracting pertussis, parents need to make sure everyone in the household is up to date with recommended pertussis vaccines (DTaP for infants/children and Tdap for adolescents/adults). Those planning on becoming pregnant or who are currently pregnant should talk to a doctor about getting the Tdap vaccine. To avoid spreading the disease to infants, make sure all people around the baby are vaccinated with Tdap, including siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nannies, caregivers, child-care staff, etc. People with a cough illness or other communicable disease should always stay away from young infants.

For information regarding the signs and symptoms of pertussis, go to the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/ or contact the Graham County Health Department at 928-428-1962.

[The news report above fails to say the ages of the 8 pertussis cases in Greenlee County, Arizona, or their pertussis vaccination status.

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. In 2014, over 10 percent of cases occurred in children under 6 months of age and the incidence rate of pertussis among infants in this age group (about 150 cases per 100 000) exceeded that of all other age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf). Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old.

As of 31 Dec 2014, 28 660 cases of pertussis (with an incidence rate of 9.1 per 100 000) were reported in the US during 2014, which is an 18 percent increase, compared to provisional numbers that were reported at the same time in 2013 (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). The US state of Arizona had 464 cases with an incidence rate of 7.0 per 100 000 in 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf).

The state of Arizona can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3617491,9143. Greenlee County, where the 8 cases of confirmed pertussis resided, is the least populous county in Arizona with a population of 8437 in 2010; this county is located in the southeastern part of the US state of Arizona, on the border with the state of New Mexico (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenlee_County,_Arizona). Its economy is dominated by one of the largest copper mines in the world. Greenlee County is bordered to the west by Graham County, with a population of 37 220 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_County,_Arizona#Adjacent_counties).
