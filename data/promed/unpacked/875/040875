Isn't this die off due to Influenza Strain H7N7 similar to previous die
offs. Has anyone been able to isolate influenze from the seals?

Could this be in any way connected to the seal die-off in NZ?

[Strange you should mention New Zealand. Over the past few weeks I have
been contacting Massey directly and indirectly for information on the
sea lion die-off but with zero success. The best suggestion to date, by a
Kiwi third-party, is that the adults may have died directly & indirectly of
starvation. Until Massey or the NZ Department of Conservation care to share
their information with us or issue a press release we are in the dark. -

Maybe my remark is totally superfluous, but the stranding center in New
Jersey, could try to contact the Dutch
HREF="http://www.alrecrea.com/recrinf/r9968ag.html">Zeehondenopvangcentrum,
Pieterburen (having had a similar problem) to see if they have some
useful info.
I'm just a curious layperson.

[I visited this website but as my Dutch is nonexistant I had immediate
problems. The website appears to be a useful list of local museums and zoos,
and related hotels and restaurants. It would be appreciated if our
Netherlands members would follow-up on this suggestion and get back to us
with any useful information. - Mod.MHJ

In hopes of finding something useful, I websurfed for marine strandings and
came up with the following:
Marine Mammal Stranding Centers
<http://www.mmsc.org/>
<http://www.csn.net/trips/friend/mmsc.html>
<http://whale.wheelock.edu/whalenet-stuff/strandings.html>
<http://www.tmmsn.org/>
cetacean strandings
<http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/~gmk/Projects/Orcas-SW/Misc/StrandLit.html>
Gulf Coast dolphin strandings.
<http://www.tmmsn.org/strandings/statistcs.html>
<http://capita.wustl.edu/NEW/blaylock.html>
<http://www.premier.net/~lmmsn/#historical>
It seems that each genus has its own pattern of strandings and related
causes. However, the informative quality of these sites is very variable,
from simplistic pr up to path reports, data, and people to contact. The
dolphin group is certainly in the latter series. Unless there is a sudden
provision of hard information on those dead New Jersey seals, this thread is
reluctantly cut.
