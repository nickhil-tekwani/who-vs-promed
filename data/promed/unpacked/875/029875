Fact sheet on deadly new virus in Malaysia
----------------------------------------------------
1. What is Paramyxo virus?
Paramyxoviruses are a group of enveloped RNA viruses
whose members have been shown to cause animal and
human infection. Several new viruses belonging to this
family Paramyxovirus have been isolated in Australia
since 1994. This includes the Hendra virus.
2. What is Hendra virus?
Hendra virus has been shown to affect race horses and three
humans in Australia. Two of these Australian patients died,
one of respiratory infection and the other of
meningo-encephalitis. It is clearly established that Hendra
virus is a fruit bat virus. Fruit bat virus can cause infection
in other animals; for example, horses.
3. What are the other animals that can be affected with
Hendra virus?
Experimental studies have shown that in horses and cats the
virus causes fatal pneumonia. Other animals include fruit
bats, birds and guinea pigs.
4. What are the signs and symptoms of Hendra virus
infection?
Findings of the patient who died of meningo-encephalitis
showed a brief period of aseptic meningitic illness shortly
after caring for two infected horses that died from the same
disease.
5. How is it transmitted?
Researchers have shown that infected animals excrete the
virus in their urine. The virus is not carried through the
breath of horses and is not highly contagious.
6. How is it prevented?
Good rigorous hygiene practices in horse stables and the
surrounding environment. Hendra virus is an enveloped
virus and is susceptible to soaps and detergent solutions.
