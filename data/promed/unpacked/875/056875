Leishmania in US troops from Iraq, Kuwait, & Afghanistan
-----------------------------------------------------
Highlights from the MMWR report [The full text can be obtained from
the above URL]
This report provides preliminary data about 22 cases of CL [cutaneous
leishmaniasis] in military personnel deployed during 2002-2003 to 3 countries
in Southwest/Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait). The patients were
evaluated and treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) in the
District of Columbia during August 2002-September 2003.
U.S. health-care providers should consider the possibility of CL in persons
with chronic skin lesions who were deployed to Southwest/Central Asia or who
were in other areas where leishmaniasis is endemic. On the basis of the
patients' histories about their deployments, the majority (18 [82 percent])
probably were infected in Iraq, particularly in the urban and periurban areas
of An Nasiriyah and Baghdad, and 2 (9 percent) probably were infected in
areas of Kuwait adjacent to Iraq. An additional 2 (9 percent) persons were
infected in Afghanistan. The patients had been deployed to these areas an
estimated median of 60 days (range: 21-150 days) before first noting skin
lesions. Self-reported dates of lesion onset ranged from May 2002 to August
2003.
All 22 patients were treated with sodium stibogluconate (20 mg/kg of body
weight/day) by intravenous infusion for 20 days (1). The patients' lesions
responded to therapy. The patients had predictable, reversible side effects
from therapy (e.g., fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, and chemical
pancreatitis).
Surveillance for infected female phlebotomine sand flies, the vectors of
leishmanial parasites, has been conducted in and near urban and periurban
areas of Iraq where U.S. military personnel have been stationed. The
infection rates for sand flies collected in and near specific areas were as
follows: 2.3 percent (9 of 390) for Tikrit, 1.6 percent (315 of 19 937) for
An Nasiriyah, 0.08 percent (one of 1307) for Baghdad, 0.06 percent (one of
1795) for Balad, and 0 percent (none of 448) for Diwaniyah. 5 percent (8 of
149) of PCR-positive pooled aliquots of sand flies collected from An
Nasiriyah were positive by species-specific PCR for _L. infantum_, which can
cause visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis.
U.S. health-care providers should consider the possibility of CL in persons
with chronic skin lesions who were deployed to Southwest/Central Asia or who
were in other areas where leishmaniasis is endemic and that of VL [visceral
leishmaniasis] in such persons with persistent, febrile illnesses, especially
if associated with other manifestations suggestive of VL (e.g., splenomegaly
and pancytopenia). Information about diagnosing and treating CL and VL has
been published (1,5). Both WRAMC and CDC provide diagnostic services and the
antileishmanial compound sodium stibogluconate.
For treatment of health-care beneficiaries of the military, health-care
providers should contact WRAMC, telephone 202-782-6740. For treatment of
civilians, providers should contact CDC's Drug Service, telephone
404-639-3670.

[The US Assistant Secretary of Defense has estimated that the incubation
period is usually under 6 months and has consequently imposed a 12-month ban
on donating blood from the date of departure from Iraq, estimating that this
will result in the loss of a further 12 375 blood donors, as about 2/3 of US
troops in Iraq are already excluded from donating blood due to possible
malaria exposure.

The risk of leishmania from persons being stationed in the Middle East and
Afghanistan has also been addressed by the American Association of Blood
Banks:
