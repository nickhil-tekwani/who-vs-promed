News of the response
1st birth at ETC
------------------
- [A girl] is the 1st baby born to a patient who has been cured of Ebola. She was born on Sun 6 Jan 2019 at the Ebola treatment center in Beni. She weighs 3.7 kg [8.2 lb], she is in good health and she is not contaminated by Ebola. Her mother, who was pregnant at the time, was infected with the virus and admitted to the ETC in December 2018. When she was cured, she was discharged from the ETC but she continued to be monitored to monitor the baby's development. Given the risk that the baby was also contaminated, the mother agreed to give birth in the ETC. Fortunately, the baby has been tested twice and the results have come back negative.

Vaccination
-----------
Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 57 471 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, and Tshopo provinces as of 9 Jan 2019 can be seen in the report above].

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
Disease outbreak news: update 10 Jan 2019
------------------------------------------------------
WHO and partners continue to respond to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in one of the most complex settings possible. A decline in case incidence has been seen in Beni, the former epicentre. This is a strong positive indication of how effective the response can be despite multiple challenges. However, in Beni and elsewhere, trends must be interpreted cautiously, as delayed detection of cases is expected following recent temporary disruption in response activities due to insecurity. Nevertheless, WHO and partners remain committed, under the government's leadership and through collaboration across agencies, to addressing challenges and ending the outbreak.

As of 8 Jan 2019, there have been a total of 628 EVD cases (580 confirmed and 48 probable), including 383 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 61%). Thus far, 222 people have recovered, been discharged from an Ebola treatment centre (ETC) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. [See updated numbers as of 9 Jan in [1] above]

During the last 21 days (19 Dec 2018-8 Jan 2019), cases have been reported from 10 health zones where the outbreak remains active, including: Katwa (18), Butembo (16), Oicha (13), Beni (13), Kalungata (6), Mabalako (5), Komanda (3), Musienene (2), Kyondo (1), and Nyankunde (1). Overall, cases have occurred in localised hotspots within 16 health zones found in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 1 -- see below). Surveillance activities are being maintained to rapidly detect resurgences or reintroduction events in all areas.

Trends in numbers of new cases occurring (Figure 2 -- see below) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas, with encouraging declines in case incidence in areas such as Beni. Hard-earned progress could still be lost from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts.

Amongst confirmed and probable EVD cases, 61% (385/628) were female and 30% (189/628) were children aged less than 18 years. This includes a high number of cases in infants aged less than 1 year (38) and 1-4 years (58). While investigations to understand the risk factors for this disproportionate burden are ongoing, response teams continue to prioritise these population groups to mitigate, wherever possible, the risk of transmission.

All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, and in a traveller returning from Burundi to Sweden. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas. International travellers who may have come into contact with the virus, including a doctor who returned to the United States of America after providing medical assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are also being followed closely; all remain asymptomatic.

Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 8 Jan 2019 (n=628)*

*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning -- trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

[3] Travel advisories
- Thu 10 Jan 2019. Health officials fear setbacks in effort to contain Ebola outbreak
[PJ Media, abridged, edited]
https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/health-officials-fear-setbacks-in-effort-to-contain-ebola-outbreak/
[Byline: Bridget Johnson]

The World Health Organization warned in its most recent Ebola update this month [January 2019] that containment of the 2nd-largest outbreak of the virus in history could suffer disastrous setbacks if the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to deteriorate.

The [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its travel advisory for the region on [Wed 9 Jan 2019], covering the North Kivu and Ituri provinces that are under a travel warning from the [US] State Department because of militant activity and dangers to civilians.

"The armed conflict and violence in the outbreak area are hampering response activities including early identification of cases, and monitoring of 'contacts' (people who may have been exposed to Ebola)," the CDC said. "The North Kivu and Ituri provinces are among the most populated in DRC. These provinces share borders with other countries (Rwanda and Uganda) with frequent cross-border movement for trade activities. The provinces have been experiencing a prolonged humanitarian crisis and deteriorating security situation, which is limiting public health efforts to respond to this outbreak."

As of 2 Jan 2019, the WHO says, there have been a total of 609 Ebola cases including 370 deaths and 208 recoveries. Cases have been reported the most in females ages 15 to 49. 16 percent of cases were in children under 5 years old, and 7 percent in babies less than a year old. 29 cases occurred in pregnant women.

"Thorough contact tracing during initial case investigations remains difficult in light of continued community resistance and the deteriorating security situation in the field ... this resulted in a number of new confirmed cases not being identified as potential contacts," the WHO said. 2/3 of known cases had documented contact with someone who had Ebola, and 37 percent had attended the funeral of someone who had died of Ebola. 34 percent were exposed to the virus in both ways.

Health officials have investigated the potential spread of the virus to other parts of the country or Uganda, but have not confirmed the outbreak's spread.

Not only can regional travel spread the virus, but also the internal displacement that happens during armed conflict.

The country is concurrently battling epidemics of cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, and malaria.

"Hard-earned progress could still be lost to rebound levels of transmission resulting from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts," the WHO said of the Ebola fight. "...WHO's risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low."

While the WHO advises against any travel or trade with the DRC, the agency is not recommending restrictions.

[The statement that the "While the WHO advises against any travel or trade with the DRC, the agency is not recommending restrictions" is not very clear. They warn about the risk of transmission increasing and it is not only Ebola that threatens the public health, but also malaria, cholera, and vaccine-derived polio. - Mod.LK]

-Thu 10 Jan 2018. Rwanda subjecting DRC travellers to 21 day quarantines. RFI
From: Vicki Hansen-Landis <viki.hansen-landis@internationalsos.com> [edited]

"Apparently Rwandan MOH is going to start enhanced screening and potential 21 day quarantine of people coming in from Ebola areas of the DRC. No details yet as to what the quarantine entails or what criteria determine who will enter it and for how long. Also unclear how Rwanda is planning to determine if people have been in "Ebola affected areas"..... self reporting NEVER does the trick!"

[ProMED thanks Viki Hansen-Landis for submitting these travel advisories. If any reader has further information on the Rwandan travel advisory, ProMED would welcome that information, particularly in response to the questions raised by the submitter in her post. With travel advisories being enacted by a country neighboring the DRC, one would think it is time for WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern.

The upgraded CDC travel alert for the DRC is level 2, practice enhanced precautions. See https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/ebola-democratic-republic-of-the-congo

"Key points:
- There is an outbreak of Ebola in the North Kivu (Kivu Nord) and Ituri provinces in the northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- The outbreak is in a part of the country identified by the US State Department as a "do not travel" zone because of armed group activity and major outbreaks of violence targeting civilians.
- The armed conflict and violence in the outbreak area are hampering response activities including early identification of cases, and monitoring of "contacts" (people who may have been exposed to Ebola).
- Travelers to this area could be infected with Ebola if they come into contact with an infected person's blood or other body fluids.
- Travelers should seek medical care immediately if they develop fever, headache, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, weakness, vomiting, stomach pain, rash, or red eyes during or after travel."

Scientists develop universal Ebola treatment effective in single dose
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pan-_Ebolavirus_ immunotherapy would provide a rapid-response treatment during Ebola virus outbreaks. In [the current] issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Wec et al. (2019) and Bornholdt et al. (2019) optimize the MBP134 mAb cocktail through antibody affinity maturation, improving its protective efficacy against 3 Ebolaviruses: EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV.

ref 1: Wec AZ, Bornholdt ZA, He S, et al. Development of a human antibody cocktail that deploys multiple functions to confer pan-_Ebolavirus_ protection. Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25(1): 39-48.e5; https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/pdfExtended/S1931-3128(18)30631-0

Highlights
----------
- Cocktail of 2 human mAbs affording pan-ebolavirus neutralization was selected.
- Cocktail outperforms single antibody in protecting against EBOV infection in guinea pigs.
- 2nd-generation cocktail with optimized Fc effector functions enhances protection.
- Single low dose of optimized cocktail protects guinea pigs against 2 ebolaviruses

Summary. Passive administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a promising therapeutic approach for Ebola virus disease (EVD). However, all mAbs and mAb cocktails that have entered clinical development are specific for a single member of the _Ebolavirus_ genus, Ebola virus (EBOV), and ineffective against outbreak-causing Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) and Sudan virus (SUDV). Here, we advance MBP134, a cocktail of 2 broadly neutralizing human mAbs, ADI-15878 from an EVD survivor and ADI-23774 from the same survivor but specificity-matured for SUDV GP binding affinity, as a candidate pan-ebolavirus therapeutic. MBP134 potently neutralized all ebolaviruses and demonstrated greater protective efficacy than ADI-15878 alone in EBOV-challenged guinea pigs. A 2nd-generation cocktail, MBP134AF, engineered to effectively harness natural killer (NK) cells afforded additional improvement relative to its precursor in protective efficacy against EBOV and SUDV in guinea pigs. MBP134AF is an optimized mAb cocktail suitable for evaluation as a pan-ebolavirus therapeutic in nonhuman primates.

ref 2: Bornholdt ZA, Herbert AS, Mire CE, et al. A two-antibody pan-ebolavirus cocktail confers broad therapeutic protection in ferrets and nonhuman primates. Cell Host Microbe. 2019 Jan 9;25(1):49-58.e5; https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/pdf/S1931-3128(18)30632-2.pdf

Highlights
----------
- The mAb cocktail MBP134AF protects ferrets from lethal EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV challenge.
- A single 25-mg/kg dose of MBP134AF protects NHPs challenged with EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV.
- Both CHOK1-AF cell-produced and plant-produced MBP134AF is therapeutically effective.

In brief, Bornholdt et al examine the therapeutic efficacy of MBP134AF, a pan-ebolavirus cocktail comprising 2 human mAbs. MBP134AF reverted lethal disease in both ferrets and nonhuman primates challenged with 3 divergent ebolaviruses. A single dose of MBP134AF administered post-infection was sufficient to protect nonhuman primates from ebolavirus disease.

[- Wed 10 Jan 2018. Commentary on the papers
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/01/drc-records-more-ebola-presidential-election-called

Every patient in this outbreak has received medical treatment for the virus, including ZMapp, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. Today [10 Jan 2019], 2 new studies in Cell Host & Microbe showed that a new cocktail of Ebola virus mAbs was protective in guinea pigs, ferrets, and rhesus macaques.

All tested therapies were effective for more than one of the 6 viruses in the Ebola family, of which 4 cause deadly hemorrhagic fevers in humans.

In the 1st study, 2 antibodies isolated from an Ebola survivor offered protection against both Sudan ebolavirus and Ebola virus in guinea pigs. The next-generation human mAb cocktail, MBP134AF, exhibited glycoproteins that targeted all 6 strains of Ebola, the study authors said.

In a 2nd study, the cocktail, given in a single dose, was shown protective in 8 ferrets and 10 monkeys.

"The developmental path of MBP134AF presents a model for the rapid design of next-generation antiviral immunotherapeutics targeting World Health Organization-priority pathogens," the study authors concluded.
