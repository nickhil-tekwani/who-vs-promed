[Central America has had a consistent record of reporting outbreaks
of classical swine fever (CSF) to the OIE over the last decade:
Honduras in 2004, Nicaragua (again) in 2004 and 2003, Guatemala in
2002, El Salvador in 2001, and Costa Rica in 1997. Belize last
reported CSF in 1988, and Panama has been free of the disease for
over 40 years, since 1961. Given the threat posed by an outbreak of
this disease, Mexico and other nearby countries should watch
developments carefully. - Mod.PC]
