Outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O26 infection in Ireland
An outbreak of Vero cytotoxin producing _Escherichia coli_ O26 infection
has affected seven children aged 18 months to 3 years at a child care
facility in Donegal, Ireland. The affected children became ill between 29
September and 4 October. The main symptom was diarrhoea; all but one, who
still has loose stools, are now well. Screening identified no spread of the
infection to adults and carers. The child care facility was closed
voluntarily.
We are not aware of any previous similar outbreaks having occurred in
Ireland. _E. coli_ O26 is not routinely screened for in Ireland or the
United Kingdom and cases may occur therefore undiagnosed. Reported by Ann
Shannon (ann.shannon@nwhb.ie), North Western Health Board, and Derval Igoe
(dervaligoe@ndsc.ie), National Disease Surveillance Centre, Dublin, Ireland.
