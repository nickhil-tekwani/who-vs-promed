Outbreaks of anthrax affecting cattle have been identified by ICA and
Corpoica in different parts of the country.

Health care organizations are assessing the risk factors. In the case
of Cordoba department, it is expected to take a week to investigate
the livestock situation and determine the extent of the disease.

Teresita Beltran, director of ICA, said that after determining the
situation, she will schedule a meeting with the guilds and farmers to
determine the collaborative financing of the response. ICA has
indicated that it has some 3000 doses of vaccine on hand.

[This is an uninformative report of what may be a difficult
situation. Over the past few years, there have been sporadic outbreaks
in La Gujira and Cundinamarca. Cordoba in the northwest is a new area.
This situation, along with the remark about multiple outbreaks in
different parts of the country, are worrying. Of course, it could just
be a summary 2010 annual report by the agencies. It would be
appreciated if our Colombian members with knowledge of what is going
on would share it with us. - Mod.MHJ
