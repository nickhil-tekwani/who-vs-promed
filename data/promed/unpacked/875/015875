Suspected NLV Outbreak Affects Nearly 175 People on an Alaskan Cruise
---------------------------------------------------------------------
VANCOUVER: Dozens of passengers aboard a Holland America week-long cruise to
Alaska fell ill with what a cruise line spokesman says may be a common
virus. The Ryndam docked here on Thu 25 Jul 2002 after the Alaska voyage. In
all, 163 passengers and nine crew members were reported to be suffering
flu-like symptoms.
Cruise ships must report an illness when more than 3 per cent of passengers
on board are affected, said Holland America spokesman Erik Elvejord. In this
case, nearly 13 per cent fell ill. A reported 1266 people were on board.
The cruise line is awaiting lab test results to determine the culprit but
Elvejord said Holland America thinks a Norwalk-like virus (NLV) is to blame.
He said cases of NLV have been reportedly recently in Alaska. The ship's
crew has disinfected all rooms and common areas of the ship.
NLV is believed to have sickened 100 of 170 campers at a Christian
children's camp on British Columbia's coast northwest of here. "These
outbreaks are very common," said Jamal Harb of Health Canada. "NLV is on the
increase here in British Columbia and in Alberta.

[Norwalk-like virus infection in closed communities (schools, hospitals,
care homes, cruise liners, tour coaches, etc.), where there is opportunity
for rapid person-to-person spread, has been common throughout the winter
and early summer of 2002. The apparent greater vulnerability of Alaskan
cruise liners (see below) probably merely reflects a greater awareness of
the hazard. - Mod.CP]
