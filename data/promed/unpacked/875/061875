Core rot disease affecting Himachal Pradesh apple crop
-----------------------------------------------
This year's [2005] apple crop in Himachal Pradesh has been severely
affected by apple core rot [ACR]. The disease has spread because
farmers are not using fertilizers, which are costly following the
abolishment of government subsidies.
The worst-affected are the orchards that produce early apples of 4
popular varieties: Red Delicious, Rich-a-Red, Red June and Tydeman's
Early, all of which grow above 1800 meters in the hill State. ACR
disease has destroyed more than 10 percent of the apple plantations
in the State so far.
First spotted in Mandi, in the heart of the Karsog belt, ACR has now
been reported in adjoining areas of Kullu and Shimla, attacking the
crop and weakening roots. The mysterious fungal disease has no
external manifestation but causes apples to rot and finally drop off
the trees.
Apple growers in Himachal Pradesh are struggling to survive because
of escalating costs of fertilizers and insecticides. They want the
government to increase the subsidy on fertilizers and insecticides.
Gokul Chand, an apple grower, said that, if ACR spreads, the economy
of 3 districts in Himachal Pradesh will be severely affected.
"Farmers will request that the government look into our demands,
firstly to increase the subsidy on Ken fertilizers, and secondly to
provide a subsidy on fungicides and insecticides. A special team
should be constituted to look into why only our district is so badly
affected."
According to the Horticulture department in Himachal Pradesh, ACR can
be a result of imbalance in climatic conditions.
P.C. Bhanu, Deputy Director, Horticulture, Himachal Pradesh, said
that ACR occurs when there is a change in temperature and humidity,
because the crop requires suitable climatic conditions to grow. Rains
in May may also be a possible cause for the disease.
The Horticulture department has recommended extensive use of
fertilizers and insecticides to get rid of the disease.
ACR has struck the apple crop in the State after 20 years. Popularly
known as the "Apple Bowl of India," Himachal Pradesh is the largest
producer of apples in the country. It is the mainstay of the local
economy, with hundreds of growers earning their livelihood from the
orchard industry.
Spread across 9 districts of the State, grown on a land area of 96
000 hectares, the industry provides employment to almost 800 000
people.

[Apple core rot [ACR] is caused by many different fungal species. ACR
is characterized by infection within the locules (the cavity of the
ovary or seed cavity), without penetration into the fruit flesh.
External symptoms on the fruit are quite subtle, and, typically, the
disease goes unnoticed until the fruit is cut open. External symptoms
may include premature ripening and fruit drop.
ACR has been recorded in the United States, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and the Netherlands. The
most common fungi associated with ACR are _Alternaria_,
_Stemphylium_, _Cladosporium_, _Ulocladium_, _Epicoccum_,
_Coniothyrium_, and _Pleospora herbarum_. Many cultivars of apple are
affected, including Delicious, Golden Delicious, Gravenstein, and
Idared.
ACR fungi species colonize the flower parts as soon as the blossoms
open, allowing the pathogens to enter the developing fruit through an
opening in the calyx. ACR is primarily a problem during years with
light fruit set or in years when dry weather in early summer is
followed by heavy rains in late summer. In addition, wet weather
during bloom may cause conditions favorable for the fungi to produce
spores.
Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to ACR. This difference
is primarily related to the presence of the sinus opening at the
calyx end of the fruit. "Delicious," "Gravenstein," and "Idared" are
susceptible cultivars and should be avoided in areas prone to ACR
problems. In some studies, fungicides used during bloom have been
successful in controlling ACR, but the results are erratic, and
fungicides are rarely recommended. Cultural practices, such as tree
training and pruning (which open up the tree canopy and allow good
airflow and light penetration), will help to promote fast drying of
plant surfaces, reducing the potential for spore development. These
practices should help to reduce the incidence of ACR.
