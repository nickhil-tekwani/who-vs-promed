Pfizer removes BVD vaccine from the German market
-------------------------------------------------
Pfizer will temporarily remove the product Pregsure off the German
market. Pregsure is a vaccine against Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).
The product is temporarily withdrawn from the market in relation to
the prevention of hemophilia in calves. There may be a link between
the disease and the vaccine.

"In Germany, most of these calves with hemophilia were found of which
80 percent of the calves were born from cows that were vaccinated
with the BVD vaccine. Although there is no evidence that there is a
relation with the vaccine, we still recommend the vaccine taken off
the market for further investigation," a Pfizer spokesperson said.

Previous research on the vaccine shows that the drug itself is fine.
"It could be that the vaccine affects the immune system and hence
triggers the formation of hemophilia in calves," Pfizer explained.

Pfizer intends to withdraw the product for a year.

[Since 2007, an apparently novel disease in young calves has been
recorded in several European countries (Germany, France, Belgium, UK,
Netherlands, Italy). The disease was characterized by a bleeding
disorder (haemorrhagic diathesis), with profuse hemorrhages in
neonatal calves. Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia also obtained the
popular name of "blood sweating."

In early December 2009, the French Buiatrics Association hosted a
2-days satellite symposium on the syndrome to its European Buiatrics
Forum, held in Marseilles. This symposium, chaired by Prof Wolfgang
Klee (Ludwig Maximilians University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
Munich, Germany), included 5 sessions:
Session 1: Epidemiology (distribution, incidence, risk factors,
common characteristics, puzzling observations); 8 papers.
Session 2: Clinical signs, treatment options and results, subclinical
forms, and hematology; disorders of differential diagnostic interest; 4 papers.
Session 3: Gross and microscopic pathology; 3 papers.
Session 4: Etiological investigations; 5 papers.
Session 5: General discussion: Case definitions and nomenclature;
Public health concerns (the colostrums industry); Hypotheses on
etiology and pathogenesis; Areas and avenues for further research;
Co-ordination of research efforts.

The papers addressing etiology included, among others, the following
2 comments:
1. "The findings are suggestive for an immune mediated mechanism, of
which the primary cause could be both toxic (natural toxins,
medication, vaccination) or infectious."
2. "Vaccine, or vaccine adjunct induced damage of foetal bone marrow
remains a possibility, although an immune mediated mechanism seems
unlikely. Contamination of cow feed by mycotoxins, particularly
myelotoxic trichothecenes, remains a possibility. Overall, the
findings in this outbreak correspond better with an insult causing
direct myelotoxicity, rather than an insult inducing immune mediated
marrow destruction. Thus we propose that this condition is caused by
direct myelotoxicity to calf bone marrow that has occurred in utero."

Pfizer's decision is possibly related to the fact that cows producing
haemorrhagic calves have been vaccinated with their Pregsure IBR
vaccine and found to have excessive levels of antibodies to BVDV. We
