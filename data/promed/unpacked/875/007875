Antibiotic-resistant "superbug" genes originated in India were found in the High Arctic, a new study has shown. The genes associated with resistance to antibiotics were discovered in soil samples from the Kongsfjorden region, a remote place in the High Arctic, said a study published in the academic journal Environment International on [Mon 4 Feb 2019] [1].

Some of the detected genes, which are almost certainly not "local" to the Arctic, can confer resistance to multiple drugs. The discovery confirmed the spread of blaNDM-1 (called New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) into the High Arctic.

By far, a total of 131 such genes have been discovered by scientists, including the one first detected in urban India in 2008. Since British scientists found the "superbug" in New Delhi's public water supply later, the resistant genes have been found in over 100 countries, including new variants.

It is estimated that some 70% of bacteria that cause infections are resistant to at least one antibiotic used to treat them, largely fueled by their overuse. "What humans have done through excess use of antibiotics on the global scale is accelerate the rate of evolution, creating a new world of resistant strains that never existed before," said David Graham, a professor of Ecosystems Engineering at the Newcastle University in Britain. "This finding has huge implications for the global antibiotic-resistant spread," he warned.

By 2050, 10 million people could die each year if existing antibiotics continue to lose their effectiveness, according to the UK Review on Antimicrobial Resistance.

Abstract
--------
"Soils in tropical and temperate locations are known to be a sink for the genetic potential of anthropogenic-driven acquired antibiotic resistance (AR). In contrast, accumulation of acquired AR is less probable in most Polar soils, providing a platform for characterizing background resistance and establishing a benchmark for assessing AR spread. Here, high-throughput qPCR and geochemistry were used to quantify the abundance and diversity of both antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and selected mobile genetic elements (MGEs) across 8 soil clusters in the Kongsfjorden region of Svalbard in the High Arctic. Relative ARG levels ranged by over 2 orders of magnitude [10ˆ(-6) to 10ˆ(-4) copies/16S rRNA gene copy), and showed a gradient of potential human and wildlife impacts across clusters as evidenced by altered geochemical conditions and increased "foreign" ARG abundances (i.e., allochthonous [denoting sediment or rock that originated at a distance from its present position]), including blaNDM-1. Impacted clusters exhibited 100x higher total ARGs and MGEs in tandem with elevated 2ary nutrients, especially available P [phosphorus?] that is typically low and limiting in Arctic soils. In contrast, ARGs in less-impacted clusters correlated strongly to local soil lithology [the general physical characteristics of a rock]. The most plausible source of exogenous P and allochthonous ARGs in this region is bird and other wildlife guano, disseminated either by local human wastes or via direct carriage and deposition. Regardless of pathway, accumulation of apparent allochthonous ARGs and MGEs in High Arctic soils is concerning, highlighting the importance of characterizing Arctic sites now to establish benchmarks for tracking AR spread around the world."

blaNDM (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases such as NDM-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, etc.) is a member of a group of enzymes called carbapenemases that destroy carbapenem antibiotics, as well as most other beta-lactam antibiotics. Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that include ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems commonly is the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases. Other resistance mechanisms, which include reduced affinity of penicillin-binding protein (PBPs) for carbapenems, increased efflux of the beta-lactam antibiotics, or decreased permeability of the outer membrane due to loss of outer membrane porin channels, may be combined with production of the carbapenemase. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases such as KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.); NDMs (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases such as NDM-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, etc.); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases).

Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids or other mobile genetic elements. Mobile genetic elements can facilitate spread of resistance genes among organisms of the same species or even different bacterial species. Mobile genetic elements frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics, such as colistin and tigecycline.

Svalbard is group of 3 remote Norwegian islands (Spitsbergen, Nordaustlandet and Edgeoya) in the Arctic Ocean, directly north of continental Norway and 1300 km (approx. 810 mi) from the North Pole, with no agriculture or industry and a very small human population (2667 residents) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard). A video of Svalbard is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NhIRwCq428. The main settlement, Longyearbyen, has an elected local government and a university center; also there is a Russian mining community of Barentsburg, the research station of Ny-Alesund, and the mining outpost of Sveagruva. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a secure seed bank near Longyearbyen, 120 m (approx. 390 ft), buried inside a sandstone mountain, that preserves a wide variety of plant seeds to ensure against the loss of seeds in other genebanks during large-scale regional or global crises (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault). Approximately 60% of the archipelago is covered with glaciers, and the islands feature many mountains, fjords, and local wildlife, which attract tour groups that get about on snowmobiles and dog sleds (https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Svalbard and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFJ-ze2-SqU). Thus the region is not pristine.
