Measles outbreak kills 11 children in northern Liberia
------------------------------------------------------
Measles has claimed the lives of 11 children in Henry Town in north-western Gbarpolu County in northern Liberia. The Liberia News Agency correspondent in the county quotes health officials as saying that the disease claimed the lives of the 11 children within one week.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of health and the Liberia National Red Cross Society in the county over the weekend commenced a training workshop on measles for 50 volunteers and health workers assigned in the town. The Liberia National Red Cross Society - Gbarpolu Chapter and the County Health Team have also begun a 14-day intensive de-worming awareness campaign in the 5 health districts of the county.

Addressing participants at the start of the workshop, LNRCS Field Officer, Seth Tarweh, pointed out that the campaign is aimed at enhancing the government's information dissemination about the measles vaccination campaign that is to be officially launched in Bopolu on 8 May 2015.

Sudan: 169 Measles Cases, 27 Deaths Reported in Sudan
-----------------------------------------------------
According to the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and UNICEF measles has been reported in 32 localities in 14 states across Sudan. In response, a nationwide measles vaccination campaign was launched on 22 Apr 2015 and will continue for 10 days. Some 1.7 million people aged between 6 months to 15 years in the 28 worst affected localities are targeted. These localities are in Red Sea, Kassala, Sennar, West Darfur, East Darfur, and North Darfur states, OCHA [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] reported. WHO and UNICEF are supporting the vaccination campaign with logistics, supervision and monitoring, in collaboration with Sudanese non-governmental organisations.

Of the total number of reported measles cases, 69 percent are below 15 years of age, including 52 percent under the age of 5. West Darfur remains the worst affected state, with 441 confirmed cases and 5 deaths. Kassala has had 365 confirmed cases and 5 deaths, while in Red Sea state there have been 263 cases and 4 deaths, UNICEF reported on 23 Apr 2015. Sudan has one of the highest levels of malnutrition in Africa. 36 percent of the children are stunted, which is a primary manifestation of undernutrition. For malnourished children, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, ear infections, pneumonia, and severe diarrhoea.

Sudan targets 8 million children in vaccination campaign against measles
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aid agencies are struggling to contain a massive measles outbreak in Sudan. The Ministry of Health is leading a United Nations and international effort to vaccinate 8 million children under age 5 against the sometimes fatal disease, which so far has claimed 27 child lives.

Aid agencies have just completed the 1st phase of an immunization campaign in which 2 million Sudanese children were vaccinated against measles. They now plan to fan out throughout the country to immunize millions of other young children and young adults under age 30 who are at risk.

Speaking by phone from the capital, Khartoum, the representative for the UN Children's Fund in Sudan, Geert Cappelaere, says the country is suffering its biggest measles outbreak in years. He attributes much of the problem to a lack of routine immunizations against the disease and to the inability to reach several areas of conflict.

Cappelaere says about one-half-million children are being deprived of humanitarian aid, including essential vaccines in Jebel Marra, which borders northern, central, and southern Darfur, the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan and some areas in the Blue Nile states. "Because of conflict, we have not been able to access the population in some areas for the last 4 years," said Cappelaere. "So, we have there a massive group of children that are unvaccinated and may be one of the causes of the outbreak of measles we are having today."

Cappelaere is appealing to the government of Sudan and all rebel forces active in the country to allow aid agencies immediate access to no-go areas so they can immunize the hundreds of thousands of children who have been deprived of life-saving vaccines for several years. Over the last 4 months, UNICEF reports there have been 2200 confirmed cases and 4000 suspected cases of measles in Sudan. It says that is 4 times higher than the average annual measles caseload over the last few years. It says 54 percent of confirmed cases are in children under age 5, but 28 percent are among people over age 15. It says 14 of 18 states in Sudan are affected by the outbreak.

Sudan currently is trying to persuade the international community to relieve it of its outstanding foreign debt, which the International Monetary Fund estimates at USD 46 billion.

UNICEF representative Cappelaere tells VOA that creditors should not just look at the debt from a purely financial perspective. He says he would like to see that debt relief, if granted to Sudan, made conditional on the government spending some of that money for the health and well-being of its people.

Cappelaere notes measles does not stop at borders. He says Sudan's measles outbreak also is threatening neighbouring Ethiopia, South Sudan and Chad. As a consequence, he says similar vaccination campaigns are taking place in those countries to protect their children and put a stop to the outbreak in the entire region.

Measles cases reported in Florida
---------------------------------
Five cases of measles have been reported in Florida during the past month, health officials say. The cases are in St. Lucie and Indian River counties. "We should be concerned in the way that if we see one, that means we could have another one, and from that one we could still keep getting other cases and seeing other people exposed to just one case. It could happen," said Adlin Santiago, RN Specialist at the Health Department in Hillsborough County.

Santiago and other health experts recommend vaccination as the best way for people to protect themselves from the disease, which can be deadly especially for young children. However, pediatrician Dr. Jose Jimenez said once or twice a week parents tell him they don't want their child vaccinated. Usually he's able to convince them to do it -- but not always.

Students are required to have certain vaccinations, including measles, but there are exceptions for religious and medical reasons. Statewide, 93.3 percent of kindergarten students had all required immunizations as of November 2014. In Hillsborough County, 92 percent of kindergartners were vaccinated as of this fall, according to Department of Health data. The rate in Pinellas [County] is 91.3 percent, in Polk [County] it is 96.4 percent and in Pasco [County] it is 95.4 percent.

Student tests positive for measles in Forsyth County, Georgia
-------------------------------------------------------------
An elementary school student in Forsyth County recently tested positive for measles. Amy Bartlett, principal of Sharon Elementary School, sent parents a letter confirming a 3rd grader has the highly infectious disease. "We do not mean to cause alarm but want to keep all of our parents informed when a case has been reported," Bartlett said in the letter.

A fever is usually the 1st sign of a measles infection, followed by a hacking cough, runny nose, and pinkeye. A red or reddish-brown rash the forehead and spreads down over the face, neck and body, then to the arms and feet. Children who develop any measles symptoms should see a healthcare provider as soon as possible.

Elimination of measles and rubella in Europe by 2015
----------------------------------------------------
For several years, the WHO's Europe Region and its member states have worked towards the goal of eliminating measles and rubella in Europe no later than by the end of 2015, EPI-NEWS 17/09 and 16/13. To achieve this goal, a persistent minimum 95 percent coverage for the 2 MMR vaccinations is required throughout all of the region's 53 member states. In addition to this high vaccination coverage, all countries shall have in place high­standard disease surveillance and the capacity to respond rapidly to any suspicion of a measles case with diagnostics and secondary prevention in the form of post­exposure prophylaxis through vaccination/immunoglobulin.

To document the progress made in each country, a structure was established based on experiences from the polio­eradication campaign.

This structure includes the appointment of independent national verification commissions for measles and rubella. These commissions are responsible for assessing each country's progress and status quo in relation to the objective of arresting circulation of measles and rubella virus. The national data are collected annually in a report, which is submitted to the WHO and to the independent Regional Verification Commission for Europe (EVC) which carries the supranational responsibility for assessing and classifying each country's status quo in the process towards elimination of the 2 diseases.

At a WHO meeting held at the end of March [2015], overall feedback was provided from the regional verification committee, based on 2013 data. The EVC has assessed that 22 countries meet the conditions for elimination of measles, in 13 countries the virus still circulates (is endemic), whereas in 14 countries the data were inconclusive/lacking and therefore no final assessment/status quo could be determined.

For rubella, it was assessed that a total of 23 countries meet the conditions for elimination of the virus, whereas in 9 countries the virus was still in circulation, and for 17 countries the data were inconclusive/lacking and therefore no final status/assessment could be prepared.

Measles warning for South Devon after 2 cases confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------
Public Health England is advising parents in Devon to ensure their children are fully protected by the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine following 2 confirmed cases of measles in children. Letters advising parents to ensure their children are fully protected against measles by having had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine and that measles is circulating in the community has been issued to parents at some local schools.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine offers full protection against the 3 illnesses, provided the 1st dose is given after 12 months of age and the 2nd after 18 months of age. Unless advised otherwise, parents should follow the recommended NHS vaccination schedule. The vaccine may also protect your child if given within 72 hours of exposure to someone with measles. If already infected with measles, the MMR will not cause any harm.

Dr Nick Young, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control (CCDC) for Public Health England in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, said:

"I'd appeal to any parents who have not yet had their children vaccinated to get them protected as soon as possible through their GP. Children should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine for maximum protection. MMR not only protects them, but also limits the chances of the virus spreading more widely, for example to children who are too young to have the vaccine and to adults who may be more vulnerable to the disease. It is important to remember that MMR is a highly effective and safe vaccine." Information about the MMR vaccine can be found by visiting http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pages/mmr-vaccine.aspx.
