In reply to the moderator's queries (Does anyone know if specimens were
collected and sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for typing? If so, what
were the results? - Mod. JW) on the recent Promed message referenced as
follows :
Over a month ago (27.05.1997) the Focal Point of the Pacific Public
Heath Surveillance Network (PPHSN) posted an INFLUENZA warning message
to its members, via the combined email/fax listserver called PACNET.
The message relayed amongst other sources, some ProMED-mail information
posted by Pr Alan W. Hampson, Deputy Director, WHO Collaborating Centre
for Reference and Research on Influenza, in Melbourne Australia [PRO>
Influenza B threat - Australia (3), Friday 09 May 1997], and was also
taking note of a suspected outbreak of influenza in Papua New Guinea
(PNG) commented on by PACNEWS, a regional press agency [PNG - influenza
: NBC - PNG : PACNEWS 3 : Friday May 23 15:11 1997].
In spite of several attempts to get further information from the Papua New
Guinean health authorities on this so-called influenza outbreak, we have not
been able to get any sort of confirmation so far, regarding the outcomes of
the investigations carried out locally. It was impossible, in particular, to
obtain confirmation on any samples possibly taken for further investigations
from either patients or dead persons.
On a complementary approach, through the Pacific Public Heath Surveillance
Network no contacts have been able to provide more indirect information
either:
* none of our laboratory contacts in the region has indicated that they
were working on samples from Papua New Guinea, in relation with this
suspected influenza outbreak.
* no other institutional partners of the PPHSN (e.g. WHO collaborating
centers or offices) notified any further details regarding this outbreak
We are currently still trying our best to obtain useful information.

In answer to the Moderator's question about whether specimens were collected
from the influenza outbreak reported from Finschafen area in PNG and sent for
typing, I understand no specimens were received by the WHO Collaborating
Centre for Influenza Reference and Research in Melbourne (Dr. Alan Hampson).
