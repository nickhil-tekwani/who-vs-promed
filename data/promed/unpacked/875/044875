This Sunday [16 Jan 2022] the death of a man was registered who was suspected [to have an infection] with a hantavirus. Health authorities began an epidemiological investigation in the Astillero sector to determine where the infection was acquired.

A health authority confirmed the death of a man who was suspected of a hantavirus [infection] in Majllin in the Los Lagos region. The patient was hospitalized in the Tamuco hospital.

According to the information [provided], on Friday [15 Jan 2022] a rapid test was done that was positive for a hantavirus. He then was moved to the Araucania region where he died on Sunday morning [16 Jan 2022].

The dead individual was about 40 years old and was a resident of the Astillero costal area. Due to this, an environmental epidemiological investigation is carried out in this area to establish the site of contagion.

The Los Lagos SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat], Marcela Cardenas, stated that among the possible places is an outbuilding near the man's residence that was used as a storage shed. The shed was used to store hay and forage and apparently had not been ventilated.

Following the case, educational and cleaning work is being reinforced in sectors that receive visitors during the summer.

This Wednesday [12 Jan 2022] the health authority confirmed the 1st death from a hantavirus infection in the Nuble region this 2022. The individual is a 29 year old man who would have acquired the virus in the Andes area of the region after carrying out sport fishing activities. The deceased, who lived in Chillan, died last Friday [7 Jan 2022] at the Herminda Martin Clinical Hospital.

The SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat], Marcela Cuadra, reported that the environmental epidemiological investigation established the Los Lleuques sector, in the Pinto community, as a possible place of infection. There, the man took part in sport fishing, where he entered an area with bushes during the first 2 weeks of December [2021].

The patient presented symptoms in the last few days of the year [2021], being hospitalized in the intensive care facility until his death due to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a diagnosis confirmed by the Institute of Public Health (ISP). His case is the 3rd reported in 2021. The other 2 were a woman aged 24 and a girl of 12.

Given the situation, the SEREMI reinforced educational work in the rural sector, for people who work in the fields and for tourists. In Pinto, hygiene kits were delivered to cabin owners to avoid new cases of infection.

[The above reports are of 2 cases of a hantavirus infection in different regions of Chile. Although not specified in these or previous reports from the regions, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur there every year. Andes virus can be transmitted directly person to person but only with very close physical proximity, usually within the family. However, unless specific laboratory tests are done, Seoul hantavirus cannot be ruled out.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
