re: Avian influenza, poultry vs migratory birds (30): Germany
-------------------------------------------------------------
To clarify the issue: at the Speichersee near Munich 3 WILD ducks were
found infected by H5N1 avian influenza virus. Of those, 2 of them were
confirmed by the national reference laboratory for avian influenza at the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut on the Isle of Riems to be infected by highly
pathogenic virus H5N1 'Asia,' whereas this diagnosis is still pending with
the 3rd case due to the low amount of viral genetic material within the
sample. Virus isolation on eggs is ongoing. However, due to the
epidemiological link there is strong suspicion that this will also turn out
to be HPAIV H5N1 Asia.
So far, this year [2007] there has been ONE detection of HPAIV H5N1 Asia in
domestic poultry in a small mixed (ducks and geese) poultry holding in
Thuringia (10 animals). Last year [2006], there has also been ONE outbreak
of HPAIV H5N1 Asia in domestic poultry in a turkey holding in Saxony (ca.
28 000 animals). ALL other findings were in WILD BIRDS.
Concerning the epidemiology, all 2007 viruses in Europe are closely related
which indicates that they originate from a common source. A direct link
between the cases in poultry in the Czech Republic in 2007 and the other
findings from France (only in wild birds -- that is, swans) or Germany
(except for the one small poultry holding also only in wild birds including
swans, crested grebes and black-necked grebes) is highly unlikely.
This has already been described in a number of previous postings to which I
refer.

[In a previous posting (archived 20070807.2563) we requested to obtain
details of the species of the "ducks" reportedly sampled at the Speichersee
near Munich. From the above observations of Prof Mettenleiter, for which we
are grateful, it appears that the sampling involved wild ducks, _Anas
platyrhynchos_. The application of scientific species nomenclature, when
wildlife is involved, would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
