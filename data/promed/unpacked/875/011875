The official death toll from Japanese encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh
climbed to more than 1 300 on Friday, health officials said.

"At least 9 more children died of this mosquito-borne disease
[overnight] taking the toll to 1302," said Vijay Shankar Nigam of the
state health directorate's communicable disease department.

The vast majority of the dead are children, mostly malnourished and
under the age of 15, officials said in Lucknow.

Some 250 people are still in state-run hospitals with encephalitis.

The encephalitis outbreak was first reported from Gorakhpur, 250
kilometers southeast of Lucknow in July and more than 4 900 cases
have since been.

"By September end the disease was on the ebb in Gorakhpur and
adjoining areas," said Lalit Saxena, a government doctor, in line
with expectation that the virus would die out with the onset of winter.

"The concern is that the disease has spread to new areas particularly
to the western part of the state," Saxena said. "Over 100 deaths have
been reported in Saharanpur in the last fortnight or so."

A special team of doctors have been sent to Saharanpur, 400
kilometers southwest of Lucknow, O P Singh, director of General
Health Services, told AFP.

Health minister Jaiveer Singh has said that his government would
start a vaccination drive in November to tackle next year's expected
outbreak, but was still waiting for federal funding.

"We have approached the central government and international agencies
for help. We are waiting for the response," Singh said.
