New cases of leprosy coming up across Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar should serve as a wake up call for the government to take proper action, Ram Naik, former Petroleum Minister said at a press conference on Tuesday [20 Mar 2012].

The government had declared that leprosy had been eliminated in 2005 but new cases have been detected. While there are 126 800 leprosy-affected persons in India, the highest numbers are in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra. Maharashtra State Leprosy Officer Dr Pradeep Gaikwad had recently said that 2440 new cases have been identified in 19 districts of Maharashtra.

According to Dr SD Gokhale, president, International Leprosy Union, an action plan has been worked out to work for leprosy-affected people in colonies at Dapodi, Pandharpur, Kolhapur, Ahmadnagar, and Ulhasnagar. They will set up Bal Vikas Kendras [child development centres] which will look into education, health, and nutrition of children, integration of leprosy-affected persons in the main stream of society, creation of awareness about human rights, and help for the groups of women.

Naik said they had submitted a petition to Parliament to empower leprosy-affected persons way back on 5 Dec 2007. The petition had been signed by Dr SD Gokhale, Dr PK Gopal of National Forum of Leprosy, Uday Thakar of Kusht Rog Nivaran Samiti, Baliram Tambade of Maharashtra Kushthapidit Sangathna, and others.

Several recommendations were made on empowering leprosy-affected persons and were submitted to President Pratibha Patil on [14 Sep 2011]. Demands included formulation of a comprehensive socio-economic rehabilitation policy for empowerment of leprosy-affected persons, enhancement of pension to Rs. 2000/- [USD 39] per month and provision of civic amenities to self-settled colonies of these persons.

According to Gokhale a demand was also made to conduct a new country-wide survey to assess the increase or elimination of leprosy. But no demands were addressed. On [13 Mar 2012] Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad admitted that India's share of leprosy-affected persons was 55 percent, which was alarmingly high.

"The new cases are a wake up call to the governments to take concerted action. It is also necessary that various NGOs working on all India basis as well as in Maharashtra for elimination of leprosy and empowerment of LAPs [leprosy-affected persons] should work together," Gokhale added.

Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by a bacillus, _Mycobacterium leprae_ (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/). _M. leprae_ multiplies very slowly and the incubation period of the disease is about 5 years. Symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. Leprosy is not highly contagious. But because lepromatous patients with the lepromatous form of leprosy excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions, a case of untreated lepromatous leprosy poses increased risk for infection for close, long-term contacts, such as household members. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to spread the disease. As the organism is also present in lepromatous skin lesions, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Because the organisms that are shed by lepromatous patients can persist on surfaces in the environment, fomites are also a potential source of infection.

Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995 (see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml). Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months.

When WHO says that leprosy has been "eliminated" in a region, they do not mean eliminated completely. WHO defines elimination of leprosy as a public health problem if the prevalence is less than one case per 10 000 population. The global disease burden fell from 5.2 million in 1985, to 805 000 in 1995, to 753 000 at the end of 1999, to about 219 826 cases at the end of 2005, with a prevalence rate of about 0.2 per 10 000 population.

The Southeast Asia Region (SEAR), including India and Sri Lanka, achieved the elimination goal in December 2005. The SEAR prevalence rate steadily declined from 4.6 per 10 000 population in 1996 to 0.82 per 10 000 population as of July 2006. The SEAR new case detection also declined from a peak of 47.8 per 100 000 in 1998 to 11.9 per 100 000 as of March 2006 (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm). The 2005 prevalence rate in India was 0.88 per 10 000 (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20_12162.htm) and in Sri Lanka 0.65 per 10 000 (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section54_12169.htm).

However, 2 countries in the SEAR, Nepal and Timor-Leste (East Timor) are yet to achieve elimination (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm).

However, pockets of high endemicity still remained in some areas of Angola, Brazil, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal, and the United Republic of Tanzania. India, Brazil, and Indonesia are the 3 countries that have the greatest number of leprosy cases. The top 10 countries in new case detections in 2005 are India, Brazil, Indonesia, DR Congo, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mozambique, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Together, they constitute about 96 percent of year 2005's global new case detections. The SEAR contributed about 69 percent of 2005 global new case detections. Globally, 296 499 new cases of leprosy were detected during 2005. In 2008, about 213 000 people mainly in Asia and Africa were infected, with approximately 249 000 new cases reported worldwide. In 2010, Southeast Asia continues to account for the most of the global leprosy burden, with more than 50 percent of the world's cases reported from India (ProMED-mail Leprosy - India (02): background 20120127.1024258). New cases of leprosy among children, as reported in the news above, from India and Sri Lanka, would be an indication of ongoing transmission in the community.

WHO emphasizes that sustained political commitment and adequate resources for leprosy services are required, especially for currently under-served population groups such as those in remote rural areas and urban slums, and migrant laborers, to sustain elimination at national levels and to progress towards further reducing the burden of leprosy. Also strengthening integration of leprosy services into the general health system through capacity building and skill development is required to ensure and sustain quality leprosy services, including diagnosis and treatment and prevention/care of disabilities (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm). - Mod.ML]
