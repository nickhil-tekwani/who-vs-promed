[1] Italy ex Egypt
Date: Thu 3 Jun 2010
From: Guido Calleri <calleri@asl3.to.it> [edited]


We were recently called in on consultation for 2 cases of suspected
dengue fever in travelers to the Red Sea resorts in Egypt, where the
disease was not reported in recent years. The 2 patients were
travelling together in early May 2010, and visited Marsa Alam,
Berenice, and Bir Shalatayn.

Case 1
------
A 72-year-old female, presented with fever, arthralgia, vomiting, and
diarrhea. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were present. Subsequently a
moderate impairment of consciousness appeared. Dengue serology was
negative at presentation. 10 days later dengue EIA IgG index was 21
(positive greater than 11), and IgM was 29 (positive greater than 11).
Dengue IFA IgG was 1/3200. Also West Nile fever [virus] serology was
positive (IgG 1/320, IgM negative: non-specific?). A slow improvement
of symptoms was seen and after 10 days the patient was discharged.

Case 2
------
A 71-year-old female, presented with fever, arthralgia, vomiting, and
diarrhea. Symptoms improved within 3 days and the patient was
discharged. Dengue serology was negative at presentation, and 10 days
later dengue EIA IgG index was 19 (positive greater than 11), and IgM
was 15 (positive greater than 11). Dengue IFA IgG was 1/3200. Also in
this case West Nile fever serology was positive (IgG 1/320, IgM
negative).

Investigation within TropNetEurop, a network for imported tropical
diseases, specifically reporting dengue cases, did not show dengue
reporting from Egypt in the last few years.

Is this another consequence of the broadening of _Aedes_ area, and
consequently of dengue area? The observation is significant because of
the large number of tourists [going] from Europe to the Red Sea resorts.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr Calleri and colleagues for this report.
The number of dengue reports from North Africa and the Middle East are
very few, so one does not know if the virus is truly absent there, or
if transmission is occurring but is undiagnosed and unreported. It
would also be of interest to know if there are _Aedes albopictus_
present in the area where these patients live and hence, a risk of
ongoing transmission in Italy.

Cases of chikungunya and dengue are being registered in the Gabonese
provinces of Haut-Ogooue and Ogooue-Lolo. According to the director
general of Health of Gabon, Mr Khouilla, "Out of 616 samples analyzed
by the International Centre for Medical Research (CIRMF), [there were]
84 cases of dengue virus and 15 cases of co-infection with both
diseases [viruses]. So far, no deaths have been reported since the
declaration of these epidemics in April [2010].

To provide a response to these 2 outbreaks, health experts have been
dispatched to the country to strengthen the management of patients
through an allocation of medicines and emergency training for
healthcare staff working in those areas where the epidemics exist.

Dr Khouilla has also said that awareness campaigns are carried out
actively on the risks people face by these epidemics and how to remedy
them. He also recommended spraying houses with insecticide in order
to fight mosquitoes, the main vectors of these 2 diseases [viruses].

[The number of dengue virus infections has increased by 2 since the 28
May 2010 ProMED-mail report, indicating that the outbreak is ongoing.
Spraying houses with insecticides in the absence of elimination of
water catchments in which the vector mosquitoes breed will provide
only temporary reduction of the mosquitoes.

People are suffering from dengue and malaria, especially in
Pimpri-Chinchwad. Dr Milind Jawale, medical officer, national health
programmes in Pimpri-Chinchwad, said ... dengue fever was recorded
among 679 patients last year [2009] and till May this year [2010]
there have been 34 cases.

Dr Sadashiv Patole, in-charge of the insect control department at the
PMC [Pune Municipal Corporation] has started 'gate meetings' at
cooperative societies to prevent dengue and malaria. He said there
were 170 cases of dengue in the city last year [2009]. This year till
April [2010], there have been 14 cases of dengue. "As part of our
preparedness campaign, we have put up banners in the city and tried to
inform citizens via the electronic media to refrain from storing water
for more than 5 days at their homes," he said.

Doctors and hospital administrators have also had their hands full at
Sassoon Hospital. "We saw 191 cases of dengue (10 deaths) [in 2009],"
... said Dr PS Pawar, medical superintendent.

Health commissioner Julia Sheen on Wednesday [2 Jun 2010] said the
Department of Health has confirmed the U.S. Virgin Islands' 1st case
of dengue fever. The case was reported in the St Thomas-St John
district and follow-up testing confirmed positive for the disease
caused [by the virus transmitted] by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito,
which is mostly found in the home, Sheen said.

"Increased rains can make certain areas near the home a haven for
mosquito breeding and place individuals at risk for dengue fever,"
Sheen said. "We went through both the hurricane and rainy seasons last
year [2009] without a positive case of dengue being reported and with
this confirmed case, we urge residents to be vigilant and help their
communities and the Department of Health stop the spread of dengue
fever by doing basic things."

Residents should:
- Keep tires in a dry place
- Put plants that are currently in water, into soil and empty
flowerpot vases weekly
- Keep water barrels tightly sealed
- Cover or turn pet dishes and buckets that hold water upside down
- Place a screen or mesh over the overflow pipe of cisterns
- Repair or replace damaged screens and keep windows and doors without
screens closed
- Cover infant cribs with mosquito netting
- Spray dark closets often
- Use mosquito repellents containing DEET. Follow instructions
carefully and use on arms, legs, ankles, and nape of neck. Avoid
applying repellant to eyes, lips, or bruised skin, and to children
under 2 years old and to the hands of older children

DOH epidemiologist Dr Eugene Tull said that the Department will issue
a fogging schedule as part of its mosquito abatement program later
this week [week of 3 Jun 2010] in light of recent rains, but reminds
residents that the mosquito that causes [transmits] dengue [virus] is
usually in the house. "They hide in dark closets and sleep when we
sleep and are awake when we are awake," Dr Tull said.

The latest newsletter from the Institut de Veille Sanitaire reports
650 new infections of the dengue virus during the week of 17-23 May
2010. The epidemic remains at a high level, very high: 650 is 8 times
the maximum number of infections expected in this period.

The total number of affected people since the beginning of the
epidemic (the 1st week of December [2009]) now stands at 7260. Since
the beginning of the epidemic 106 laboratory confirmed cases have been
hospitalized. There are 50 common [dengue disease] types, 19 severe, 4
of DHF (or shock syndrome), and 19 incomplete [sic] hemorrhagic forms.
The remaining 14 cases are being classified. The distribution of cases
among adults and children is about 50/50.

Over the past 2 weeks, the Mussel community and those in St Francis
are the highest impacted on Grande Terre. The epidemic is also present
in the region and North Pointoise Grande-Terre. On Basse-Terre, [these
are islands in the archipelago of Guadeloupe. - Corr.SB] high
incidences of the disease are now observed at Three Rivers and Terre
de Haut, while the epidemic continues in Sous-le Vente and Santa Rosa.

Dengue cases in Porto Alegre cause neighboring municipalities to
intensify the fight against mosquitoes. Canoas, Viamao, and Alvorada
take preventive action to avert risk of the disease. A least [these] 3
neighboring municipalities will increase care with dengue, after
confirmation of 2 cases of the disease in the capital. In Canoas, an
emergency survey of vector mosquito breeding sites will be done in the
Niteroi and Rio Branco neighborhoods. Starting next Wednesday [9 Jun
2010], 80 [health] agents will visit residences, commercial
establishments and vacant land in search of _Aedes aegypti_ larvae.
The supervisor of the fight against epidemics of the Prefecture,
Patricia Valentim, emphasized that care should be redoubled.

In Viamao, the army will help the prefecture in the fight against
dengue; 25 agents will be contracted as an emergency. In Alvorada,
health surveillance plans to return to the region bordering Porto
Alegre. The municipality was visited by [health] officers and soldiers
in May [2010]. The state government decided to intensify the work to
combat dengue in all of Rio Grande do Sul, with special attention to
the metropolitan region.

So far this year [2010], dengue has killed 38 people in Minas Gerais,
with 6 in the capital, according to the totals of the state
Secretariat of Health. Last year [2009], the disease killed 24 people
in the state, so there has been an increase of 58 percent in just 5
months this year [2010]. Another 59 hemorrhagic-type deaths from the
disease are under investigation by the Secretariat of Health. In Belo
Horizonte there are 16 deaths suspected for this most serious form of
the disease [DHF]. In Montes Claros 2 deaths of suspected dengue were
recorded. For one of these, a 21-year-old student, dengue was
laboratory confirmed but not yet confirmed as DHF. Of the current
dengue deaths in Minas Gerais, 22 were dengue with complications and
16 were DHF.

The confirmed dengue cases in Ribeirao Preto from [1] Jan [2010] to
the day before yesterday [2 Jun 2010], increased by 48 percent over
the total of confirmed cases of the disease in the last 10 years.
According to the municipal Secretariat of Health, from 2001-2009, 16
553 people were diagnosed with the disease. This year [2010], ill
individuals now total 24 523.

The residents of the Campos Eliseos, in the Zona Norte, and the Parque
Ribeirao neighborhoods have the greatest [number] of victims of the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the vector of the disease [virus]. The 1st
[locale] totals 1729 [dengue cases] and the 2nd 1727.

Last month [May 2010], when the number of cases fell almost by half in
relation to April -- there were 3933 confirmed cases versus 7828 in
the previous month, or 50 percent -- the 2 neighborhoods remained on
the top of the dengue ranking in the city: Parque Ribeirao reported
233 new infected individuals and Campos Eliseos, 228.

According to the municipal Secretary of Health, Stenio Miranda
Correia, the Secretariat began to register a fall of 50-60 percent per
week in notifications of [dengue] cases. "What we have to do now is
work preventively to so that we do not have so many cases next year
[2011], " said the secretary.

Last week [week of 24 May 2010], a task force formed by the City
collected 25.5 tons of recyclable materials, possible breeding sites
for the dengue mosquito vector, in the neighborhoods of Ribeirao Park,
Maria Graca, and Progresso and Marchesi gardens. The sweep found 101
foci of mosquito breeding in 87 homes, but there were 121 property
owners who refused the entry of agents during the sweep.

The reappearance of dengue [virus] type 2 in Ribeirao Preto could
cause a new epidemic in the coming year [2011], which now worries the
municipal Secretariat of Health. According to Maria Luiza Santa Maria,
director of the Division of Health Surveillance, the last time this
virus type circulated intensively in the city was in 2001. The virus
is divided into 4 types -- this year [2010] type 1 predominates and is
considered the most explosive and it caused the epidemic considered
the worst in all history of the city.

A total of 24 523 dengue cases were registered in Ribeirao Preto this
year [2010].

Dengue cases in Brazil are increasing among the youngest population,
those of less than 15 years of age. Because of this, the Ministry of
Health now fears that dengue will turn into a "childhood disease", as
has occurred in Southeast Asia. Data from the Ministry, noted in the
Sao Paulo file, show that as of 2007 children were practically not
presenting with dengue. Today, the mean has risen to one child for
every 4 adults.

This shift occurs because, after a person is bitten [infected], that
person is immune to the virus that infected him or her. Since there
are 4 types of [dengue] virus, after successive epidemics, the adult
population becomes protected and the children are the easier [more
susceptible] population.

Also according to the survey, in the [dengue] epidemic of 2008 in Rio
de Janeiro, most patients were less than 15 years of age. The
difference [between Brazil and Southeast Asia] is that [dengue]
epidemics have been occurring in Southeast Asia for 60 years and in
Brazil, for only 20. Because of this, the shift will take longer to
happen [in Brazil].

[Nelson Rodrigues, a renowned Brazilian journalist, author, and
playwright had an expression that fits well here, the "blindingly
obvious". [This age shift] looks like a fantastic, unpredictable
discovery. It is not. The shift of dengue to younger ages was foreseen
for over a decade. Sad but true. - Mod.LJS]

[Re: "Today, the mean has risen to one child for every 4 adults" -- or
1 in 2 in Rio. The question is not why is dengue apparently more
common in children in Brazil now than it used to be, but that given
half the pop. of Brazil is aged less than 15, why have not half the
cases been in children since the beginning? Exposure to mosquito
bites in and around houses must have been similar to that of adults.
Perhaps dengue cases in children were much milder and unreported
previously. - Mod.JW]
