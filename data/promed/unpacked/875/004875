AFGHANISTAN: Tests confirm deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu
---------------------------------------------------------
A strain of bird flu found in dead chickens in Afghanistan has been confirmed
as the deadly H5N1 strain, the government and the United Nations said on
Thursday [16 Mar 2006].
The samples came from dead birds found in the capital, Kabul, and in
Nangarhar province, on the Pakistani border in the east, and were
tested at laboratories of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
[FAO] in Italy.
Another 6 samples from Kandahar province in the south and Kunduz
province in the north had tested negative, they said.
"Thus far in Afghanistan, avian influenza remains confined to the bird
population, with no human cases reported. Nonetheless, it is
imperative that the human population is protected," the government
and the United Nations said.
Culling would begin immediately in affected areas and markets selling
poultry and poultry products in these areas would be closed and
disinfected, they said.
Farmers would be compensated for their culled chickens and efforts to
increase public awareness of the disease were underway, they said.
There is concern that Afghanistan, with weak veterinary and health sectors
after decades of war, will struggle to contain an outbreak.
Agriculture officials say they don't even have protective suits that
should be worn if authorities order a cull of poultry flocks.
Adding to concerns, most Afghan farmers and chicken traders are illiterate and
know little about bird flu. [This is a strange comment; even if TV is not
widely available in Afghanistan, there is such a thing as radio. WHO used
radio extensively in Africa in its information campaigns about AIDS. - Mod.JW]

Independent tests confirm H5N1 in Myanmar - FAO
-----------------------------------------------
Independent tests have confirmed an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird
flu virus in central Myanmar, the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) said on Thursday.
A Bangkok laboratory confirmed the findings of Myanmar officials who announced
the country's first outbreak in the central Mandalay Division on Monday [13
Mar 2006], said He Changchui, the FAO's regional representative for the Asia-
Pacific region.
"Our network laboratory test confirmed it's H5N1," he told Reuters.
Myanmar health officials say there is no evidence of human infections
from the H5N1 virus, which has killed about 100 people in Asia and
the Middle East since late 2003.
In Yangon [the capital], state-controlled media ended a news blackout on
Thursday [16 Mar 2006] and published details of the Mandalay outbreak and the
measures taken to contain it.
The New Light of Myanmar said H5N1 had been found on poultry farms in Khin U
township of Sagaing Division and Pyigyidagun township of Mandalay Division in
the first half of March [2006].
Officials slaughtered more than 5000 birds, temporarily closed poultry markets
and banned bird movements in the 2 townships, the newspaper said.
It said officials investigated suspicious poultry deaths in 2 other townships
in Sagaing Division but found no bird flu.
Myanmar has appealed for international help. An FAO team flew to Yangon on
Thursday [16 Mar 2006] and was due to visit the Mandalay area to assess the
scale of the outbreak and what Myanmar needed to fight the disease. The team
would also deliver a 1st batch of protection suits, disinfectant sprayers,
testing kits and other emergency gear.
"The whole situation in Myanmar at this moment is not clear as far as FAO is
concerned. That is why we are anticipating the mission will come up with a
preliminary assessment of the scope as well as the need," He Changchui told
reporters in Bangkok.
Myanmar reported the outbreak to international health agencies swiftly, health
experts say, keeping a pledge it made in December [2005] to tell the world if
it found bird flu.
But years of mismanagement have crippled the economy, and despite a relatively
large number of foreign-trained doctors, there is a dire lack of
infrastructure in a country where military spending far outstrips that on
health care.

[3] Israel, poultry (turkeys): H5 suspected

Deadly bird flu strain may have reached Israel
----------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry voiced caution and urged the public not to panic after the
Agriculture Ministry announced on Thursday [16 Mar 2006] night that turkeys in
2 Negev farms were "suspected" of having died from the H5N1 strain of avian
flu.
Associate director-general Dr. Boaz Lev said that there is no danger to the
general public, as avian flu among poultry and wild birds can spread only to
people in direct contact with live birds whose droppings contain the virus.
There is no danger eating poultry, even if the food supply is affected by the
virus, as it is destroyed by the heat of cooking.
"It's a problem for the turkeys and the chickens, but not for humans at this
point," said Prof. Manfred Green, director of the Israel Center for Disease
Control. "If it is bird flu, poultry will be isolated and killed in the
affected area within a radius of 3 km. Agriculture workers who have been
directly in contact with them could be given anti-virals as a prophylactic
measure and on an individual basis," he added. "We are waiting for
confirmation. So far, it seems to be the H5 strain, but we are not sure that
it is H5N1, which is more infectious."
Israel has had sporadic cases of avian flu in wild birds, but not of the
specific strain H5N1.
Agriculture Minister Zeev Boim said Thursday that the widespread death of
turkeys at the 2 western Negev communities of Kibbiutz Ein Hashlosha and Holit
could have been caused by the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu. "Tonight, we
will likely find out if indeed we are talking about bird flu," Boim told
Israel TV. "In the meantime, it is a suspicion."
The Agriculture Ministry said that they may know Friday morning if it is an
outbreak of avian flu, and that there's a 50-50 chance. "We have imposed a
quarantine in a radius of 7 km around the area, and we are prepared, in case
our suspicions are confirmed, for a widescale destruction of the flocks in a
radius of 3 km," he said.
Boim stressed that Israelis should remain calm until the tests have been
completed.
There have periodically been such bird flu cases in wild birds and even
domestic ones in recent years, the most recently about 3 years ago. [This
relates to A influenza LPAI H9N2, a strain which seems to have become endemic
in the Middle-East, including Israel, in the past several years.- Mod. AS].
The Israeli Veterinary Service said that initial results indicated that the
birds had died from avian flu, though it had not yet been determined if they
were infected with the feared H5N1 strain of the virus.
Many Israeli agricultural communities are largely dependant on the poultry
industry.
The H5N1 virus was detected in neighboring Egypt last month, and Boim said the
death of the birds in southern Israel might indicate that the disease could
have entered the country from Egypt.

[According to the Israeli radio, the number of dead turkeys in Ein
Hashlosha, one of the 2 affected farms, reached 17 000; other sources
mentioned lower numbers. The 2 affected farms are adjacent to the
Gaza strip, within the Palestinian authority. See interactive map at
http://www.eyeonisrael.com/ (go to square 13).
In view of Israel's situation as a main flyway of migratory birds
between Europe, Asia and Africa
(<http://www.eilat-guide.com/birds.html>), the Israeli Veterinary
Services have undertaken (passive) surveillance in dead wild birds
since fall 2005. All tests of (an unspecified number of) dead wild
birds, carried out by the central Veterinary poultry laboratory at
the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit Dagan, have been -- so far --
negative. The same laboratory is currently engaged in the testing
of the samples from the suspected turkeys; results are anticipated
within several hours. - Mod. AS].

Officials say Azeri dog dies of bird flu
----------------------------------------
A dog has died of bird flu in Azerbaijan, a country on the crossroads
of Europe and Asia where 3 people have already died from the virus,
officials said on Wednesday [15 Mar 2006].
"A dead stray dog has been found, and after analysis type A bird flu
was discovered. The medical investigation is continuing," said a
statement from the state commission tasked with fighting the spread
of bird flu.
It said the dog died on 9 Mar 2006 in the capital Baku.
It was the first dog reported to have died of the virus in Europe, although
Germany has reported that at least 3 cats and one stone marten have been
infected. Austria has also reported cats infected with the deadly H5N1 strain
of flu [This report from Austria is subject to review -- see ProMED post
20060313.0789 - Mod.JW].
The disease has hit domestic and wild birds throughout the South Caucasus
state. The 3 human victims, who died over the past few weeks, were thought to
have been infected through contact with birds.

[Until confirmation -- or otherwise -- is obtained from the laboratory, this
case remains suspected. A single, anecdotal report on avian influenza in a
Thai dog was included in ProMED post 20041003.2731. - Mod. AS].
