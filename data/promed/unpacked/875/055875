["Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a herpesvirus infection capable of inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) and varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp". Source: https://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_koi_herpesvirus.htm

"Koi herpesvirus disease is a devastating disease of ornamental koi and common carp. There are several methods to detect various states of the infection. There is no effective treatment to rid the fish of the virus. Good management practices, including quarantine, testing, and appropriate husbandry, are vital components to preventing this disease for all koi and common carp producers, dealers, and hobbyists. There is no zoonotic concern with KHV. The herpesvirus responsible for causing KHV disease in fish will not cause disease in humans."
