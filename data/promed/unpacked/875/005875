The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic health minister Sergei Movsesian told
Armenian News [NEWS.am] that the outbreak of an infectious disease in the
Kashatagh region of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has been confirmed to be
leptospirosis. He also noted that the patients are in good condition and
most had been discharged from hospital. The minister noted that the 14
patients who currently remain in hospital will be discharged in the coming
days.

Recall that on 8 Jun 2010 in the Kashatagh region of Nagorno-Karabakh the
outbreak of leptospirosis involved 54 people. Note that the disease is
transmitted to humans from rats.

[This news release above appears to be a follow-up of a prior one that
ProMED-mail posted (Undiagnosed disease - Nagorno-Karabakh: RFI
20100610.1945). The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is located in the South
Caucasus. For the following details about the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic,
see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_Republic>.

After the Soviet Union established control over the area in 1923 it formed
the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a predominantly Armenian-populated
region within the Azerbaijan SSR. Nagorno-Karabakh Republic now controls
most of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and
several Azerbaijani districts adjacent to the borders of Azerbaijan with
Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. It is still de jure part of
Azerbaijan but de facto under joint Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh control.
Maps of the region can be found at

HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/r/01vD>.

Leptospirosis, which occurs worldwide in warm climates, is a zoonotic
disease caused by exposure to several types of the _Leptospira_ bacteria.
The microorganism can be found in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or
vegetation that has been contaminated by urine from chronically infected
animals. Leptospirosis affects humans and a variety of animals that include
dogs, cattle, pigs, and rodents. Leptospires enter the body through open
sores or wounds in the skin, or through mucous membranes following exposure
to contaminated water. Outbreaks frequently follow large rainfalls,
flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

People can also contract leptospirosis by drinking water that has been
contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Indeed, drinking water that
had been contaminated by rats was believed to have caused the current
outbreak in Nagorno-Karabakh (see
<http://www.a1plus.am/am/social/2010/06/9/infection> -- in Armenian). - Mod.ML]
