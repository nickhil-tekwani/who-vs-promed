Virus likely cause of widespread catfish kill on Alabama coast, scientists say
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead catfish have washed up by the thousands on the Alabama coast, and
scientists say they are probably victims of a virus that also struck in 1996.
The fish washed up Tuesday, spread over miles of beachfront at Dauphin
Island and Fort Morgan. Alabama conservation officials said many more
would wash up Wednesday.
Scientists sent tissue samples to the Alabama Department of Environmental
Management for testing, with results due back in about a week, said Mark
Van Hoose of the Alabama Marine Resources Division.
In May 1996, tens of thousands of hardhead catfish were killed Gulf-wide by
what scientists later determined was a virus. The catfish virus hasn't
killed mass numbers of fish since then.
Tommy Nishimura of Dog River was white trout fishing on a backyard pier on
the island's northside when he noticed white dots speckling Mississippi Sound.
"I thought when we first started fishing this morning that they were
whitecaps. Then I looked all around us and realized that they were dead
catfish, thousands of them," Nishimura said.

[It would be useful to obtain more details on the current outbreak. In view
of the mention of a similar outbreak in 1996, one of the possibilities
which might be considered is the Channel catfish virus disease (CCVD),
caused by a herpesvirus designated _Ictalurid herpesvirus_. CCVD reportedly
struck catfish (_Ictalurus punctatus_) in the USA in 1996. Details on CCVD
can be seen in Chapter 2.1.6. in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests for
Aquatic Animals, 2003 <http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00023.htm>.
