New data on measles: reported measles cases the highest since 2006

New measles surveillance data is now available on the WHO website. This preliminary data is based on country reports submitted monthly to WHO. Please note that these are not final estimates, as countries are still reporting cases and discarding cases based on laboratory results. Through WHO and UNICEF's joint reporting channels, final official annual total numbers are made available in July of the following year.

Data from this summary should therefore be reported as provisional and clearly dated (i.e., "provisional data based on monthly reports to WHO (Geneva) as of August 2019").

Measles outbreaks continue to spread rapidly around the world, according to the latest preliminary reports provided to WHO, with millions of people globally at risk of the disease.

In the 1st 6 months of 2019, reported measles cases are the highest they have been in any year since 2006, with outbreaks straining healthcare systems, and leading to serious illness, disability, and deaths in many parts of the world. There have been almost 3 times as many cases reported to date in 2019 as there were at this same time last year [2018]. This follows successive yearly increases since 2016, indicating a concerning and continuing upsurge in the overall measles burden worldwide.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Ukraine have reported the highest numbers of cases this year [2019]. However, cases have dramatically decreased in Madagascar in the past several months as a result of nationwide emergency measles vaccine campaigns, highlighting how effective vaccination is in ending outbreaks and protecting health.

Major outbreaks are ongoing in Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Philippines, South Sudan, Sudan, and Thailand.

The largest outbreaks are in countries with low measles vaccination coverage, currently or in the past, which has left large numbers of people vulnerable to the disease. At the same time, protracted outbreaks are occurring even in countries with high national vaccination rates. This results from inequities in vaccine coverage and gaps and disparities between communities and geographic areas, and among age groups. When enough people who are not immune are exposed to measles, it can very quickly spread.

The United States has reported its highest measles case count in 25 years. In the WHO European region, there have been close to 90 000 cases reported for the 1st 6 months of this year [2019]: this exceeds those recorded for the whole of 2018 (84 462), already the highest in this current decade.

The reasons for people not being vaccinated vary significantly between communities and countries and include lack of access to quality healthcare or vaccination services, conflict and displacement, misinformation about vaccines, and low awareness about the need to vaccinate. In a number of countries, measles is spreading among older children, youth, and adults who have missed out on vaccination in the past.

With governments and partners such as the Measles & Rubella Initiative, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and others, WHO is helping countries stop outbreaks, strengthen health services, and increase essential vaccination coverage.

According to WHO and UNICEF coverage data released in July 2019, 86% of children have received the 1st dose of measles vaccine and 69% the 2nd. This means that around 20 million children in 2018 received no measles vaccine through their routine vaccination programmes. Furthermore, 23 countries have yet to introduce the 2nd measles vaccine dose into their national schedule.

[It is important to include the 2nd vaccine dose in the vaccination program in order to achieve greater protective immunization. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after 2 doses and approximately 93% after one dose. However, in Pakistan, a low serologic response of 72% was noted after the 1st dose of measles vaccine and 87% after 2 doses of vaccine at 9 months and 15 months. This lower level of protection has also been observed in other developing countries and makes a 2-dose vaccine regime even more important. - Mod.LK]

The US recorded 10 new measles cases last week [week of Mon 5 Aug 2019], taking the total cases for the year to 1182, in the worst outbreak since 1992, federal health officials said on Monday [12 Aug 2019].

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had recorded cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease in 30 states as of 8 Aug [2019].

[4] St. Lucia: cruise ship

https://www.coherentmagazine.com/cruise-ship-affected-with-measles-case-is-now-quarantined-off-st-lucia/


Off the Caribbean islands, the measles-stricken cruise ship, reportedly owned by the Church of Scientology, has been quarantined. A female crew member has been confirmed as a measles case, causing the ship to quarantine since 29 Apr 2019. According to reports, over 300 passengers are on board. According to Church of Scientology's website, the vessel is 440 ft [134 m] long and named Freewinds; [the vessel] hosts religious retreats ministering the most advanced level of spiritual counseling in the Scientology religion. The ship has been quarantined in a port in the Caribbean Island's capital since the officials discovered infected patients.

St. Lucia's chief medical officer Dr. Merlene Fredicks-James said, "Because of the risk of potential infection, not just from the confirmed measles case but from other persons who may be on the boat at the time, we thought it prudent to make a decision not to allow anyone to disembark." St. Lucia was declared measles free since 2016, which means it has been free from local measles transmission as it was last reported in 1991. However, health officials, there is extremely [caution] over travelers importing highly infectious reporters.

"Due to the high intensity of international travel related to the large tourism sector, the Caribbean region remains at high risk for the importation of measles and rubella cases," said Dr. C. James Hospedales, executive director of the Caribbean Public Health Agency.

The measles outbreak is not restricted to St. Lucia; the World Health Organization, [in] April 2019, reported a 300% increase in global measles cases. Moreover, the US has currently 700 confirmed cases of measles in 2019, the highest number of cases since 1994. A lot of health officials around the world are blaming the hesitance toward the vaccination for this outbreak.

The major cause behind the measles outbreak is hesitance toward vaccination and misinformation spread about its efficacy.

https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/scienceandhealth/2019/08/mutated-measles-virus-is-responsible-for-new-outbreak-in-sao-paulo.shtml


A mutated measles virus is responsible for the recent outbreak of the virus that has led to 1000 cases in the the Sao Paulo area, according to Edison Luiz Durigon, a professor at USP's Institute of Biomedical Sciences and one of the country's most respected virologists.

The previous outbreak of the disease, which was considered eradicated in Brazil in the past decade, occurred in 1999. The current version of the virus, however, is another.

Still, the vaccine protects against this type of measles virus, the D-8. But the amount of antibodies in the body of an immunized person (made with the type A virus) drops after 15 years of application. Therefore, anyone who has never been immunized or injected for a long time should be vaccinated. WHO estimates that from 2000-2017, 21 million measles deaths were prevented by the vaccine.

With the amount of antibodies generated by someone who recently took the vaccine, the body can neutralize viruses of various types (8 in all, from A to H) and subtypes (24, distributed between types).

D-8 viruses circulated generally in Europe and began to pop up about a year ago in Venezuela and the northern part of the country. "Because there were a few cases, we thought the disease was spreading among unvaccinated people."

https://theworldnews.net/ng-news/measles-abia-records-22-suspected-cases


Dr Onyechere Nwokocha, director, Public Health/Disease Control Department, Abia Ministry of Health, said 22 suspected cases of measles and one death were recorded in Mgboko, Obingwa local government area [LGA] of Abia in June [2019]. He made the disclosure in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Thursday [8 Aug 2019].

Nwokocha said that samples from the victims were taken to the Public Health Laboratory in Lagos for analysis, adding that the result was still being awaited.

"if the result is out and confirmed positive, that is when we can say it was truly a measles outbreak and that one person died as a result of the disease,'' he said.

Nwokocha added that the ministry had done "case-searching in the community to see if there are other suspected cases. Random samples from other households in the community were taken for analysis as part of measures to put the case under effective check.''

In his contribution, Dr Chinagozi Adindu, executive secretary of the state's Primary Healthcare Development Agency, said the agency would commence another statewide measles immunisation campaign. Adindu said 147 teams made up of stakeholders in the health sector would be deployed in each of the 17 LGAs to facilitate the exercise.

"We have enough stock of vaccines, and we will apply for more vaccines to ensure sufficient quantity," [Adindu said].

[7] Germany: vaccine gap
Date: Thu 8 Aug 2019
MSN News [abridged, edited]
https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/measles-vaccine-gap-poses-risk-in-germany/ar-AAFwqDl


Some 166 000 German infants lack measles immunization, health insurers warn. Their finding underscores a recent World Health Organization alert that in Germany, and other European nations, the virus is still 'endemic.'

Merely 80% of 2-year-olds and 88.8% of 6-year-olds were adequately immunized against measles in 2017, Barmer, one of Germany's 6 large semi-statutory health insurers, warned on Thursday [8 Aug 2019].

A target of 95% of the population is widely recommended to rid a country of the easily spread virus and potentially fatal disease.

Barmer, which has 9.2 million members, disputed the assumed level of 92.8% immunization stated by Germany's renowned Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and documented in vaccination passports presented by parents when their children start school.

Barmer said 9% of school-beginners did not possess the document. So it instead scanned its own patient database to identify immunizations actually given by pediatricians. Scaling up its sample, Barmer calculated that nationwide, 166 000 2-year-old children lacked full measles immunization.

Furthermore, one in 5 girls of this age was inadequately vaccinated against rubella. This viral ailment, with skin rash symptoms similar to measles, can result in congenital problems in offspring or miscarriages when girls reach adulthood.

"In Germany, too few children are being vaccinated," said Barmer chairman Christoph Straub. "That makes the eradication of certain infectious diseases impossible and hinders protection for all those who don't allow themselves to be vaccinated," he added.

Facing vaccination detractors, German health minister Jens Spahn got Cabinet approval in July [2019] for a draft law that would require proof of complete measles immunization before children start kindergarten or primary school.

In January and February [2019], 34 300 cases of measles were recorded across 42 countries included in the World Health Organization's (WHO) 53-nation "European Region." The majority were reported in Ukraine, with more than 25 000 cases. Thirteen measles-related deaths occurred in Albania, Romania, and Ukraine. Elimination had been verified in only 37 [of] the region's 53 nations, said the WHO.

It went on to list 10 nations where measles remained "endemic": Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and Ukraine.

The European Vaccine Action Plan (EVAP), running from 2015 until 2020 and adopted by all 53 member nations in 2014, states that at least 95% of individuals in every population need to be immune to ensure community protection. Immunity is defined as 2 doses of vaccination or prior exposure to the virus.

Last November [2018], the WHO estimated that worldwide there were 110 000 deaths related to measles in 2017.

Global coverage with a 1st vaccine dose had "stalled" at 85%, it warned. The 2nd dose coverage stood at only 67%.

[8] Israel: El Al stewardess
Source: Arutz Sheva 7 [edited]

http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/267329


A stewardess of Israel's El Al airline died Tuesday [13 Aug 2019], following a months-long battle with measles. The 43-year-old stewardess was infected with the measles virus during a flight from New York to Israel 5 months ago.

After she was infected, the stewardess was hospitalized in serious condition at Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba in central Israel after she was found unconscious and struggling to breathe. During her hospitalization, the stewardess' condition deteriorated, and she was transferred to the quarantine section of the hospital's intensive care wing.

On Tuesday [13 Aug 2019], doctors at Meir hospital declared her death, following the 5-month struggle.

[This is a very sad outcome, and our condolences go out to the family of the flight attendant, who worked for El Al, the Israeli national airline. It is not clear whether she contracted the virus in New York, in Israel, or on a flight between the two locations. The flight attendant received only one dose of the measles vaccine when she was a child. It wasn't discovered until later that one dose is only about 93% effective. More recently -- in the USA, starting in 1989 -- children have been given 2 doses, which is about 97% effective, according to the CDC. See Measles update (27) 20190418.6429834 for an earlier report on the flight attendant. - Mod.LK
