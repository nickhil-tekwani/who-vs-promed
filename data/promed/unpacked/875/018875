Connecticut agriculture officials are investigating a possible
outbreak of avian influenza at an eastern Connecticut egg farm that
has led to the quarantine of 4.7 million birds.
Michael Darre, a poultry extension specialist and animal science
professor at the University of Connecticut, said the apparent
outbreak occurred at an egg farm, which has operations in Bozrah and
Lebanon and controls more than 90 percent of the state's egg market.
The farm produces about 12 million eggs per week.
Connecticut has more chickens per square mile than any state in the
nation, according to the Connecticut Farm Bureau. Maine and
Connecticut are the top 2 egg-producing states in New England.
The apparent outbreak led Japan on Thursday to impose a temporary ban
on poultry imports from the United States.
"This is a devastating disease to poultry but zero risk to humans or
any mammal," acting Agriculture Commissioner Bruce Gresczyk said.
Gresczyk said samples from the farm have been sent to a diagnostic
laboratory in Iowa [most likely the National Veterinary Services
Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa - Mod.TG] and results are expected
next week. State officials learned of the possible illness last week.
"We have no hard confirmation but we have suspicions," said Gresczyk.
He said the particular strain suspected is considered a low-grade
pathogen and in some cases is not fatal to chickens.
Meanwhile, traffic at the farm is strictly limited. Employees must
take foot baths before entering the coops, and vehicles are being
disinfected leaving and entering the property, Gresczyk said.
While Gresczyk would not confirm the name of the farm, he said the
disease does not affect eggs and said there are no problems with any
of the products the farm has on the market.
It's not the first case of the disease in the state. In 2001, some 16
000 birds had to be destroyed at a farm in Scotland, Connecticut,
because of an influenza outbreak.
If influenza is confirmed in the most recent case, the state may have
to destroy the flock, Gresczyk said.
The egg industry is among the top 5 agriculture businesses in
Connecticut with annual receipts of between $60 million and $100
million.
"It will affect the whole market," said Harvey Polinsky, an egg
distributor in Griswold.
"This is a scare we've lived with for a long time," Darre said.
He said state and industry officials were first put on alert in the
early 1980s when a strain of avian influenza was discovered in
eastern Pennsylvania.
That strain resulted in the destruction of 17 million birds in
addition to the hundreds of thousands that died from the disease,
according to Pennsylvania veterinarian and poultry consultant Dr.
Dave Kradle.
It resulted in a statewide surveillance program in Pennsylvania that
remains in place today, Kradle said.
That strain also was considered a low-risk pathogen but quickly
mutated to something more serious. That is the concern with the
influenza suspected in Connecticut, Kradle said.
"Although the symptoms in flocks are not nearly as severe, you can
really miss it if you're not looking for it," Kradle said.
As a result of the Pennsylvania outbreak, Connecticut tightened its
biosecurity in the industry, Darre said. But wild birds such as ducks
and geese can be carriers, and because Connecticut is on a major
migratory flight path the potential exists for the disease to be
deposited here, he said.

[Avian influenza is a highly contagious poultry disease that can
cause severe economic damage to the poultry industry.
Avian influenza generally infects only birds, but there have been
isolated cases when humans contracted the disease. The most recent
was in Hong Kong last month when a boy and his father became sick
after having been in direct contact with sick birds. This article
does not indicate the strain of influenza. There are strains that do
not affect humans. In regard to the comment above, influenza is
generally regarded as a disease that is taxing to any individual,
whether human or animal.
The only way to eradicate the disease quickly in commercial poultry
is by destroying infected flocks and imposing a strict quarantine. -
