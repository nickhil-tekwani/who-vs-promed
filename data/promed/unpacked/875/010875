The spread of novel coronavirus in India has quickened in the past few days with new cases of coronavirus and COVID-19 deaths being reported every day. After the 1st confirmed positive case was reported on 30 Jan 2020 in Kerala, the epidemic has expanded in the country, affecting more than 300 000 people. More than 3 billion people around the world have been living under lockdown for the past few days as governments step up efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic, which has left more than 420 000 people dead globally.

While the novel coronavirus has impacted the US, Brazil and Russia the most, India too is seeing COVID-19 affect its economy. After making its presence in Kerala 1st, the novel coronavirus spread to other cities/regions, including Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi, Jaipur, Agra, Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir.

- 13:15 GMT - Italy, Germany, France and Netherlands sign vaccine contract with Astrazeneca. Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands have signed a contract with Astrazeneca to supply European citizens with a vaccine against the coronavirus, Italy's health minister has said.

The contract is for 400 million doses of the vaccine, which was developed with the University of Oxford and whose experimentation phase is already advanced and expected to end in autumn 2020, Roberto Speranza said in a Facebook post.

He added that a 1st batch of doses would be made available by the end of this year [2020].

The European Commission received a mandate from EU governments on Friday [12 Jun 2020] to negotiate advance purchases of promising coronavirus vaccines, the EU's top health official said, but it was unclear whether there would be enough money available.

- 12:30 GMT - More than 22 000 fans attend New Zealand rugby match. New Zealand became one of the 1st nations in the world to welcome hordes of fans back into a packed sports stadium, thanks to the country's remarkable success in eliminating the coronavirus.

A capacity crowd packed the Forsyth Barr Stadium in the city of Dunedin to welcome the return of professional rugby, 3 months after the sport's professional tournaments were shut down by the coronavirus pandemic.

Almost 20 000 tickets had been sold before the opening Super Rugby Aotearoa match between the local Highlanders and the Hamilton-based Chiefs, and walk-ups filled the stadium to its capacity of 22 800 before kick-off.

There were no restrictions on physical contact. Fans could hug, high-five, congregate in groups before and after the match and fill public transport without wearing masks or social distancing.

New Zealand has almost eradicated COVID-19 after shutting its borders and imposing an early and thorough lockdown. There are no active cases, and New Zealand has recorded no new infections in 22 days.

- 12:00 GMT - Iran to reimpose restrictions if guidelines not followed: President Rouhani. President Hassan Rouhani has said Iran will reimpose restrictions to stem a surge in coronavirus cases if health regulations are not observed.

After gradually relaxing its lockdown since mid-April 2020, Iran has seen a sharp rise of new daily infections in recent weeks.

While compliance with health protocols was as high as 80 percent a month ago, it is now down to 20 percent, Rouhani said in a televised speech.

"If there is no cooperation, we will have to reimpose the restrictions," Rouhani said, adding that adherence to the health protocols was needed "in order to keep businesses open."

With 2410 new cases on Saturday [13 Jun 2020], the total of cases has now reached 184 955. With the death of 71 people in the past 24 hours, total fatalities stand at 8730, the health ministry said.

- 11:50 GMT - Former Pakistan cricket captain tests positive for COVID-19. Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi on Saturday [13 Jun 2020] said he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

Afridi played more than 500 international games across all formats after making his debut in 1996.

- 11:35 GMT - Protest in Nepal over government handling of COVID-19 crisis, several arrested. Nepali police arrested 10 protesters including foreign nationals from Australia, the United States and China as hundreds staged a demonstration in Kathmandu against the government's handling of the virus crisis.

Demonstrators have defied a nationwide lockdown for several days this week to demand better testing and quarantine facilities for returning migrant workers.

- 11:20 GMT - Qatar reports 1828 new cases. Qatar's ministry of public health said on Saturday [13 Jun 2020] that 1828 people had contracted the virus in the past 24 hours, taking the country's total to 78 416.

At least 1956 people recovered from the virus over the same period, the ministry said, pushing the total to 55 252.

- 11:00 GMT - India surpasses 300 000 cases, records biggest single-day jump. India reported another record daily spike in coronavirus infections as the country passed a grim milestone of 300 000 cases.

The health ministry reported 11 458 new cases on Saturday [13 Jun 2020] and 386 deaths, driving the toll of fatalities up to 8884.

India's total caseload reached 308 993, the 4th highest in the world, including more than 150 000 recoveries.

The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown in late March 2020. India's caseload jumped by about 100 000 cases in a week, coinciding with the reopening of shopping centres, houses of worship and restaurants.

- 10:40 GMT - Pakistan seals off hot spots as record number of cases reported. Pakistani authorities have identified and sealed off nearly 1300 hotspots to contain the increasing rate of COVID-19 infections in the country.

The sealing of high-risk areas comes as Pakistan reported 6472 news cases on Saturday [13 Jun 2020], the country's highest single-day total. Pakistan has confirmed a total of 132 405 cases including 2551 deaths.

Pakistan put its entire population of 220 million under lockdown in March 2020. The government has since eased restrictions, saying it was necessary to save the country's economy, but it has caused a surge in infections.

Pakistan has eased restrictions, saying it was necessary to save the country's economy. Prime Minister Imran Khan has resisted demands from experts to reinforce the lockdown.

Authorities, however, are now using the term "smart lockdown" to close shops and markets and force people to stay home in areas where confirmed cases have increased in recent weeks. Some residential areas were also sealed in the capital, Islamabad, to contain the spread of the virus.

- 10:15 GMT - Malaysia reports 43 new cases. Malaysia reported 43 new coronavirus cases, raising the cumulative total to 8445 infections.

The health ministry also reported one new death, taking total fatalities from the outbreak to 120.

- 09:45 GMT - Tracking Africa's coronavirus cases. The outbreak of the new coronavirus has reached every nation in Africa, a continent of 1.2 billion people.

As of 13 Jun 2020, the confirmed coronavirus death toll on the continent stood at 6040, with fatalities including the former President of the Republic of the Congo, Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, and Somalia's former Prime Minister, Nur Hassan Hussein.

There are 225 105 confirmed infections and 102 846 recoveries, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

- 09:00 GMT - Indonesia reports 43 COVID-19 deaths. Indonesia reported 1014 new coronavirus infections and 43 more deaths, taking the total number of cases to 37 420 and fatalities to 2091, health ministry official Achmad Yurianto said.

Yurianto said 563 more patients had recovered from the virus, bringing the total number of recovered cases to 13 776.

All of the new cases were locally transmitted, he added. At least 2091 people have died from the virus in Indonesia, according to the country's ministry of health [Reuters].

- 07:45 GMT - Russia records more than 8700 new cases. Russia reported 8706 new coronavirus cases, bringing its cumulative infection tally to 520 129.

The authorities said 114 people had died of the virus in the last 24 hours, raising the official national death toll to 6829.

- 06:40 GMT - Lockdown in parts of Beijing due to COVID-19 clusters. Parts of Beijing were placed under lockdown on Saturday [13 Jun 2020] as 6 new domestic coronavirus cases were reported, fueling fears of a resurgence in local transmission.

People were prevented from leaving their homes at 11 residential estates in south Beijing's Fengtai district after most of the cases were linked to a nearby meat market, city officials said at a news briefing.

Beijing's 1st COVID-19 case in 2 months, announced on Thursday [11 Jun 2020], had visited Xinfadi meat market last week and had no recent travel history outside the city.

China's domestic outbreak had been brought largely under control through vast, strict lockdowns that were imposed after the disease was 1st detected in the central city of Wuhan last year [2019].

- 05:20 GMT - Fauci concerned over coronavirus spikes as US reopens. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, cautioned that the "blips" of rising coronavirus hospitalisations being reported by some states could get out of control if robust contact-tracing regimes are not put in place.

About half a dozen US states are grappling with a rising number of coronavirus patients filling hospital beds, with Texas and North Carolina reporting on Friday [12 Jun 2020] their highest hospitalisation rates since the pandemic began.

Fauci, in an interview with CNN, underscored that increased hospitalisations were a worrying trend and a sign that "maybe we need to slow down a little" on reopenings.

"When you start seeing more hospitalisations, that's a surefire sign that you're in a situation where you're going in the wrong direction," he said.

- 03:42 GMT - Beijing shuts major market after 6 more locally transmitted cases. Authorities in Beijing temporarily closed a major wholesale market in the city after the National Health Commission (NHC) reported 6 more locally transmitted cases in the Chinese capital.

Chinese media said at least 2 of the infected people had visited the Xinfadi market. Authorities said all workers at the fresh food market were being tested for the virus. They also closed the Jingshen seafood market and ordered testing of food and environmental samples for all of Beijing's wholesale food markets.

Earlier, the city said it was delaying the planned reopening of school Monday [15 Jun 2020] for 1st to 3rd graders because of the new cases.

Beijing reported its 1st locally transmitted case in more than 7 weeks on Friday [12 Jun 2020].

- 02:50 GMT - France to open borders to non-Schengen countries from 1 Jul 2020. France will gradually reopen its borders to countries outside the Schengen zone from 1 Jul 2020, the interior and foreign ministers said in a statement.

Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said France's reopening would be in harmony with the rest of the European Union, which has recommended that the bloc reopen to some countries in the Balkans from 1 Jul 2020.

Castaner and Le Drian confirmed that France would also lift all border restrictions with other Schengen countries from 15 Jun 2020.

- 02:42 GMT - South Africa sees biggest one-day rise in cases South Africa saw its largest single-day increase in coronavirus cases, recording 3359 infections on Friday [12 Jun 2020].

A health ministry update said South Africa now has more than 61 927 cases, or well over a quarter of the cases across the African continent, including 1354 deaths.

Nearly 2/3rds of South Africa's cases are in the Western Cape province centred on the city of Cape Town, where the World Health Organization's Africa chief has said the trend "seems to be similar to what was happening in Europe and in the US."

- 02:29 GMT - Mexico prepares to reopen despite record cases. Claudia Sheinbaum, the mayor of Mexico City, said the Mexican capital will lift restrictions on car traffic and public transport next week and allow 340 000 factory workers to get back on the job under strict sanitary conditions.

Sheinbaum said that street markets, malls, restaurants and churches could reopen a week later, but at reduced capacity.

The announcement came as the health ministry reported a record 5222 new confirmed coronavirus infections, along with 504 new deaths. Total confirmed cases now number 139 196, and total deaths are at almost 16 450. Both are considered substantial undercounts due to very limited testing.

Separately, the federal government announced that starting on Monday [15 Jun 2020], half of Mexico's 32 states can start limited reopenings of hotels and restaurants and broader reopenings of markets.

The states to reopen are those that have falling rates of coronavirus hospitalisations, lower rates of infection and acceptable ratios of available hospital beds.

- 01:59 GMT - Egypt registers highest daily rise in cases in nearly 2 weeks. Egypt confirmed 1577 new coronavirus cases on Friday [12 Jun 2020], the highest daily increase in almost 2 weeks. In total, the Arab world's most populous country has registered 41 303 cases including 1422 deaths, the health ministry said in a statement.

The country is planning to open its seaside resorts to international flights and foreign tourists on 1 Jul 2020.

- 01:31 GMT - Masks significantly reduce infection risk, says new study. Requiring the wearing of masks in areas at the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic may have prevented tens of thousands of infections, a new study suggests.

Mask-wearing is even more important for preventing the virus's spread and the sometimes deadly COVID-19 illness it causes than social distancing and stay-at-home orders, researchers said in the study published in PNAS: The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.

Infection trends shifted dramatically when mask-wearing rules were implemented on 6 Apr 2020 in northern Italy and 17 Apr 2020 in New York City -- at the time among the hardest-hit areas of the world by the health crisis -- the study found.

"This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78 000 in Italy from 6 Apr to 9 May 2020 and over 66 000 in New York City from 17 Apr to 9 May 2020," researchers calculated.

- 01:12 GMT - Somalia's al-Shabab sets up virus treatment centre. Somalia's al-Shabab group said they had set up a COVID-19 treatment centre in the country, and said the disease posed a grave threat, citing international health authorities.

"Al-Shabab's coronavirus prevention and treatment committee has opened a COVID-19 centre," the group said in a broadcast on their radio Andalus, adding that the centre had been set up in Jilib, about 380 km (236 miles) south of the capital, Mogadishu.

"International health organisations said COVID-19 is spreading terribly in countries of Africa continent."

For more than a decade, the group has been fighting to topple the Horn of Africa's Western-backed central government and establish its own government based on its own interpretation of Islamic law.

- 00:18 GMT - Brazil's COVID-19 death toll passes Britain's. Brazil's COVID-19 death toll has overtaken that of the United Kingdom to become the 2nd-highest in the world after the United States, according to numbers released by the Brazilian Health Ministry. Brazil reported a total of 828 810 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 25 982 new infections in the last 24 hours, and another 909 fatalities, raising the death toll to 41 828, the health ministry said.

Of the total cases of COVID-19, 365 063 have recovered, the ministry said.

- 00:10 GMT - Botswana reinstates strict lockdown in Gaborone. Botswana has brought back a strict coronavirus lockdown in its capital city and surrounding areas after recording 12 new cases of the virus, 4 imported cases at its borders and 8 at a private hospital in Gaborone.

The southern African nation ended a 48-day national coronavirus lockdown late last month [May 2020], allowing businesses and schools to reopen under controls, but its borders are still closed apart from returning citizens and imports of essential goods.

Announcing the new lockdown measures, Malaki Tshipayagae, the country's director of health services, said authorities were trying to determine whether the Gaborone hospital cases were locally transmitted.

"From midnight today [13 Jun 2020], the greater Gaborone area will revert to extreme social distancing until further notice, where only essential services will be allowed to operate," he said in a televised announcement.

The new cases bring Botswana's cumulative cases to 60. Prior to Friday's [12 Jun 2020] cases, Botswana only had one active case of the coronavirus. It has recorded only one coronavirus death.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
---------------------
The Americas region reported 54.6% of the global newly reported cases and 69.1% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 39% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA reported 27.9%, Chile 8.6%, Peru 7.6%, and Mexico 6.1%.

The European region reported 14.0% of the global newly reported cases and 11.4% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 43.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 7.7%, Sweden 6.9%, Turkey 5.9%, Ukraine 3.7% and Belarus 3.5%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 15.0% of the global newly reported cases and 6.1% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 32.0% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 18.2%, Iran 11.0%, Egypt 7.3%, Qatar 7.1%, and Oman 5.2%.

The African region reported 3.8% of the global newly reported cases and 3.3% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 61.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Gabon 9.1%, Cote d'Ivoire 5.1%, Ethiopia 4.5%, Mauritania 2.8%, and DRC 2.2%.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.86% of the global newly reported cases and 0.37% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 49.8% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 37.7%, Japan 4.1% and South Korea 3.9%.

The South East Asia region reported 11.6% of the global newly reported cases and 9.5% of global fatalities. India reported 69.3% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 21.0%, Indonesia 6.7%, and Nepal 2.7%.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 8000+ new cases a day. The Eastern Mediterranean is approximately at parity with the European region with Pakistan reporting 6000+ cases a day. South East Asia is approaching parity with the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day. The Americas region is reporting over 70 000 cases a day with Brazil reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day, and the USA seems to have stabilized at 20 000+ a day. In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 2000-3000+ range daily, and in the Western Pacific region, they are maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with Singapore and the Philippines averaging 400+ cases per day (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 13 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases, and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has surpassed the European region, and the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 7 817 294, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count increased by 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.13 million confirmed cases, now represents 27.3% of the global cases of COVID-19, as other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases significantly. A global total of 430 400 deaths have been reported, an increase of 2164 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, there is major under-reporting of numbers of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, possibly 1/10th to 1/20th in order of magnitude. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home and who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Italy, Peru, Germany, and Iran at number 10. China is now number 19, changing this ordering in the past 24 hours. In descending rank order, the USA is number one for number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Russia, Chile, Pakistan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Iran; Peru and South Africa did not report any new cases in the past 24 hours, so the order in the top 10 list for number of newly confirmed cases is changed.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases, which include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and one from the Western Pacific region, unchanged in the past 120 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 20 countries with most newly confirmed cases include 8 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the European region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and one from the African region, none from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.UBA]
