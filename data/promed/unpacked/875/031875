This report [below] mentions 15 deaths and 100 cases of illness attributed
to an infectious disease outbreak of unknown etiology in Dolakha district,
Nepal.
Dolakha district is 130 kilometers northeast of Kathmandu in a remote
Himalayan region wracked by 6 years of guerilla warfare. The Bangkok-based
US Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences currently conducts
influenza surveillance in Nepal so perhaps their resources will be
mobilized to assist the Nepali government's response to this outbreak.

Strange disease kills 15 in Dolakha
Peon [guardian/keeper] decides fate of 100 others
---------------
13 Sep 2002: At least 15 people, including 2 children died immediately
after showing signs of headache, fever and running nose in Jhyaku VDC. The
epidemic has spread like a wildfire and infected another 100 in less than 2
weeks. The unknown disease threatens to engulf the whole of Jhyaku village.
The only staff at the village health post is a peon [guardian/keeper].
Records of the exact dead patients are unavailable. However, sounding
alarm, the District Health Office in Dolakha said at least 15 have died of
an "unknown disease". The response of the District Health Office comes only
on Friday, 2 weeks after the epidemic killed 15 people and infected 100 others.
Counting his fingers, Netra Jirel, a peon guarding over the Jhayku-based
health post said, at least 15 people are daily reporting at the health post
complaining of sickness. Jirel is the only person in the health post
handling a large number of incoming patients but is unable to write the
names of the patients without the aid of a literate person. Due to the
absence of a person to register the names of the patients, an exact death
toll is yet to be ascertained.
According to CDO Daya Ram Sharma, he has immediately acted upon receiving
the news of the spread of disease. "We will soon be sending a medical team
to Jhyaku VDC."
Former VDC chairman Narendra Pathak told The Kathmandu Post today that
wards-1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 have been affected in the last few days. "Since
the last 2 months, health post in the region has simply a peon to handle
everything and has no medical staff, let alone doctors to diagnose the
increasing number of patients."
"The health post has hardly any medicine, which has further complicated the
matter. There is an urgent need to send a medical team here," he said.
However, technician Krishna Mijar at the District Health Office in Dolakha
claimed that he had sent some antibiotics through Jirel to tackle the
problem. But for a health post without a single medical practitioner to
prescribe the tablets, it is up to the peon, Jirel, to ultimately decide
the life and death of the innocent people.

15 dead as mystery illness baffles Nepal's doctors
--------------------------
Nepal has sent doctors to a village in the kingdom's northeast, where 15
people have died and 100 others have fallen sick from an illness that is
baffling medical authorities.
In the past 2 weeks, 15 people, including 2 children, have died in the
village of Jhyaku in Dolakha district, about 90 kilometres north-east of
Kathmandu. Symptoms of the malady include a headache, fever and runny nose.
Officials fear the illness could be contagious and spread across the region.
"District health officials could not diagnose the nature of the disease but
medical experts have been dispatched," an official in Nepal's Health
Ministry said.

[The description of illness given above seems consistent with an
influenza-like illness (given the mention of "runny nose" as part of the
clinical spectrum of disease), and the scarcity of health care personnel
and medicines would be consistent with an observed higher mortality
resulting from secondary untreated bacterial pneumonia, in a possibly
marginally nourished population (reminiscent of the higher mortality
related to an influenza outbreak in Madagascar this year). In 1996 there
was a similar thread in ProMED-mail, starting as a "mystery illness"
reported in western Nepal, which ultimately was evaluated to be the usual
and expected ARI (acute respiratory illness) outbreak seen seasonally in
Nepal -- the season identified as December through April. In contrast,
Nepal is endemic/epidemic for Japanese encephalitis, with annual outbreaks
in the rainy season June- September, the current season. The news reports
above seem to suggest that adults are the primary fatalities (only 2/15
deaths were in children), another curiosity/anomaly proposing a
differential diagnosis (such as measles, which can present with an upper
respiratory component). In the past we have been fortunate that officials
working within the health sector in Nepal have responded to our requests
fairly rapidly when information becomes available. We would very much
appreciate information on this current outbreak from official sources. -
