New African maize disease threatens food security
-------------------------------------------------
A new maize disease, never reported anywhere in Africa, has emerged in
Uganda, threatening the food security of millions of people and the
future of an important cash crop for farmers in Africa. The rough
dwarf maize disease, spotted early this year [2010] in the areas of
Masindi district and Namulonge [Wakiso district] in the western and
central regions of Uganda, respectively, is causing panic among maize
farmers in Africa.

Researchers have no immediate solution to the devastating disease.
"The only line of defence we have so far is to sensitize farmers and
advise them to keep uprooting and burning the infected crop," said
Godfrey Osea, National Crops Resources Research Institute (NACRRI).

The disease causes total loss of the crop, but its scope of infection
around the east African region has not yet been fully understood.
"Being a new disease, we have not started developing resistant
varieties and we are yet to understand how the vector thrives," Dr
Osea said. The disease is known to have an incidence rate of 20-30
percent infection of a whole maize garden.

Experts believe the disease has not been reported anywhere in Africa
yet and that it is little wonder it has erupted in Uganda.
Historically the country seems to be the basket of erupting crop
diseases because of high temperatures and wet conditions, which are
conducive [to pathogen and vector development. - Mod.DHA]

But scientists say they would develop a resistant maize variety with
time as NACRRI have done, in partnership with the Kenya Agricultural
Research Institute (KARI) and international partners like CIMMYT
[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center], for the maize
streak virus which was diagnosed in Uganda in 1991-92.

[_Maize rough dwarf virus_ (MRDV; genus _Fijivirus_) is spreading in
parts of Europe and Israel, and as Mal de Rio Cuarto strain in
Argentina and Uruguay. While there have been reports from China, it
has been suggested that the closely related _Rice black streaked dwarf
virus_ (RBSDV), which is widespread in that country, may in fact be
the virus affecting the maize crops. Besides maize, MRDV can also
affect oats, rye, barley, wheat, rice, and several grassy weeds.
Symptoms on maize include thickening and chlorosis of leaf veins, leaf
roll and enations (distortions) of younger leaves, stunting and
reddening of plants, and malformation of ears or no ears at all.

MRDV is transmitted by several planthoppers (family _Delphacidae_)
including the small brown planthopper _Laodelphax striatellus_ (which
is also a vector of RBSDV and other important cereal viruses). Insects
remain infectious for life. The virus can also be transmitted by
mechanical inoculation, but not by grafting, seed, or contact of
plants in the field. Disease management may include phytosanitation
(like the burning of infected material mentioned above), vector
control and use of cultivars with resistance to the virus, the vector,
or both. Since cultivars resistant to MRDV are not yet available for
Africa, insecticide sprays against the vectors would currently appear
the best option but may be difficult to implement under the local
conditions.

Masindi and Wakiso districts, which are both reported above to be
affected in Uganda are separated by a considerable distance. This
would raise the question of how MRDV has arrived in these locations
(perhaps with infectious insects) and whether it may already be
present elsewhere in the region as well.

The other virus mentioned above is _Maize streak virus_ (MSV; genus
_Mastrevirus_) which is transmitted by leafhoppers (family
_Cicadellidae_). It is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa and a number
of MSV-resistant maize cultivars have been developed for use in the
region.
