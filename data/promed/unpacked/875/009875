University of Illinois reports 60 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
University of Illinois officials say they've seen more than 60 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease among students since the beginning of the semester.

Dr. Robert Palinkas tells the (Champaign) News-Gazette the rate has slowed so the infections may have peaked.

Hand, foot and mouth disease causes painful sores in the mouth and on the hands and feet. It is caused by viruses and can spread through coughing, sneezing or kissing. An infected person can spread the virus to others by touching objects and surfaces. Handwashing is an important strategy to prevent its spread.

Rachella Thompson of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District says the illness is more often seen in day care centers. But Illinois isn't alone in reporting cases. Florida State University and other schools are reporting outbreaks.

[The most common cause of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is infection with the coxsackievirus A16. The coxsackievirus belongs to the nonpolio enteroviruses. Other types of enteroviruses also may cause HFMD.

Oral ingestion is the main source of coxsackievirus infection and HFMD. The illness spreads by person-to-person contact with an infected person's: nasal secretions or throat discharge, saliva, fluid from blisters, stool, respiratory droplets sprayed into the air after a cough or sneeze.

Some people, particularly adults, can pass the virus without showing any signs or symptoms of the disease.

Outbreaks of the disease are more common in summer and autumn in the United States and other temperate climates. In tropical climates, outbreaks occur year-round. [http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease/basics/causes/con-20032747]
