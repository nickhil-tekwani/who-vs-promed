Salmonella outbreak at Royal Botanical gardens in Burlington
-----------------------------------------------
At least 81 people became sick after a salmonella outbreak at the Royal
Botanical Gardens in Burlington. 4 people had to be put in the hospital; 2
have since been released. The restaurant is still open after it was cleared
by the Halton Health Department, but health officials still want to talk to
anyone who attended the Mother's Day buffet or anyone who may have been
sick between 1-12 May 2005. None of the food handlers have displayed
symptoms, but investigators are looking at how food was prepared.

Dozens battle salmonella after brunch at gardens
-----------------------------------------------
At least 81 people became sick, and 4 were hospitalized, after eating food
tainted with salmonella at a Mother's Day catered buffet. Halton public
health officials want to speak to anyone who became ill between 1-12 May
2005 after eating at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Burlington, Ontario.
"The fact that so many people got sick means there might have been quite a
large infective dose, or it may be something about the actual strain [of
the bacteria]," said Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health. "We are
continuing to work very closely on the site and continuing our
investigation of the caterer and the food establishment at the RBG."
Officials believe salmonella bacteria is the cause. About 190 people of the
300 who attended the event have been contacted by phone and given detailed
questionnaires about what they ate in order to determine the source of the
outbreak.
Salmonella causes severe diarrhea, vomiting, fever, nausea, headaches and
abdominal pain, usually 12 to 36 hours after exposure. Symptoms can last
from 4 to 7 days and can lead to severe dehydration. The elderly, infants
and those with weakened immune systems are more likely to suffer more
severe symptoms.
At least one person has developed septicemia, a form of infection in which
the bacteria spreads from the intestines to the blood.
Dr. Nosal said he's looking at one particular food item, based on results
of the questionnaires, but wouldn't say what. The most common sources of
salmonella are meat, poultry, raw milk and raw or undercooked eggs.
One man said he believes he and his relatives got sick after eating chicken
served at the buffet. A 51-year-old man from St. Catharines, Ontario said
he started to feel dizzy and got severe stomach cramps 3 days after eating
at the buffet with his wife and 4 other relatives. He went to a walk-in
clinic, but doctors didn't know what was wrong and sent him to the
emergency room. "I thought I was dying. I'm still so weak, I can hardly
stand," Mr. Stahl said. "I've had salmonella before and thought I had food
poisoning."
Dr. Nosal said all the food served at the buffet was thrown out the next
day. But some prepared and stock items, such as cheesecake, horseradish and
vinaigrette dressing, were served in the days leading up to the event and 3
days after it. Samples have been sent to the Ontario Public Health
Laboratory in Toronto for testing, and preliminary results are expected in
the next few days.
Dr. Nosal said the concern now is to prevent secondary contamination.
"There exists a risk of passing the infection to others if these
individuals work, while ill, in food preparation, food service, child-care
or health-care settings," he said.
Of the 81 people who are sick, 29 are from Hamilton and 16 live in Halton
region. The rest are from the Greater Toronto Area, Niagara, Waterloo,
London and Buffalo.

[Contaminated food causing an outbreak of salmonellosis is certainly an
epidemiological classic. While a high inoculum is generally required in
healthy adults, the infectious dose may be considerably lower in the very
young, the elderly and those with gastric acidity reduced by disease or
drugs. We await the identification of the food and any information
regarding the particular Salmonella serogroup. - Mod.LM]
