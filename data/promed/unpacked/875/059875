[1] Cholera, post-cyclone - Myanmar (Irrawaddy division)

Cholera has broken out in 2 areas of Burma's [Myanmar's] Irrawaddy
Delta, where hundreds of thousands of cyclone victims are living
rough, with no fresh water or food, writes Edward Loxton for The First Post.

Doctors in the region's 2 major towns, Bogalay and Laputta, told a
local correspondent of the exile magazine Irrawaddy that an unknown
number of people had already died of the disease in Bogalay. "The
(feared) cholera outbreak has begun," a doctor was quoted as saying.
Fresh water was unavailable in the area, "so they drink water from
the creeks and rivers."

The flood-swollen waterways that crisscross the Irrawaddy delta are
crammed with dead bodies and animal carcasses. An anonymous army
major said 70 000 people were known to have died in Bogalay and
Laputta alone. More than 600 villages in the delta region had
disappeared beneath the tidal wave unleashed by Saturday's [3 May
2008] cyclone, the officer said.

[2] Diarrhea - Iraq (Sulaimaniyah)
Date: Sat 3 May 2008

A rash of patients hospitalised with diarrhea and vomiting in
northern Iraq has raised fears of a cholera outbreak across the
region. In April 2008, the main hospital in Sulaimaniyah received an
average of 25 patients per day with such symptoms, which are very
similar to those associated with cholera. While no cases of the
disease have been confirmed, officials are worried.

"We have serious fears of a cholera outbreak," said Ziryan Osman,
Kurdistan Regional Government, KRG, health minister.

According to statistics from Sulaimaniyah general hospital, around
400 patients were admitted with diarrhea and vomiting in April 2008,
a big leap from the 260 cases in March 2008. An outbreak in the
region in 2007 led to 2000 infections and 24 deaths. Hardest hit was
the northern city of Sulaimaniyah, where 14 people died.

Health officials said a lack of clean drinking water and rising
temperatures in the region could spark a similar epidemic this year
[2008]. The former coupled with poor sanitation was to blame for last
year's outbreak, which began in the province of Kirkuk and spread
throughout Iraqi Kurdistan as well as Baghdad.

26 Apr 2008, and their number began increasing last evening [28 Apr 2008].

Patients came complaining of vomiting and diarrhea. They were mostly
from B.M. Srinagar, Kumbarakoppal and Palahalli. They were
administered IV fluids and antibiotics, and they are now out of
danger, said Dr. T. Paramesh, District Surgeon.

Precautionary measures have been taken up by the City Corporation and
the Department of Health and Family Welfare to contain the spread of
the epidemic. The people are advised to maintain hygiene, drink
boiled water and avoid roadside food, he added.

[4] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland Central)

Health authorities in Zimbabwe said on Thu 8 May 2008 that cholera
had killed 5 people, including a small child, in the northern resort
town of Kariba in recent weeks.

District medical officer for the area, William Mhundwa, said the
disease was concentrated in 2 settlements around the town and is
thought to be a result of people eating contaminated fish from a
nearby lake. He said this was the 2nd cholera outbreak in the area in
2008. "We suspect that these people consumed fish which was
contaminated by cholera bacteria after the fish had also consumed
contaminated raw crocodile affluent," he said.

Several cholera deaths have been reported in a number of areas in
Zimbabwe in 2008, a problem compounded by lack of medicines.

Dar es Salaam, a city of nearly 4 million residents served with poor
water and sanitation networks, has been hard hit by a cholera
outbreak, the government announced yesterday, 5 May 2008. In her

said Temeke and Ilala municipalities have been highly affected by the
disease. But, so far, no one has died of it.

Dr Kahama warned city residents to keep the environment clean,
especially during the rainy season. As of 5 May 2008, 8 patients from
Chang'ombe, Yombo Vituka and Miburani surburbs in Temeke district

[8] Shigellosis - USA (New York)

The Health Department today [2 May 2008] notified Orthodox Jewish
residents of the Borough Park and Williamsburg communities in
Brooklyn of an ongoing outbreak of shigellosis, an intestinal
infection. So far in 2008, the 2 communities have had more than 150
cases of shigellosis, more than half of them among very young
children. In the hardest-hit area, zip code 11219 [in Borough Park -
Mod.LL], 60 people have been infected. The Health Department is
working with community leaders, including rabbis and City Council
members, to raise awareness of the outbreak and to provide advice on
prevention.

Shigellosis spreads easily among young children in day care and
preschool environments. Parents, teachers and care givers should help
young children wash their hands thoroughly and should make sure it is
done properly. It takes very few _Shigella_ bacteria to cause illness.

"We encourage residents to be vigilant about hand-washing," said Dr.
Sharon Balter, Medical Epidemiologist in the Health Department's
Bureau of Communicable Disease.

Large outbreaks of shigellosis have occurred in recent decades in
traditionally observant Jewish communities in Borough Park,
Williamsburg and other parts of New York State, New Jersey, Illinois,
Maryland and Canada. Some 274 cases of shigellosis were reported in
New York City in 2006, a rate of 3.4 cases per 100 000 people.
