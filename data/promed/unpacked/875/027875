Squirrels at 2 campgrounds in the San Jacinto Mountains have tested antibody-positive for plague this month [June 2016], according to Riverside County [California] health officials.

Now the Riverside County Environmental Health Vector Control Program wants to make sure visitors and campers are taking the proper precautions to stay safe and healthy while having fun in the mountains.

The squirrels were in the Dark Canyon Campground and Marion Mountain Campground.

The Riverside County Environmental Health Vector Control Program was notified about the positive blood tests by the California Department of Public Health, which were collected on 8 and 13 Jun [2016]. The U.S. Forest Service district rangers and safety officer have also been notified.

The antibody-positive test means the squirrels had been exposed to the disease sometime in the past. All campgrounds are continuously posted to remind campers that plague has been found in the area in the past.

According to the release, plague is a rare bacterial disease in rodents that can be transmitted through the bite of infected rodent fleas. The disease has been detected in ground squirrels, chipmunks, and other wild rodents throughout many mountain regions in Southern California. The last positive plague samples in the San Jacinto Mountain Range were in 2012 and 2002.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection. - Mod.PMB
