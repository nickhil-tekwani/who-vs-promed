Torres Hillsdale Country Cheese of Reading, Michigan, is expanding
the recall of Asadero and Oaxaca soft Mexican-style cheeses due to
potential _Listeria_ contamination.

Consumption of food contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ can
cause Listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease.
Listeriosis can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and
nausea. It can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths. The very
young, the pregnant, the elderly and persons with compromised immune
systems are the most susceptible to infection. People experiencing
these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

Products were distributed to the following states: Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Alabama.

A routine sample of Asadero cheese, taken by an inspector from the
Michigan Department of Agriculture's Food and Dairy Division on 23
Feb 2009 was subsequently tested by the Michigan Department of
Agriculture Laboratory and discovered to be contaminated with
_Listeria monocytogenes_.

The recalled Asadero and Oaxaca cheese products were distributed to
retails stores and delis in 10-pound balls, 16- and 12-ounce plastic
packages, sold under the name "Aguas Calientes." Product was also
sold in 6-pound blocks shrink-wrapped in clear plastic, under the
name "El Jaliciense." Packaging may also include a label with the
name "Torres Hillsdale Country Cheese LLC." The recall encompasses
all production dates between 1 Aug 2008 (expiration date 29 Oct
2008) and 27 Feb 2009 (expiration date 10 May 2009).

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with the
recalled products. Consumers and retailers are urged to return all
unused recalled product to the manufacturer.

[Because of the potential severity of listeriosis for people at risk
(e.g., newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and
those with compromised immune defenses), ProMED-mail is posting this
recall even though there are no reported human cases associated with
the contaminated Asadero and Oaxaca cheese products at this time.

_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely
distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water,
silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized
milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of
many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in
crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.

Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission
can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery
through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can
occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected
animals.

Contamination of food can occur in nature; e.g., raw
vegetables contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk from
infected cows, or contamination may occur following subsequent
cooking or other processing. Because the organisms can multiply at
refrigerator temperatures, it is not surprising that listeriosis is
usually associated with ingestion of contaminated milk, meat or
vegetable products that have been held at refrigeration temperatures.
A detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail no.
