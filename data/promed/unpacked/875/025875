[Although ProMED no longer posts cases of Andes virus infections in Chile because this virus disease is endemic there and cases occur every year, the following report is an interesting 2013 summary of cases in 2 regions where most of the disease occurs. - Mod.TY]

So far in 2013, the Public Health Institute (ISP) and the Laboratory Network have confirmed a total of 44 cases of hantavirus [infections] in the Valparaiso and Aysen regions. Of this number, 41 presented with [hantavirus] cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS] and 3 were mild cases.

The disease [infection] is acquired by presence of [virus in] urine [saliva and excrement] of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat [_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_].

The information about the number of cases was issued by the ISP Director, Stephan Jarpa, following a meeting with clinical teams of the Concepcion Regional Hospital. The Director praised the work in the area to reduce the incidence of disease and mortality last year [2012].

"The ISP is in charge of confirming cases of hantavirus [infection] in the country. However, in 2012, the Institute designated the Universidad Austral in Valdivia and the Catholic Pontifica University in Santiago as 2 other confirmation centers," Jarpa explained.

With this Laboratory Network, it was possible to reduce significantly the time of making presumptive and confirmatory diagnoses of hantavirus [infections] in Chile, time that is crucial for the [treatment] measures that health teams must take for a disease that is so serious and highly fatal, he explained.

In the Bio Bio region, to date [as of 13 Dec 2013] 10 cases have been confirmed, with a registered regional case fatality of 50 per cent. The median age is 33 years with a range of 18-65 years.

Nuble has 40 per cent of the cases, followed by Arauco and Bio Bio with 30 per cent each. The community most affected has been Coihueco with 3 cases.

Last year [2012] for the same period (up to week 49), 21 cases were registered with 8 deaths (fatality of 36 per cent), for which the work was praised for reducing the incidence of cases of hantavirus [infections] in the region, thanks to the [preventive] measures and to the Surveillance Network.

Hantavirus infections cause a respiratory disease with abrupt onset, known as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, with an overall fatality rate in the country bordering on 30 per cent. [The infection] has an incubation period of 1-3 weeks with a range of 3-45 days.

[Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases is no doubt Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and HPS cases occur every year. The diagnostic system has been substantially improved. As mentioned above, rapid, accurate diagnosis is critical because of the speed with which the disease progresses and the urgency of proper treatment. Fatal cases have occurred recently. A 5 Dec 2013 report indicated that a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old from the Araucania region died of HPS (http://www.publimetro.cl/nota/cronica/dos-adolescentes-fallecen-en-la-araucania-por-contagio-con-hantavirus/CPImle!aXLdE4ZJFBVDf3B1XQsRdA/, in Spanish). Presumably, these 2 cases are included in the 41 fatal case totals mentioned in the report above.
