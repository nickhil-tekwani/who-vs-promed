Peruvian bats found to harbor novel influenza virus
---------------------------------------------------
Discovery of a novel influenza virus, H18N11, in several species of Peruvian bats lends credence to New World bats being an important reservoir for a diversity of influenza viruses, says a study yesterday [10 Oct 2013] in PLoS Pathogens.

The researchers, several from the CDC, tested rectal swabs from 114 bats captured in the Amazon rainforest region of Peru. A total of 18 species were represented, with most falling within 6 species. The flat-faced fruit bats (_Artibeus planirostris_) were positive for influenza on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. After full-length genomic sequencing, the novel virus was designated as A/bat/Peru/10.

A flu subtype designated H17N10 was recently discovered in yellow-shouldered fruit bats in Guatemala. Phylogenetic analysis in the present study showed that all genes of the A/bat/Peru/10 virus were related to those of the Guatemalan virus but formed a distinct lineage justifying its classification as H18N11, the authors said.

Indeed, their analysis indicated that "bat populations from Central and South America have as much influenza virus genetic diversity in certain gene segments as all other mammalian and avian species combined."

With bats' global distribution, abundance, population density, and large number of species (more than 1200), further research should be focused on them as potential reservoirs of novel influenza viruses and as vessels for reassortment and species jumps, the authors wrote.

"Abstract: Aquatic birds harbor diverse influenza A viruses and are a major viral reservoir in nature. The recent discovery of influenza viruses of a new H17N10 subtype in Central American fruit bats suggests that other New World species may similarly carry divergent influenza viruses. Using consensus degenerate RT-PCR, we identified a novel influenza A virus, designated as H18N11, in a flat-faced fruit bat (_Artibeus planirostris_) from Peru. Serologic studies with the recombinant H18 protein indicated that several Peruvian bat species were infected by this virus. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that, in some gene segments, New World bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined, indicative of a long-standing host-virus association. Structural and functional analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase indicate that sialic acid is not a ligand for virus attachment nor a substrate for release, suggesting a unique mode of influenza A virus attachment and activation of membrane fusion for entry into host cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that bats constitute a potentially important and likely ancient reservoir for a diverse pool of influenza viruses.

Author Summary: Previous studies indicated that a novel influenza A virus (H17N10) was circulating in fruit bats from Guatemala (Central America). Herein, we investigated whether similar viruses are present in bat species from South America. Analysis of rectal swabs from bats sampled in the Amazon rainforest region of Peru identified another new influenza A virus from bats that is phylogenetically distinct from the one identified in Guatemala. The genes that encode the surface proteins of the new virus from the flat-faced fruit bat were designated as new subtype H18N11. Serologic testing of blood samples from several species of Peruvian bats indicated a high prevalence of antibodies to the surface proteins. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that bat populations from Central and South America maintain as much influenza virus genetic diversity in some gene segments as all other mammalian and avian species combined. The crystal structures of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins indicate that sialic acid is not a receptor for virus attachment nor a substrate for release, suggesting a novel mechanism of influenza A virus attachment and activation of membrane fusion for entry into host cells. In summary, our findings indicate that bats constitute a potentially important reservoir for influenza viruses."

In summary, the authors have characterized a new influenza virus from a flat-faced fruit bat (_Artibeus planirostris_) in the Amazon River basin in northern Peru. While our phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Peruvian bat virus shares common ancestry with recently identified Guatemalan H17N10 bat viruses, their genetic and phylogenetic divergence is such that we propose that their HA and NA genes be designated as new subtypes H18 and N11, respectively. A high frequency of antibodies is consistent with widespread circulation of these viruses in bat populations from the Americas. These data raise the number of influenza virus HA types from 16 to 18 and the number of neuraminidase types from 9 to 11. - Mod.CP]
