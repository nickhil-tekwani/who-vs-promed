Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh said based on
figures released by the Vector-borne Disease Branch of the Health Ministry
the number of dengue cases increased by 42.4 percent between 1997 and last
year. A total of 27,370 dengue cases were reported in the country last year
in which 58 people died, compared to 19,225 cases in 1997 with 47 deaths,
he told a post Cabinet meeting news conference at his office here [Kuala
Lumpur.
Among the causes identified for the increase were the drought and the water
supply shortage crisis which forced people to store water in all types of
containers facilitating breeding of the Aedes mosquito. Apart from that,
failure to keep construction and factory sites clear of mosquito breeding
grounds also contributed to the increase in dengue cases.
Since the dengue preventive campaign launched in 1997, two million checks
had been conducted nationwide and compound fines totaling RM1.2 million
were collected from a total of 18,125 offences of breeding Aedes
mosquitoes. [But "Measures to date have not been that effective and I am
sad that our efforts have not been fruitful and have not led to an
increased awareness among the people," he said.
However, there has been a marked decrease of 25.8 per cent in the number of
dengue cases in Sabah [a province on the Island of Borneo from 310 in 1997
to 230 last year. However, in other states there had been increases even of
up to 200 per cent, Ting said. He did not name the states.
