<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2001/june/22june2001.html>

During 2001 the following countries have reported cases of W135
meningococcal disease to WHO. (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2001/may/16may2001.html>)
Most cases are associated with international travel or contact with
travellers to Saudi Arabia.
Burkina Faso
----------------
_N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed in 4
cases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,
United States. Travel/ contact history of cases is not yet known.
Following a joint mission of the Institut Pasteur, Paris and
Association pour la Medecine Preventive (AMP) to investigate the
epidemic meningitis situation, 10 additional cases of _N.
meningitidis_ W135 were laboratory confirmed. The samples were taken
from documented cases between 10-24 Apr 2001 and the proportion of _N.
meningitidis_ isolates belonging to the W135 serogroup was found to be
37% of the total _N. meningitidis_ isolates identified by PCR on
collected specimens.
***None of the cases had any relationship with the 2001 Haj pilgrimage
(travel or contact history).***
Among 4 strains that were cultured from the same period, 3 were
W135:2a:P1-2,5 and belong to the ET-37 complex.
Niger
-------
A joint mission of Institut Pasteur, Paris and AMP investigated the
epidemic meningitis situation and identified 10 laboratory confirmed
cases of _N. meningitidis_ W135. The samples were taken from
documented cases between 10-16 Apr 2001 and the proportion of _N.
meningitidis_ isolates belonging to the W135 serogroup was found to be
40% of the total _N. meningitidis_ isolates identified by PCR on
collected specimens.
***None of the cases had any relationship with the 2001 Haj pilgrimage
(travel or
contact history).***
Central African Republic
------------------------
3 cases (Haj pilgrims) have been reported. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup
W135 has been laboratory confirmed.
Denmark
-----------
2 cases (one case close contact with Haj pilgrims, the travel/contact
history of the second case is not yet known) have been reported. _N.
meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.
France
--------
2 cases (close contacts with Haj pilgrims) have been reported. _N.
meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.
Norway
---------
4 cases (2 contacts with Haj pilgrims) have been reported. _N.
meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.
Saudi Arabia
----------------
109 cases (predominantly Haj pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia)
including 35 deaths have been reported between 9 Feb & 22 Mar 2001.
_N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed in more
than half of the cases.
Singapore
------------
4 cases (3 close contacts with Haj pilgrims, 1 with history of travel
to Saudi Arabia), including 1 death have been reported. 2 of the cases
occurred in January 2001, before the main period of pilgrimage to
Saudi Arabia. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory
confirmed.
United Kingdom
--------------------
41 cases (8 pilgrims returning from the Haj, 19 cases in close
contacts and data outstanding on the remaining cases) including 11
deaths of laboratory confirmed invasive _N. meningitidis_ serogroup
W135 have been reported. WHO recommends that chemoprophylaxis be
given to close contacts of the cases, such as persons sleeping in the
same dwelling. In most countries rifampicin is recommended.
In preparation for the Umrah and the Haj seasons for next year, the
Ministry of Health of the Government of Saudi Arabia has notified the
Ministries of Health of all countries from which pilgrims arrive, that
the vaccination against meningococcal meningitis with the quadrivalent
vaccine (serogroups A,C, Y & W135) has been added to the health
requirements for arrivals coming to the Umrah and Haj.
WHO encourages national reference laboratories to closely monitor
meningococcal disease.
