An Oregon woman has become the 1st person worldwide known to have had an eye infestation by a tiny worm species previously seen only in cattle that is spread by flies that feed on eyeball lubrication, U.S. government researchers said on [Mon 12 Feb 2018].

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists said 14 translucent parasitic worms of the species _Thelazia gulosa_, all less than half an inch (1.27 cm) long, were extracted from the 26-year-old woman's eye over a 20-day period before her symptoms dissipated.

This species of Thelazia worm was previously seen in cattle throughout the northern United States and southern Canada, the researchers reported in a study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. They said the study indicates that North Americans may be more vulnerable than previously understood to such infections.

If the worms remain in a person's eye for a prolonged time, they can cause corneal scarring and even blindness, according to the researchers.

"Cases of eye worm parasitic infections are rare in the USA, and this case turned out to be a species of the _Thelazia_ that had never been reported in humans," said study lead author Richard Bradbury, who works with the CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria.

More information on _Thelazia_ spp. can be found at the CDC website: https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/thelaziasis/index.html. _Thelazia_ spp. in a helminth belonging to the group of Nematodes. The worm is transmitted by infected flies and the final host (including humans) is infected when the fly feeds on the tears of the definitive host. The larvae invade the conjunctival sac of the definitive host and become adults after about a month and 2 additional molts. - Mod.EP
