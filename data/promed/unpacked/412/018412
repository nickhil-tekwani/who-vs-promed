[While there have been only 2 confirmed cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in 2021, the continued detection of positive environmental samples in Pakistan signal that the virus is circulating there. It appears as though the challenges of the circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) continue into 2021. Right now, there have been 2 cases attributable to WPV1 and 26 cases attributable to cVDPV2. At the risk of being a broken record, perhaps the time has come to seriously consider IPV.
