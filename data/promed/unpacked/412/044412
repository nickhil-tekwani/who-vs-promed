Pandemic H1N1 flu virus found in pigs in Norfolk
------------------------------------------------
A 6th case of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus in pigs has today [2
Dec 2009] been confirmed in the UK.

Pigs on a farm in Norfolk [England] have been confirmed as having a
strain of influenza commonly known as 'swine flu' in people. This
follows earlier cases in Northern Ireland.

Routine scanning surveillance has confirmed that the strain of the
virus found is virtually identical to strains currently circulating in
humans. It is not uncommon for pigs to be affected by influenza.
Influenza in pigs is not a notifiable disease.

Voluntary measures set out in a new Code of Practice on influenza in
pigs drawn up by the pig industry, Defra, Devolved Administrations,
and other government bodies, are in place on the farm.

There is no food safety risk, pandemic H1N1 2009 has not been shown to
be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and cooked
pork or pork products.

Notes to editors
----------------
- Pandemic H1N1 2009 has been confirmed in pigs in many other
countries around the world including Argentina, Australia Canada,
China, Finland, Northern Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Iceland,
Ireland, Taiwan, and the USA.

- Pigs are susceptible to influenza viruses and some strains of
influenza viruses circulate widely in pigs throughout the world. These
viruses are generically termed swine influenza and are considered
endemic in most pig producing countries, including UK. In Europe, the
influenza viruses commonly seen are 'avian-like' H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2.

- VLA [Veterinary Laboratories Agency, UK] sequencing has confirmed
this virus is virtually identical to the strain currently circulating
in humans and the virus has not undergone any genetic reassortment.

- H1N1 pandemic strain is widely circulating in the community and
spread into pigs is not an unexpected event given that it is widely
known that H1 human influenza strains can infect pigs. There is no
evidence that pigs play any significant role in transmitting human
influenza to people, and thus the main risk to people remains through
transmission in the community from person to person spread.

- The evidence so far is that the A (H1N1) pandemic virus in pigs has
remained identical to the virus in humans.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[Since the confirmation of the 1st case of H1N1 in UK pigs on 16 Sep
2009 and its reporting to the OIE, the UK CVO (chief veterinary
officer) has submitted 10 follow-up reports to the OIE, on a weekly
basis. In a previous outbreak (follow-up report No 8, submitted 13 Nov
2009), in Northern Ireland, clinical signs in the affected animals
were described and the following comments were included:
"Coughing in young sows noticed one week before samples submitted.
Increased mortality in young piglets. No links with other 3 outbreaks.
No illness in pig workers. Human flu has been circulating in the
area." Notification of the current case is expected to include data on
the presence (or absence) of clinical signs in the affected animals. -
