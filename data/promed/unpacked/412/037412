[Even though influenza A (H1N1) was diagnosed in some pigs in 2 farms
across the country, there was no evidence of clinical disease reported from
any of the positive cases. These results reflect the importance and success
of the A/H1N1 influenza virus surveillance programme which began in May
2009 in the country. The only other countries in East Asia which have
reported the pandemic H1N1 strain are China (dogs and swine both with
clinical disease); Indonesia (surveillance only); Taiwan (swine, clinical
disease); Japan (surveillance only); Thailand (surveillance); Singapore
(unknown method of identification of viral presence) and Australia (unknown
method of identification of viral presence). So, a quick review indicates
that surveillance is very important to establish the presence and extent of
the disease in a geographic region and will pick up cases in the absence of
clinical signs. - Mods.FE/PC
