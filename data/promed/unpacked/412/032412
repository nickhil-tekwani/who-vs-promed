According to the press service of the Emergency Situations Ministry
of the Kyrgyz Republic, on Sat 12 Mar 2011, a bull belonging to a
resident of the village of Ornok in Natyn [Naryn] district died as a
result of rabies virus infection. A cow belonging to the same
villager then died on Tue 15 Mar 2011.

Staff of the district veterinary and epidemiological service have
sent tissue samples for confirmatory laboratory diagnosis. The Press
Service reported that results of these tests are not available yet,
but all members of the villager's family have been vaccinated. As an
additional measure, 36 stray dogs have been shot.

[Rabies is endemic in Kyrgyzstan, and the following information on
rabies infection in bovines is reproduced from a commentary by Mod.AS
accompanying a report of a similar incident in Ukraine (see: Rabies -
Ukraine: (VI) bovine, human exposure 20101009.3668):

"Generally, rabies in herbivores is, like in humans, a dead-end
disease. An owner, handler or an attending veterinarian may become
exposed to rabies themselves by searching, bare handed, for an
offending foreign body in a choking animal. Rabies may present in
cattle in either of 2 forms. In the furious form, normally docile
animals may attack humans and other animals, though biting is rather
rare. Milk production ceases abruptly in dairy cattle. The cow may
appear hypersensitive and will follow sounds and movements intensely.
The affected cattle may exhibit abnormal bellowing which may continue
intermittently, or voiceless attempts to bellow described as yawning.
Those who have heard this sound once will recognize it readily. In
the paralytic form, the 1st sign may be paralysis of the throat.
Drooling of saliva, grinding of the teeth, extension of the head, and
bloat may occur. The cow may appear to be choking. Laryngeal
paralysis can cause a change in vocalizations, including the
aforementioned abnormal bellow, though this is more common in the
furious form. Weakness in the hindquarters may occur and is always
accompanied by decreased sensation to the affected area. Paralysis of
the anus and penis in the bull may be seen. Eventually, the animal
will go down and be unable to get up as paralysis becomes complete.
These animals do not attack others."
