Four people have died in Nakuru [County] in a suspected cholera outbreak at Ponda Mali estate; 9 others are at the Nakuru Referral Hospital.

Nakuru Health executive Mungai Kabii said the 1st case was reported last week on Wednesday, 22 Apr 2015. "We have 6 people from Rhonda area, 2 from Bondeni and 1 from Ponda Mali currently undergoing treatment," Kabii said in Nakuru town yesterday, 27 Apr 2015.

He said the county has started an anti-cholera drive to educate residents on the disease. "We have banned all street food vendors. It is unfortunate that we have lost 4 people in a week," Kabii said.

The county has started issuing chlorine tablets to residents.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Delta State)

At least 30 people have been killed in the latest cholera outbreak in Nigeria's oil-rich Delta state's Isoko South community, a health official said on Monday [20 Apr 2015].

According to the official, people of the local community had been facing challenges of cholera disease since 2010, when their main source of drinking water was polluted. He said, rather than seeking medical help at the local health center, the people resorted to traditional medicines and self-medication to cure themselves.

"It was not until after the disease had claimed 5 lives that they (the local residents) brought it to the knowledge of the local authorities," the official said.

In 2010, more than 30 people had died when the 1st cholera outbreak was recorded following the pollution of the main source of water supply in the same area of Delta state.

[3] Diarrhea - South Sudan (Jonglei State)
Date: Fri 17 Apr 2015

About 150 children up to the age of 5 have been treated for acute watery diarrhea between February and April 2015 [in Duk County, Jonglei State].

SMC runs one primary health care centre (PHCC) headed by a clinical officer in Poktap and another primary health care unit (PHCU) headed by a community health worker in Ayueldit. Both clinics have been operating either in the open under trees or in tents divided into small wards used to admit people.

"The ward in tents is available, but no beds and its capacity is small," Machok said, adding that medicines used to treat the condition are also out of stock.

Acute watery diarrhea is caused by poor hygiene and sanitation conditions and is fatal if not treated in time. Children quickly become dehydrated and will also suffer complications such as fever, coughing if left untreated. Improving hygiene and sanitation standards in the communities is the only means to reduce the number of cases of acute diarrhea and other related infections.

As part of the campaign, medical staff provided health education on topics such as eating food in a clean environment, washing hands with ash or soap after using the toilet, drinking water from the boreholes and properly disposing of waste.

Following the outbreak of violence across the country in mid-December 2013, Duk suffered major destruction by rebels forces in South Sudan and insecurity remains an ongoing challenge.

[4] Cholera - Haiti (Ouest Department)

Four people are dead among 15 cases of cholera infection recorded in Fonds-Verrettes [Ouest Department] on Thu 23 Apr 2015. This was learned on Mon 27 Apr 2015 by the online agency AlterPresse from the Haitian Red Cross. One of the victims died in the locality of Solyet, when the patient was transported to the Cholera Treatment Center (CTC) of Funds-Parisien, according to Julien Zetrenne, a representative of the Haitian Red Cross in Fonds-Verrettes. There is no CTC in Fonds-Verrettes. The Red Cross plays at best a role of 1st responders.

"After the removal of each body, we come to spray the area and provide chlorine to the family and other families in the area for water treatment," said Zetrenne. Medicine and chlorine distributed are from a stock offered by the French Red Cross. "We spray the house and the entire court, including latrines and some pipes. However, we want to reopen the CTC in Fonds-Verrettes to avoid the worst, "says Zetrenne, recognizing the limits of the actions performed.

Since the closure of the 2 CTCs of the town, residents must take a motorcycle ride to Fonds-Parisien (communal section of Ganthier) to receive treatment. The dirt road between Fonds-Verrettes and Fonds-Parisien makes for a difficult and perilous journey for cholera patients. Often, people are dying of cholera on the trip, before reaching the care center. The distance from the city center of Fonds-Verrettes to Fonds-Parisien is about 24 km (about 14 miles).
