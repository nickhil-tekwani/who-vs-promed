Citrus canker found in Martin grove, spreads to south Florida
--------------------------------------
Citrus canker, the industry-threatening disease that has been raising fears
among growers in Indian River and St. Lucie counties since late in 2004,
has moved south into Martin County. State Department of Agriculture
officials on Tuesday reported finding 69 infected trees in the middle of a
1500-acre grapefruit and orange grove in western Martin County along the
St. Lucie County line.
The trees are in the middle of an eastern stand of grapefruit trees and
could require 250 to 400 acres of trees to be destroyed, said Ronald
Edwards, president of Evans Properties, of Vero Beach, owners of the
grove. "We're going to lose those acres, that's fairly certain, but
hopefully that's all there is. We don't know," Edwards said. "They're still
looking."
Inspectors are to return to the grove today. To eradicate canker, all
citrus trees within 1900 feet of an infected tree must be destroyed. At 86
trees to an acre, the initial find could require destruction of 1230 to
3440 trees.
The infection is the 1st in Martin County since canker was found in 2001 in
Sunrise Grove along Interstate 95, just north of the Palm Beach County
line. "It is not good news," said Doug Bournique, executive director of the
Indian River Citrus League, a growers' group based in Vero Beach.
The last previous discovery of a canker-infected grove on the Treasure
Coast was made in late February 2005, making growers and government
agricultural officials hopeful that no more canker would be found. A
routine inspection in Port St. Lucie in December 2004 turned up the 1st
known infection in St. Lucie County. The outbreak became more pronounced
during January and February, when about 2500 acres of canker-infected trees
were found at residences and groves in St. Lucie and Indian River counties.
State officials estimate that almost 400 000 commercial and residential
trees along the Treasure Coast have been or will be destroyed before the
start of the next hurricane season.

[Citrus canker has erupted again in Martin County. The disease was reported
on 7 Dec 2004 in 1 tree in a grove near the Indian River/St. Lucie county
line. On 25 Jan 2005 a routine Sentinel Tree Survey conducted by USDA found
3 suspected citrus trees on 2 adjacent properties in Sebastian. Officials
of the State Citrus Canker Eradication Program immediately launched a
comprehensive survey of these areas to identify the extent of the infection
and to prevent further spread. Commercial control actions (quarantine
removal) were implemented to remove 16 878 trees including 226 trees
confirmed to be infected by the citrus canker bacterium (_Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pv. _citri_).
In Florida, the predicted negative economic impact of allowing citrus
canker (CC) to become endemic clearly favors eradication. The Florida
approach to CC eradication has evolved over time. In the first program from
1915 to 1933, infected trees were usually doused with an incendiary fuel
and burned in place. In later programs, infected trees have been burned in
place or removed mechanically. The necessity of removing exposed -- in
addition to obviously infected -- trees was recognized in the 1986 program,
and a guideline calling for removal of all citrus within 125 ft of infected
citrus was adopted based on studies of inoculum dispersal in Argentina. In
the latest eradication program with citrus leafminer involvement), even the
125-ft radius was deemed inadequate for eradication in most situations, and
a general policy of removing infected trees plus exposed trees within a
1900-ft radius is now in place. Through risk assessment, exposure zones are
determined commensurate with !
the amount of disease, age of infection, inoculum dispersal opportunities,
environment, susceptibility of hosts, physical access to potential hosts
for regular inspection, plus other factors. In these exposure zones, all
citrus is removed. Guidelines call for quarantine areas to extend one to 2
miles in all directions from infected citrus. No citrus material is allowed
to move into or out of the quarantine zone unless risk-assessed. Survey and
inspection crews should practice rigorous sanitation of hands, shoes,
clothing, or any equipment that comes in contact with citrus before moving
from property to property. Quaternary ammonium disinfectants are available
for use on both inanimate surfaces and for application to bare skin and
clothing. In areas of the world where CC is endemic, disease management
involves use of resistant varieties, windbreaks to hinder inoculum
dispersal and timely applications of copper-containing bactericides.
Selective pruning of infected tissues is also utilized in citrus growing
areas where labor-intensive practices prevail. - Mod.DH]
