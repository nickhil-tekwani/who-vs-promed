The deaths of [7 out of] 12 babies at the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital (KHMH) have been linked to the outbreak of _Enterobacter cloacae_, an organism that is said to be responsible for major outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) all over the world.

In a release on Wednesday [22 May 2013], Director of Medical Services at the hospital, Dr Adrian Coye noted that the organism is not a superbug. "The problem lies in the fact that it is very fastidious, difficult to clear, and there is transmission by direct contact and also by indirect contact. So it can be on the skin of any of us right now in this room, on your clothing material, on stethoscopes, on IV drip stands, the surfaces in the clinical area, etc," he said. "The profile of the resistance pattern within the organism we have found is sensitive to antibiotics that we do have in the hospital and made available through the Ministry of Health."

Due to the nature of the outbreak, he said help will be coming from the Washington-based Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO). "In that light, this is part of why we see that even PAHO Washington is sending us assistance to see and help us analyze the outbreak that we have, because it is matching a global trend," he said.

Although 12 babies died, only 7 tested positive for the organism. "And so the other deaths happened as a result of pre-maturity-related issues and are not related to this infection."

According to Boye [Coye?], the hospital is implementing an aggressive approach to determine whether there is actually an environmental source. "So we've actually brought in a specialist for the purpose of studying all aspects of our ventilation and all other areas within the unit that we can."

In the aftermath of the deaths, the hospital's NICU has been closed, and an independent contractor has ordered an assessment of the air quality in the unit. This will be followed by the removal and disinfection of all equipment and terminal cleaning of the entire unit.

The Ministry of Health said it is making all of its resources available to the KHMH to investigate and deal promptly with "this alarming situation" at the country's only referral hospital.

[_Enterobacter cloacae_ is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacillius in the Enterobacteriaceae family. It frequently causes a wide variety of opportunistic infections in hospitalized patients, especially in ICUs. These infections have included bacteremia; intravenous catheter, urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue infections; surgical wound and intra-abdominal infections; septic arthritis; and osteomyelitis. Outbreaks have been traced to contaminated hands of personnel; hospital equipment, such as endoscopes, stethoscopes and dialysis equipment; blood products; parenternal nutrition solutions; and albumin. _E. cloacae_ has become a nosocomial pathogen in neonatal units (1-4).

Management of infections caused by _E. cloacae_ is complicated by the organism's resistance to multiple antibiotics. _E. cloacae_ produce AmpC beta-lactamases, which are chromosome-encoded cephalosporinases that mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations (5). AmpC enzymes may be initially inducible but can be expressed constitutively at high levels following mutation, called derepression (5). Overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone, which can emerge during therapy with these drugs (6). These organisms frequently exhibit additional resistance to other classes of antibiotics.

Carbapenems are the most reliable beta-lactam drugs for the treatment of severe _E. cloacae_ infections, but carbapenem resistance can arise by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation).

Belize is a country located on the northeastern coast of Central America (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize). Belize City, with a population of 67 964 residents, is the largest city and capital of Belize (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize_City). Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital is the main public hospital in Belize City, where it is both the national referral hospital, and the district hospital for Belize District (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Heusner_Memorial_Hospital).
