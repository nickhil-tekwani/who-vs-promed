Teen With Meningitis on AirTran Flights
------------------------------------------
A teenager who fell seriously ill on an AirTran Airways flight was
diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, and the airline was contacting
passengers who sat near her, a spokesman said. The girl, whose
identity wasn't released, was in critical condition Monday [23 Jul
2007] at Wesley Medical Center [Wichita, KS], a hospital spokeswoman said.
The teen had traveled Saturday [21 Jul 2007] from Orlando, FL, to
Atlanta on Flight 862 and then to Wichita on Flight 687, AirTran
spokesman Dave Hirschman said. The crew called for an ambulance to
meet the plane at the gate after the girl became sick on the 2nd
flight and unresponsive, he said. The airline notified the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday[22 Jul 2007] .
Meningitis, a bacterial infection of the lining surrounding the brain
and spinal cord, primarily affects children, killing about 10 percent
of those infected. Symptoms include a stiff neck, high fever,
headaches and vomiting. It can be contracted by direct close contact
with discharges from the nose or throat of an infected person, but
not through casual contact or breathing the same air.
The planes the girl traveled on have been thoroughly cleaned and
returned to service, and AirTran was notifying fewer than 20 people
who sat in her immediate vicinity, Hirschman said. The airline is a
subsidiary of AirTran Holdings Inc., based in Orlando, FL.

[Another hazard of airline travel: The news release suggests that a
teenager developed a rapidly progressive illness while onboard
airplane flights from Orlando to Atlanta and then Atlanta to Wichita,
KS, that was diagnosed as bacterial meningitis. The patient is is now
in critical condition at a hospital in Wichita. The exact bacterial
species is not specified. Preceding symptoms and co-morbid conditions
are not given.

As a result of the control of _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b
infections that has followed _H. influenzae_ vaccination programs,
meningococcus is the major cause of meningitis in children and young
adults. The pneumococcus is another possible etiologic agent in this
age group. Meningococcal meningitis occurs sporadically or as
epidemics. Certain types of close contact of a case of meningococcal
meningitis place a person at increased risk of developing meningitis
for which antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis is recommended. These
contacts include household members, daycare center members, and
anyone directly exposed to the patient's respiratory secretions
(e.g., by kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or intubation of the
patient) (see:
<http://0-www.cdc.gov.mill1.sjlibrary.org/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046263.htm>).
Antibiotics recommended for chemoprophylaxis are rifampin,
ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended
for school or work contacts. Chemoprophylaxis for contacts of
pneumococcal meningitis is not defined.
According to the CDC, for management of airline passengers exposed to
meningococcal disease, household members traveling with the index
patient as well as persons traveling with the index patient who have
prolonged close contact (e.g., roommates, members of the same sports
team) should be identified and the need for antimicrobial
chemoprophylaxis evaluated. Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should
also be considered for airline passengers who have had direct contact
with respiratory secretions from the index patient, and for
passengers seated directly next to the index patient on prolonged
flights (>8 hours)
(<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/menin-guidelines.htm>).
Because the risk for illness is highest during the first few days
after infection, chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as
possible (ideally within 24 hours) after contact with an index case-patient
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm>).
Chemoprophylaxis administered >14 days is probably of limited or no
value. For both the meningococcal conjugate and the polysaccharide
vaccines, approximately 7-10 days are required following vaccination
for development of protective levels of anti-meningococcal
antibodies. Meningococcal vaccination, however, is used to control
spread of meningitis in outbreak situations. - Mod.ML]
