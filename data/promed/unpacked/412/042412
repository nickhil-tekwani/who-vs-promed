Tsetse fly and sleeping sickness risk; Kenya
--------------------------------------------
Tsetse fly, which causes sleeping sickness in man and Nagana in cattle, is
back. The pests, which had successfully been brought to 99 per cent control
levels by 1991, is said to have crept back from the Congo about 3 months
ago and then spread to Serengeti in Tanzania and now to Ruma Park in Lambwe
Valley.
"There is a general upsurge of tsetse that is not only being experienced in
Kenya," explains Dr Rajinder Saini, tsetse programme leader at the
International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Nairobi.
Although no cases of human sleeping sickness have been reported in Lambwe
so far, 8 cases have already been reported in Tororo and one case on the
Kenyan side of the border.
Reports from a medical circular TropNetEuro and ProMED-mail indicated that
5 tourists visiting the Serengeti National Park and other parks in Tanzania
had been infected with African trypanosomiasis towards the end of March
2001. Says Dr Saini, "The Serengeti case is far beyond comparison to the
Lambwe Valley one currently, and has chances of spreading rapidly if not
monitored, though this does not necessarily mean that the Ruma Park matter
should also be taken lightly."
Among visitors, 2 Italian nationals of unidentified ages, a 44-year-old
British woman, a 41-year-old Swedish national, and a 68-year-old South
African have been reported to have suffered a variety of ailments related
to trypanosomes after visiting the Serengeti Park in Tanzania.
Both the Italians and the Swedish tourist tested positive for _T.
rhodesiense_ (a.k.a _T. brucei_). Asked whether it could be a new strain of
the tsetse fly species, Dr Saini said that it is simply a matter of
unsustainable control methodologies employed in the past encouraging return
of the pests.
"The government does not have adequate resources to support livestock
industry due to other priorities, much of the time leaving the livestock
farmer on his own."
A meeting held at Mbita Research point called by the Kenya Trypanosomosis
Research Institute, (KETRI) in collaboration with ICIPE and KWS on 15 Mar
2001, noted with concern the alarming rate at which the tsetse flies were
increasing in the region.
KETRI in their survey conducted during the same meeting in March said only
31 out of 764 animals sampled in 8 representative areas had been infected,
translating to about 4 per cent infection rate. The sampled areas were
Kamato, God Jope, Nyadenda, Magunga, Olando, Ndisi, Ombek, and Andingo.
"We believe there could be another disease complicating the situation in
Lambwe besides Nagana," says Ketri director Dr Mathu Ndungu. "Babesiosis is
a high suspect in this case. The problem is that most farmers tend to
quickly point fingers at Nagana immediately [when their livestock acquire
any peculiar symptoms."

[The reported increase in tsetse activity in Kenya and increase in
trypanosomiasis "Nagana" in livestock provides further weight to the
presumed increase in human cases of trypanosomiasis seen in tourists to
western Tanzania, and to the reports of increasing numbers of cases in
northern Uganda bordering Sudan. This report seems to suggest that there is
also an increase in trypanosomiasis in Kenya. The report points to
decreasing resources for control and surveillance, making it difficult to
assess the situation in Central and Eastern Africa, though it certainly
needs urgent attention. - Mod.EP
