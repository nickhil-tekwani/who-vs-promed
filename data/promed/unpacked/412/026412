The Osun State Commissioner for Agriculture reported 12 000 pigs dead in
the state in the last 3 months due to African Swine Fever (ASF) infection.
The Commissioner, who was represented by the State's Deputy Director of
Veterinary Services, Dr Adegbite Ojo, was addressing Livestock Farmers on
how to contain the epizootic. Osun State shares a common boundary with Oyo
State, where more than 25 000 pigs have been lost in its capital city
Ibadan alone between June and October 2001 in confirmed ASF outbreaks. The
disease has also been reported in the neighbouring Delta and Ogun State.
