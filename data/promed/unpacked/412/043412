The Health Services Department (SEDES) of Santa Cruz declared an
epidemic of canine rabies after confirming 38 cases of the disease so
far this year [2011], a figure higher than that registered in 2010
when 19 cases were reported. As of now, no human cases have been
reported, but a new vaccination campaign is being prepared to halt the
spread of the disease. According to SEDES, in Santa Cruz department
[state or province equivalent], there are 450 000 pets, including
dogs, cats, monkeys, parrots and others [rabies occurs in mammals, not
birds, so rabies in parrots is not of concern. - Mod.TY].

The SEDES Director, Joaquin Monasterio, explained that 22 of the
cases are concentrated in the [department] capital and 16 in rural
areas. "These numbers are worrying, and the public must become aware
and vaccinate their pets, above all those less than 3 months of age,
since 90 per cent of the positive cases have occurred in these small
[young] animals," he said. He added that in relation to previous
years, positive cases have increased 69 per cent. "Our concern is that
there could be a rabies outbreak in humans in the city."

Monasterio stated that there will be intervention in the unregulated
trade in pets in shops and plazas without vaccination certification.
"We will confiscate the animals, and the owners will be penalized
financially."

According to SEDES statistics, in 2005, 394 canine rabies cases were
reported, a year also in which an epidemic was declared; in 2006, a
decline to 315 [cases] was declared; in 2007, [the number] declined to
95, in 2008 to 43, and in 2009 to just 9 cases. 2010 yielded an
increase to 19 cases.

As the official responsible for SEDES Zoonoses, Jhonny Ruiz said that
2 months ago, a vaccination campaign was carried out in the rural
areas and across the city; [the next campaign] will be on 20 and 21
Aug [2011]. They hope to immunize 500 000 animals.

[There have been scattered canine rabies cases in several departments
in Bolivia this year (2011). The National Zoonoses Program of the
Ministry of Health reported 25 canine rabies cases in Santa Cruz
department as of 1 Jul 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110702.2013). The above report indicates that a little more than 2
weeks later, there are now 38 cases. With the city-wide vaccination
program more than a month away, it seems likely that more canine cases
will occur with the attendant risk of human exposure. There already
has been one human rabies death in Cochabamba department this year
(2011) (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110411.1150).
