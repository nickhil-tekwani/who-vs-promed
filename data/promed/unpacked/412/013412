Mozambique takes measures to control foot-and-mouth disease
---------------------------------------------------
Mozambican authorities are preparing to brand cattle throughout the
country, in order to control the movement of the animals and improve the
management of the deadly foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), local media reported
on Friday.
The Mozambican deputy national director of livestock, Ventura Macamo, told
press that priority will go to those areas that have been affected by FMD,
particularly along the border with Zimbabwe.
He noted that this is a costly process, and will have to be undertaken in
accordance with the country's financial capacity. Preparations include
provincial budgeting, taking into account the coverage of the priority
areas. Macamo could not estimate the number of cattle to be branded, saying
that planning is still at local level.
Restriction in cattle movements in the country were last reviewed in April
2004, when it was decided that cattle could be moved for slaughtering
purposes, while maintaining the ban on movement for reproduction.
Macamo explained that a total lift of the ban will only be decreed when it
is found that there is no longer any danger of the spreading of FMD, and
when the cattle are branded, to allow better control in the future.
FMD affects cloven-hoofed animals like pigs and cattle. It causes sores,
blisters and fever, deadly for livestock, but harmless for humans.
The disease's worst outbreak took place in Europe. Some 6 million farm
animals were culled across Britain alone in 2001, which affected around
2000 farms and slaughterhouses. The disease also hit Africa, with Tanzania,
Zimbabwe and Zambia among the affected. Mozambique also reported an
outbreak in May 2004.
