It was suggested that a factor in the transmission of Brucellosis in elk is
the eating of afterbirth. Many, (most?), mammals eat afterbirth. In my
experience as a veterinarian it is only the mother that does this at the
time of delivery. In that case, the afterbirth would not be infected
unless the mother was already infected.

earlier. Thanks for keeping me on my toes. - Mod.TG

The term "elk", referred to in the post as an alternate reservoir for
_Brucella_ sp. in domestic cattle in North America, may cause confusion on
a multinational list such as ProMED-mail.
_Alces alces_ exists in North America and on this continent is called a
moose. This species also exists in Europe where it is either called a moose
or an elk. (Van den Brink, 1968 : The Peterson Field Guide Series : A Field
Guide to the Mammals of Britain and Europe. Boston, Massachusetts, USA,
Houghton Mifflin Company.)
_Cervus canadensis_ exists in North America and is called an elk. This
species does not exists in Europe. (Burt WH, Grossenheider, 1964 : The
Peterson Field Guide Series : A Field Guide to the Mammals. Boston,
Massachusetts, USA, Houghton Mifflin Company.)
This is a pertinent example of the need to refer to species by their
internationally accepted Latin name and not just by a regional common name.
Also, when studying trans-species transmission of infectious agents in
animals (zoonotic or otherwise), it is IMPERATIVE to have qualified
wildlife experts on the team (BOTH laboratory zoologists which study
speciation by nucleic acids and traditional zoologists who study the intact
animal). Identification of species must be exact and specimens of the
presumed reservoir must be taken for further reference. I became aware of
this when I tried to update the nomenclature of sylvatic mammals, naturally
infected with _Trypanosoma cruzi_ for my veterinary thesis on the zoonotic
cycle of this agent (literature from 1909 to the present). I found several
published lists of species identified by Latin and common names. Many of
the Latin names have been changed throughout the years, as well as the
classification of the animal. There were several Latin names that even
experts at the Smithsonian Institute were unable to recognize. The author
of the original list (who wrote in Spanish) is long gone. There is no
reference of what species the name actually refers to. No specimen is known
to have been taken. The information is thus lost. Other species were listed
as having been sampled for _T. cruzi_ in countries where the animal is not
known to exist. I, and Smithsonian experts could only guess what exact
species was actually sampled.

[Raymond is quite correct that I was negligent in not including the
scientific name of the elk. I am grateful for the excellent examples as a
reminder. - Mod.TG
