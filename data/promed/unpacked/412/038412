Blue mold disease in garlic is associated worldwide with various _Penicillium_
species and has been [caused] significant annual crop losses in Argentina; the
world's 2nd largest exporter of garlic. To identify the responsible pathogenic
_Penicillium_ species, symptomatic plants were sampled in La Consulta station
(33 deg 45 min S, 69 deg 02 min W) and damp-chambered. Characteristic disease
symptoms are stunted and chlorotic plants with withered leaves and reduced
bulb size.
Bulbs are often covered with blue/green conidial masses. Isolations were made
from fungal colonies emerging on affected bulbs. Pure cultures (IBT 26466,
26467, 26511 and 26512; CMB collection, BioCentrum-DTU, Denmark) were
initially identified by micro-morphology as _Penicillium allii_ and
identifications were confirmed by comparing RP-HPLC secondary metabolite
profiles with those of type _P. allii_ strains.
To confirm pathogenicity, sterilised garlic cloves were injured with a needle
and inoculated with 5 micro-litres of _P. allii_ spore suspensions (adjusted
to 5x106 conidia per ml). Cloves were planted in a field not previously
cultivated with garlic (4 replications and an untreated control). The original
disease symptoms were produced on inoculated plants while control plants
remained healthy. The survival rate of inoculated plants was 68 percent. _P.
allii was re-isolated from symptomatic field plants.
_P. viridicatum_ was first reported as the causal agent of blue mould of
garlic in Argentina (Gatica & Oriolani, 1984) before the characterisation of
_P. allii_ (Vincent & Pitt, 1989). _P. allii_ is micro-morphologically similar
to _P. viridicatum_, and both species produce yellow exudates in pure culture.
To compare pathogenic ability, standard _P. viridicatum_ strains IBT 16939 and
15053 were inoculated into sterilised garlic cloves and incubated for 12 days.
The _P. viridicatum_ strains were not able to sporulate on the garlic cloves.
_P. hirsutum_ was recently reported as a pathogen on garlic in Argentina
(Cavagnaro et al., 2005). However, _P. allii_ but not _P. hirsutum_ has been
reported as an aggressive pathogen of garlic in comparative pathogenicity
trials conducted in moisture chambers (Overy et al., 2005). Our results
suggest that _P. allii_, rather than _P. hirsutum_ or _P. viridicatum_, is the
pathogenic species responsible for garlic crop losses due to blue mold rot in
Argentina. This is the first report confirming _P. allii_ as a field pathogen
of _A. sativum_.

[The results presented demonstrate that _Penicillium allii_, rather than _P.
hirsutum_ or _P. viridicatum_, is the pathogenic species responsible for
garlic crop losses during storage due to blue mold in Argentina. This is the
1st report confirming _P. allii_ as a field pathogen of _Allium sativum_. The
general problem of correct diagnosis of _Penicillium_ species on onions and
garlic is exemplified by this study. This plant disease in garlic is managed
by storing bulbs with a minimum of bruising, wounding, or insect damage.
Prompt curing of bulbs so the necks are dry and storing bulbs at temperatures
of 41 deg F (5 deg C) or less with low relative humidity minimizes disease
losses.
