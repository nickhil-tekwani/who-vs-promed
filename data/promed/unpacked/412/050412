Influenza like illness in the United States of America
------------------------------------------------------
The United States Government has reported 3 cases of human infection
with swine origin triple reassortant Influenza A H3N2. Between 10 and
13 Nov 2011, three children (aged 11 months, 2 years, and 3 years)
experienced onset of febrile respiratory illness. All 3 children had
visited the same health care provider in Iowa State. None of them were
hospitalized and all 3 have recovered.

Laboratory testing conducted on 18 Nov 2011 in the State Hygienic
Laboratory at the University of Iowa showed a swine-origin triple
reassortant influenza A (H3N2) (S-OtrH3N2) virus. This was confirmed
by sequencing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
on 20 Nov 2011

The 3 children attend the same daycare facility. There is an ongoing
investigation and to date, no epidemiological link to swine has been
identified in any of the 3 children. Additional investigation is
currently underway to identify and characterize the illness in other
daycare attendees, family members, or other contacts, and to determine
any exposure to swine.

These are 16th, 17th, and 18th cases of human infection with swine
origin triple reassortant influenza A (H3N2) detected in the United
States since 2009, and the 8th, 9th, and 10th cases reported this year
[2011].

WHO is closely following the situation with the US Government, CDC,
and other partners.

[Another novel swine flu virus with human genes was found this year
(2011) in mainland (China) pigs at a Hong Kong slaughterhouse. But the
swine flu H3N2 virus was considered unlikely to be a "major" human
health risk, according to the Hong Kong Centre for Food Safety. 15
pigs were found infected with "essentially a swine influenza H3N2
virus that has picked up some genes of human swine influenza virus,"
the Centre stated. They were detected out of 1000 samples taken
between August and mid-October 2011. However, according to Malik
Peiris (Chair Professor, Department of Microbiology, University of
Hong Kong) the H3N2 subtype seen in these pigs is not the same
swine-originated new H3N2 virus that has infected the 10 people in the
United States since July 2011. - Mod.CP]
