Bluetongue, one of the most feared viral diseases of sheep, has claimed
more than 10 000 sheep in the past 3 months in south India, the Press Trust
of India (PTI) reported Sunday.
Bluetongue was endemic to India and caused heavy losses annually but this
years damage was the worst, said scientists at the Haryana Agricultural
University (HAU) in Hisar, 164 kilometers northwest New Delhi.
The disease caused losses over 300 million rupees (over 7 million U.S.
dollars) in the southern state of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in the last
2 years, said Gaya Prasad, head of the Bluetongue Virus Laboratory in the
Department of Veterinary Microbiology at HAU.
