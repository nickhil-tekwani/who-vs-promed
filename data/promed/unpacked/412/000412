1st report of the root-knot nematode _Meloidogyne floridensis_ on tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) in Florida
-----------------------------------------------
GT Church, US Horticultural Research Laboratory, USDA-ARS, Fort Pierce, FL
34945. Plant Dis 2005; 89: 527, published online as DOI:
10.1094/PD-89-0527B. Accepted for publication 11 Feb 2005.
The state of Florida is the largest producer of fresh market tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_ L.) in the United States, with 2003 yields of
634 million kg on 17 700 ha, valued at USD 516 million. Effective crop
management is essential for production of vegetables in Florida because of
the presence of intense pest pressure. The identification of the pests
present is the 1st step in the development of a successful IPM (integrated
pest management) program.
Root-knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ spp.) are common nematodes that
parasitize vegetables in Florida and cause significant yield reductions
when not properly managed. In 2003 field experiments, soil was collected
from 2 research farms in Saint Lucie and Seminole counties in Florida.
Galling caused by root-knot nematode was observed on tomato at both
locations. Since females suitable for identification are difficult to
obtain from field-grown roots, field soil was placed in pots in the
greenhouse and planted with _Lycopersicon esculentum_ cv. Rutgers.
Standard morphological techniques, differential host tests, and isozyme
phenotypes were used in nematode identification. Female root-knot nematodes
were extracted from tomato roots and placed in extraction buffer (10 per
cent wt/vol sucrose, 2 per cent vol/vol Triton X-100, 0.01 per cent wt/vol
bromophenol blue). The females were crushed, loaded on a polyacrylamide
gel, and separated by electrophoresis using the PhastSystem (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The activities of malate dehydrogenase and
esterase enzymes were detected using standard techniques.
Isozyme phenotypes consistent with _Meloidogyne incognita_ (Kofoid and
White) Chitwood and _M. javanica_ (Treub) Chitwood as well as with the
newly described _M. floridensis_ Handoo (1) were observed at both locations.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _M. floridensis_ naturally
occurring on tomato in Florida. The identification and distribution of _M.
floridensis_ in vegetable production fields is important for disease
management throughout the state, since the host range is likely different
from other _Meloidogyne_ spp.

[A root-knot nematode species, previously unnamed and assumed to be "race
3" of _Meloidogyne incognita_, has now been classified as a new species,
_M. floridensis_ (Mf). Mf was isolated from nematode-resistant Nemaguard
and Okinawa peach rootstocks in Gainesville, Fla. This explains why
nematodes were infesting and reproducing in these root knot nematode
resistant rootstocks. Scientists found the pest's penchant for
nematode-resistant rootstock characteristic, which stimulated further
research. Morphological, cytological, molecular and host-range studies
conclusively determined the taxonomic position of the nematode. Using
scanning electron microscopy, it was demonstrated that differences between
Mf and _M. incognita_ were recognized. Mf did not exhibit the same host
affinities as _M. incognita_. Mf reproduced abundantly on Nemaguard and
Guardian peach rootstocks, whereby _M. incognita_ did not. Alternately, Mf
does not reproduce in peppers as does _M. incognita_. Molecular studies
confirm the uniqueness of Mf from _M. incognita_ and other root-knot nematodes.
