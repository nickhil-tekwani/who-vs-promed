Ebola virus disease, West Africa - update
-----------------------------------------
Guinea
------
As of 18:00 on 17 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 203 clinical cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 129 deaths. To date, 158 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection and 109 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 61 deaths.

In addition, 41 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 53 cases (34 deaths) are classified as suspected cases; 24 health care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 15 deaths (11 confirmed).

Clinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (50 cases, including 20 deaths), Guekedou (120/83), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported from Conakry (36 cases, including 15 deaths), Guekedou (58/34), Macenta (13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1).

These updated figures include 4 new cases isolated on 17 Apr 2014, one of whom is laboratory confirmed, and 4 deaths among existing cases; 3 of the deaths were patients with confirmed EVD; 29 patients are currently in isolation in Conakry (17), Guekedou (11) and Macenta (1), while 15 patients who recovered from their illness were discharged from hospital. The female:male ratio among confirmed cases is 1.2 : 1. The median age of 198 clinical cases for whom the age is known is 35 years and the age breakdown is 0-19 years (11 percent), 20-59 years (72 percent) and 60 and over (11 percent).

Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. A total of 230 contacts are currently under medical observation and 53 have completed their 21 days of follow-up; 7 contacts who developed symptoms continue in isolation as a precautionary measure.

Efforts to increase public health awareness continue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guinea convened a meeting with a number of diplomatic missions on 18 Apr 2014 where the Minister of Health, supported by the WHO Representative, WHO Country Office for Guinea, and WHO EVD Response Coordinator, briefed the meeting. WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are in the process of deploying additional experts to support activities in case management, infection prevention and control, contact tracing, social mobilization and psychosocial support.

Numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations.

Liberia
-------
In Liberia, the epidemiological situation remains the same. Intensive surveillance activities and other preventive measures are ongoing. No new laboratory confirmed cases of EVD have been reported from Liberia today.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event.

[2] Controlling an EVD outbreak
Date: Wed 16 Apr 2014

Sudden and deadly though it is, EVD can be contained, for 3 reasons:

1) The 1st is transmission: the virus is not airborne. It is transferred only through direct contact with someone who is visibly sick. "It's not that one person enters a bus, and half of the bus is infected," explains Dr Matthias Borchert of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Because the early symptoms of ebola resemble more common diseases, reported infections quickly grow. Following the recent outbreak, suspected cases were flagged in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Mali, before the patients later tested negative (a few results from Mali have not yet been returned).

2) The 2nd reason is preparation. The WHO, Medecins Sans Frontieres and ministries of health devote tremendous resources to building wards, isolating suspected patients and tracking their contacts. "Even basic precautions reduce the risk of transmission," says Barbara Knust of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

3) Finally, EVD is treatable. Although no cure exists, the services available in an intensive care unit can help a patient beat the bug.

In any outbreak, rumours spread quickly, conspiracy theories are rife and junk treatments proposed (a mixture of raw onions and Nescafe is one example currently doing the rounds). So reliable information is crucial. Banning travel and closing borders can push the disease underground; both are discouraged by the WHO.

According to doctors, one new aspect of the Guinea outbreak has been patients' use of mobile phones, which makes isolation wards a bit less awful and provides succour to families, encouraging communities to work with health providers rather than against them. With a continued strong response, the current outbreak can be stopped before it becomes an epidemic.

[3] Canada emergency contribution

Canada Announces Emergency Contribution to Fight Ebola Virus Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Honourable Christian Paradis, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, the Honourable John Baird, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Honourable Rona Ambrose, Minister of Health, today announced a joint funding contribution of CAD 1 285 000 [about USD 1 165 427] to address the current outbreak of the deadly ebolavirus disease [EVD] in West Africa.

"In a situation like the current EVD outbreak in West Africa, it is of critical importance to implement measures to end the chain of transmission," said Minister Paradis. "We must ensure strong surveillance and investigation as well as a coordinated response to new or suspected cases. Canada's support will play a critical role in responding to and preventing the spread of this deadly disease."

"Biological threats such as the current EVD outbreak do not recognize borders," said Minister Baird. "They represent a global problem that requires coordinated international action across multiple sectors, including health and security. Canada's contribution underscores the importance of obtaining cooperation from various sectors to help prevent, detect and rapidly respond to infectious diseases."

"The Government of Canada welcomes the World Health Organization's rapid efforts to address this outbreak of EVD, one of the most virulent diseases known to humans," said Minister Ambrose. "Canada is pleased to join other countries in this response and urges other donors to support the WHO."

[Guinea reports 8 newly confirmed cases with 5 more deaths in 24 hours.

The reasons control is possible are clearly spelled out in the 2nd report. It is emphasized that banning travel and closing borders can push the disease underground. It is interesting to learn that cell phones help to alleviate stress in patients held in isolation.

Canada understands that the outbreak is not over yet, and more resources are needed to beat it. Canada is evidently recalling its sad experience with SARS, when it suffered more cases than any other country after a case was imported. - Mod.JW
