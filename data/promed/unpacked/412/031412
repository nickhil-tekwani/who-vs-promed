It is with great sorrow that I have to report the passing of ProMED-mail's 1st foreign language list moderator, Dr Luiz Jacintho da Silva of ProMED in Portuguese (PRO/PORT), in Sao Paulo, Brazil at the age of 64. It was after a long illness, in spite of which he continued to be active in teaching and writing a book to the very end.

Luiz had a long and brilliant career. Graduating from medical school in Sao Paulo, Brazil, he did a post-doc in Liverpool and became a full professor at the state university of Campinas, Brazil in 2002. He was also director in the Secretariat of Health of the municipality of Campinas, and superintendent of the epidemic control agency (SUCEN) and coordinator of the Research Institute in the Secretariat of Health for the state of Sao Paulo, where he oversaw programs for the control of hepatitis, immunizations, leishmaniasis and Brazilian spotted fever. Throughout these activities, he kept up a steady stream of postings to PRO/PORT from 1997-2011 -- 7000 of them -- most with expert comment on the public health importance of the outbreaks. Over those 16 years, he was more productive than any other ProMED moderator; I don't know how he did it!

The citation to his ProMED-mail Award for Excellence in Outbreak Reporting reads:

"Luiz Jacintho da Silva MD was Full Professor of Transmissible Diseases in the Department of Clinical Medicine of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, Unicamp (University of Campinas), Sao Paulo, Brazil until 2011. He joined ProMED-mail in 1997 as the 1st moderator of the new ProMED Portuguese language list, focusing on outbreak news from Brazil, Portugal, and the Portuguese-speaking countries of Africa. This was ProMED's 1st regional network and 1st service in a non-English language.

"In the 16 years since then, he posted single-handedly more than 7000 outbreak reports, most of them with his expert commentary, far more than any other member of the ProMED team. He continued that level of productivity through changing responsibilities as chief of infectious diseases and later chief of all diseases for the state of Sao Paulo and postings abroad as a member of the staff of the pharmaceutical giant Novartis. Since 2011, he has served as the Director of the Dengue Vaccine Initiative at the International Vaccine Institute, Seoul, South Korea.

"His expertise and dedication to ProMED's mission cannot be praised too highly, and ProMED is proud to present its Anniversary Award to him."

Luiz is sorely missed.
