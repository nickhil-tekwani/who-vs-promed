Japan discovered a suspected case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
a cow in its southern prefecture of Miyazaki, just days after it
lifted a state of emergency, an official said.

"We cancelled 2 auctions of cows in the prefecture after a suspected
case of foot and mouth was discovered on a farm," a prefecture
official told AFP.

The region reported the case to the farm ministry and was awaiting
the test result to determine whether it is a fresh FMD case.

The highly contagious virus, which [extremely] rarely affects humans
but sickens cloven-hoofed animals, had forced the suspension of meat
sales from Miyazaki prefecture and the slaughter of almost 300 000
farm animals this year [2010].

But the prefectural government on Tuesday [31 Aug 2010] lifted a
state of emergency, allowing trade of cows in the region to resume.
