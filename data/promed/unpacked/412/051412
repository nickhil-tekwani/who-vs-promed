CDC, Aventis Pasteur Announce Allocation Plan to Address Influenza
Vaccine Shortages
----------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Aventis
Pasteur announced today the 1st phase of the plan to allocate
influenza vaccine in response to the recently announced loss of half
of the nation's expected flu vaccine supply for the 2004-2005 season.
The plan, announced by CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding and Aventis
Pasteur US President Damian Braga, calls for CDC to work closely with
Aventis to distribute in phases 22.4 million doses of unshipped
vaccine to identified areas of need throughout the country.
Beginning immediately, about 14.2 million doses of vaccine will be
allocated over the next 6-8 weeks through Aventis Pasteur contracts
directly to high-priority vaccine providers, including hospitals,
long-term care facilities, nursing homes, and private providers who
care for young children.
"This plan will help ensure that vaccine gets to those people who
need it most," said CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding. "This is a
troubling, frustrating situation for all of us and we need for all
Americans to pull together in the weeks to come to meet this
challenge head-on. This plan is the result of unprecedented
collaboration between CDC, Aventis Pasteur, and state and local
health departments across the country. And we must not forget the
other public health heroes on the front lines in grocery stores,
pharmacies, and health clinics working to prioritize vaccine."
CDC will continue to work with Aventis Pasteur and state and local
health departments to identify people, by region, on the vaccination
priority list. The approximately 8.2 million doses remaining after
the 1st phase is completed will be shipped to other high-need areas.
"Since Dr. Gerberding contacted us last week, we at Aventis Pasteur
have worked with the CDC around the clock to tackle the complex task
of getting millions of doses of influenza vaccine to thousands of
health care providers around the country. Our goal has been to direct
remaining doses as quickly as possible to those areas where large
numbers of at-risk individuals are in need," said Damian Braga,
president, Aventis Pasteur US. "It is a huge logistical feat and we
are proud to have contributed our knowledge and expertise to this
plan."
Last week CDC announced priority groups for vaccination with
inactivated influenza vaccine for the 2004-2005 influenza season:
- all children aged 6-23 months,
- adults aged 65 years and older,
- persons aged 2-64 years with underlying chronic medical conditions,
- all women who will be pregnant during influenza season,
- residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities,
- children 6 months-18 years of age on chronic aspirin therapy,
- health-care workers with direct patient care, and
- out-of-home caregivers and household contacts of children aged <6 months.
Influenza season typically peaks in the United States between
December and March. Because each season is unpredictable, it's not
known how severe the 2004-2005 season might be.
Although vaccination is the best protection against influenza,
everyone can take practical steps to help prevent spread of flu, such
as avoiding close contact with people who are sick and keeping your
distance from others if you're sick; when possible, staying home from
work, school, and errands when you are sick; covering your mouth and
nose when coughing or sneezing, and cleaning your hands often.

[In a press conference that coincided with the above press release
(transcript available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t041012.htm>), Dr. Julie
Gerberding, Director of CDC, discussed the current restricted
vaccination recommendations. High-risk children, the elderly (over 65
years of age, with a focus on institutionalized elderly), and the
military would be included in the 1st wave of vaccinations to be
offered. According to Dr. Gerberding, the estimates are that
"somewhere between 42- and 50 million people we think would meet our
high-risk, or high-priority criteria, and request vaccination." There
are currently 22.4 million doses of flu vaccine produced by Aventis
Pasteur USA that have not been shipped. The allocation of these
doses is currently under review and will be decided in the coming
days.
In addition to the doses of flu vaccine, there is a federal stockpile
of Tamiflu (oseltamivir), an antiviral agent used for both prevention
and treatment of influenza, and there are plans to add up to 5
million treatment courses of Rimantadine to the stockpile as well.
What is unclear is the actual estimated number of persons who meet
the high-risk criteria defined in the CDC recommendations, and how
that compares to the estimated 42-50 million people who are expected
to be vaccinated this year. As a reminder, last year's flu vaccine
(2003/2004) did not contain A/H3N2/Fujian, which was a predominant
strain in the United States (82 percent of isolates; see 2003/2004
influenza surveillance summary:
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2003-2004/03-04summary.htm>).
Approximately 83 million doses of vaccine were administered. Studies
showed reduced efficacy: estimated efficacy against influenza-like
illness in those vaccinated before 1 Nov was 13 percent and after 1
Nov was 3 percent. (See MMWR report on 2003/2004 trivalent
inactivated vaccine (TIV) in Colorado:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5301a3.htm>)
It should be noted that in a study of patients aged greater than 65
years, TIV was effective in preventing 61 percent of
influenza-related deaths when the vaccine and circulating strains
were well-matched and 35 percent when they were not well-matched
(Nordin J, Mullooly J, Poblete S, et al. Influenza vaccine
effectiveness in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in persons 65
years and older in Minnesota, New York, and Oregon: data from 3
health plans. J Infect Dis 2001;184:665--70).
The Pneumonia & Influenza death curves (P & I) contained in last
year's report indicate that the epidemic peaks of P&I deaths were
markedly increased from the 3 prior seasons (albeit less than for the
1999/2000 peak). This can be taken as additional circumstantial
evidence that last year was more severe, probably contributed to by a
less-than-efficacious vaccine.
The implications of this current vaccine shortage/crisis are
potentially highly significant in terms of expected P&I deaths this
coming year in the United States. However, if one takes last year as
exemplary of the effects of a vaccine of sub-optimal effectiveness,
it is possible that the coming season may in fact resemble last year.
Complete projected figures regarding the effects of the vaccine
shortage on the UK and other countries that were dependent upon this
manufacturer are not presently available for review/discussion. One
BBC press report discussed the theoretical impact on the UK,
including the statement, "The Department of Health said of the 14
million doses of flu vaccine they had ordered, Chiron had only been
due to supply 2.4 million."
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3719694.stm>
No information on alterations in vaccine recommendations to meet
reduced availability were available at the Health Protection Agency
website, although the BBC report did advise health professionals to
concentrate on the "most at risk" population. - Mod.MPP]
