Cyprus foot and mouth update
---------------------------
The foot and mouth disease [FMD] virus does exist
in Cyprus but is inactive and was probably
brought over to the island from overseas or
transported from the occupied north of the island.

This was the conclusion drawn up by a panel of EU
experts who yesterday met in Brussels to discuss
the situation with Cyprus Veterinary Service officials.

The fact that the virus is inactive originally
raised the suspicion that it may have been
brought over to the island in the form of
vaccines, however the EU panel have all but ruled
out the vaccine theory, with suspicions now being
that it came from animals imported from abroad. A
final verdict is expected within 2 weeks.

Precautionary measures will remain in place until
the end of the month [November 2007] in the
Larnaca districts of Koshi and Aradipou.
[According to an earlier report of the Famagusta
gazette, a positive sheep was allegedly detected
in Koshi; this, in addition to the serologically
positive sheep in Dromolaxia. This finding has
not been officially notified. ­ Mod.AS]

Speaking to the press earlier today [20 Nov
2007], Chief Veterinary officer Charalambos
Kakoyiannis confirmed that the infection is not
contagious and that no further measures have been
taken. He added that checks will continue
throughout the island and that any animals
testing positive for the virus would be culled.

[We are looking forward with great interest to
the "final verdict" of EU's experts panel. Turkey
is a member of EUFMD, FAO's European Commission
for FMD. EUFMD may be instrumental in enhancing
the performance of epidemiological investigations
also in the northern part of the island, a part
which is under Turkey's control. Such
investigations, to include sampling and
laboratory tests, should, hopefully, enable
better understanding of the unusual "outbreak."
Specifically, to clarify the conclusion (if the
above newswire is accurate) by the expert panel
that the positive serological tests in ovines
(bovines and porcines remaining negative) are not
related to vaccinations but indicate that the FMD
virus "does exist in Cyprus but is inactive,
probably brought over to the island from overseas
or transported from the occupied north of the island." - Mod.AS]
