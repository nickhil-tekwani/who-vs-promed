[3] Mexico: cases and deaths
Date: Wed 9 Nov 2022

https://www.la-prensa.com.mx/mexico/sociedad/viruela-del-mono-en-mexico-ya-registra-sus-primeras-cuatro-muertes-9166615.html


The Government of Mexico reported this Wednesday [9 Nov 2022] that until last Monday [7 Nov 2022] it had registered 3007 cases of monkeypox, with an increase of 106 in the last week, and the 1st 4 deaths "directly related" to the virus. In addition, he indicated that cases are registered in the 32 states of the country.

In the weekly technical report on epidemiological surveillance, the Secretariat of Health detailed that in the referred period a total of 4996 people were identified who meet the operational definition of a probable case. Of this total, 3007 are confirmed, 358 are under study, and 1631 are ruled out by laboratory tests.

Meanwhile, the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) reported that the positive cases are already distributed in the 32 states, with Mexico City in the lead with 1765 infections.

Jalisco state has 351 cases; State of Mexico 312; Yucatan 108; Quintana Roo 86; Tabasco 43; Puebla 38; Nuevo Leon 32; Chiapas 29; Baja California 25; Veracruz 24; Queretaro 20; Morelos 19; Guanajuato 17; Sinaloa 16; Hidalgo 14; Chihuahua 13; Coahuila 12; Tamaulipas 11; Guerrero 9; Oaxaca 8; Aguascalientes 8; Campeche 6; Michoacan, 7; Tlaxcala 6; Sonora 5; Colima 4; Zacatecas 3; San Luis Potosi 3; and Baja California Sur and Durango 1 each.

Of the total confirmed cases, 97.5% correspond to men and 2.5% to women.

The Secretariat of Health specified that, so far, 7 deaths have been identified: 6 men and one woman, although direct causality has not been determined in all of them. "4 deaths are directly related to monkeypox virus infection, 2 deaths are not due to this direct cause [monkeypox], and one is being analyzed by a group of experts in infectology and epidemiology to define whether there is a causal association link between death and infection by monkeypox virus," he stated.

[Interestingly, the 3007 monkeypox (MPX) cases and 7 fatalities (4 confirmed) in the report above are higher than the 2901 cases with no fatal cases in the worldwide case totals in item [1] above.

The report does point out that 4 deaths are directly related to MPX infection, but with no information about how the causality was established; one is under investigation and 2 discarded as not MPX-related. - Mod.TY]

[4] Cases increase slightly: WHO

The number of monkeypox cases reported to the WHO rose slightly last week [week of 1 Nov 2022], with 19 countries reporting rises in cases, the head of the WHO said today [9 Nov 2022] at a briefing on a host of health issues.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said despite the small rise in cases, the number of weekly cases is down 80% from the peak reported in August 2022. WHO tracking shows cases rose 2.5% for the week ending 6 Nov 2022. Most of the cases reported last week were from the Americas and European regions. Of the 19 countries reporting rises, Mexico reported the highest increase.

In another new development, he said the WHO this week signed an agreement with Siga Technologies, the company that developed the antiviral tecovirimat (Tpoxx) for a donation of 2500 treatment courses. Tedros said WHO will invite low- and middle-income countries to express interest in receiving the donated doses.

Though the treatment isn't approved in most countries, the WHO has posted a protocol that researchers can use to design and conduct clinical trials. Tedros said in settings where trials are not in place, The WHO recommends that tecovirimat be considered for use under a different protocol to promote data collection on the treatment's effectiveness.

Conclusions
-----------
The gradual decline in immunity to smallpox may partly explain an increase in the incidence of monkeypox in some regions where the disease is endemic. However, the current epidemic reminds us that viral emergence is a permanent phenomenon without boundaries and is often unpredictable in its nature, target, and magnitude. This outbreak illustrates how a disease affecting one region of the world can have a strong effect on areas where it is not endemic, with different target populations and new clinical presentations. To thwart the continuation of the current monkeypox epidemic, both in the African areas where it is endemic and in newly affected regions, the priorities are clear: 1st, increase awareness and education of populations, especially at-risk groups, to prevent infection and reduce transmission and spread; 2nd, develop rapid, sensitive point-of-care detection tests to improve diagnosis and, consequently, prevention; and 3rd, evaluate the effectiveness of existing treatments, vaccines, and vaccination strategies and improve efforts to make vaccination and treatment available to all affected groups and regions.
