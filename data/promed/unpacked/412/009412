West Nile virus activity -- United States: Wed 23 to Tue 29 Jun 2004
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Human cases
-----------
As of Tue 29 Jun 2004, 8 states had reported a total of 57 human cases of
West Nile virus (WNV) illness to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) through ArboNET in 2004. A total of 38 cases had been
reported from Arizona, 10 from California, 3 from New Mexico, 2 from
Florida, and one each from Michigan, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming.
36 (64 per cent) of the cases occurred in males; the median age of patients
was 53 years (range: 9 to 84 years), and dates of illness onset ranged from
23 Apr to 15 Jun 2004. Of the 57 cases, one fatal case was reported from
Arizona. [Details of this case are provided in the following post. - Mod.CP]
Blood donors
------------
A total of 13 presumptive West Nile viremic blood donors (PVDs) have been
reported to ArboNET. Of these, 12 were reported from Arizona, and one was
reported from New Mexico. Of the 13 PVDs reported to ArboNET, one person
aged 69 years subsequently had neuroinvasive illness, and 3 people aged 22,
51, and 52 years subsequently had West Nile fever. In New Mexico, the first
detected WNV activity in 2004 was in a PVD; in Arizona, 3 of the first 7
reported human WNV infections in 2004 were in PVDs.
Birds and equines
-----------------
In addition, during 2004, a total of 760 dead corvids and 85 other dead
birds with WNV infection have been reported from 23 states, and 42 WNV
infections in horses have been reported from 11 states (Alabama, Arizona,
California, Idaho, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia).
Sentinel chickens and mosquitoes
--------------------------------
WNV seroconversions have been reported in 89 sentinel chicken flocks from 4
states (Arizona, California, Florida, and Louisiana). 3 seropositive
sentinel horses were reported from Puerto Rico. A total of 180 WNV positive
mosquito pools have been reported from 11 states (Arizona, California,
Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Texas, and Virginia).
Additional information about national WNV activity is available from CDC at

Arizona: Maricopa County records first West Nile death in the USA in 2004
------------------------------------------------------
Ten months after health officials first detected its presence in the
Valley, West Nile virus apparently has taken its first life in Maricopa
County. The virus was first detected in the county in August 2003. So far,
at least 14 Arizonans have been diagnosed with the virus infection, which
is spread by mosquitoes that feed on infected migratory birds.
The Arizona Department of Health Services said earlier this month that at
least 9 victims reside in a 20 square mile area bounded by Bell Road and
Glendale Avenue, and 7th and 59th avenues. Most of those infected develop
flu-like symptoms, but at least about 20 per cent develop encephalitis,
meningitis or paralysis that may be lasting, officials said.
