Salmonella cases reach 260 in state
--------------------------------------
The number of salmonella cases in Pennsylvania linked to a regional
outbreak keeps going up.
The state Department of Health reported yesterday, Mon, 26 Jul 2004, that
260 Pennsylvanians have been sickened in the outbreak thus far -- up 50
from Fri, 24 Jul 2004. At that time, health officials in West Virginia,
Maryland and Ohio were reporting another 73 cases likely tied to the outbreak.
Further tests will determine which of the cases being reported now can be
linked definitively to the outbreak. But if the numbers currently reported
hold up -- and the trend continues for a few more days -- the salmonella
outbreak could become one of the largest in the nation during the past decade.
"The cases will continue to come in for a while longer," said Richard
McGarvey, spokesman for the state Health Department.
Between 1993 and 2002, the largest salmonella outbreak in the USA caused
almost 1000 reported cases, while the 10th largest outbreak generated 393
reports, according to records kept by the CDC.
In the current outbreak, people got sick after eating food from Sheetz
convenience stores during the first 10 days or so of July 2004. Health
officials believe most, if not all, of those affected have recovered by now.
Investigators are focusing on tomato contamination as the cause. Although
it's not clear how it occurred, sliced Roma tomatoes were contaminated
before arriving at Sheetz stores, officials believe.
The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture is continuing to collect samples
from various sources.
Agriculture officials completed tests last week of 235 food samples
collected from Sheetz stores and some food warehouses, but found no
evidence of the salmonella strain that has sickened people in the outbreak.
Yesterday, Mon, 26 Jul 2004, the department completed tests on another 15
samples, but found no evidence of salmonella. 2 of the samples came from a
consumer, while another 13 came from outlets that received tomatoes from
Coronet Foods of Wheeling, WV.
