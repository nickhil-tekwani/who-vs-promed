A South Canterbury dairy farm is in lockdown, after a cattle disease made its way to New Zealand's shores. A total of 14 cows have tested positive for _Mycoplasma bovis_, and are the first to have the disease in New Zealand, while a further 150 cows on the property have signs of infection.

Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) director of response, Geoff Gwyn, says they don't know how or when the disease entered the country, after confirming it on [Sat 22 Jul 2017]. Mr. Gwyn said the disease poses no risk to humans or food safety and there is no concern about consuming milk products.

MPI is working with the farmer to contain the disease to the affected farm and treat the animals showing symptoms. Mr. Gwyn says legal restrictions are in place to stop any movement of stock from the property.

[Quite apart from anything else there will be some urgency in investigating how this pathogen found its way to New Zealand. This outbreak impacts national biosecurity for the Kiwis.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ is a pathogen causing respiratory disease, otitis media [inflammation of the middle ear], arthritis, mastitis [infection of the mammary gland and udder tissue], and a variety of other diseases in cattle worldwide. It is increasingly recognized by the veterinary and livestock communities as having an important impact on the health, welfare, and productivity of dairy and beef cattle. _M. bovis_ diseases can be difficult to diagnose and control because of inconsistent disease expression and response to treatments and vaccines, and large gaps in the current understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, which tend to become chronic and do not respond well to antibiotic treatments. Also it sometimes works in conjunction with other pathogen organisms.
