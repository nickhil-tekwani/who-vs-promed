Austrian authorities are investigating an increase in cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Coeln. In August and September [2018], cases caused by the pathogen _Salmonella_ Coeln cluster type (CT) 1768 occurred in several Austrian provinces. The Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) said the accumulation of infections indicates a possible transmission through food but there is currently no indication as to the source of the outbreak.

This year [2018], 72 cases of _Salmonella_ Coeln, all strains including CT1768, were confirmed at AGES' National Reference Center for Salmonella until the end of November 2018. This compares to 52 in the whole of 2017; 32 in 2016; and 21 in 2015. AGES is investigating the suspected foodborne outbreak with the Federal Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, Health and Consumer Protection (BMASGK) and state authorities.

In 2017, 4728 samples were tested for salmonella as part of the control and sample plan, as well as in targeted campaigns, according to the 2017 zoonoses and zoonotic agents in Austria report. _Salmonella_ Coeln was found twice in raw turkey meat samples examined.

In 2017, 1672 lab-confirmed salmonellosis cases were reported to the Epidemiological Reporting System (EMS) in Austria. Salmonellosis cases increased in 2017 and this could mainly be attributed to an increase in cases of serovar _Salmonella_ Enteritidis. This means salmonella was the 2nd commonest cause of bacterial foodborne illness, behind campylobacter. A total of 7201 lab-confirmed campylobacteriosis cases were notified to the EMS in 2017.

In Europe, _Salmonella_ Coeln has increased 33.5% in two years and entered the top 20 list of most commonly reported _Salmonella_ serovars in 2017. A total of 265 cases were reported by 22 member states in 2017 compared to 139 cases in 2016 and 200 in 2015. A nationwide outbreak of _Salmonella_ Coeln in Norway, including 26 cases identified between October 2013 and January 2014 was linked to imported, mixed, pre-washed and bagged salad.
