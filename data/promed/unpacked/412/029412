I was given the impression by a Veterinary Professor that with the current
3 year booster protocol for Canine Rabies Vaccination, that 6 percent will
lose rabies protection in the third year after the vaccination. That 6
percent loss is acceptable based on epidemiologic considerations to prevent
a rabies outbreak in a vaccinated population. So a 3 year booster is
acceptable from a population viewpoint, but then when it is you or your
pet, perhaps more frequent vaccination would be preferred? Is this 6
percent figure for rabies accurate?
There is no guarantee any vaccine will provide protection from a disease
because of many factors. Unfortunately the general public believes
vaccination is 100 percent. And from what I have seen, many think that one
vaccine while a puppy or kitten gives them protection immediately after the
vaccine is administered and fail to get the follow up boosters that are
recommended. But, what I hear is that we veterinarians have better
compliance than physicians.
Does more public information need to be promulgated about vaccines? Or do
we let things slide as they now exist, because the vaccinated base is
adequate to prevent an epidemic? This goes beyond rabies epidemiology.

[I am unaware of any statistics involving 6 percent. Although there is a 3
year rabies vaccine available, some states maintain boosters must be given
every year and it is a legal requirement. Without question, education of
the public is needed. There are many misconceptions regarding rabies
vaccine and post exposure vaccine for human beings. A public awareness/
information campaign would be appropriate, whether on a local or state
basis. - Mod.TG
