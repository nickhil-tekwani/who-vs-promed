Glasgow Crimean-Congo viral haemorrhagic fever case flown to London
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A man critically ill with Crimean-Congo viral haemorrhagic fever (CCVHF) has been flown from Glasgow to London in a special RAF [Royal Air Force] isolation plane. The 38-year-old, who had been in Kabul, Afghanistan, was diagnosed hours after returning to Glasgow on Emirates flight EK027 from Dubai on Tuesday [2 Oct 2012]. He was transferred from the city's specialist Brownlee unit [Gartnavel Hospital] to the Royal Free Hospital in London on Friday morning [5 Oct 2012].

Passengers who sat near the man have been contacted and have no symptoms. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) said medical staff would continue to follow up with passengers on the flight from Dubai. The health authority said the risk to all other passengers was "extremely low" and advised anyone with concerns to contact NHS 24 [Emergency Telephone Service].

This is the 1st case of CCVHF in the UK. NHS GGC said the patient's transfer was "in line with the UK-wide protocol for the management of diseases of this severity and rarity." The man was stabilised overnight before being moved in specialist isolation facilities by air with the support of the Scottish Ambulance Service and the RAF. Public health consultant, Dr Syed Ahmed, who is coordinating the investigations into this case, said: "The risk of person-to-person transmission of Crimean Congo Viral Haemorrhagic Fever is extremely low as it can only be transmitted by direct contact with infected blood or body fluids. It is not a virus which is transmitted through the air. As such the risk to those who were in close contact with him is minimal. We have already made contact with all the patient's close contacts and they are being followed-up appropriately. The decision to transfer the patient to the high security unit at the Royal Free was taken in line with the national protocol for the management of cases such as this."

The NHS 24 helpline number for anyone on flight number EK027 to call if they have concerns is 08000 85 85 31. The helpline will be available between 08:00 and 22:00, 7 days a week.

CCVHF is a zoonosis -- a disease found in animals that can infect humans. Outbreaks are usually linked to contact with blood or body fluids from infected animals or people. Onset is sudden, with initial symptoms including high fever, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face and red spots in the throat are also common. As the illness progresses, patients can develop large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding.

[ProMED-mail also thanks ProMED-mail Rapporteur A-Lan Banks for this communication. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever caused by a Nairovirus (Family _Bunyaviridae_). Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans do occur. The disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia. The geographical distribution of the virus, like that of its tick vector, is widespread. Evidence of CCHF virus has been found in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Healthcare workers in endemic areas should be aware of the illness and the correct infection control procedures to protect themselves and their patients from the risk of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection.

CCHF virus may infect a wide range of domestic and wild animals. Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches are susceptible and may show a high prevalence of infection in endemic areas. Animals become infected with CCHF from the bite of infected ticks. A number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, but the most efficient and common vectors for CCHF appear to be members of the genus _Hyalomma_. Trans-ovarial (transmission of the virus from infected female ticks to offspring via eggs) and venereal transmission have been demonstrated amongst some vector species, indicating one mechanism which may contribute to maintaining the circulation of the virus in nature. However, the most important source for acquisition of the virus by ticks is believed to be infected small vertebrates on which immature _Hyalomma_ ticks feed. Once infected, the tick remains infected through its developmental stages, and the mature tick may transmit the infection to large vertebrates, such as livestock. Domestic ruminant animals, such as cattle, sheep and goats, are viraemic (virus circulating in the bloodstream) for around one week after becoming infected. Humans who become infected with CCHF acquire the virus from direct contact with blood or other infected tissues from livestock during this time, or they may become infected from a tick bite. The majority of cases have occurred in those involved with the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.

This is the 1st case of CCHF diagnosed in Scotland and only the 2nd case to be recognised in northern Europe. The local medical staff have responded with commendable efficiency. The patient arrived in Glasgow on a flight from Dubai, which is now a major transit terminal for passengers travelling to destinations in Europe and wishing to avoid the congestion and delays at the major hubs in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, and Paris. Such events may become more frequent in the future. The risk of transmission of CCHF virus to airline passengers is very low, since the virus is not transmitted by airborne infection. - Mod.CP
