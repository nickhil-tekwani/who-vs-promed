The 4th case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been
diagnosed in the Stavropol Krai this year [2010]. The cases were from
the Ipatovskiy, Trtunovskiy and Shpakovskiy regions. All contracted
the infection during contacts with farm animals. 1341 people have
sought medical attention after tick bites in the Stavropol Krai this
epidemic season, and 59 of them were hospitalized.

[There have been 4 CCHF cases in the Stavropol Krai and 2 in the
Rostov oblast during this epidemic season. The number of CCHF cases
in Stavropol was 66 last year (2009) and 80 in 2008. The incidence of
CCHF decreased in the South Federal Okrug of Russia in 2009; 116
cases were registered in 2009, versus 212 cases in 2008. The Federal
Health Agency "Stavropol Research Institute Against Plague" announced
its analysis of the epizootic situation during the past 2 years. The
report says that the climate anomaly facilitated the increase of
numbers of ticks and caused changes in their life cycle.
Particularly, the developmental cycle of _Hyalomma marginatum_ was
delayed by 30-45 days, and the mass activation of their larvae starts
at the end of July. The area of spread of _Hyalomma marginatum_, the
vector of CCHF virus, enlarged, and now new territories in the west,
northwest and central parts of the Stavropol Krai are affected. The
only way to stabilize the situation regarding CCHF is to perform tick
dis-infestation treatment of farm animals and grazing lands. - Mod.NP]
