Situation update
----------------
- Since the last update, one suspect case (a 14-year-old girl) was admitted in the treatment facility in Yirol West with fever and conjunctival injection. She is from Arwa Village in Yirol West (not Yirol East like the suspect cases reported previously) and has no linkage with the cases reported previously. Sample was collected and shipped for testing.
- During the week, one of the contacts, an 18-year-old; 7-month pregnant female in Thonabutkok village (village of initial case) and contact to the initial case developed symptoms on [9 Jan 2018]. The symptoms included chills, joint pains, headache, neck pains and 2 episodes of epistaxis. Updates on her status and sample collection to follow.
- There have been no other alerts from the village or other neighbouring communities; surveillance has been heightened, and facilities have been urged to report any suspected cases.
- During the week, a total of 7 human samples were collected and shipped to Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) for testing: 6 samples were from close contacts (asymptomatic) and the 7th sample was obtained from the new suspect case in Yirol West (see above).
- The 7 human samples initially tested negative on [10 Jan 2018] (by PCR) for Ebola, Marburg, CCHF, RVF and Sosuga viruses.
- Follow up serological testing showed one sample had high RVF IgM and IgG and another 2 samples had high RVF IgG titres.
- A total of 7 animal (2 sheep; 2 goat; and 3 cattle) samples have also been shipped to UVRI for testing but the test results are pending.

Initial reports on the event
- On [28 Dec 2017], the Eastern Lakes Ministry of Health reported a suspect viral hemorrhagic fever cluster to the National Ministry of Health and WHO. The initial cluster involved 3 deaths in Thonabutkok village, Yali Payam, Yirol East county with [7 Dec 2017] as the earliest date of onset.
- Preliminary investigations conducted by the County Health Department, State and National MoH, CUAMM, and WHO show that the 3 deaths had a severe hemorrhagic illness and were epidemiologically linked by place (Thonabutkok village) and time (with 49 and 51 as the respective epidemiological weeks of illness onset). However, there was no history of close physical contact between the cases and travel history was not significant. In addition, the symptoms were not reported in the respective close case contacts during the clinical illness or even after death.
- There is significant history suggesting a zoonotic hemorrhagic illness as abortions in goats and sheep; deaths/disease in goats and cows; wild bird die-offs have been reported in association with this event cluster.

Brief clinical and epidemiological findings
-------------------------------------------
- The putative initial case was a 30-year-old female housewife from Thonabutkok village in Yirol East county. Her illness started on [7 Dec 2017] with fever, headache, neck pain and sudden nose, gum, and injection site bleeding. She reported to a health facility the same day where she was admitted in maternity ward since she was pregnant. After 8 days of treatment with no improvement, she moved to a private clinic for 4 days where she was treated for malaria and typhoid fever. The illness worsened on [19 Dec 2017] and requested to return home. She died at home the same day. No supervised burial was done and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.
- The 2nd case was a 13-year-old female from Thonabutkok village (approximately 150 meters from the putative initial case). Her illness started on [20 Dec 2017] with headache, joint pain, neck pain, fever, generalized swelling at the joints which were painful (ecchymosis), bleeding from the nose and gums. She died at home on [26 Dec 2017] after the she developed bleeding from the skin blisters. Goat and sheep abortions were reported in association with this case. No supervised burial was done and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.
- The 3rd case was a 15-year-old male from Thonabutkok village. His illness started on [24 Dec 2017] with headache, fever, sweating, and neck pain, nose bleeding, vomiting of blood and gum bleeding, convulsions and loss of consciousness. He died at home on [27 Dec 2017] after failing to improve on treatment in a private clinic. In the case neighborhood 8 goat deaths with extensive hemorrhage were reported (the goats were skinned, cooked and eaten). No supervised burial was done and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.
- The most recent suspect case involves a 14-year-old girl from Arwa Village in Yirol West. She presented on [9 Jan 2017] with fever and conjunctival injection. She had no epidemiological linkage to the 3 suspect cases reported previously. Sample was collected and shipped for testing.
- At least 60 contacts have been listed for follow up.

Response updates
----------------
Overall coordination of investigation and response activities
- A multi-disciplinary national rapid response team headed by the Director General Preventive Health Services from the National Ministry of Health and a Technical Officer from the Ministry of Livestock are supporting investigation and response activities in Yirol East.
- At the national level, the MoH is collaboration with the Ministry of Animal Health Resources and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are working alongside the national taskforce to conduct animal health investigations and containment measures.
- The state level outbreak taskforce is activated in Yirol East and is meeting daily with full technical support from the National Ministry of Health, Ministry of Livestock, WHO, and partners.
- During the week, the National EPR meeting was held and stakeholders are working to enhance multi-sectoral coordination, update stock levels, preposition supplies, and update the VHF response plan.
- CDC has also shared generic IEC materials on RVF for adaptation to the South Sudan context.
- There are ample supplies of personal protective equipment and sample collection kits in the country to support the current outbreak response needs.
- 2 laboratories have been identified to conduct any further laboratory testing required: Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Uganda and IPD in Senegal.
- Mentor Initiative has offered to lead the entomological investigations into this event on the basis of an official request from the taskforce, Government, or health cluster. A protocol for the entomological investigations has been drafted.
- Unicef has drafted key messages on Rift Valley fever to enhance awareness and mitigate the risk of the disease at community level.

Planned activities and way forward
----------------------------------
- Ministry of Health to convene regular multisectoral and multi-agency meetings to coordinate investigation and response activities.
- Update the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever response plan to conform to the standard RVF recommended interventions that are tailored to the South Sudan context.
- Re-orient the national and sub-national multi-sectoral outbreak response coordination towards enhancing national capacities for RVF surveillance and outbreak prevention and control.
- Enhance social mobilization and public health education on RVF prevention and control by finalizing the communication strategy and disseminating the messages.
- Conduct extended public health, animal health, and entomological investigations into the event by - Ministry of Health; Ministry of Animal Health Resources and Fisheries, WHO, FAO, Health Cluster, and partners.
- Strengthen animal and public health surveillance to ensure that new human/animal events are promptly detected.
- Disseminate regular updates by way of situation reports and/or press statements/releases as the situation evolves.

[At least some of these human cases point to Rift Valley fever (RVF) as the etiological agent. The ruminant cases (sheep, goats and cattle) are also compatible with RVF. However, until the laboratory results are available, the RVF diagnosis should be made with some caution. There is always the possibility that more than one pathogen is circulating in this locality. However, the main hemorrhagic fever agents have been excluded in the 10 Jan 2018 laboratory tests. ProMED would appreciate receiving any further information about human or animal cases and the laboratory results of tests done on the 14 samples provided.

There have been undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic disease in South Sudan several times before. In 2016, there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of several reference laboratories, the etiological agent of that South Sudan hemorrhagic fever outbreak was not determined. In that outbreak, several possible viruses were discarded by laboratory tests (see Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - South Sudan (02): addtl. information 20160625.4309572). In 1999, an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease occurred in the southern part of Sudan due to infections with the bacterium _Borrelia recurrentis_, the cause of louse-borne relapsing fever.
