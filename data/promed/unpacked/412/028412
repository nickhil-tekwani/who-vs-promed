[With the addition of these newly reported cases and the 24 reported cases yesterday (see sections [2] and [3] for more details), the total number of laboratory confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia in the past 24 hours is 36 cases including 4 deaths. In the above report, there are 4 cases who worked in the health care environment, nurses (2), doctor (1) and receptionist (1). 7 of the 13 cases are in expatriots presumably living and working in Saudi Arabia (although this is not definitively stated). Nationalities include Philippine, Egyptian, Palestinian and Indonesian.

Riyadh case number 1 mentioned above appears to have gotten the MERS-CoV infection while admitted to the hospital initially for other reasons. This case, together with the cases in healthcare workers suggests that there was (?and still is) significant nosocomial transmission of the MERS-CoV within the healthcare environment in Saudi Arabia, both in Riyadh as well as in Jeddah and Mekkah as all 3 locations seem to have involvement of healthcare workers.

For those apparent index cases (those appearing at the hospital for the 1st time when ill with symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV infection), a case control study addressing possible risk exposures would be helpful. For those with histories of comorbidities, one wonders if there might have been animal exposure, or exposure when seeking health care (non-inpatient/hospitalized healthcare) for their comorbidities.

MOH: 11 New Corona Cases Recorded in the Kingdom's Regions - 23 Apr 2014
----------------------------
Within the framework of the constant monitoring and epidemic surveillance of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 11 new confirmed cases have been recorded, in addition to 5 other cases of those in contact with confirmed cases of this virus. This has been declared after the National Scientific Committee for Infectious Diseases has reviewed and discussed the results of laboratory tests of the cases.

- The 1st case is an 81-year-old male citizen in Riyadh, who has been suffering from various chronic diseases. Now, he is at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), receiving the proper treatment.
- The 2nd case is a 41 year-old female citizen in Riyadh, who has been suffering from various chronic diseases. Her health status is stable. - The 3rd case is a 59 year-old female citizen in Riyadh, who has been suffering from various chronic diseases. Now, she is at the ICU, receiving the proper treatment.
- The 4th case is for a 34 year-old female resident, working at the health sector in Riyadh, who is in contact with a confirmed case. Now, she is at the ICU, receiving the proper treatment.

- The 5th case is a 13 year-old female citizen in Jeddah, who is in contact with a confirmed case, even though she doesn't have any symptoms.
- The 6th case is a 71 year-old male citizen in Jeddah, who has been suffering from various chronic diseases. Now, she is at the ICU, receiving the proper treatment. [gender is unclear in this online version]
- The 7th case is a 67 year-old male resident in Jeddah, who has been suffering from various chronic diseases. Now, he is at the ICU, receiving the proper treatment.
- The 8th case is a 45 year-old male citizen, working at the health sector in Jeddah. Now, he is at the ICU, receiving the proper treatment.
- The 9th case is a 55 year-old male citizen in Jeddah, who has been suffering various chronic diseases. Now, he is at the ICU, receiving the proper treatment.
- The 10th case is a 24 year-old male citizen in Makkah. His health status is stable.
- The 11th case is a 48 year-old female citizen, working at the health sector in Jeddah. Now, he is at the ICU, receiving the proper treatment. [gender is unclear in this online version]

Stemming from the MOH's keenness to provide all community members, mass media and users of social networking websites with health guidelines and medical tips on the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV), as well as briefing them on its updates, the Ministry calls upon everyone to visit the Coronavirus website on the MOH Portal: www.moh.gov.sa/coronanew, or communicate via the toll free number: 8002494444, 937 call center, or Twitter @SAUDIMOH. Finally, the Ministry of Health wishes all people health and safety.

[There is mention of 11 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, and "5 other cases" of those in contact with other confirmed cases. Geographic distribution of the cases: Riyahd (4), Jeddah (6), Mecca (1). Of these 11 cases, 8 are in intensive care therapy, 2 are in stable condition and one is an asymptomatic infection in an individual with known contact with other known MERS-CoV infected individuals. Other notable variables include there were 3 cases who worked in the health field, and 6 of the cases had a history of "various chronic diseases".

The mention of "5 other cases" who had known contact with other confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals is curious. As the tally of the number of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection was not increased accordingly to include another 5 cases, one wonders if this statement refers to an additional 5 known contacts who are symptomatic but testing results aren't back as yet. ProMED would greatly appreciate clarification from knowledgeable sources in Saudi Arabia.

[In this report there were 13 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 2 deaths in previously reported cases announced by the MOH of Saudi Arabia. Of these 13 cases, 5 were in Riyadh, 2 were in Jeddah, 4 were in Mekkah, 1 was in Medina and 1 was in a Saudi citizen hospitalized in Jordan and reported to the MOH Saudi Arabia by the WHO representative in Jordan (see section [5] below. Further confirmation of nosocomial transmission is seen in the 2nd case mentioned above - the 69 year old female citizen who was hospitalized for diabetic foot issues and after an unspecified amount of time, developed symptoms of pneumonia. It is also seen with the 5th case who was admitted for a stroke and then developed pneumonia and the 7th case who was admitted to the hospital for an anemia evaluation and 6 days after admission developed signs of pneumonia. The 10th and 13th cases above highlight the mobility of the population, where the 10th is a pilgrim from Turkey, and the 13th is a Saudi Citizen seeking health care in neighboring Jordan.

Of the 2 fatal cases reported, 1 was in an individual working in the health sector in Al-Kharj (a fatal case), and the other was in a Saudi from Jeddah with presumed "community acquired" infection.

Al Kharj governorate is located in the central portion of Saudi Arabia 77 kms to the south of Riyadh. It is located in the governorate known as Wadi ad-Dwasir. For a map of the governorate, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Riyadh_governorates.png. - Mod.MPP]

WHO advice

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients - regardless of their diagnosis - in all work practices all the time.

Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.

Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[Of the 9 cases described in the WHO report above, only one of the cases had a history of travel outside of Abu Dhabi during the incubation period. This is the 1st case described above -- a 52 year-old female reported on 21 Apr 2014 who had a history of comorbidities, and history of seeking medical care at a hospital in Jeddah 3 times while there. By date of onset of illness, she post-dated the presumed index case in the current nosocomial outbreak as his date of onset was reported as 3 Apr 2014. Of note, none of the cases mentioned in the above WHO report had a history of exposure to animals and all of the cases had contact with either the medical sector in general or specifically with known laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Clinical expression of the MERS-CoV among these 9 cases included asymptomatic infections (2), mild illness (4), stable condition (1), in intensive care (1) and not mentioned (1).

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update - 24 Apr 2014
-----------------------------------
On [22 Apr 2014], the Ministry of Health of Jordan reported an additional laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The patient is a 25 year-old man from Al Grayat City, Saudi Arabia. He became ill on [9 Apr 2014], was admitted to a hospital in Saudi Arabia on [10 Apr 2014] and discharged from the hospital on [15 Apr 2014], against medical advice. As his condition did not improve, he sought medical care at another hospital in Zarka City, Jordan on [19 Apr 2014], where he was tested positive for MERS-CoV. The patient has underlying medical conditions and has a history of travel to Abha Mecca and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from [3 to 8 Apr 2014]. He has history of contact with camels and is also reported to have consumed camel milk.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 254 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 93 deaths.

[The 1st known nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV (diagnosed retrospectively) occurred in an ICU in Zarka City, Jordan in April 2012. Given the above description of the clinical course and healthcare seeking behavior of this current case (a Saudi citizen from a bordering area in Saudi Arabia who sought additional medical care in Zarka), one can't help but wonder if the "true" index case of that 2012 outbreak in Zarka was someone who came from Saudi Arabia seeking healthcare in Zarka. If information was available, a retrospective look through hospital records in Zarka might be able to address this question. The history of contact with camels and drinking camel's milk of this case adds to the growing body of circumstantial evidence that there may be a direct association between those events and transmission of the MERS-CoV. A case control study addressing these postulated exposures and development of infection with MERS-CoV would be very helpful in further addressing this in a scientific and statistically pure manner.

Al-Jawf Region (also spelled Al-Jouf) is located in the northernmost part of Saudi Arabia and boarders with Jordan. The capital of the region is Sakakah. The region has 3 governorates - Sakakah, Qurayyat (Al Grayat) and Dumat Al-Jandal. A map of the region can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jawf_Region.

Qurayyat (also Al Qurayyat or Gurayat) is located 19 miles (30 kms) from the border with Jordan and had a population of 147 550 according to the 2010 census. The market is well known for olives and salt and is widely frequented. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qurayyat,_Saudi_Arabia).

Zarka (or Zarqa) Jordan is located in the northeast of Jordan 25 kms from Amman. (for a map of Zarka, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarqa). The distance (by road) from Qurayyat (Al Grayat) to Zarka (Zarqua) is 42 miles. - Mod.MPP]

WHO Risk Assessment - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) [24 Apr 2014]
----------------------
Summary of available information
Since April 2012, 254 laboratory‐confirmed cases of human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) have been reported to WHO, including 93 deaths.

To date [24 Apr 2014], reporting countries in the Middle East include Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE); in Europe: France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom (UK); in North Africa: Tunisia; and in Asia: Malaysia and the Philippines.

The occurrence of new cases seems to follow a seasonal pattern, with increasing incidence from March‐April onwards. The number of cases sharply increased since mid‐March 2014, essentially in KSA and UAE, where 2 important healthcare‐associated outbreaks are occurring.

As much as 75 percent of the recently reported cases appear to be secondary cases, meaning that they are considered to have acquired the infection from another infected person. The majority of these secondary cases are mainly healthcare workers who have been infected within the healthcare setting, although several patients who were in the hospital for other reasons are also considered to have been infected with MERS‐CoV in the hospital .

The majority of the infected healthcare workers presented with no or minor symptoms. Only 4 instances of transmission within households have been reported, and no large family cluster has been identified. When human‐to‐human transmission occurred, transmission was not sustained, and to date only 2 possible tertiary cases have been reported.

The number of cases who acquired the infection in the community has also increased since mid‐March [2014]. These cases have no reported contacts with other laboratory confirmed cases, and some have reported contacts with animals. Although camels are suspected to be the primary source of infection for humans, the exact routes of direct or indirect exposure remain unknown. Investigations to identify the source of infection and routes of exposure are still ongoing.

Several of the recent cases acquired the infection in KSA or UAE and then travelled to another country, including Greece (1 case), Jordan (1 case), Malaysia (1 case), and the Philippines (1 case). No further transmission has been documented so far. Of note, exported cases occurred in the past that resulted in limited further human‐to‐human transmission (France and UK). In view of the increasing number of cases - in particular secondary cases, nosocomial outbreaks and exported cases - the WHO risk assessment has been revisited to determine whether transmission pattern has changed and whether sustained community transmission is occurring.

Risk assessment
This risk assessment is based on currently available data and knowledge, and will be updated as more information is made available. The investigations are still ongoing and new findings on, for example, exposures to animal and/or environmental source, transmission chains, risk factors for infection among primary cases and healthcare workers, and serological investigations will be critical to make the risk assessment more robust.

Has the transmission pattern of MERS‐CoV changed?
The majority of the cases now reported have likely acquired infection through human‐to‐human transmission and only about a quarter are considered as primary cases, which suggests slightly more human‐to‐human transmission than previously observed.

One hypothesis is that the transmission pattern and transmissibility have not changed and that the occurrence of 2 large nosocomial outbreaks reflects inadequate infection prevention and control measures, coupled with intensive contact tracing and screening. Several elements would support this hypothesis: i) the clinical picture appears to be similar to what was observed earlier; secondary cases tend to present with a milder disease than that of primary cases; however, we note that many secondary cases have been reported as asymptomatic; ii) only 2 possible tertiary cases have been reported; iii) the recent exported cases did not transmit further; iv) screening of contacts revealed very few instances of household transmission; and v) no increase in the size or number of household or community clusters has been observed.

An alternative hypothesis is that transmissibility of the virus has increased and is resulting in more human‐to‐human transmission as the basis for the recent upswing in cases. It is possible that current levels of surveillance are missing cases of mild infection within the community. At this point, there is insufficient information on the recent cases to definitively exclude these hypotheses.

Can we expect additional cases of MERS‐CoV infection in the Middle‐East countries?
The way humans become infected from an animal and/or environmental source is still under investigation. More individuals are likely to be infected until the mode of transmission is determined and preventive measures implemented to break transmission from the source to humans. For the 3rd consecutive year, the number of cases increase in March‐April and it is very likely that more primary cases will occur, and consequently further transmission will occur.

Can we expect additional cases exported to other countries and further transmission?
It is very likely that cases will continue to be exported to other countries, through tourists, travellers, guestworkers or pilgrims, who might acquire the infection following an exposure to the animal or environmental source, or to other cases, in a hospital for instance. Whether these cases will further transmit will depend of the capacity of the receiving country to rapidly detect, diagnose and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures. Of note, further transmission from exported cases did occur in the past, but transmission was not sustained.

[The observation that 75 percent of newly reported cases have occurred via person-to-person transmission is a significant change in previous transmission patterns, but the stated lack of evidence of sustained chains of transmission may be reassuring. Those data supporting this observation have not been readily available for review. It does appear that there are now 3 probably nosocomial outbreaks ongoing - one in Jeddah Saudi Arabia, another in Riyadh Saudi Arabia and a 3rd in Abu Dhabi, UAE. It is curious that these nosocomial outbreaks have now occurred in 3 consecutive years around this time of year. The observation that a large proportion of the secondary transmission associated infections have resulted in asymptomatic and mild clinical expression of disease. There definitely has been an increased awareness of the need for contact tracing and testing, probably contributing to this observed increase in occurrence. One also wonders if current specimen collection and laboratory diagnostic procedures have improved over the course of these 3 years, in the early days of recognition of MERS, studies were done on hospital based and close personal contacts that were predominantly negative in terms of finding MERS-CoV infection, yet verbal histories on these contacts did reveal numbers of contacts reporting mild respiratory illnesses in the time frame consistent with being within the incubation period post exposure.

Given the high amount of travel within the region as well as to and from other regions, there are concerns re: more importations of MERS-CoV infected individuals into areas with limited resources for adequate testing of specimens and for adequate implementation of infection control measures to prevent further transmission locally. - Mod.MPP]

[7] Greece ex Saudi Arabia - ECDC update
Date: 23 Apr 2014
Source: ECDC
http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=989


Epidemiological update: 1st imported case of MERS-CoV in Greece - 23 Apr 2014
------------------------
On [18 Apr 2014], the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) announced a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in a 69 year old male patient. The individual is a Greek citizen, permanently residing in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who arrived in Athens on [17 Apr 2014] on a flight via Amman, Jordan. Close contact tracing is ongoing; there are no suspected or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection associated with this individual to date.

The individual 1st sought medical attention with signs of illness on [8 Apr 2014] in Jeddah and was discharged on [10 Apr 2014] with a diagnosis of probable typhoid fever. His wife was hospitalised in the same hospital in Jeddah from [31 Mar 2014 to 5 Apr 2014] with laboratory confirmed typhoid fever. He sought medical attention the same day of his arrival in Greece [17 Apr 2014] for prolonged fever and diarrhea.

The patient is currently in stable condition receiving antimicrobial therapy and oseltamivir.

As of [22 Apr 2014], 333 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported by local health authorities worldwide, including 107 deaths. Of these, only 15 have been reported outside of the Middle East including only 10 in Europe.

ECDC is working closely with KEELPNO, the World Health Organization and other international partners with regard to this public health event.

In earlier Rapid Risk Assessments, ECDC concluded that the risk of importation of MERS-CoV to the EU was expected to continue and the risk of secondary transmission in the EU remains low. ECDC is currently revisiting its Rapid Risk Assessment which will be published in the coming days.

[From the above provided background investigation, it appears as though this case is part of the ongoing nosocomial transmission occurring in Jeddah. We await further information on contact tracing.

[According to the information page on MERS-CoV on the Saudi MOH website, there have now been 299 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 87 deaths in Saudi Arabia. This total number of cases has changed 3 times today (24 Apr 2014) presumably as new information has become available. Yesterday (23 Apr 2014) there were a total of 24 confirmed MERS-CoV infection announced in Saudi Arabia, and today (24 Apr 2014) an additional 12 cases and 2 deaths were reported earlier, but this has increased by 2 more cases and 2 more deaths throughout the course of the time of preparation of this post. This moderator is fairly sure these numbers will continue to increase as more laboratory results are received by the MOH, and more information on the cases becomes available. Hence, she is requesting patience and tolerance on the part of the readers for probable/possible discrepancies that may arise as the tally of total numbers of confirmed is currently a very rapidly moving target.

The WHO risk assessment is in accord with what is being observed. The global tally reported by WHO in today's update(s) included in this post is significantly lower than other tallies as many of the newly reported cases of MERS-CoV infection from Saudi Arabia have not as yet been included in these global tallies. The tally of total MERS-CoV infected cases this moderator has is now approximately 366 including approximately 107 deaths. - Mod.MPP
