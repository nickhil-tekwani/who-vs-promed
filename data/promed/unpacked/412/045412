Lowlands anthrax outbreak over
------------------------------
One anthrax outbreak among bison in the NWT has been declared over,
and it is as yet uncertain if a 2nd outbreak even exists. The anthrax
outbreak in the Slave River Lowlands (SRL), about 80 km [50 miles]
southeast of Fort Resolution, was declared over on 10 Aug 2010. Ella
Stinson, a spokesperson for the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources, said the declaration was made following an aerial survey
of the area on 9 Aug 2010. "There were no dead bison," she said.

Stinson said the final count of bison carcasses amounted to 45. All
were burned during the course of the outbreak, which began in June
[2010]. The last 2 carcasses, which were decomposing when discovered,
were spotted on 26 Jul 2010. A dead moose was also spotted during the
survey of 9 Aug 2010. "But we don't know if it was due to anthrax or
just natural causes," said Stinson, adding samples were taken and
sent for testing. The dead moose was found about 25 km [15.5 miles]
south of the southernmost location of dead bison on the Slave River
Lowlands, Stinson said. "It was relatively far away, which makes us
think it probably wasn't (anthrax), but we did testing just to be sure."

Meanwhile, testing results have not yet been completed on samples
from 2 dead bison found in Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP). The
dead animals were discovered within a day of each other in late July
[2010] off Highway 5, about 140 km northwest of Fort Smith. Samples
were drawn and the carcasses were burned as a precaution. One other
dead bison was later found in roughly the same area, but the carcass
was estimated to be about 3-and-a-half weeks old. That carcass was
not tested, but it was also burned as a precaution.

Mike Keizer, external relations manager with the park, said recent
cool and damp weather conditions are not conducive for an anthrax
outbreak. "We're pretty confident we're not going to see an outbreak
this summer," he said.

The last anthrax outbreak in the park was in 2007. Bison contract the
disease from spores in the ground while wallowing in dust.

[The laboratory results on these final SRL and WBNP bison have yet to
be declared by the Animal Disease Research Institute at Lethbridge,
Alberta. Whether the WBNP bison and the SRL outbreak are all part of
a larger epidemic or just a coincidence of timing is unclear.

During any hot weather there will be sporadic cases of anthrax due to
site specific events; whether those usually singular initial cases
explode into an epidemic depends on other factors, usually fly
related, but it can be due to soil disturbances from bull dozing or
spring and ditch clearing and unearthing old carcasses, as in
northern Nevada some years ago. Being the NWT it is almost certainly flies.

Moose die and when there are regular carcass flights their bodies
will be found. As their grazing habits are very different from bison,
if it is anthrax, there will have to be some yet-to-be discovered
bison carcasses nearby. I doubt it. In the 1993 epidemic in the
Mackenzie Sanctuary there were some 178 dead bison and one moose.
