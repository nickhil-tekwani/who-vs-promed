Five men (aged 27 to 45 years) who live or work in London developed
legionellosis between 2 August and 14 September 1998. All have recovered.
Four were diagnosed by urinary antigen detection, and one by single high
antibody titre. No common links or possible sources of infection have been
identified. None had travelled abroad.
Two further possible cases reported by London laboratories last week are
being investigated. Between zero and four community acquired cases of
Legionnaire's disease (that is, not associated with hospitals or travel)
are reported to the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC)
each month by laboratories throughout the Thames regions. One of the five
recent cases lives in Kent and the others in west and south London. They
all work in various parts of London. One is known to have dismantled a
cooling unit at work, another used a sauna in the same postal district as
the home of one of the cases (who did not visit the sauna), and two are
known to have visited the same public house.
Clinicians, microbiologists, and consultants in communicable disease
control are requested to ask recent cases of legionellosis whether they
were in London between two and ten days before becoming ill and if so to
inform the Respiratory Diseases Section at CDSC (tel 0181 200 6868 ext 4497).
