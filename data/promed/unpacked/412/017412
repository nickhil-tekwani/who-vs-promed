The number of legionnaires' disease infections at the Illinois Veteran's Home - Quincy remains at 54, including 12 deaths. The outbreak has prompted Illinois US Senator Dick Durbin to call on the federal government to look into the situation.

According to a WGEM [News] report [Mon 21 Sep 2015], Durbin wants the consultation of the US Departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, "The extent of this outbreak and the resulting deaths raises important questions about the capacity of the facility to provide the standard of care veterans deserve."
