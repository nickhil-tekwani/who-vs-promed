The Lithuania NPPO recently informed the EPPO Secretariat about the

was found on 10 potato cultivars grown in Lithuania (cvs. Bimonda, Vindsor,
Karolin, Sante, Nida, Larisa, Gloria, Mirta, Rossela, Helena). 17 foci were
[found]. All infected potatoes were used for animal feed, industrial
processing or consumption.
The status of _C. michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ in Lithuania can be
described as:
Present: only in some areas.
Plum pox potyvirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was found on plums (_Prunus

orchards and from 4 private gardens have been destroyed. [Destruction of
infected trees in the remaining private gardens will commence] shortly.
