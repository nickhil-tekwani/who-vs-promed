Moderator ML wrote that "preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in
health care facilities involves ... particular emphasis on hand
hygiene ...". It would be very interesting to learn what that means in
detail, as almost none of the usual hand disinfectants is effective
against _C. difficile_ spores.

[Dr Caspari raises a good point. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic
patients with _Clostridium difficile_ infection shed vegetative forms
and spores of _C. difficile_ onto their skin and into the environment.
_C. difficile_ spores have an exosporium that enhances their adherence
to surfaces. Spores can be found on hospital items such as curtains,
lab coats, scrubs, plants and cut flowers, computer keyboards,
bedpans, furniture, toilet seats, floors, linens, telephones, call
buttons, scales, blood pressure cuffs, electronic thermometers and
stethoscopes, where they may persist for months. Fecal soiling of the
environment is greater for patients with diarrhea, and spore forms
predominate in the environment because vegetative forms do not
tolerate exposure to air. Spores that adhere to the hands of
healthcare workers (HCW) during contact with the patient's skin and
the surrounding environment can then potentially be transferred to
other patients.

The detergent and mechanical action of hand washing in a sink with
plain soap and water, rinsing, and drying with a paper towel have
proved to be effective in removing both vegetative forms and _C.
difficile_ spores from the surface of contaminated HCW hands (Gerding
DN, et al: Measures to Control and Prevent _Clostridium difficile_
Infection. Clin Infect Dis 2008; 46(Suppl 1): S43-9; available at
http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/Supplement_1/S43.long).
Plain soaps have minimal, if any, antimicrobial activity. Although
active against vegetative forms of _Clostridium_ and other bacteria,
none of the antimicrobial agents (including alcohols, chlorhexidine,
hexachlorophene, iodophors, and triclosan) used in antiseptic handwash
or antiseptic hand-rub preparations are reliably cidal against
clostridial spores.

Studies involving HCW caring for patients with _C. difficile_
infection have revealed that wearing gloves prevent hand contamination
of HCW having direct contact with patients. Preventing heavy
contamination of the hands is important, because handwashing may not
remove all potential pathogens when hands are heavily contaminated.
Studies have provided evidence that wearing gloves can help reduce
transmission of pathogens in health-care settings. For example, in a
prospective controlled trial that required personnel to routinely wear
vinyl gloves when handling any body substances, the incidence of _C.
difficile_ diarrhea among patients decreased from 7.7 cases/1000
patient discharges before the intervention to 1.5 cases/1000
discharges (Johnson S, Gerding DN, Olson MM, et al: Prospective,
controlled study of vinyl glove use to interrupt _Clostridium
difficile_ nosocomial transmission. Am J Med 1990; 88(2): 137-40;
abstract available at
http://www.amjmed.com/article/0002-9343(90)90462-M/abstract). After
gloves are removed, hands should be washed with soap and water when
caring for patients with _C. difficile_ infection because
microorganisms can contaminate hands via small defects in the gloves
or during glove removal. - Mod.ML]
