Situations Agency of Kazakhstan. The man was admitted to hospital on 28 Jun
2004, diagnosed on 30 Jun, and died on the morning of 1 Jul 2004. Outbreak
control measures have been implemented in the focus of infection. According

is also suspected of having contracted Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and
this has now been confirmed by the Emergency Situations Agency. The girl

So far 3 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever have been recorded in the
southern part of Kazakhstan in 2004. The 3rd person was a 17 year old
resident of Aamansay village. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is caused by
