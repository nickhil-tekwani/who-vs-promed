Abstract
--------
This article reports on the identification of a group 2 coronavirus
(BatCoV DR/2007) in a _Desmodus rotundus_ vampire bat in Brazil.
Phylogenetic analysis of ORF1b revealed that BatCoV DR/2007
originates from a unique lineage in the archetypical group 2
coronaviruses, as described for bat species elsewhere with putative
importance in Public Health.

Text
----
Coronaviruses (_Coronavirus_: _Coronaviridae_) have long been
associated with a diverse set of diseases in a wide range of mammal
an avian hosts, including humans, in which a new species in the genus
named HCoV-SARS has been implicated in the etiology of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (1).

Virions are enveloped and highly pleomorphic, with 50 to 200 nm in
diameter, and a positive-sense ssRNA as genome, in which the 5'
two-thirds (ORFs 1a and 1b) code for the replicase complex, highly
conserved among members in each of the 3 groups the genus is divided,
while the 3' final third codes for the structural proteins (2).

In bats, the 1st description of a coronavirus occurred in 2005 (3),
when a group 1 coronavirus was found in _Miniopterus_ spp.
insectivorous bats in Hong Kong. Since then, groups 1 and 2
coronaviruses have been identified in a large number of insectivorous
bat species in China, leading to the striking conclusion that the
original host of the SARS coronavirus was a bat (4,5).

Recently, the 1st bat coronavirus in the American Continent, named
Rocky Mountain Bat Coronavirus, was detected in _Eptesicus fuscus_
and _Myotis occultus_ insectivorous bats in the USA (6), but hitherto
no coronavirus has been reported in non-insectivorous bats.

This article reports a survey for coronaviruses in insectivorous and
vampire bats from Brazil and the identification of a group 2
coronavirus in a vampire bat.

Specimens of the vampire bat _D. rotundus_ (n=3), and 4
non-identified insectivorous bats were captured in Sao Paulo state,
Southeastern Brazil, in 2005, as part of a continuous rabies
surveillance program, when all of them where found rabies negative by
routine rabies tests at Pasteur Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

The complete enteric content of each of these bats was collected in a
sterile microcentrifuge tube and prepared as 20 percent (v/v)
suspensions in DEPC-treated water and clarified by centrifugation (12
000g/30 min/4 deg C).

Total RNA from the supernatant was extracted with TRIzol
(InvitrogenTM) and tested by a genus-specific RT-PCR targeted to
amplify a 251-bp fragment of the ORF1b (8) and also to a group 2
coronavirus-specific nested-RT-PCR with a 136-bp amplicon internal to
the 1st fragment with primers sense 5'TACTATGACTGGCAGAATGTTTCA3' and
anti-sense 5'AACATCTTTAATAAGGCGRCGTAA 3' and M-MLV Reverse
TranscriptaseTM and Taq DNA PolymeraseTM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) as recommended by the manufacturer.

All 7 samples resulted negative for the genus-specific RT-PCR; while
the sample from the _D. rotundus_ included in the study was the only
that resulted in the 136-bp amplicon for the group 2 nested RT-PCR.
This strain was named BatCoV DR/2007.

Next, the amplicon was purified from the agarose gel using IllustraTM
DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Health Care, Buckinghamshire,
UK) and submitted to bi-directional DNA sequencing with BigDye 3.1
(Applied BiosystemsTM) and the sequences where resolved in an ABI-377
Automatic DNA Sequencer (Applied BiosystemsTM). The sequence obtained
was assigned GenBank Accession Number EU236685.

A Maximum Parsimony phylogenetic tree was built with the sequence
from BatCoV DR/2007 and homologous sequences retrieved form the
GenBank, corresponding to species in each of the 3 coronavirus groups
and _Breda virus_ as an outgroup using MEGA 3 (8).

Strain BatCoV DR/2007 segregated in the cluster corresponding to the
group 2 coronaviruses, depicting a unique lineage paraphyletic to the
other subclusters in the group.

Mean nucleotide identities among BatCoV DR/2007 and other
coronaviruses where 93.6 percent with archetypical group 2
coronaviruses (bovine coronavirus, human coronavirus OC-43, mouse
hepatitis virus and rat sialodacryoadenitis virus), 82.3 percent with
group 2 bat coronaviruses (BatHKUs), 72.5 percent with group 3, 69.9
percent with group 1 and 66.6 percent with SARS coronavirus. All
sequences included in the phylogenetic tree segregated in the
expected groups of coronaviruses with the correct molecular tree
topology described for the genus (9) and high bootstrap values, what
validates both the molecular marker and the sequence size chosen for typing.

Bat species thus far identified as reservoirs for coronaviruses were
all found asymptomatic (6,10), still have not only been proposed as
the original hosts for the SARS coronavirus (11) but also pointed as
the hosts for an ancestral coronavirus that originated all
coronavirus lineages currently known (10).

It is noteworthy that antibodies against coronaviruses such as
SARS-like coronavirus were found widespread in bat populations in
China, but a much lower frequency of coronavirus RNA was found in
these same populations (12), pointing out that bats might be infected
by coronaviruses but shed these at low titers (6), what could be then
basis of the low frequency of coronavirus RNA recovery in the present research.

_Desmodus rotundus_ poses a serious treat both for animal and human
health in Latin America as this species is a major reservoir for
rabies virus in this region (13), what has restricted investigations
on the importance of these bats as potential carriers of other viral pathogens.

Initially, the finding of a coronavirus in the enteric content of a
_D. rotundus_ allow one to hypothesize that these bats may harbor a
coronavirus species of yet unknown importance in public health.

As only the group 2-specific nested RT-PCR resulted positive for the
_D. rotundus_ sample, while the genus-specific, non-nested RT-PCR did
not, one can infer that strain BatCoV DR/2007 was present at a low
titer in the sample, supporting the theory of a highly stable
host/parasite relationship among coronaviruses and bats (10).

The coronavirus strain BatCoV DR/2007 described herein derives from a
unique lineage among the other classic group 2 coronaviruses, but
apart from other group 2 coronaviruses detected in bats such as the
HKUs bat coronaviruses.

Nonetheless, an intense investigative effort has still to be carried
out in order to gather more consistent sequence data for an
elucidative classification of BatCoV DR/2007. Besides, a larger
number of specimens of _D. rotundus_ has yet to be sampled with the
aim of making a conclusive connection between these and the group 2
coronavirus described herein.

As a conclusion, a coronavirus has been identified in the enteric
content of a _Desmodus rotundus_ vampire bat that can be classified,
based on a small segment of the ORF1b, in the group 2 of the genus
_Coronavirus_.

Finally, bringing these conclusions to the field of Public Health,
the coronavirus strain described herein might be considered a
putative pathogen for human diseases if a spillover event takes
place, once bats, as already mentioned, are the origin of HCoV-SARS,
making coronaviruses surveillance on bats and the increase of public
awareness on bat-transmitted diseases relevant actions.
