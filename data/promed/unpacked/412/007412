[Cases continue to occur in Saudi Arabia. The newly reported case is a healthcare worker from Riyadh with a history of contact with camels. As there have been quite a few cases reported from Riyadh since 1 Jan 2016 (8 cases including this case), it would be of interest to know whether this healthcare worker worked in any of the hospitals where other cases of MERS-CoV were admitted.

A map showing the location of the newly reported case can be found at the source URL.
