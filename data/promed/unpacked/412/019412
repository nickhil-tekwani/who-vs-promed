TULAREMIA, HARES - NORTHERN ITALY

Routine veterinary surveillance in the Voghera district (Northern Italy)
has found several tularemia-infected hares in a shipment from Hungary which
had been released into the wild. A few dead hares have been found in the
area. Family doctors have been alerted. Press coverage, although not
completely accurate, seems adequate to warn the general public of the risks
involved.
In the past, imported wildlife has introduced tularemia in some areas of
Tuscany, which became endozoonotic for several years; clusters of human
cases were traced to ingestion of water from springs contaminated by
infected animals.

[I have no problem with this but as the hares "had been released" before
they were found to be "tularemia-infected", how do we know that these were
not domestic Italian dead hares? Were the imported Hungarian hares tatooed
or ear-notched or ear-tagged? Was this area previously hare-free? What was
the basis for this epidemiological decision? - Mod.MHJ]
