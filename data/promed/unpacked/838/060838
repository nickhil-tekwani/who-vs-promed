A disease that's already killed a million bats in eastern North
America has been found in a colony hibernating near Mattawa
[Ontario].

White nose syndrome, [WNS] which isn't considered dangerous to
humans, was found on 5 sample bats taken from the Purdy Mine Site in
Mattawan Township, says the North Bay District Office of Ministry of
Natural Resources (MNR).

"We'd like people to stay away from any caves or mines that may
harbour bats," said Dave Fluri, MNR management biologist, to ensure
the disease isn't transmitted on the clothing or boots people wear
while exploring.

Fluri said officials don't know how bad the problem is and they're
not sure how the syndrome spreads, although it's likely carried by
migrating species.

"It's likely bats that are transmitting it," he said, noting there's
no way to control such movement, although the potential for
human-generated spread can be contained if people are careful. Bats
with WNS were also identified in Kirkland Lake [north eastern Ontario]
with several thousand bats lost to the disease.

The syndrome is noticed when a white fungus grows on the snout near
the bat's nose and it bothers the animal enough to wake it from
[hiberation]. Bats with WNS can be seen flying during the day,
depleting their winter stores of energy at a time insects and other
foods are not available.

Fluri said the mortality rate within a colony of bats can be as high
as 90 percent once the fungus spreads. The exact impact of losing so
many bats is not known, Fluri said, but any time one element of an
ecosystem is gone there are always ramifications. Bats eat thousands
of insects each night during the spring and summer months.

While the MNR is not encouraging anyone to seek out hibernation sites
or handle live, dead or sick bats, Dave Fluri said the Canadian
Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre and Natural Resources Information
Centre is collecting data on locations where bats hibernate and
reports of the disease.

Call 1-866-673-4781 for the CCWHC [Canadian Cooperative Wildlife
Health Centre], 1-800-667-1940 or your local MNR office if you see
bats flying during the daytime in winter or find dead bats.

[White nose syndrome has taken a toll on many bat populations,
especially the little brown bat. This article does not tell us what
type of bat was affected.

Different areas tend to have different bats and there are several
species that have been affected. If someone knows which bats are
affected, it would be nice to know. - Mod.TG]
