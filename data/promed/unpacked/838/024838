Taiwan: Dengue Fever Outbreak Affects Kaohsiung and Kaohsiung
County
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Greater Kaohsiung Area in southern Taiwan is suffering from its
most serious dengue fever threat in 14 years, with 383 people having
been infected by the mosquito-borne disease so far this year [2002] as
of yesterday.
Of the 383 reported cases, 10 involve the more fatal dengue
hemorrhagic fever, the Department of Health (DOH) reported
yesterday. All of the cases have been confirmed as having originated in
Taiwan, according to the DOH's Center for Disease Control.
A total of 384 cases of the disease have been reported island-wide, with
262 cases in the port city of Kaohsiung and 121 cases in Kaohsiung
County; one case has been reported in Taipei County in northern
Taiwan.
The DOH warned last week of a possible outbreak of dengue fever in
southern Taiwan, with the number of reported cases of the tropical
disease increasing by about 10 per day. The Health authority also
warned tourists bound for southeast Asia of an outbreak of dengue
fever currently rampant in Malaysia [see [2] below].
In Taipei City, despite the fact that there hasn't been a single case of
dengue fever reported, health officials have put some districts on red
alert against a possible outbreak as the density of the mosquito
population has reached as high as Level 4, meaning 20-34 mosquitoes
or mosquito larvae found in every 100 households. These districts
include Ta-an and Chungcheng districts. Health officials issue dengue
fever warnings when the mosquito density reaches Level 2, 5-9
mosquitoes or larvae found in every 100 households.
Taipei Health Department officials have urged city residents to undergo
a medical checkup if they have traveled to Southeast Asia or southern
Taiwan over the past 2 weeks and have developed symptoms such as a
sudden high fever, severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, or muscle and
joint pains. As of 4 years ago, almost all the reported cases of dengue
fever in Taiwan, including cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, were
found to have originated from abroad, brought in by returning visitors
to Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries.

Matalysia: Perak Put on Dengue Fever Alert
------------------------------------------
Perak has been put on dengue alert after the vector-borne disease
claimed 6 lives in the last 6 months, including that of a 7-month-old
baby boy from Simpang, Taiping. The others, aged between 20 and 52
years, were from Ipoh (2 victims), Batu Kurau (one), Kuala Kangsar
(one) and Bidor (one). While 5 of the deaths occurred last month [June
2002], the other was in May.
State Health and Environment Committee chairman Datuk Ho Cheng
Wang said today all district hospitals and health departments had been
ordered to monitor the situation and report new cases to the State
Government, especially the deadly dengue haemorrhagic fever. He said
private hospitals and clinics had also been informed of the situation
and had promised to cooperate to prevent the spread of the disease.
He said from January 2002 to June 2002, there were 1089 dengue and
dengue haemorrhagic fever cases, of which 184 were reported in June
2002. Ho said in the first 6 months of last year [2001], there were only
637 dengue cases -- and only one death for the whole of last year. He
said Kuala Kangsar was the worst hit with 250 cases, followed by
Manjung (179), Ipoh (167), Kinta (103) and Hilir Perak (102). He said
preventive measures had been taken, including fogging and anti-
dengue campaigns.

Trinidad: Extent of Dengue Outbreak in Dispute
----------------------------------------------
The Trinidad and Tobago government has denied an outbreak of
dengue fever in the country, even as Health Minister Colm Imbert
announced plans to deal with _Aedes aegypti _ mosquitoes, the carriers
of the disease. Imbert told reporters that while his ministry was aware
of some cases of dengue fever, the situation could not be characterized
as an outbreak. "I would not say there is a crisis, what I would say is
there is a problem," Imbert told reporters, adding that, "there is a
problem between reported and confirmed cases of dengue."
But the Health Ministry has taken out newspaper advertisements
outlining measures to be adopted by residents to deal with the situation.
The advertisements also warn that persons found guilty of breeding
[sic] _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes could be charged 480 Trinidad and
Tobago dollars (80 US dollars). "Together we can do something about
dengue," the advertisement says, informing residents to clear their
property of tins, tires and unused containers that were "favourite sites
for mosquitoes".
Newspaper reports said that at least one person was "battling for his
life, while there are some 30 patients" at the San Fernando Hospital.
The reports said that the man was suffering from dengue haemorrhagic
fever that could result in death. On Mon 22 Jul 2002, Dr Austin
Trinidade, chief of staff at the hospital, was quoted in a local
newspaper as saying that a number of people had been coming to the
hospital suffering from "dengue-type symptoms".

India: Dengue Fever Outbreak in West Bengal
-------------------------------------------
The people of West Midnapores, Salboni and Garbeta have been
afflicted with classical dengue fever, according to an investigation of
the Burdwan Medical College Hospital BMCH. The Principal of BMCH,
Dr Bijoy Mukherji, has sent the findings to Dr Chittaranjan Maity,
director of medical education in West Bengal.
The first attack was reported at Garbeta on 2 Jun 2002. [As of Wed 24
Jul 2002], the number of affected people in Salboni was 840, of whom
3 have died. Blood samples will also be sent to the National Institute of
Cholera and Enteric Diseases, said Mukherji. On Monday and
Wednesday, a team collected blood samples from victims. The victims
homes were infested with _Aedes_ mosquitoes, the carrier of dengue.

Honduras: National Emergency Declared
-------------------------------------
Honduras President Ricardo Maduro has declared a national emergency
due to the country's dengue epidemic, when announcing the measures
the government will implement to fight the disease. The President
announced on national television that the immediate priority is to
control the outburst of dengue, particularly in the main urban centers
of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, to prevent the spread of the
disease to other cities, and make sure that the impact of the control is
sustainable and thus avoid more deaths.
This week, 242 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever were confirmed,
and another 423 people are suspected of suffering the illness. The
Metropolitan Area continues to report 64 percent of the total number of
cases. So far 9 deaths are confirmed and a further 12 are suspected of
dying of dengue. Hospital Escuela, which is the most important public
hospital in Tegucigalpa, is saturated and there is no space left.
Control will only be achieved through a massive fumigation campaign
and actions to avoid the growth of the larvae of the mosquito
transmitting the disease. A fumigation campaign has been ordered with
chemicals that do not affect the health of the people, but are effective
against the mosquito.
"My commitment is to do everything possible to avoid dengue taking
more lives. Therefore, to combat the crisis, together with my cabinet,
we have declared a national emergency to fight against dengue: we will
allocate US$1.2 million to reinforce the program that is being
executed," said the President.
Permanent Cleaning Committees have been formed to get rid of all
materials that could be a breeding place for the mosquito, and are being
trained in the application of Untadita, a mix of detergent and chlorine
that helps to eliminate the larvae of the mosquito in washing basins and
other recipients, instructing to clean these washing basins every 7 days.
In his speech, the President thanked the international community for its
support in the fight against the epidemic highlighting the participation
of US-AID, and the governments of Sweden, Cuba, Guatemala and
Mexico.

Bangladesh: Dengue Fever Returns to Dhaka
-----------------------------------------
Dengue fever has returned to the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, killing 7
people so far this month and affecting some 200 others, senior health
official Kanak Ranjan Talukder said on Wed 24 Jul 2002. At least 6
people died of the infection in Dhaka's leading diabetic hospital, where
5 to 6 dengue patients have been admitted daily since 1 Jul 2002,
Talukder told Agence France Press.
A 10-year-old boy died in the nearby Dhaka Medical College Hospital,
where about 4 people are being admitted daily suffering from fever.
Health Ministry officials said municipal health squads were taking
preventive measures to contain the infection, which is spread by
mosquitoes. Characterised by painful joints, fever and a rash, dengue
symptoms usually begin within a week of a mosquito's bite and last for
7 days.
An outbreak of dengue fever in Bangladesh last year [2001] claimed
more than 44 lives, Talukder said. In October 2000, Bangladesh began
a 5-year action plan to contain dengue fever after 3837 people became
infected, 70 of whom died.
The World Health Organisation earlier expressed concern about a
dengue fever outbreak in southeast Asia and the south Pacific which
last year [2001] left more than 340 people dead.

El Salvador Declares National Emergency over Dengue Fever
---------------------------------------------------------
El Salvador declared a national emergency on Fri 26 Jul 2002 to battle a
dengue epidemic that so far has claimed 9 lives since January 2002 in
the Central American nation. Health authorities said El Salvador has
seen 3203 cases of dengue fever this year [2002], 206 of them the
potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever. There have also been 14
000 suspected cases.
Dengue is transmitted by mosquitoes and the national emergency,
approved by a majority of legislators in Congress, enables the
government to free up more funds to fight the epidemic. It also means
the emergency will be led by the Defense Ministry in coordination with
the Health Ministry, adding weight to the fight to contain the epidemic.
"We continue to have high levels of (mosquito) larvae which expose us
to an expansion of the epidemic," Deputy Health Minister Herbert
Betancourt told reporters after the emergency was approved.
Dengue epidemics have also broken out in neighboring Honduras and
Guatemala. The 3 countries are trying to cobble together a long-term
regional plan to fight the disease. Honduras, where dengue fever has
killed a dozen people, mostly children, declared a similar national
emergency on Mon 22 Jul 2002.

El Salvador: Appearance of Dengue Virus Type 3
----------------------------------------------
The persistence of dengue transmission and the appearance of a new
serotype of the virus [for the country], dengue virus type 3 (DEN-3),
has forced the Salvadorian National Assembly to declare a state of
emergency throughout the whole the country yesterday. Whereas only a
month ago the reported national incidence was 16 cases per day, it is
now 30 cases per day. On 30 Jun 2002, the National Assembly had
already declared a state of emergency in the Departments of San
Salvador, Santa Ana, La Libertad, and Cabanas, as well as in any other
zone where cases of dengue, either classic or hemorrhagic, have been
detected.
The situation is complicated by the presence of the serotype DEN-3,
said the Minister of Health, Jose Lopez Beltran, yesterday during the
presentation of his annual review of activities to the Assembly. Lopez
Beltran requested extension of the state of emergency, after meeting last
weekend in Esquipulas, Guatemala, Ministers of Health Mario Bolanos,
of Guatemala, and Elias Lizardo, of Honduras, to analyze the situation
of dengue in the region. At this meeting the presence of DEN-3 in El
Salvador was acknowledged, as well as the fact that dengue fever is not
a local but is a hemispheric problem.
[The reintroduction of DEN-3 to Central America, where it has been
absent for about 20 years, was reported in 1994. The same serotype
was isolated a few months later in Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica,
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. The accumulation of a large
young population not previously exposed to this serotype of dengue
virus, living in conditions favorable to the transmission of the
infection, facilitates the potential occurrence of massive outbreaks of
the infection and the appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever. For
these reasons, the steady increase in the incidence of the disease in the
region comes as no surprise.
Viral envelope gene sequence data from DEN-3 isolates from Panama
and Nicaragua have shown that this new American DEN-3 strain is
likely a recent introduction from Asia, since it is genetically distinct
from the DEN-3 strain found previously in the Americas, but is
identical to the DEN-3 strain that caused major outbreaks of dengue
hemorrhagic fever in Sri Lanka and India in the 1980s. - Mod.JT]

Philippines: Dengue Fever Deaths in Bicol Region
------------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever has killed at least 7 patients and hospitalized 128 persons
in 6 months in the Bicol Region. Department of Health (DOH)
epidemiologist chief in Bicol Dr. Ferchito Avelino said that from
January to July 2002, 7 have died of dengue, 6 of them from Albay and
one from Catanduanes. Avelino added that there had been 4 unreported
cases of dengue fever in Masbate last month. He believed that there are
more unreported dengue cases, especially those confined in private
hospitals.
At least 54 dengue cases were recorded by the Provincial Health Office
(PHO) during the first 6 months of the year, prompting the office to
intensify its information and education campaign on the disease.
Polangui has the highest record of cases with 12. DOH regional director
Gerardo Bayugo has sought the cooperation of local government units
in improving its sanitation campaign to prevent a dengue outbreak.
Breeding areas of mosquito would multiply rapidly this rainy season if
no preventive measures are taken, he warned.

Who Issues Dengue Fever Warning
-------------------------------
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said Mon 29 Jul that 2002 was
shaping up to be a bad year for dengue fever and urged governments
and individuals to protect against the mosquitoes that spread the
infection. "This year is looking a bit like 1998 when we had a
pandemic. It's a very worrying picture," said Mike Nathan of WHO's
Department of Communicable Diseases, adding that a record 1.2
million cases were reported in 1998.
Jose Esparza, coordinator of WHO's viral vaccines team, said the
search for a vaccine was still going on but was a long-term project and
no "magic bullet" to replace prevention efforts. The vaccine must fight
against all 4 [serotypes] of dengue fever. Once an individual is
infected, he is only immune to that [serotype] and has a greater
likelihood of suffering more severely from a second infection.
The surge this year is due chiefly to the nature of the disease itself and
is predominant in areas where household water storage and inadequate
solid waste disposal services prevail. "During the 1998 pandemic, there
was a lot of transmission so many people developed an immunity.
Typically after a big outbreak you get a quiet year, then each year it
begins to build up again until you have an epidemic. That seems to be
where we are now," Nathan told a news conference.
In the first quarter, Brazil alone reported 84 deaths to the WHO from
around 550 000 cases of dengue fever, 200 000 of those the more
serious dengue hemorrhagic fever. [While I accept that dengue is under-
reported in Brazil, there are too many zeros in the DHF figure: official
reports to PAHO for the first quarter of 2002 at
<http://www.paho.org/English/SHA/be_v23n1-denguebrazil.htm>,
accessed today, show 357 615 cases of dengue, with only 1622 of DHF
& only 66 deaths, which are more likely ratios. - Mod.JW]
Although reporting is sketchy, the WHO estimates there are around 50
million cases of the infection each year and 2.5 billion of the world's
population are at risk. Nathan called on governments to implement
measures to cut mosquito populations and urged people to take simple
precautions such as unblocking gutters and discarding packaging
properly to prevent stagnant water, a prime breeding area for
mosquitoes.
