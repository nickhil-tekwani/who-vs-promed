Second Crow In Indiana Tests Positive For West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------------
INDIANAPOLIS: A dead crow found in Floyd County is the second bird in
Indiana to test positive for West Nile virus. Health officials say the fact
that another infected bird has been found in a different part of the state
could be an indication that West Nile virus is more widely dispersed
throughout Indiana. "When that first crow in southeast Marion County tested
positive for West Nile virus, we expected that it was just an indication
that the virus had made it this far west and that it could be present in
other areas," said Michael Sinsko, senior medical entomologist at the
Indiana State Department of Health.
Tests completed today by the Indiana State Department of Health
Laboratories confirmed the presence of West Nile virus in the crow.
Laboratories at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta will be conducting tests in the next few days to further confirm
the positive results.
The Indiana State Department of Health has 4 full-time entomologists and 6
Governor's Interns collecting blood from wild birds to be tested for the
virus. According to Sinsko, they have collected and tested 4643 live birds
from 33 counties and 8410 mosquitoes from 13 counties. The State Department
of Health Laboratories have also tested 13 dead birds from 7 counties.
Including the one from Floyd County, 2 have tested positive for the virus.
Primarily [the cause of a wild bird disease, West Nile virus has been
found in fewer than one percent of mosquitoes in areas where it has been
reported. And fewer than one percent of people bitten by an infected
mosquito will become severely ill. "We are continuing to watch for evidence
of not only West Nile virus, but also the other mosquito-borne viruses we
are concerned about in Indiana," said Sinsko. "We will see this virus again
next year and most likely for the next several years until our bird
population develops a high enough level of resistance to interrupt
transmission."
West Nile virus has been found in nearly 80 bird species and 8 mammal
species. Prior to August 1999, West Nile virus had never been reported in
the Western Hemisphere. In addition to Indiana, West Nile virus has
recently been reported in Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin,
Louisiana, and Ontario.
