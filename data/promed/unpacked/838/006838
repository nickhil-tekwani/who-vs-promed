[3] WHO: weekly review
Date: Thu 25 Aug 2022
Source: WHO Director-General's remarks [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-covid-19-media-briefing--25-august-2022


Last week, the number of weekly reported cases fell by more than 20% globally, although new cases increased in the Americas, where we are continuing to see intense transmission. In the early stages of the outbreak, most reported cases were in Europe, with a smaller proportion in the Americas. That has now reversed, with less than 40% of reported cases in Europe and 60% in the Americas.

There are signs that the outbreak is slowing in Europe, where a combination of effective public health measures, behaviour change and vaccination are helping to prevent transmission. However, in Latin America in particular, insufficient awareness or public health measures are combining with a lack of access to vaccines to fan the flames of the outbreak.

Yesterday [24 Aug 2022], the manufacturer of one vaccine, Bavarian Nordic, signed an agreement with WHO's Regional Office for the Americas to support access to its vaccine in Latin America and the Caribbean. We thank Bavarian Nordic for this agreement, and we hope that it will help to bring the outbreak under control in the region.

WHO continues to encourage all countries to establish vaccine effectiveness studies to ensure data collection even while enhancing access.

Citation: Spicknall IH, Pollock ED, Clay PA, et al. Modeling the impact of sexual networks in the transmission of _Monkeypox virus_ among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men -- United States, 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2022.

Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
The 2022 monkeypox outbreak is associated with sexual and intimate contact. Survey data suggest that gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), who have been disproportionately affected, are reducing one-time partnerships.

What is added by this report?
Modeling of sexual infection transmission between men indicates that one-time partnerships, which account for 3% of daily sexual partnerships and 16% of daily sex acts, account for approximately 50% of daily _Monkeypox virus_ (MPXV) transmission. A 40% reduction in one-time partnerships might delay the spread of monkeypox and reduce the percentage of persons infected by 20% to 31%.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Reductions in one-time partnerships, already being reported by MSM, might significantly reduce MPXV transmission.

Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
A global monkeypox outbreak is currently primarily affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.

What is added by this report?
In a recent survey of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, approximately one half reported reducing their number of sex partners, one-time sexual encounters, and use of dating apps because of the monkeypox outbreak. Receipt of vaccine to protect against monkeypox varied by race, ethnicity, and geography.

What are the implications for public health practice?
It is essential that public health programs continue to deliver tailored, respectful harm reduction messages that do not create stigma to diverse communities of men who have sex with men. Vaccine programs should prioritize efforts to maximize equitable access.

[6] Tecovirimat for treatment
Date: Thu 25 Aug 2022
Source: Nature News Explainer [edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02245-2


As supplies of vaccines against monkeypox remain constrained and the number of people contracting the disease continues to mount, physicians and researchers are looking to the drug tecovirimat for relief. In animals infected with monkeypox, the antiviral has been shown to lower the amount of virus in their bodies and reduce the number of fluid-filled "pox" lesions forming on their skin.

Efficacy data in humans, however, are much more limited, making some researchers and regulatory agencies hesitant about authorizing tecovirimat's widespread use. But people with monkeypox -- in particular those with severe disease, which can cause extreme pain, scarring and, in rare cases, death -- are pleading for access to the drug.

Clinical trials of the drug are starting up now, but results are still months away. Nature spoke to infectious disease specialists to understand how tecovirimat works, and what data are still needed to assess whether it is effective against monkeypox in humans.

What is tecovirimat, and how does it work?
After the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, in which letters laced with spores of the lethal bacterium were sent to media organizations and politicians, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, received a funding boost to develop treatments against pathogens with the potential to be used as bioweapons. Biosecurity officials were especially worried about smallpox, which can kill about 30% of the people who are infected. Although the disease was eradicated more than 40 years ago, the concern was that smallpox virus could be accidentally released from, or weaponized by, laboratories around the world where samples are still kept.

The influx of cash helped to give rise to tecovirimat. The antiviral works by preventing orthopoxviruses, such as smallpox, from creating a certain protein. Once this type of virus hijacks a host cell and replicates, the newly formed viruses use this protein to escape from the infected cell and spread to other cells. By blocking the virus from making the protein, tecovirimat "essentially traps the virus inside infected cells," leaving the immune system's antibodies and T cells to take care of the situation, says Dennis Hruby, chief scientific officer at SIGA Technologies, the New York City-based pharmaceutical firm that makes tecovirimat.

Researchers designed the antiviral with smallpox in mind, Hruby says. But because it targets a protein that other orthopoxviruses, including the monkeypox virus, use, scientists think the drug could also tame monkeypox.

Is there any evidence that tecovirimat works against monkeypox?
A 2018 trial in about 450 people, 90 of whom received a placebo, showed that the drug is safe and has few side effects1. But demonstrating its efficacy against orthopoxviruses in humans has been less explored.

Is there any evidence that tecovirimat works against monkeypox?
A 2018 trial in about 450 people, 90 of whom received a placebo, showed that the drug is safe and has few side effects (1 [see source URL for references]). But demonstrating its efficacy against orthopoxviruses in humans has been less explored.

When the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered approving the drug to treat smallpox in 2018, the agency acknowledged that it wouldn't be feasible or ethical to test it by infecting people with that virus or any other orthopoxvirus. Instead, the FDA granted an exception to allow SIGA to use efficacy data from animal studies.

Researchers tested tecovirimat on non-human primates infected with the monkeypox virus and rabbits infected with the rabbitpox virus. In both cases, animals that received the antiviral 4 days after infection had a much higher chance of survival, developed fewer lesions and had a lower viral load compared with those that received a placebo (1).

The ongoing global monkeypox outbreak has so far provided only anecdotal evidence of tecovirimat's effectiveness in people, says Daniel McQuillen, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, based in Arlington, Virginia. A couple of observational studies (2,3) in a handful of people with monkeypox found that new lesions stopped forming within one day after physicians administered tecovirimat. And a study that administered the drug to 14 people in the Central African Republic, where a more deadly strain of the virus has been circulating for decades, found that participants' viral load dropped significantly within 4 days, according to a draft manuscript Nature has seen. These studies do not establish drug efficacy because they did not have a control group for comparing results.

Physicians worldwide have had a hard time accessing tecovirimat. Why?
The European Union and the United Kingdom have approved tecovirimat for monkeypox using the same animal studies reviewed by the FDA, which has eased access to the drug in some countries. However, SIGA has so far taken orders from only 11 countries, including the United States and Canada, says Holly Stevens, a spokesperson for the company. (Stevens declined to disclose the other countries.) That means access to the drug is still extremely limited -- and notably so in parts of Central and West Africa, where monkeypox has been spreading for decades and has caused the most deaths.

In the United States, the FDA hasn't authorized tecovirimat's use against monkeypox because, the agency says, the disease hasn't been eradicated and therefore it is still possible to test the drug in humans. This means that US physicians can access the drug, deemed experimental for monkeypox, only by requesting special permission through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This red tape has put many physicians off prescribing tecovirimat, even though the country has a stockpile of 1.7 million courses -- mainly intended for use against smallpox.

The paperwork required is an enormous burden for clinicians who have to juggle patients, says Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. The CDC recently made some of the forms optional and has allowed physicians to submit them after administering the drug to people. It is also working with the FDA to further tweak the process, says Scott Pauley, a CDC spokesperson.

The FDA finds itself in a "tricky position," McQuillen says. The agency was criticized when it authorized the emergency use of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 and they turned out not to be effective. Making tecovirimat completely accessible could hinder clinical trials to determine the drug's efficacy because people might not want to enroll if there's a chance they will receive a placebo, he says. The FDA did not respond to Nature's queries.

What data are now being collected, and what do scientists still want to know?
The 1st randomized controlled trials are being set up in Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Kingdom and the United States; clinicians have begun enrolling participants in the UK trial, and the others hope to begin soon.

Hruby says that researchers plan to enroll people with mild cases of monkeypox. If they are hospitalized, participants will have the opportunity to receive the drug, even if they were part of the placebo group. He adds that he expects to see the 1st data in a matter of months.

Apart from these efficacy trials, it would be helpful to test whether the drug can also prevent infection when administered prophylactically, either before exposure to the monkeypox virus or within days of a person finding out they have been exposed, says Jessica Justman, an infectious disease physician at Columbia University in New York City. With HIV, using antivirals prophylactically has been very effective in protecting against the virus -- and that strategy might work for monkeypox, too, she says.

In some countries, clinicians have been trialling the use of smallpox vaccines, which are thought to be effective against monkeypox, by offering them soon after a person has been exposed to the monkeypox virus. But the most common vaccine offered is given in 2 doses and takes 6 weeks after the 1st one to reach peak efficacy, meaning that using vaccines post-exposure might not be very effective. This is a situation in which a proven antiviral, which would probably take effect much faster than vaccines, could come in handy, Justman says.

More information about how the antiviral works in humans is desperately needed, McQuillen says, although he acknowledges the difficult task ahead. "We're trying to figure out if a drug works in an outbreak that's expanding exponentially and that we want to stop at the same time," he says.
