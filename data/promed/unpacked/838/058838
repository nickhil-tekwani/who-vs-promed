_Vibrio cholerae_ is not endemic in Louisiana, but more pathogenic
non-cholera Vibrios are, and they have already killed and will
continue to do so. I have been [back] to New Orleans, and there are
no mosquitoes now; all larvae were killed by floating petrochemicals.
The ARBOR diseases will return soon, principally West Nile virus --
worse than in Mississippi -- and spraying will be required later when
the floodwaters recede.
Current mild diarrheal diseases are viral and secondary to poor
sanitation and endemic RNA enteric viruses. More serious dysenteric
disease outbreaks could follow among those who are not evacuating
flooded areas and who are consuming contaminated food and water.
Dysenteric diseases should not be a problem in well-run shelters.
Baton Rouge will probably have a hepatitis A outbreak in 4-6 weeks so
get vaccinated for HAV now, because there are inadequate stocks of
IgG and HAV vaccine to respond to an outbreak.
As we enter flu season, viral URIs will become a problem among the
elderly in shelters and may result in community acquired pneumonias.
Since many TB+ homeless persons and ex-prisoners may have been
sheltered with the elderly, infants, and the immunosuppressed, MDR-TB
could be transmitted to these susceptible populations. Reactivation
of non-MDR TB in the elderly is usually more of a problem, especially
among older immigrants from countries where TB is endemic (Viet Nam,
Mexico, etc.) and primary infections were acquired during childhood.
The elderly often baby sit the infants, who are highly susceptible to
TB. TB should not be as much of a problem as viral URIs and secondary
pneumonias.
[He added:] I have never seen a case of cholera in 30 years of
practice, but plenty of non-cholera _Vibrio_ infections; many were
fatal, especially in immunosuppressed transplant patients. _V.
vulnificus_ septicemia is especially problematic, because it can be
transmitted through lacerations, ingestion, and, probably,
transconjunctivally.

[I hate to disagree with Jim, as we have known each other for many
years, but in the past, there have been outbreaks in southern
Louisiana of _V. cholerae_ "El Tor" of a specific phage type common
from Apalachicola Bay to Galveston Bay, and usually south of
Interstate highway 10 (I-10). We used it in a trial involving frog
legs: see Sang, F.C.; Hugh-Jones, M.E.; Hagstad, H.V. 1987. A
Research Note: Viability of Vibrio cholerae 01 on Frog Legs under
Frozen and Refrigerated Conditions and Low Dose Radiation Treatment.
Journal of Food Protection, 50:662-664. We obtained the culture from
the NO PH Laboratory which had recovered it from some prior outbreak.
It was never very virulent in the various outbreaks, and its recovery
depended more on clinician awareness than anything else. I haven't
seen it reported for some time now. Those outbreaks followed a lack
of rain and thus presumably salt-water intrusion into the oyster bays
and blue crab trapping areas. It was largely south of the I-10,
presumably because of the Cajun propensity to under cook their crabs.
_V. cholerae_ non-01 strains are still recovered occasionally. But,
in reality, Jim is absolutely correct about the present status of
cholera in Louisiana.
His advice about getting vaccinated for hepatitis A is valid, but the
vaccine appears to be unavailable in Baton Rouge. Our shared grad
student was unable to get any for her daughter this morning. -
