I was just in Fort Smith for the past two days providing my [advice to
Park officials and trying to help John and Brett [Elkins, NWT Wildlife
Pathologist politely suggest a course of action
The first carcasses were found on July 14 by a crew surveying a purposed
new winter road through the [Wood Bison National Park [in the NE corner of
Alberta. Twelve carcasses were discovered in two areas to the north of the
Peace River and east of the western Park boundary within the Alberta
portion of the Park (the area is outside the regions where anthrax has
previously occurred). The nearest human habitation is Garden River, a small
native settlement (estimated population 300) about 50 km to the west on the
Park border. There are no domestic herds at Garden River.
On Saturday Park wardens flew out to the site and collected specimens from
several of the carcasses to send to ADRI [Animal Diseases Research
Institute at Lethbridge. They estimated the animals had been dead
approximately four or five days and in most cases the bodies were already
being scavenged. Park wardens flew over the area on the 17th [July and
observed 22 bison carcasses and one bear carcass. There are two clusters of
about eight carcasses each with the remainder spread around the clusters.
The bear carcass is near one of the clusters. The affected area is low
lying and near a slow moving creek. Most of the carcasses are under a heavy
cover of aspen and jack pine which has made observation and landing
difficult. Park wardens observed six additional live animals in the
immediate area, at least 3 of whom seemed morbid, and another herd of about
30 animals (mostly cows and calves) within 30 km of the site. Eight of the
carcasses closest to the old cut line the surveyors were looking at as the
route of the new winter road were covered in lime to discourage scavengers
but were otherwise left untreated. The Park issued a voluntary (human)
travel restriction for the area surrounding the site.
On Tuesday, Brett and I met with the Park Superintendent and Health Canada
and Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials in a teleconference. To make
a long meeting short, the Park's position is that the carcasses are in too
remote a region and the trees too large and encroaching for burial or
burning. All the carcasses apparently show some degree of scavenging so it
is too late to stop the spread of the spores and those that aren't
scavenged are old enough that putrefaction and the elimination of the
vegetative organism should be well on its way. They believe there is no
chance of finding the point source for the outbreak, the disease is already
endemic to the region anyway and anthrax is a natural part of the
ecosystem. In other words, they are taking a hands off approach similar to
their stance with tuberculosis and brucellosis in the Park.
While the meeting was going on John and his technician, Troy, accompanied
the Park warden overseeing the outbreak to the site and collected samples
from the black bear carcass. The bear was quite putrid with maggots
hatching in its mouth and a prolapsed rectum and must have been dead at
least a week. Still swabs were collected from the mouth, nostrils and anus
and we may get a lucky isolation. John and Troy both agreed that the forest
cover was thicker than what we encountered in the [MacKenzie Bison
Sanctuary outbreak [in 1993 but was still not insurmountable. No new
carcasses were seen though one apparently morbid bison was observed in the
Salt Plains area (in the Park Central region). Greg Tiffin at ADRI has
done his usual fast magic and today the outbreak was officially confirmed
as anthrax. You will probably be receiving the new isolates from Greg next
month sometime after the end of the anthrax season.
Through more talking with the Park wardens, Brett and John managed to
convince the Park to fly a more intensive surveillance flight over the
affected and surrounding areas with an infrared camera. The Park wardens
have also agreed to collect lats and longs of all the carcasses observed
and even to land by a few of the more accessible ones and take pictures and
sink a metal stake beside the animal's nose (the wardens would dearly love
for someone to go in afterwards and collect soil samples to determine the
level of spore contamination around the untreated carcasses and compare
that to my findings around treated carcasses). The flight should be run
sometime before the end of the week. Today a visual surveillance was flown
over the nearby Lake One and Lake Claire regions and no carcasses were
found. A further visual surveillance flight is planned for the Park Central
region tomorrow.
Anthrax surveillance flights were flown over the Grand Detour and Hook Lake
regions [sites of outbreaks in the 1960s, '70s & 80s on July 8 and 9 and
over the [MB Sanctuary on July 14 and 15. No dead bison were observed.
Plans are in place to re-survey the Grand Detour and Hook Lake regions this
weekend and a regularly scheduled survey of the Sanctuary will take place
on the 24 or 25.
That's about all I know for now. If anymore carcasses are found during the
surveillance flights I will let you know.

[As to the recent outbreak, it seems that the park officials have set up a
nice, but not necessarily wise, experiment. The '93 MacKenzie Sanctuary
outbreak was dealt with by some 96% incineration in situ of all 180
carcasses -- there had been an intensive helicopter search with
heat-seeking devices and it is confidently believed that few if any bison
carcasses were missed; plus retrospectively we know that six months later
there was a very high residual seroprevalence of antibodies in the
surviving adult population of wood bison. And seemingly as a result there
were no or minimal subsequent cases. In the WBNP in 1962-3 they buried &
limed those carcasses found (mainly by ground searches and bush planes) and
outbreaks continued for the next 20 years or so. It will be interesting to
see if this outbreak follows the 1962 pattern, which I strongly suspect it
will for sure.

For those needing background, Dan Dragon has been studying the ecology of
this pathogen in wildlife outbreaks and especially in the MacKenzie Bison
Sanctuary. He has written a number of useful papers on this disease in
northern wildlife. His dissertation defence is presently rescheduled for
the second half of this coming August. - MHJ
