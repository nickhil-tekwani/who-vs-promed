Costa Rican health authorities reported today [20 May 2009] that 7
persons have died in a hospital in San Jose due to an aggressive
bacterium [_Clostridium difficile_] acquired in the health center.

Ricardo Boza, head of [the division of] infectious diseases of the
San Juan de Dios Hospital, told local press that there is no
assurance that the bacterium _C. difficile_ was the [primary] cause
of death of the patients, but acknowledged that the 7 who died were
infected with this microorganism, which causes fever, diarrhea,
vomiting, and perforations in the colon. It particularly attacks
patients with other underlying ailments such as heart disease or
respiratory problems.

Hospital authorities commented on the case after local newspaper The
Nation reported an outbreak of the bacterium, which has affected at
least 25 patients in the health center. Upon release of the news, the
director of the medical center, Ileana Balmaceda, said that these
patients are in isolation and that the peak of the outbreak is over,
but could not specify when the abnormal increase in the number of
infected patients will be controlled.

Rosa Climent, medical manager of the Costa Rican Social Security,
said that if this bacterium infects patients with very low defenses
it can be fatal because it is resistant to antibiotic treatment.

Physicians at the San Juan de Dios Hospital who asked to remain
anonymous told The Nation that _Clostridium difficile_ has spread in
the hospital and infected dozens of people over the last 3 months at
least, and that no control measures have been implemented.

This type of bacteria is widespread in hospitals and transmission
results from, among other reasons, an inappropriate disposal of the
feces of an infected patient or by fecal-oral contact.

Health authorities said they are already taking all necessary
measures to prevent further infections, such as limiting visits to
patients who have the bacteria and intensifying the cleaning
procedures in the areas where they are.

[From a prior ProMED post Clostridium difficile, ribotype 027 - UK:
(N. Ireland) 20080207.0498:

"_Clostridium difficile_ is the most common cause of bacterial
diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients, and
antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk factor
associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_. Recent outbreaks
of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea with increased severity, high
relapse rate, and significant mortality, have been related to the
emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain in North
America, Japan, and Europe. The emerging strain, which hyper-produces
toxins A and B, is referred to as North American pulsed-field type 1
and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027. These epidemic
strains are characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use
of which is one risk factor for disease due to this ribotype (Drudy
D, Kyne L, O'Mahony R, Fanning S: gyrA mutations in
fluoroquinolone-resistant _Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027. Emerg
Infect Dis 2007; 13. Available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/3/504.htm>)."

The high mortality rate in the San Jose hospital outbreak (7 of 25
patients with _C. difficile_-associated disease died) suggests a
hypervirulent strain may be involved, but neither the ribotype
involved, nor the mortality directly attributable to _C. difficile_
in the San Jose outbreak is known. In a Canadian outbreak due to
ribotype 027, the 30 day-mortality rate was 23.0 percent for patients
with CDAD, compared with 7.0 percent for the matched controls, for an
attributable mortality of 16 percent (Pepin J, et al. CMAJ. 2005
October 25; 173(9): 1037-1042. Available at:
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1266326>).

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities
involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized
patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection
control measures, including prompt patient isolation of patients with
_C. difficile_-positive diarrhea or cohorting, where isolation rooms
are not available, combined with particular emphasis on hand hygiene
and control of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents
(<http://www.sheaonline.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF>).
