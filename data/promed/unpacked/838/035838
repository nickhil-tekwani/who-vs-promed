Notes from the Field: Outbreak of Diarrheal Illness Caused by Shigella flexneri -- American Samoa, May-June 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Painter JE, Walker AT, Pytell J, Nua MT, Solial-Lemus S, Mintz E, Ali I, Parsons M, Martin H, Beach M, Bowen A, Cope J]

On 9 May 2014, a physician at hospital A in American Samoa noticed an abnormally high number of children presenting to the emergency department with bloody diarrhea. Based on preliminary testing of stool specimens, _Entamoeba histolytica_ infection was suspected as a possible cause. _Shigella_ was also suspected in a subset of samples. On 22 May 2014, the American Samoa Department of Health requested assistance from CDC with the outbreak investigation. The goals of the investigation were to establish the presence of an outbreak, characterize its epidemiology and etiology, and recommend control measures. The CDC field team reviewed the emergency department log book for cases of diarrheal illness during 15 Apr 2014-13 Jun 2014. During this period, 280 cases of diarrheal illness were recorded, with a peak occurring on 10 May 2014. Twice as many cases occurred during this period in 2014 compared with the same period in 2011, the most recent year for which comparable surveillance data were available. Cases were widely distributed across the island. The highest number of cases occurred in children aged 0-9 years. Across age groups, cases were similarly distributed among males and females. These patterns are not consistent with the epidemiology of disease caused by _E. histolytica_, which tends to cause more cases in males of all ages.

Hypothesis-generating interviews with families of 13 patients did not reveal any common water, food, sewage, or event exposures. 8 participants reported having ill household contacts, with family contacts often becoming ill within 1-3 days after the participant's illness onset. 6 stool specimens were sent to CDC. All were negative for ameba, including _E. histolytica_, by multiple laboratory methods. All 6 specimens were also negative for Cryptosporidium and Giardia by a polymerase chain reaction test. However, an invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene sequence, a genetic marker of _Shigella_, was identified in four specimens. Additionally, 7 isolates sent to the Hawaii Department of Health and CDC were identified as _Shigella flexneri_ serotype 7 (proposed; also referred to as provisional 88-893 or 1c), and 5 shared an indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern.

Shigella causes an estimated 500 000 cases of shigellosis per year in the USA (1). Most persons with shigellosis develop diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever, and stomach cramps 1-2 days after they are exposed to the bacteria. The illness usually resolves in 5-7 days. Careful and frequent hand washing and strict adherence to standard food and water safety precautions are the best defense against shigellosis (2).

Together, epidemiologic and laboratory data suggest this was a shigellosis outbreak with person-to-person transmission. This investigation highlights the importance of building epidemiologic and laboratory capacity for enteric illnesses and enhancing basic hand hygiene and prevention strategies in US territories.

[Shigella was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; in part for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread. Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces, with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
