According to [recent reports, lab tests show samples from cheese processed by
Parmalat Canada contained the same strain of _Salmonella_ sp. as that found in
Lunchmate products manufactured by J.M. Schneider of Kitchener.
The story says that scientists are still investigating the exact cause of a
national outbreak of salmonella poisoning, with the number of reported
cases now reaching over 650, mostly in Ontario.
The strain of _Salmonella enteritidis_ has now been detected in both the
shredded cheese in the Lunchmate line and a vat of cheese at a Belleville
plant operated by Parmalat, which is also Schneider's supplier.
What investigators are still trying to determine is at what stage of
production the bacteria entered the cheese.
Dr. Andrea Ellis of Health Canada in Guelph was quoted as saying, "That's
the million-dollar question right now."
The story says that the investigation hasn't ruled out the possibility of
the bacteria being spread by a worker carrying the infection without
showing signs of illness. Nor is the case entirely closed on the
possibility of "cross-contamination," by which the cheese was infected by
some other food.
However, it appears the search for an answer is becoming more focused on
the Parmalat cheese alone, including its dairy milk and pasteurization.
Ellis was cited as saying that a key question investigators are grappling
with is whether the contamination occurred before or after the arrival of
the cheese at the Belleville plant, where products are processed and packaged.
The complexity of the case is compounded by the fact Parmalat has several
suppliers. Ellis was cited as saying she could not identify the suppliers
until it is determined their product carried the bacteria. Rob McKenzie,
marketing manager for Schneider, was cited as saying in an interview
yesterday that the agency tested all the ingredients, including chicken, in
"hundreds of packages" of Lunchmate products. Except for that found in the
cheese, "there was absolutely no trace of [_Salmonella_ sp."
McKenzie added that production of the Lunchmate line has ceased until
"we're convinced it's absolutely safe. We have to pinpoint the source of
this problem so that we can put the measures in place to make sure this
thing never happens again."
McKenzie added that "we feel terrible about what's happened."
However, he said Schneider has been conducting market surveys which leads
the company to believe "our customers still do have tremendous trust in us."
