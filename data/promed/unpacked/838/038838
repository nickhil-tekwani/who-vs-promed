Number of Bosnian brucellosis patients on the rise
---------------------------------------------------
Presenter Almira Huseinovic: 39 brucellosis patients have been admitted to
Sarajevo's Kosevo clinic over the past 5 months. The assumption is that
this will not be the final number. Most infected persons come from Central
Bosnia Canton. An epidemic has not been declared so far, although doctors
assert it is time to do that.
Reporter Arnela Subasic: A veterinarian from Travnik and a man from Sanski
are sharing a room at Kosovo's infectious [diseases] ward. They both have
brucellosis, a disease that has not been mentioned much as of late.
A doctor: If I tell you that in 2003 and 2004 we had a total of 47 acute
cases of brucellosis, and that already in this period of 5 months, Jan to
May 2005, we have had a total of 39 treated patients --
Reporter: Veterinarians believe that the 1st infected cattle came from Romania.
Unidentified speaker: In Bosnia & Herzegovina trade lobbies are at work to
import both live cattle and [other] food of suspicious quality. This of
course has negative consequences for the health of the population. And you
can see that now professionals who are supposed to prevent infections are
being hospitalized.
