A salmonella outbreak at a prestigious Melbourne hotel has left at least 44 people ill, with 6 needing hospital treatment. The outbreak was linked to Southbank's The Langham hotel, in the Victorian capital's inner-city, in the high tea room in the Aria Bar and Lounge on 11-12 Jul 2015. A Victoria Department of Health spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were aware of 44 people who had fallen ill after eating at the hotel. "Of those 15 are confirmed salmonellosis cases, with test results still pending on others [from whom] we have obtained samples ," he said. "We know 6 people had received hospital care, [with] 4 admitted and 2 seen in the emergency department." The department's spokesman also said the hotel was fully cooperating with authorities.

The source of the food poisoning is yet to be determined with the department testing samples provided by the hotel. "It may take some time before the source can be established because some foods have more than 1 ingredient and further more detailed tests may be required," the department spokesman said.

A hotel spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia food samples had been frozen in line with hotel guidelines, which have now been provided to investigators. "This has never happened before and now we're cooperating with the Department of Health and Human Services, and providing details of preparation logs and samples," she said. "As the safety and well-being of the guests and colleagues are of the highest priority, the hotel has extensive protocols in place to ensure food safety."
