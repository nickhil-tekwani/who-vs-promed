SECRETARY LIFTS 27-COUNTY ST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS MEDICAL ALERT
TALLAHASSEE - Florida Department of Health Secretary Dr. James T. Howell
today lifted the health alert for St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE) that had been
in place in 27 central and south Florida counties since October 2, 1997.
"The risk of contracting St. Louis Encephalitis has been reduced
significantly," Howell said. "For this reason, we are lifting the alert but
urging people to still take precautions if they are in areas with high
concentrations of mosquitoes."
Howell said the health alert has been lifted due to several factors,
including no human cases of St. Louis Encephalitis since October 29, a
significant drop in mosquito activity and a marked reduction in positive
encephalitis tests among chicken flocks in the alert area.
There were a total of nine human cases of St. Louis Encephalitis this year.
One of those cases resulted in the death of a 68-year-old Hillsborough
County man with a history of significant mosquito exposure.
The Department of Health issued the 27-county medical alert after two human
cases were reported in the same week and after observing a significant
increase in mosquito populations and positive tests for the SLE virus in
sentinel chicken flocks in the region.
One of the reasons there were so few human cases this year as compared to
other years was the response by citizens and visitors who took appropriate
precautions to protect themselves, health officials said. In addition,
county health departments and mosquito control units throughout Florida
helped reduce the risk by monitoring mosquito activity, implementing
mosquito control activities and issuing advisories to residents on how to
protect themselves.
Those counties under the health alert were: Brevard, Charlotte, Collier,
Desoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Indian
River, Lake, Lee, Manatee, Martin, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach,
Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, St. Lucie, Sarasota, Seminole, Sumter and Volusia.
