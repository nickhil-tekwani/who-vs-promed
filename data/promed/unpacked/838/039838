More than 1000 Iraqis were rushed to hospital with respiratory ailments on Thursday [5 May 2022] due to a sandstorm, the 7th to hit the country in the past month, state media said.

Residents of 6 of Iraq's 18 provinces, including Baghdad and the vast western region of al-Anbar, awoke once again to a thick cloud of dust blanketing the sky.

Authorities in al-Anbar and Kirkuk provinces, north of the capital, urged people to stay indoors, said the official INA news agency. Hospitals in al-Anbar province had received more than 700 patients with breathing difficulties, said Anas Qais, a health official cited by INA. The central province of Salaheddin reported more than 300 cases, while the central province of Diwaniya and the province of Najaf, south of Baghdad, each recorded about 100 cases, the news agency added.

Iraq is particularly vulnerable to climate change, having already witnessed record low rainfall and high temperatures in the past few years. Experts have said these factors threaten to bring social and economic disaster in the war-scarred country. In November [2021], the World Bank warned Iraq could suffer a 20-percent drop in water resources by 2050 due to climate change. In early April [2022], a government official warned Iraq could face "272 days of dust" a year in coming decades.

The environment ministry said the weather phenomenon could be addressed by "increasing vegetation cover and creating forests that act as windbreaks."

[Sandstorms arise as the force of wind increases, passing over loose sand particles on the earth's surface; the sand particles first start to vibrate, then to saltate ("leap"), repeatedly striking the ground, loosening and break off smaller particles of sand, which then begin to travel in suspension (https://web.archive.org/web/20060314100353/http://www.weru.ksu.edu/new_weru/multimedia/movies/dust001.mpg). A rising air mass resulting from cooler air riding over heated ground, carries the suspended sand aloft. Sandstorms can be hazardous for travel, with reduced visibility, obliterating ground and air routes, and causing an overall negative socio-economic impact across all sectors (https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/SDS%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf).

Human health is also affected, increasing the number and severity of asthma attacks, causing or aggravating bronchitis and reducing the body's ability to fight infections (https://www.thoracic.org/patients/patient-resources/resources/sand-and-dust-storms.pdf). Hospitals are overwhelmed in dealing with acute and chronic respiratory conditions caused by these sandstorms (https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220505-thousands-sick-as-latest-severe-sandstorm-sweeps-across-iraq).

Sandstorms could also aerosolize soilborne toxins and pathogens, such as _Bacillus anthracis_, _Clostridium botulinum_, Listeria monocytogenes_, _Coccidioides immitis_, and _C. posadasii_, exposing individuals to inhalational infections or contamination of food (see also's below).

Sandstorms are a persistent problem in Iraq, especially during the summer from mid-June to mid- September due to a strong wind, called the Shamal, that blows from the north and northwest over the floodplain of Iraq's Tigris and Euphrates Rivers (https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Earth_from_Space_Iraq_dust_storm). From April to early June and again from late September through November Iraq is also affected by the southern and southeasterly Sharqi (hot, dusty wind). These 2 winds generate severe sandstorms in the region. The growing sandstorm problem in Iraq has been attributed to inappropriate farming practices, mismanagement of water resources and climate change.

Iraq consists of 19 governorates, also known as "provinces"; a map showing the location of these provinces can be found at http://annamap.com/iraq/iraq-map.jpg. - Mod.ML
