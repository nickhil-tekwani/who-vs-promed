2001/089 Tomato viruses present in Tunisia
According to 1996 data, tomatoes are grown [in Tunisia on 23 800 ha,
in irrigated fields and under glasshouses, and the annual production
is about 750 000 t. Surveys were done to identify the viruses present
on Tunisian tomato crops in the regions of Cap-Bon, Sahel, and in the
south of the country. In total, 257 tomato samples were collected form
1997 to 1999, and serologically tested (ELISA).
The following viruses were detected: Cucumber mosaic, Tomato aspermy,
Potato Y, Tobacco etch, Pepper veinal mottle, Tomato mosaic, Tobacco
mosaic, Tobacco rattle, Alfalfa mosaic, Tomato spotted wilt (EPPO A2
quarantine pest), Tomato ringspot (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) [and
Potato X. Most viruses were found in all [surveyed regions.
Pepper veinal mottle potyvirus was only found in Cap-Bon and Sahel,
Potato X potexvirus was found only in Sahel and in the south, and
Tomato ringspot nepovirus was found only in Sahel. Tomato spotted wilt
[was detected ... in ... 1998 and 1999.
This study confirms the presence of Tomato spotted wilt [virus in
Tunisia, and constitutes the first report of Tomato ringspot [virusin
Tunisia.

[These data are out of date, but represent the status at the time
(1998/99). The delay in publication is unfortunate. In all likelihood
other viruses may be present in the current crops.
Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV) is primarily a pathogen of woody and
semi-woody plants, causing serious disease problems in apple, peach,
and cherry. The virus is transmitted by seed from infected plants and
also by pollen to seed or by pollen directly to pollinated plants.
Herbaceous weeds such as dandelion are important reservoir hosts.
