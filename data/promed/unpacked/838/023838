Republic of the Congo: Ebola Cases Now Number 108 with 88 Deaths
--------------------------------------------------
Nearly 90 people have been killed by Ebola virus in the remote
forests of the Republic of the Congo since the latest outbreak of the
disease hit this central African country just over a month ago.
Congo's Health Ministry said on Tue 4 Mar 2003 that 88 people out of
the 97 who have so far contracted the disease have died, and another
130 people suspected of contact with Ebola fever sufferers were under
surveillance. Ebola virus, which is passed on by infected body
fluids, kills between 50 and 90 percent of its victims through
massive internal bleeding, depending on the strain of the [virus].
The Ebola outbreak surfaced in the Kelle and Mbomo districts near
Congo's border with Gabon, some 700 km (440 miles) north of the
country's capital, Brazzaville. The World Health Organisation (WHO)
said on Tue 4 Mar 2003 it had recorded 86 deaths from the disease out
of 108 cases, of which 94 were in Kelle and the rest in Mbomo. "The
isolation wards and other preventive measures are working very well.
So again, we're seeing a slight decline in new cases but (remain)
certainly very much on the alert, watching for more," WHO spokeswoman
Christine McNab told reporters. "The new case count has somewhat
slowed...The WHO and global response unit are still there very much
in action, assisting with case detection and case management," she
said.
A government and parliamentary delegation was due to visit the
afflicted region, known as Cuvette-Ouest. Ebola experts from around
the world were also due to meet in Brazzaville on Tuesday to discuss
the outbreak. Scientists believe this outbreak was triggered by the
consumption of infected monkey meat. Bush meat is a staple among
remote forest communities and deemed a delicacy in many cities.
Primates started dying in large numbers towards the end of last year
and Congo launched an appeal to the international community on Mon 2
Mar 2003 to help protect central Africa's primates, especially
gorillas, who are being decimated by the disease.
Ebola killed 73 people in Congo and Gabon in an epidemic from October
2001 to February 2002. The disease takes its name from a river in
neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo where Ebola was discovered
in 1976. The worst outbreak was in that country in 1995 when more
than 250 people died.
