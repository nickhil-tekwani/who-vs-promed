With the diagnosis of a seventh case of blastomycosis in Duplin County, state
health officials urged people with persistent lower respiratory tract
symptoms to see their doctors.
Since 7 Dec 2001, 7 people in the Warsaw [NC area have been diagnosed with
the rare fungal infection. One, an 82-year-old man, died 21 Mar 2002 after a
month-long hospital stay. The others have recovered or continue to be
treated. They include 4 students at James Kenan High School in Warsaw [NC &
2 men in their 30s. [The most recent patient lived near the High School.
The rare fungal infection is caused by inhaling spores of a mold species
known as _Blastomyces dermatitidis_ that is commonly found in moist soil
throughout the Southeast.
Blastomycosis is not contagious. Symptoms can range from joint pain and skin
lesions to severe respiratory infections that only respond to treatments with
anti-fungal medication. Because symptoms vary, blastomycosis can be
misdiagnosed. Except in fairly well-developed stages of the infection, there
is no good diagnostic test.
"The best diagnostic test is an awareness, by both physicians and patients,
that the disease is around," said Dr. Newt MacCormack, acting head of N.C.
General Communicable Disease Control. Once correctly diagnosed, blastomycosis
usually can be treated with antifungal drugs.
In May 2001, a 45-year-old Duplin County man died of blastomycosis.
The previous confirmed incidence of blastomycosis in North Carolina was about
15 to 20 years ago in Halifax County, state Department of Health and Human
Services spokesman Bill Furney said.

[The fungal spores of _Blastomyces dermatitidis_ are found primarily in moist
soil. It produces granulomatous disease primarily in the skin and lung.
According to GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network) and
Chin's Control of Communicable Disease Manual:
Blastomycosis typically presents as a flu-like illness and is often diagnosed
as a pneumonia. Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, cough, chest pain,
weight loss, hemoptysis, shortness of breath and fatigue. Hematogenous,
lymphatic, or macrophage-borne dissemination occur. Pulmonary involvement
occurs in approximately 60 percent; 35 percent have involvement of both lung
and skin; and 19 percent have infection of skin only. The pulmonary focus
may progress to pleuritis, cavitation, or multiple nodules. Cavities favor
the upper lobes.
Dissemination may involve the genitourinary tract, skin, liver, CNS, spleen,
bone, lymph nodes, heart, adrenals, GI tract, and pancreas. In chronic
cutaneous blastomycosis the initial skin lesion presents as one or more
subcutaneous nodules which eventually ulcerate. Lesions are most common on
exposed skin such as the face, hands, wrists, and lower legs. If untreated,
elevated granulomatous lesions with advancing borders develop. Skeletal
involvement has been reported in 33 percent of patients.
The first case of North American blastomycosis was reported in 1894.
Although most cases have been reported from the United States and the St.
Lawrence region of Canada, additional cases have been documented in Latin
America, India, the Middle East (Israel and Saudia Arabia) and Africa
(including Zaire, Tanzania, South Africa). A total of 81 cases were reported
in Africa prior to 1987. Most cases are reported from Arkansas, Kentucky,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. Infection was
first reported in Colorado in 1998. Although the endemic area for
blastomycosis overlaps that of histoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found
further north, and not as far to the west as histoplasmosis.
The male/female ratio is 9/1. Over 60% of cases are in the age group 30 to
59 years. There is no clear seasonal variation in incidence. Rates of
approximately 0.5/100 000 were estimated for endemic states during the 1960's
and 1970's. 26 cases were confirmed during an elementary school outbreak
(Wisconsin) in 1984. 670 cases were reported from Wisconsin during 1986 to
1995; and 44 fatal cases reported for the entire United States in 1992. 72
cases were confirmed for northeastern Tennessee (Tri-cities region) during
1980 to 1995.
Disseminated disease has been described in captive California sea lions."
