[1] Haiti update

Haiti's cholera death toll has risen to 2761, and the water-borne
epidemic appears to be strengthening its grip on the quake-hit
Caribbean nation, official figures showed Wednesday, 29 Dec 2010. At
least 60 people were shown to have died on 4 of the previous 5 days
recorded by the health ministry, between 14 and 17 Dec 2010. This
level has not been seen since deaths peaked in mid-November 2010.

The number of infections has soared above 130 000 as Haiti's 1st
cholera outbreak in more than a century pours further misery on a poor
and politically dysfunctional country trying to recover from a
devastating January 2010 earthquake.

The cholera outbreak led to deadly anti-UN riots last month [November
2010] as some turned their anger on peacekeepers from Nepal accused of
bringing the disease into the country. Experts say the outbreak was
likely sparked by a human source from outside the region, and the UN
has promised a thorough investigation into the origin of the epidemic.

As cholera concerns grow, angry mobs in the deeply superstitious
nation have stoned or hacked to death at least 45 people, most of them
voodoo priests, accusing them of spreading the water-borne bacterial
infection.

[2] Cholera vaccine

PAHO, the regional office of WHO, announced Tuesday [21 Dec 2010] its
intention to launch, next April 2011, a pilot program of immunization
in Haiti, where there is a raging cholera epidemic.

WHO declared earlier in 2010: "In countries where cholera is endemic,
vaccination of the general population is not justified, and there
should be better targeted vaccination in areas and population groups
at high risk (preschool and school, pregnant women, and HIV-positive
persons), and [there should be] periodic vaccination campaigns."

A group of experts convened by PAHO/WHO at a meeting in Washington, DC
has recommended the use of current vaccines for a pilot project in
Haiti that would be extended progressively according to the
availability of vaccines. Currently, there are only 200 000 to 300 000
doses of vaccine against cholera available worldwide, said Dr. Ciro de
Quadros, executive vice president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute. PAHO
reported that it had recently located reserves to make more than a
million doses of Shanchol. But it will take several months before the
vaccine is ready, said Dr. Quadros. Shared information indicates that
one million doses may actually be available by late 2011.

Until recently, oral vaccines against cholera, easier administrable,
have been little used. Immunization generally requires 2 doses per
adult and 3 per child spaced at least a week apart. A recurring
reminder is necessary, the frequency of which varies with the age of
the patient. The vaccine provides protection a week later. The
effectiveness of this protection appears to be variable, but people
who are vaccinated and who then are infected again escape the severe
form of the disease.

Physicians who attended the meeting recommended contacting
manufacturers to see whether they can increase production and work
with groups that could help finance the purchase of these vaccines.

There are 3 brands of vaccine against cholera in the world: Dukoral
(USD 40 per dose) is manufactured in Sweden and approved by the WHO;
Shanchol (USD 6 per dose) is produced by Shantha Biotechnics in India;
and Morc VAX-VaBiotech is produced in Viet Nam.

Dukoral is approved by WHO. Of the other 2 vaccines, only Shanchol
awaits pre-qualification by WHO (this could be done in the 1st or 2nd
quarter of 2011). Shanchol was created by the International Vaccine
Institute in Seoul (South Korea) through a grant from the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation. The strain existing in Haiti has genetic
similarities with the strain found in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and
Pakistan, where epidemics kill each year over 100 000 people,
according to estimates by health professionals.

Dr. Jon K. Andrus, assistant director of PAHO, explains that, in
general, 75 percent of people infected with cholera do not show
symptoms but can still spread the disease to other people for a
maximum of 2 weeks after infection. At particularly high risk are
areas where good hygiene is lacking, as in many regions of Haiti, and
especially in the refugee camps.

Worldwide, there has never before been a mass vaccination for cholera
during an epidemic. This lack of experience and the considerable
logistical problems related to the preparation and storage of vaccine
and monitoring of patients (phase vaccination and reminders) make the
application of a large-scale vaccination complex and difficult. For
example, Dukoral must be mixed with effervescent granules provided and
dissolved in water, and must be stored between 2-8 C, and should not
be frozen. Once the effervescent granules are dissolved in water and
the vaccine suspension is added, the mixture should be drunk within 2
hours. Adding to the problems of vaccination are the detection of
cholera carriers without symptoms and the difficulties of access to
reach remote populations in the absence of roads.

Time is against the Haitian people. Since the beginning of the cholera
epidemic in the country on 19 Oct 2010, nearly 10 percent of the
Haitian population may have been affected by cholera. The last
official assessment of the Ministry of Health and Population (MSPP),
dated 17 Dec 2010, reported that 121 518 people were infected and 63
711 people were hospitalized for treatment.

If the vaccination of 50 percent of the population is enough to stop
the epidemic (but not to eradicate cholera), it is clear that the
vaccination of more than 4 million Haitians is not currently
realizable within the foreseeable future. The vaccine is probably not
a miracle solution, but it would save lives and gain time in order to
put into place across the country measures of sanitation, the only
hope to eradicate this disease.

Authorities are investigating the death of an unidentified person who
allegedly would have been the 1st fatality of the cholera outbreak
that began in mid-October 2010. According to statements by the
Minister of Health, Bautista Rojas, 105 people in the country have
contracted cholera.

According to the authorities, the person who allegedly died on 23 Dec
2010 as a result of the disease is a farmer aged 37, a resident of San
Juan de la Maguana, a city west of the country near the border with
Haiti.

"There has been an outbreak (of disease) in the provinces of San Juan
and Azua," Rojas said at a news conference.
