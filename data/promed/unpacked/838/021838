An outbreak of vomiting and diarrhoea following a conference in
Dunedin last week could have a Christchurch connection. Some people
who attended the conference, based at the University of Otago, last
week have since become violently ill and suspect the cause is the
norovirus, which last week struck dozens of people around Christchurch.
Conference organiser Mike Beattie said some people had come to the
Linux.conf.au event via Christchurch. The symptoms matched those
usually associated with norovirus, he said when contacted. "It
certainly looks that way, though I haven't heard anything officially."
Those who attended the software-users' conference had been discussing
the outbreak by email and had drawn links to Christchurch, he said.
The finger was pointed at restaurants in Christchurch for the outbreak there.
Health authorities say the highly infectious norovirus is the most
common cause of acute gastroenteritus, affecting an estimated 53 000
New Zealanders annually. A Ministry of Health website says that
although the illness is generally of short duration (less than 60
hours) outbreaks are common and often explosive.
Otago medical officer of health Dr John Holmes said yesterday there
had not been any confirmed cases. "We only hear about it if there are
large outbreaks because it is something that is probably around in
the community all the time. It is not always tested for," he said.
"It takes about a week for tests to confirm the virus."
The virus closed wards at Christchurch Hospital in 2004 and is
regarded as a particular concern for aged care institutions where
residents are relatively vulnerable. It is spread by direct contact
with an infected person, but food, water and contaminated surfaces
can also be vectors. Mr Beattie said most of those affected at the
conference did not begin exhibiting symptoms until after it ended and
had since left Dunedin, making it more difficult to determine the
scale or cause. Now, of course if they are heading home, they could
be taking it home as well.
An alternative explanation for the outbreak was food poisoning, but
there was no particular evidence for that either, Mr Beattie said.
About 430 people from around the world attended the conference.

[Norovirus infections now occur throughout the world and are an
inevitable accompaniment of winter in temperate climates, as their
colloquial description "winter vomiting disease" implies. In England
and Wales, for example, 2607 outbreaks were registered in 2005.
Schools and hospitals are especially vulnerable. Illness is
self-limiting are rarely has serious consequences. Consequently
ProMED-mail will no longer report individual outbreaks of norovirus
infection except in specific circumstances such as on board cruise
ships or where there is appearance of a new serotype of a new virus.
The above report is posted because of the implied connection with the
city of Christchurch, where there has been both a restaurant-related
outbreak of norovirus infection and an unrelated outbreak of
hepatitis A in a child-care centre. - Mod.CP]
