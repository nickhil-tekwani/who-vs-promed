97/113 First report of Grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma in Spain
Grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) has been
found for the first time in Spain, in the region of Ampudan (Cataluna),
near the French border.
The causal agent of flavescence doree was identified in October 1996 by
using PCR technique. Severely affected grapevines were found in several
foci covering approximately 23 ha. Measures have immediately been taken to
eradicate the disease by destroying affected plants and establishing
compulsory treatments against the vector _Scaphoideus titanus_.
