[Although the graphs in the above report clearly show that the Lassa fever virus transmission peak has passed, the 5 new confirmed cases and 2 new deaths indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission continues, and a few more cases might occur. Unfortunately, one health care worker was infected during this reporting period. This outbreak has been widespread, occurring in 22 states and 90 local government areas. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in this area.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus can be seen as follows:

For _M. erythroleucus_ and _Hylomycus pamfi_, see http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the source URL above.
