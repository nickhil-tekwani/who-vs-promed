Officials diagnosed a horse with eastern equine encephalitis [EEE]
last week in St. Martin Parish just outside Iberia Parish.
The horse in this case was euthanized, said Dr. Joey Landry of
Landry's Animal Clinic. The horse's owner reported it to Landry, as
is required, though not everyone does.
Landry drew blood and sent it to state officials. EEE, also know as
the "blind staggers" in horses, was confirmed 20 Oct [2006]. EEE is a
mosquito-borne, brain-swelling disease that usually results in the
animal's death. EEE is transmissible to humans.
"This horse was leaning on a fence, staggering around for a couple of
days. Then he was down on the ground having seizures," Dr. Landry
said Tuesday. "As bad off as he was, there was a slim-to-no chance of
saving him. So they decided to euthanize."
"Mosquitoes around the area are prevalent," he said, "so people
should be cautious and protect themselves from mosquito bites -- even
though the season is winding down as temperatures drop below 50 degrees."
EEE is a very serious, rare disease that is spread to horses and
humans by infected mosquitoes, according to Glenn Stokes, an expert
on mosquito-borne diseases and former Iberia Parish mosquito-spraying
contractor. It is among the most serious of a group of mosquito-borne
virus diseases that can affect the central nervous system and cause
severe complications and even death. Symptoms usually appear 4-10
days after the bite of an infected mosquito, Stokes said Tuesday.
"It's very serious," Stokes said of EEE. "This in an indication this
horse was not vaccinated. The EEE virus has a complex life cycle
involving birds and a specific type of mosquito called _Culiseta
melanura_ which lives in marshes and swamps. These mosquitoes feed
only on birds and around cypress trees, especially where acidic water
is located," Stokes said.
Assistant state veterinarian Dr. Martha Littlefield said there have
been several instances of EEE in St. Martin Parish this year.
"We are not over the season yet," Littlefield said Tuesday from her
Baton Rouge office. "Horses that get EEE generally die. But these
numbers do not reflect what is out there. A horse owner should keep
up with vaccinations. We have got quite a few [EEE cases] in
St.Martin. Rapides is not far behind. When people have a sick horse
they need to get the vet to see it.
Problem is, some owners just shoot their animals in the head and do
not tell authorities. They do so out of embarrassment or even because
they do not want a veterinarian's bill," Stokes said. "I would
suspect the prevalence [sic: incidence - Mod.TY] is higher than what
is being reported," Landry said. "There might be [an owner] whose
horse died last week and he just buried it without telling anyone."
Statewide, the West Nile/EEE case count in horses from the past 3 years are:
2003 - 36 West Nile cases, 27 EEE cases;
2004 - 59/14; and
2005 - 19/19.
"In [Louisiana in] 2006, there have been 25 cases of West Nile in
horses, 17 of EEE and 59 'suspect' cases," Littlefield said.

[EEE virus is endemic in the USA in swamps along the coast of the
Gulf of Mexico. The virus spills over from these swamp foci, where it
is maintained in a _Culiseta melanura_ mosquito-birds transmission
cycle, by "bridge vector" mosquitoes that transmit the virus to
people and horses. As the above article indicates, reliable
surveillance of equine cases is difficult, and cases are often
under-reported. Equine cases are regrettable because they are
preventable by vaccination. - Mod.TY]
