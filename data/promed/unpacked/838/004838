State officials warn of possible rabies in fox population
---------------------------------------------------------
In the wake of recent rabid fox incidents in Grant County (NM), state
officials are cautioning residents to take care when encountering
foxes. They also are reminding pet and livestock owners to vaccinate
their animals against the disease.

Tuesday [18 Mar 2008], a 19-year-old woman was attacked and bitten by
a fox near the Catwalk National Scenic Trail near Glenwood. The fox
ran away and could not be found. The woman said the fox had to be
kicked off her pant leg after it jumped up and bit her. She received
post-exposure rabies treatment as a precaution, according to
information from the Department of Game and Fish.

Monday [17 Mar 2008], a woman was walking her dog in Silver City when
a sick-looking fox approached the dog and hissed at it. The fox was
collected by a Game Department officer and tested positive for rabies
on Tuesday [18 Mar 2008], a department news release stated. The dog had been
vaccinated for rabies.

The fox was the 2nd rabid fox confirmed in Silver City in the past
month [March 2008]. There have been 4 foxes and one dog that have
tested positive for rabies in Grant County so far this year [2008]. In
2007, 8 foxes
and one bobcat tested positive in Catron County.

Although foxes are common in the Carlsbad area, none have tested
positive for rabies this year [2008], officials said Thursday [20 Mar
2008].

[Carlsbad Caverns are a big tourist attraction in the area. Visitors
should take care not to approach foxes around there. It is noteworthy
that this is only the 2nd report of animal rabies in New Mexico that
ProMED has seen since 1994 -- see 2006 ProMED ref. below. - Mod.JW
