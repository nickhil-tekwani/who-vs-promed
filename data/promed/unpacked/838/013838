Eggs spark fear of locust outbreak in northern Victoria
-------------------------------------------------------
A new generation of locusts has hatched on some farms in Victoria's
north in recent weeks, while a growing number of farmers are
discovering vast numbers of egg beds laid on their properties. The
massive number of eggs in particular has sparked increased fears
about the potential for a devastating locust outbreak in spring
[2010] before crops worth hundreds of millions of dollars are ready
for harvest.

Victorian Plague Locust commissioner Gordon Berg warned that locust
outbreaks in spring were likely. "We can't say for certain exactly
what's going to happen, but the likelihood is we're going to see
major outbreaks, certainly in some areas. And we've got to plan for
that worst-case scenario," he said.

"The sad reality is the magnitude of the outbreak could be such that,
with the best efforts of farmers, local councils for roadsides, DPI
[Department of Primary Industries] for public land, and all the rest
of it, there's still a pretty high likelihood we'll get some major
outbreaks that can't be controlled and damage occurring," he said.
"We're going to have to plan for the worst, simply because we don't
see this sort of situation very often."

West poised for worst grasshopper/locust outbreak in 30 years
-------------------------------------------------------------
The worst grasshopper outbreak in decades may envelop the western
states this summer [2010], scientists warn.

A dramatic rise in the number of grasshoppers was found during a
survey of the western states conducted last year [2009] by the US
Department of Agriculture (USDA). And while that may seem bad enough
on its own, it's really the grasshoppers' kids that are the threat.

If last summer's [2009] adults were successful during mating season,
then the worst grasshopper infestation in 30 years could strike
ranches and agricultural land in the Great Plains states between late
July and early August [2010], said Roeland Elliston of the USDA's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service who worked on the survey.

[There is no taxonomic difference between locusts and grasshoppers.
The term "locust" is used for short-horned species of the family
_Acrididae_ that change morphologically and behaviourally on crowding
to form swarms of adults or bands of immature stages.

The 1st story above refers to the Australian plague locust
(_Chortoicetes terminifera_). These locusts display the
characteristic behaviour of flying short distances, pausing, turning
back, and looking at the disturbance. Insects in the 2nd story may
include pasture eating species such as the clear-winged grasshopper
(_Camnula pellucida_), the spur-throated grasshopper (_Melanoplus
sanguinipes_), the bigheaded grasshopper (_Aulocara elliotti_), and
the white-whiskered grasshopper (_Ageneotettix deorum_).

The rate of locust egg development increases with temperature and
moisture. Complete development can occur in 14 days with a daily
maximum of 35 deg C (95 deg F), at 25 deg C (77 deg F) it can take a
month, and egg development ceases below about 15 deg C (59 deg F).
Swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding leading to an
increase in brain serotonin levels. Swarm sizes can vary but may
reach several hundred square kilometres with 40 to 80 million
individuals per square kilometre. For every million
locusts/grasshoppers, one ton of food is eaten daily. It has also
been reported that, at least in the US, grasshoppers may transmit a
vesicular stomatitis virus to livestock (see link below).

The best method of control is considered to be aerial spraying at the
nymph or hopper stage. However, it has been suggested that locust
problems may be exacerbated by broad-spectrum insecticides. These may
increase duration, frequency, and severity of outbreaks by
suppressing predators and parasites over large areas. Creating such
"enemy-free zones" may allow insect populations to resurge. Deep
harrowing or plowing are useful to destroy eggs and small nymphs.

In Australia and the southwest of northern America, outbreaks are
driven primarily by moisture, in the northern Rockies and the Dakotas
mainly by temperature. Above, major outbreaks of "eggs in the ground"
of different locust species and in different hemispheres are
reported. In both cases, however, the reason is likely to be warm and
relatively humid conditions in the previous (2009/2010) season. It is
hoped that cooler weather will follow and may have a suppressive
effect on egg hatching.
