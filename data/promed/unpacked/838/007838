The report [ProMED-mail 20111014.3091] appears to be suggesting that
the horses died from paralysis caused directly by _Ixodes holocyclus_,
the paralysis tick. If so, it is an unusual event; many mammals are
susceptible to tick paralysis, but it is highly unusual to have so
many cases in animals as large in body size as horses and more likely
in young foals.

The paralysis tick is harboured by bandicoots and other native
Australian mammalian wildlife. It feeds, then leaves the host to lay
eggs, but does not die, then reattaches to a host to feed again. As
ticks get larger and more mature, they tend to be more toxic.

The paralysis tick becomes very active during the period late August
through January but remains a significant threat most of the year
along the eastern Australian coastal areas of Queensland and New South
Wales; it causes a great deal of intoxication for domestic cats, dogs
and small livestock such as young goats.

Being the 1st spring/summer season after a very wet year and 2
successive mild winters, the tick might present extraordinary risk
because the climatic conditions have likely favoured both the tick and
its native Australian wildlife hosts.

If indeed the confirmed diagnosis is _I. holocyclus_ paralysis, I can
only surmise that that the horses in question must have been infested
with numerous relatively mature ticks. The pasture on which they were
located must have been very heavily infested.

[The blogs and tabloids report that this was an area being developed
for sprint horse racing. As such, having been recently moved to the
area, the horses were naive to local flora and fauna and clearly to
wild animals that may have been responsible for harboring the ticks.
They also report that there were ticks on the horses but make no
comment about how many. These same sources also indicate that a person
has contracted tick paralysis in the region, but I am unable to
confirm that report.

I wish to express my appreciation for Dr. Thomson's comment. I
appreciate input from someone in the region and who speaks to my own
doubts regarding ticks as the causative agent affecting so many of the
animals. - Mod.TG]
