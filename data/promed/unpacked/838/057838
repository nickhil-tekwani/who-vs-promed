I read the news on fish poisoning in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. I've got
some information from our staff, Dr. M. Matsui, on the subject. He is now
in Phnom Penh as a specialist on Pediatrics from JICA.
Dr. Matsui informed us that the victims of fish poisoning took fishes
including "kampot". 'Trey kampot' is the local name of the Family
_Tetraodontidae_, fresh water puffer, according to "Fishes of the Cambodian
Mekong" edited by FAO (1996) and supposed to have tetrodotoxin in the body.
In 1988, similar fish poisoning occurred in Thailand and was reported by
Laobhripatr S. et al. as referred below. These authors reported also in
1991 that the amount of toxin is greatly different individually and by the
seasons.
Reference:
Laobhripatr S, Limpakarnjanarat K, Sangwonloy O, Sudhasaneya S,
Anuchatvorakul B, Leelasitorn S, Saitanu K., 1990. Food poisoning due to
consumption of the freshwater puffer Tetraodon fangi
in Thailand. Toxicon 28(11):1372-5.
Abstract:
In October 1988, food poisoning due to the freshwater puffer _Tetraodon
fangi_ occurred. Six out of eight people who consumed spicy soup (Tom Yam)
of puffer developed clinical signs of tetrodotoxin intoxication. The
incubation period varied from 30 min to 3 hr and there were no deaths.
Puffers were collected one week after the occurrence of the food poisoning
and their content of toxin was determined. All organs of puffer were toxic
with skin having the highest toxicity followed by gonad, muscle, liver and
intestine.

My information source on the poisoning in Siem Reap in Cambodia is from the
officer of the Ministry of the Environment. They informed me that the
victims of the poisoning ate many kinds of fish at the time, and all of the
fish were alive in fresh condition. The most toxic species was "Trey
Kampot". In pp.225-227 of "Fish of the Cambodia Mekong (published by FAO,
UN), some species of "Trey Kampot" have toxin in their muscle and visceral
tissues. I have no more information on the matter.
It is suspected that the poisoning is occurred by the natural toxin rather
than organic phosphate agent. If the case was caused by organic phosphate
or other kinds of pesticides, it is strange that the fish was fresh when
the victims caught it. And more, the area is covered by flood now, so
chemicals will be diluted by a large amount of water.
We are trying to transport the fish to Japan and analyze the toxin.
