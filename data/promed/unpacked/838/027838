_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ infections are well documented in captive
orangutans that were taken as babies and made members of various
households, mainly in Indonesia. When the animals became unmanageable they
were turned over to rehabilitators to try and reintroduce them to the wild
but they almost always have positive CXR and PPD [tests and sputum
cultures for _M. tuberculosis_.
So then they have to spend a year plus trying to cure them of TB because,
as you say, if they were released the disease would surely wipe them out in
the wild.

The person who wrote [ProMED-mail the other day sounded a bit skeptical
about the idea that folks will kiss a non-human primate on the lips. The
following article by Stephanie Ostrowski at CDC illustrates the lengths
that some will go to show love to their monkey (or ape for that matter).
Dr. Ostrowski is in charge of quarantine at CDC.

Emerging Infectious Disease, vol 4 (#1), January/March 1998
B-virus from Pet Macaque Monkeys: An Emerging Threat in the United States?
Stephanie R. Ostrowski, Mira J. Leslie, Terri Parrott, Susan Abelt, and
Patrick E. Piercy . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,
Georgia, USA; Arizona Department of Health Services, Phoenix, Arizona, USA;

Zoological Gardens, Duluth, Minnesota, USA; and Illinois Department of
Public Health, Springfield, Illinois, USA
Abstract: Of primary concern when evaluating macaque bites are bacterial
and B-virus infections. B-virus infection is highly prevalent (80% to 90%)
in adult macaques and may cause a potentially fatal meningoencephalitis in
humans. We examined seven nonoccupational exposure incidents involving 24
persons and eight macaques. Six macaques were tested for herpes B; four
(67%) were seropositive. A common observation was that children were more
than three times as likely to be bitten than adults. The virus must be
assumed to be a potential health hazard in macaque bite wounds; this risk
makes macaques unsuitable as pets.
[extracted paragraphs
Most owners form an emotional bond with infant primates. This bond is
probably strengthened by the neonatal monkey's physical and behavioral
resemblance to a human infant. Although physically and emotionally
dependent on their mothers (or human substitutes) for up to 2 years of age,
most macaques exhibit unpredictable behavior as they mature. Males tend to
become aggressive, and both male and female macaques bite to defend
themselves and to establish dominance. Dominance within the social
hierarchy of macaques is established by aggression toward other monkeys,
generally the younger and smaller members of the group. Both veterinary
specialists and breeders of nonhuman primates agree that as a rule, all
these animals bite. Biting incidents eventually bring the animals to the
attention of animal control authorities. Most state health departments can
require that any biting nondomestic animal be euthanized and the brain be
submitted for rabies testing.

Owners of pet macaques are often reluctant to report bite injuries from
their pets, even to their medical care providers, and may fail to
appreciate that the premonitory headache and flu-like symptoms (which may
lead them to seek medical attention) could be associated with healed, often
minor, bite wounds dating back more than a month. The Southwest Foundation
for Biomedical Research, which is the designated National Institutes of
Health B-virus resource laboratory, reports processing 2000 to 3000 human
diagnostic specimens per year between 1990 and 1994, or approximately 200
per month, most of which reflect occupational exposure.
