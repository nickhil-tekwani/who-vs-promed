I'm a doctor at the southern end of Reunion Island. First of all, almost
everybody here, especially doctors, agree that the epidemic is
underestimated. According to an unofficial estimate by the "Conseil
Departemental de l'Ordre des Medecins", there would be almost 40 000 cases.
2 weeks ago, I was personally seeing about 5 new cases of chikungunya fever
each day, whereas there were officially about 100 new cases a week for the
entire island. The epidemic began 11 months ago and was focused in a
limited number of areas. During the last week, the epidemic has become
explosive and out of control, but I was on holiday, so I didn't notice it
personally. On Monday, when I'll be back to work, I'm afraid the number of
new cases will be much higher.
This disease is usually considered a benign one, and this is also my
clinical impression, even if some patients suffer arthralgias or stiffness
for months. But some unexpected complications have occurred here: several
cases of myelo-meningo-encephalitis have been reported, some in neonates,
with a strong suspicion of maternal-foetal transmission. Some wonder if we
will see the first-ever fatal case of chikungunya.
Fear, as fever, is now spreading in the population. Unfortunately,
communication is mainly controlled by local press and politicians. I would
personally prefer a recognised expert.

[Dr. Suzon's report is greatly appreciated by ProMED-mail. Chikungunya is
characterized by a brief febrile episode, persistent arthralgia in some
cases, but not by mortality. It is thus rather different from dengue
infection. The latter can develop into dengue haemorrhagic fever and shock
syndrome, which tends to be fatal. In the wake of the current widespread
epidemic of chikungunya, local health professionals worry that some
fatalities may result from complications without timely and effective
public health measures. - Mod.RY]
