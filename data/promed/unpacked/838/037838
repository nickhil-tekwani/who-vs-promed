Fireblight is killing North Korea's apple and pear trees. It spread from a previously affected region that borders China. Farmers are just waiting to get hit. The disease recently hit several orchards in major fruit-producing regions, and losses are enormous.

The disease forces farmers to uproot all the trees within a 100 meter [328 ft] radius of an infected tree, burning them and burying the remains in the ground. Otherwise they could lose their entire orchard. The blight could spread widely due to the monsoon rains, with currently wet and warm conditions.

Farming tools could spread it as well. Farmers must take care to thoroughly disinfect all their machinery and work tools. But there is a crisis because no disinfectants are available. Farmers appear to be helpless as they lose their trees to the disease.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the Rosaceae are affected, mainly the sub-family Maloideae (synonym Pomoideae), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and wild species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend, forming black hooks. Some fruits may show lesions. Cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers), and with plant material (including budwood).

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is fraught with risks (see also ProMED posts 20200629.7519826 and 20190320.6377319).

Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk. The pathogen is considered a major biosecurity risk in areas where it does not yet occur. A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin-resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.

In North Korea, an undiagnosed disease of fruit trees had been reported recently (ProMED post 20200814.7676492), but it is unclear whether this could already have referred to fireblight. The disease is known to occur also in neighbouring South Korea (ProMED post 20150616.3441184).
