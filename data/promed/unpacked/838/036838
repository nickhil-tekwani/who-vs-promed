Verticillium Wilt Incited by _Verticillium dahliae_ in Eggplant Grafted on
_Solanum torvum_ in Italy.

Eggplant cultivars grafted on rootstocks resistant to root-knot nematodes
(_Meloidogyne_ spp.) are increasingly grown in Italy to reduce nematode
infection.
During the winter of 2003-2004, eggplants (cv Black Bell and Mirabell)
grafted on the nematode-resistant rootstock _Solanum torvum_ were observed
with symptoms of a wilt disease in several greenhouses in Sicily (southern
Italy). The vascular tissue in stems of affected plants appeared brown.
These plants were stunted and developed yellow leaves with brown or black
streaks in the vascular tissue.
The wilt appeared in several greenhouses at a very low incidence (0.01 to
0.05 percent). Later, during the fall of 2004, disease incidence was
approximately 10 times greater in the same greenhouses on new crops.
_Verticillium dahliae_ was consistently and readily isolated from
symptomatic vascular tissue of the rootstock (_S. torvum_) and the scion
(cv Black bell) when cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (1).
Healthy, 50-day-old plants of _S. torvum_ and eggplant (cv. Black Bell)
were separately inoculated by root dip with a conidial suspension (10
million CFU/ml) of 2 isolates of _V. dahliae_ obtained from the rootstock
and the scion of the infected grafted plants and with a known pathogenic
isolate of _V. dahliae_ from nongrafted eggplant. Noninoculated _S. torvum_
and eggplant served as control treatments. Plants (30 per treatment) were
grown in a glasshouse at temperatures ranging between 12 and 41 C (weekly
average 15 to 36 C) and relative humidity ranging between 36 and 99 percent
(weekly average 54 to 95 percent).
The 1st wilt symptoms and vascular discoloration in the roots, crowns, and
veins developed 26 and 21 days after inoculation on _S. torvum_ and
eggplant, respectively. 72 days after inoculation, 20, 26, and 27 percent
of _S. torvum_ plants and 97, 100, and 87 percent of the eggplants showed
symptoms caused by _V. dahliae_ isolates obtained from the scion of
diseased grafted plants, the rootstock of diseased grafted plants, and
nongrafted eggplants, respectively. Noninoculated plants remained healthy.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report in Italy of Verticillium wilt on
eggplant grafted on _S. torvum_ rootstocks under commercial conditions.
Use of eggplant grafted on the nematode-resistant rootstock of _S. torvum_
presents an interesting opportunity to control the root-knot nematode but
has to be carefully considered when dealing with soils severely infested by
_V. dahliae_.

[ Eggplant cultivars grafted on rootstocks resistant to root-knot nematodes
(_Meloidogyne_ spp.) are increasingly grown in Italy to reduce nematode
infection, but the interaction with nematodes and _V. dahliae_ has
apparently compromised the expected result of higher yield. Plant
pathologists have studied antifungal activity of Iranian Actinomycetes
isolates against a number of fungi including _Verticillium dahliae_.
Biological control of plant diseases has received worldwide attention in
recent years, mainly as a response to public concern about the use of
hazardous chemicals in the environment. Soil actinomycetes, particularly
Streptomyces spp., enhance soil fertility and have antagonistic activity
against a wide range of soil-borne plant pathogens. In search for soil
actinomycetes with activity against plant fungal-pathogens, 110 isolates
were screened from which 14 isolates were found active at least against one
of the tested fungi. _Streptomyces plicatus_ strain101, _Frankia_ sp.
strain 103 and _Streptomyces_ sp. strain 44 had the widest antifungal
spectra of activity. Antifungal genes from these strains may be proper
candidates for genetic engineering of plants for increased tolerance
against the tested cosmopolitan fungal pathogens.
My comments are rather limited for this piece. Interactions between root
knot nematodes and fungi are complex.
