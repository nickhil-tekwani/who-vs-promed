The Texas Department of Health has confirmed that plague was the cause
of death in a prairie dog population at Lake Meredith National
Recreation Area. Evidence of a prairie dog die-off was investigated at
Lake Meredith, about 30 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas on 19 Apr
2001, raising suspicions plague could be responsible.
Preliminary test results at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) Plague Laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado,
identified DNA from _Yersinia pestis_ in fleas collected from the
affected prairie dog town.
Plague is endemic to west Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the
disease affects rodent and rabbit populations in these areas almost
every year. Human plague is rare, averaging only 12 cases per year in
the USA. Texas has had only 4 human plague cases since 1980. No cases
of plague in humans have been reported at this time. Medical personnel
throughout the area have been advised to watch for plague symptoms.
Persons who have visited the park recently and have developed symptoms
should consult their physician.
Since the park is visited by people from outside of Texas, the medical
community in other states should seek information regarding a visit to
the Lake Meredith park if a patient presents with symptoms compatible
with plague.

[Prairie dogs are very sensitive to plague, as are domestic cats.
Stray cats in the area, or cats that visited the park, may also show
signs of the disease. Families having visited the park with their
feline pets need to be on the alert for swollen areas or swollen lymph
nodes nodes on their pets.
There are a number of excellent flea control products available
through veterinarians. Furthermore, pets should be examined by a
veterinarian for any swollen lymph nodes and early signs of the
disease ­ Mod.TG
