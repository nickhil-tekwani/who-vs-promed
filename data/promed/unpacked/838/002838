Epidemiologists estimate the malaria situation as extremel y dangerous
in Stavropol region (kray). Imported cases are a special concern because
from 1995 till 1997, 13 cases of imported malaria were registered, and
12 cases in 1998 alone.
Epidemic control service is undertaking both organization measures
(sessions of kray administration commissions) and methodical prophylaxis
measures including purchasing and distribution of antimalaria drugs.

[Stavropol is situated halfway between the Black & Caspian Seas, about 180km
north of the Georgian border. Since there has been malaria transmission in
1999 as far north as Ryazan, near Moscow (see ref. above), the public health
authorities are right to be concerned. - Mod.JW]
