INFECTIOUS BOVINE RHINOTRACHEITIS/INFECTIOUS PUSTULAR VULVOVAGINITIS
IN SWITZERLAND

(Date of previous reported outbreak: 2001).

Information received on 16 Sep 2002 from Prof. U. Kihm, Director of
the Federal Veterinary Office, Bern:

Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.

Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 11
September 2002.

Estimated date of first infection: 27 Jul 2002.

Affected population: one dairy farm in canton of Grisons (in the
eastern part of the country). This is the herd that was destroyed
because of cases of anaplasmosis (see Disease Information, 15 [36],
169, dated 6 Sep 2002, and 15 [37], 177, dated 13 Sep 2002). In
addition, one cow that was sold from the affected farm to another
farm in Grisons tested positive for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis
(IBR) by ELISA.

Control measures:
- All animals of the affected farm have been destroyed. The positive
cow on the contact farm has also been destroyed.
- This contact farm is under movement restriction until the rest of
the animals have been tested for IBR.
- Other contact farms are under movement restriction until
serological testing has been completed.

[IBR is an OIE List B disease commonly evidenced either clinically or
serologically in most European and many American countries. - Mod.PC]

[Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis
(IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1), is a disease of domestic
and wild cattle. The virus is distributed world-wide; Switzerland is one of
the few countries which have eradicated IBR/IPV and which prohibit the use
of vaccination against the disease. (Others are Denmark, Finland and Sweden;
Norway has also reported freedom of IBR/IPV). The current emergency
notification of Switzerland should be seen in light of the reemergence of an
eradicated cattle disease, absent since 1996.

The disease is characterised by clinical signs of the upper respiratory
tract, such as a (muco)purulent nasal discharge, and by conjunctivitis.
Signs of general illness are fever, depression, inappetance, abortions and
reduced milk yield. The virus can also infect the genital tract and cause
pustular vulvovaginitis and balanoposthitis. Mortality is low. Many
infections run a subclinical course. Secondary bacterial infections can lead
to more severe respiratory disease. - Mod.AS]
