Dr Andrew Wakefield's claim there was a link between the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine and autism led to widespread panic among parents. Young people who missed out on vaccinations because of the MMR scare have been urged to get immunised after an outbreak of measles among university students.

There have been 8 confirmed cases of the disease in the Scottish capital [Edinburgh] in the past 2 weeks, with the majority being students at the University of Edinburgh. A pupil at James Gillespie's High School has also been confirmed as having the virus.

Anyone not immunised is being urged by health bosses to act now to prevent further spread of the virus. Those in their late teens and early twenties may be at risk...

Taking a lead towards achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) South East Asia Region's 'Measles Elimination Goal by 2020', Karnataka has now made it mandatory for every suspected case of measles and rubella to be confirmed through a blood test.

So far, a system of conducting detailed investigations, including blood tests, was being followed only when 5 or more cases were reported from a particular area. With this transition from outbreak-based surveillance to case-based surveillance, Karnataka is the 1st state in the country to investigate every suspected case of measles and rubella. In 2006, Karnataka was the 2nd state after Kerala to start an outbreak-based surveillance, which is yet to be followed by all states. According to officials from the WHO Country Office for India, Puducherry will follow Karnataka in adopting the case-based surveillance system from next month [November 2016].

In 2015, the highest number of cases were reported from Uttar Pradesh, with 365 outbreaks of measles and 25 outbreaks of rubella. So far this year [2016], Uttar Pradesh has recorded 117 measles outbreaks and 45 rubella outbreaks. Bihar has recorded the 2nd highest number of outbreaks of measles with 171 outbreaks in 2015, and 60 outbreaks so far this year.

Lokesh Alahari, WHO's Sub-Regional Team Leader for Karnataka, told The Hindu that the new method of surveillance would help officials curb the spread of measles and rubella in a community and prevent outbreaks. "Karnataka has a very good healthcare system compared to other states," he said.

A senior official from the Health Department's Immunisation Division said that government doctors and laboratory technicians, apart from representatives from government medical colleges, had been trained to report every suspected case of measles and rubella, and collect blood samples and send them to the National Institute of Virology, Bengaluru, where they would be tested for free. A blood test is a must if a patient, irrespective of age, reports with symptoms of fever and maculopapular rash with cough or running nose or redness of eyes. Even auxiliary nurse midwives, accredited social health activists and anganwadi [government sponsored child-care and mother-care centers] or school teachers may report suspected measles cases, the official said.

While vaccination for measles is included under the universal immunisation programme and is given at 9-12 months and 16-24 months, there has been no vaccination for rubella. "We will now include rubella vaccination along with measles in the immunisation programme. Also, we will soon start a mass vaccination campaign on the lines of the pulse polio immunisation in the state," the official said. At least 95 per cent of children need to be vaccinated with both doses if the transmission of measles and rubella had to be checked, he added.

[The 2012 to 2020 Global Measles & Rubella Strategic Plan (http://www.measlesrubellainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Measles-Rubella-Strategic-Plan.pdf) describes 5 core components of a comprehensive measles and rubella elimination strategy:
- achieve and maintain high levels of population immunity by providing high vaccination coverage with 2 doses of measles and rubella containing vaccines;
- monitor diseases using effective surveillance and evaluate programmatic efforts to ensure progress;
- develop and maintain outbreak preparedness, respond rapidly to outbreaks, and manage cases;
- communicate and engage to build public confidence and demand for immunization;
- perform the research and development needed to support cost-effective operations and improve vaccination and diagnostic tools.

A measles outbreak that sickened 383 people 2 years ago [2014] originated in the Philippines, a new report says [citation: Gasta√±aduy PA, Budd J, Fisher N, et al. A measles outbreak in an underimmunized Amish community in Ohio. N Engl J Med. 2016; 375(14): 1343-54; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602295].

Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications. Although the disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, it remains common in large parts of the world. Americans traveling to such places can bring it back with them, especially if they live in unvaccinated communities, and this is exactly what happened in 2014, a new analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine finds.

According to the report, 2 members of an Amish sect returned to Ohio after performing typhoon relief work in the Philippines, unknowingly bringing the disease with them. The Amish (a Christian sect who do not prohibit vaccinations, but whose cultural beliefs are associated with much lower vaccination rates than among non-Amish people in the same areas) came down with measles, the report says.

During 2014, the World Health Organization reported that there were 21 403 confirmed cases of measles and 110 measles-associated deaths in the Philippines. The 2 relief workers, both young men, returned to Knox County, Ohio from the Philippines on 21 Mar [2016] and began experiencing symptoms the next day. 2 additional relief workers, who also became ill, followed, the report says. Their illness was initially thought to be dengue fever, but after 12 additional Amish people became ill, the disease was correctly identified as measles.

During the outbreak, 573 suspected cases of measles were investigated in the community, which has an estimated population of 32 630, and is one of the largest in the US. Of that number, 190 people were ruled out, which resulted in 383 confirmed cases, the study says.

Despite considerable societal interaction among Amish and non-Amish persons in Ohio, the spread of the disease was limited almost exclusively to the Amish, which indicates that high baseline vaccination coverage in the general community was probably effective against further spread of measles, the report notes.

The study's authors suggest these takeaway points when dealing with measles outbreaks:
- the disease was allowed to spread until it was finally identified, which shows, health care providers should maintain a high awareness of measles when returning unvaccinated travelers present with a fever and rash;
- when the measles vaccine is administered within 72 hours after exposure, it may prevent or modify illness. The finding that measles developed in 16 persons who had received a vaccination near the time of exposure underscores the need to administer the vaccine as early as possible during outbreaks;
- outreach attempts to convince groups that have lower rates of vaccination, but are not strictly opposed to it, such as the Amish, should continue, as the single best means of containment is the maintenance of high initial levels of measles immunity in the population.

[In 2000, the United States declared it had eliminated [measles]: enough people were immunized that outbreaks were uncommon, and deaths from measles were scarcely heard of. But in the 1st half of 2014 alone, there were 288 cases. And nearly all of them, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [reported], stemmed from Americans traveling abroad and returning with the disease.

"Of 288 cases, 280 (97 per cent) were associated with importations from at least 18 countries," they wrote. Many of these travelers were coming back from the Philippines, which had been dealing with a massive outbreak since fall 2013.

"What we've seen -- since the epidemic of measles was interrupted in 2000 -- is that we are continually getting measles coming in from overseas," says Jane Seward, deputy director of the viral diseases division at the CDC. "More often than not, it's US residents who go overseas for a trip -- to say, Europe, where they don't think they need to be vaccinated. They bring measles back."

(Excerpted and edited from http://www.vox.com/2015/1/29/7929791/measles-outbreak-2014.)

The paper cited above concludes: The key epidemiologic features of a measles outbreak in the Amish community in Ohio were transmission primarily within households, the small proportion of Amish people affected, and the large number of people in the Amish community who sought vaccination. As a result of targeted containment efforts, and high baseline coverage in the general community, there was limited spread beyond the Amish community.
