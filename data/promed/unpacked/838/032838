Having disappeared from the country 3 years ago, cholera has returned to
Pernambuco. Yesterday, 1 Feb 2005, the State Secretary of Health confirmed
a report of a case from the municipality of Sao Bento do Una, in a rural
region.
This locality had detected approximately 120 cases of diarrhea in Jan 2005.
After investigation of the patients, the health authorities documented that
a 4-year-old child had the disease [cholera]. The child was treated in
Recife and has recovered.
Pernambuco is the only State in Brazil where the disease persists. In 2004,
21 cases of cholera were reported in the same city, which is situated 218
kilometers from Recife and where both the sewers and water supply are
precarious.
The case has mobilized the Secretariat of Health and scientists from the
Osvaldo Cruz Foundation, because of certainty that the cholera bacterium
was not imported from another State or from another country.

Paratyphoid A outbreak with lethal case
------------------------------------------------------
In the Ust-Avam settlement in the Tajmyrskiy autonomous region, a
6-month-old child has died from paratyphoid fever.
In total, 18 cases of acute intestinal infections have been reported in
this settlement, including 11 children under 14 years old. Victims were
hospitalized in the Dudinka and Norilsk infectious diseases hospitals.
By serologic study, the diagnosis of paratyphoid A fever has also been
confirmed in the mother of the deceased child and in 7 other persons.
The epidemiological investigation established that the source of the
infection in the settlement was a patient with the asymptomatic form of the
disease. Epidemiologists did not exclude contamination of substandard
potable water. Inhabitants of the settlement obtain their water in the
river and lake without disinfection.
[The Tajmyrskiy autonomous region is the most northern region of
Russia. It is located above the Arctic Circle north of the Krasnoyarsk
region. - Corr.NP]

[3] Cholera - Uganda, Kenya

A person from Busubo village, Buhehe sub-county, has died of cholera she
contracted after attending burial of a cholera victim in Matausi village.
Speaking to a delegation from Uganda led by the Busia RDC, Mr George
Bageya, the Busia Kenya district commissioner, Mr Raphael Letimalo, said
there was an outbreak which started in Matausi 5 kilometers from Busia
Kenya where 2 people died. It later spread to Fuyula, the Kenyan Vice
President, Mr Moody Awori's home area, where 6 people died. To control the
spread of the epidemic, people from the affected places have been asked not
to travel.
A camp has been established at Mulwanda Market where suspected cholera
victims are being treated. Letimalo said the outbreak was a result of water
disconnection at Matausi that forced people to drink contaminated water
from streams.
The District Director Health Services, Dr Oundo Bwire, said he had alerted
the epidemic surveillance department in Entebbe about the outbreak. "I
have written to the epidemic Surveillance department about the outbreak of
cholera in the area. Soon they will be here to [evaluate] the situation",
he said.

immediately banned feasting at funerals and food hawking in the whole district.
