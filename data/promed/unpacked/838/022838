[1] Cholera - Ghana (Accra)

The death toll from cholera outbreak in Ghana's capital, Accra, has risen from 5 to 15 out of over 850 reported cases, health officials said Wednesday, 30 Jul 2014. Between June and July 2014, the Greater Accra region has recorded a total of 878 cholera cases, with the Accra Metropolis alone accounting for 604 of the cases and 8 deaths.

Poor sanitation in the metropolis has been cited as the main cause of the outbreak of the disease, thereby bringing pressure on infrastructure at various hospitals and clinics. Health experts had predicted the incidence of the disease and death toll could escalate, primarily with the onset of the rains coupled with poor environmental hygiene and inadequate safe water.

But senior health officials say the disease is not yet at its peak but have cautioned the public to take precautionary measures to avoid contamination, including eating cooked food while it was still hot, boiling drinking water and washing hands with soap before eating. They have also advised the public to report suspected cholera cases to the nearest health facilities since early reporting is very critical to treating the disease.

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Accra)
Date: Fri 1 Aug 2014

Authorities at the La General Hospital in Accra have been forced to turn the out-patient department (OPD) of the hospital into a cholera bay as a result of soaring numbers in recorded cases. TV3 gathers that as of Friday, 1 Aug 2014, 15 new cases of the bacterial disease was recorded at the hospital.

Speaking to our correspondent on Friday, Dr Samuel Asamoah, the hospital's Physician Assistant, said the major challenge facing the hospital is space. "We don't have anywhere to send the patients back," he noted, however. He observed that most of the patients brought to the hospital are from the La municipality, generating worry in the face of an epidemic.

[3] Cholera - Nigeria (Borno State)

A total of 8 people have reportedly died following a cholera outbreak at an internally displaced persons (IDPs) camp located at Biu in Borno State. The Red Cross reported that the epidemic had affected over 100 people out of the 10 000 IDPs at the camp.

A Red Cross official, under the condition of anonymity, told journalists that about 30 persons out of the initial 100 affected by the disease have so far fully recovered. He said others are gradually recovering and responding to treatment being offered by the joint team of the Borno state health workers, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and Red Cross Society of Nigeria at the camp.

According to the official, the situation at the camp was made worse with Borno State not making available inadequate drugs and vaccination on the camp, but the medical team and other auxiliary team at the camp have been doing their best in controlling and treating the cholera outbreak.

Ministry of Health officials declined to comment. Borno State Commissioner of Health, Dr Salma Anas Kolo, could not be reached for comment.

[5] Cholera - Congo DR (South Kivu Province)

The Provincial Inspectorate of Health of South Kivu has recorded, in 6 months, approximately 1000 cases of cholera, including 6 deaths, in the area of health of Uvira. The communications official, Henry Ramazani, has delivered these statistics, Tuesday, 22 Jul 2014, during the launch of investigations for the identification of problems of persistence of this disease in the city of Uvira.

Henry Ramazani regrets that cholera has become a problem of society despite the various forms of struggles against this disease. It invites the people of Uvira to use chlorinated water to avoid waterborne diseases, including cholera. "Some people refuse to use the chlorine or other water detoxifying products and do not respect the hygienic rules," regrets Henry Ramazani. He also accused other households of having installed their latrines a few meters from the lake Tanganyika, where the population obtains its water. "The waste from these latrines fall into the lake," says the communications official of the Provincial Inspectorate of Health of South Kivu.

[6] Diarrhea - Viet Nam (Ho Chi Minh City)
Date: Wed 23 Jul 2014

An outbreak of acute diarrhea in Ho Chi Minh City's [HCMC] Binh Chanh District has killed a 10-month-old infant. A total of 7 babies are infected with the disease in Le Minh Xuan Commune in Binh Chanh District, including the 10-month-old infant who died. The Department of Health in HCMC said the outbreak of acute diarrhea has appeared due to poor environmental sanitation and hygiene conditions.

Medical experts fretted as residents in the commune live in stagnant ponds. For years, residents go for open defecation and they breed fish with their excrement in a pond. They also use contaminated pond water for washing and bathing.

Truong Van Hanh, deputy chairman of People's Committee in Binh Chanh District, said that local residents live temporarily here as the commune is zoned for house planning area, however, it is suspended for years. The district authority has encouraged people to stop open defecations to eliminate disease over ponds but people don't follow the warning; accordingly it is heavily contaminated, and water-related diseases breaks out.

Moreover, water supplier Le Minh Xuan is far from the area; consequently, the price of water increases many times. Many low-income people resort to using contaminated water for washing and bathing; hence, outbreaks of disease are unavoidable, and children are the 1st victims.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2014 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally than through a orogastric tube (for examples, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.
