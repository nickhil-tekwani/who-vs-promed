_Bartonella bacilliformis_ in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, Cusco, Peru,
1998.
Isolation and Characterization by PCR and [indirect immunofluorescence (IIF).

INTRODUCTION
_Bartonella bacilliformis_ is the etiologic agent of Carrion's Disease
(Oroya Fever and Verruga Peruana). The disease is endemic to the South
American Andes, being encountered from Ecuador and Colombia in the North
and as far South as the 12th parallel in Peru. The endemic zone is also
delineated by altitude, ranging between 500 to 3,400 meters above sea level
(masl), coinciding with the habitat of some Lutzomyia (Diptera:
Psychodidae) sandflies. In May, 1998 a large outbreak of the disease was
encountered for the first time in the Department of Cusco. Herein we
provide bacteriological confirmation of clinical diagnoses made on 6
patients living in Urubamba (2,700 masl) and Calca (2,800 masl), two towns
in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, some 50 km from the city of Cusco.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation
Blood samples, collected from patients into commercial evacuated blood
collectors containing EDTA anticoagulant, were inoculated onto a potato
agar containing 10% whole sheep blood. Blood culture flasks were then
incubated at room temperature (21-30 C) for up to 21 days. Any colonies
which appeared on these media, and which had a 'bartonella-like'
appearance, were subjected to Gram staining and physiological and
biochemical testing.
Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF)
Presumptive _Bartonella_ colonies were harvested from agar plates and
resuspended in sterile saline solution for use as antigen in a standard IIF
assay. Their identity as _B. bacilliformis_ was confirmed using an
anti-_B. bacilliformis_ rabbit polyclonal antibody, then a
fluorescein-labelled goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugate. Organisms which
bound the antibody were detected by epifluorescent microscopy.
PCR
Crude DNA extracts were prepared from presumptive colonies by resuspending
them in sterile distilled water, then boiling these suspensions for 10
minutes in a water bath. These extracts were then used as templates in a
previously described PCR incorporating broad-spectrum primers allowing
amplification of the 16S/23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ITS). Although
this assay is not specific for _B. bacilliformis_, the uncharacteristically
large size of the _B. bacilliformis_ ITS allows presumptive identification
of the species. The success of PCRs was gauged by UV-illumination of
ethidium bromide-strained agarose gels in which amplification products had
been electrophoretically resolved.
RESULTS
Small (0.1-0.15 cm) white, shiny, convex, colonies, appeared on culture
plates after between 7 to 14 days incubation. These organisms were
characterised as being Gram negative, oxidase negative coccobacilli,
supporting their identity as _Bartonella_ spp. Microscopic examination of
bacterial suspensions demonstrated the organisms to possess a
characteristic jerky twisting flagellate movement. Nutrient agar plates
inoculated with the same blood samples which yielded colonies on blood agar
plates remained sterile.
IIF examination of bacteria recovered from blood agar plates confirmed them
to react strongly with anti-_B. bacilliformis_-polyvalent antibody.
PCRs incorporating crude DNA extracts from cultured bacteria yielded a
single-sized amplification product of about 1,000 base pairs. The size of
these products was indistinguishable from that obtained from a _B.
bacilliformis_ positive control. Negative control reactions failed to
yield any detectable amplification products.
CONCLUSION
A clinical diagnosis of bartonellosis was microbiologically confirmed in 6
patients from Cusco. The utility of the potato-blood agar for the recovery
of clinical _B. bacilliformis_ isolates was demonstrated. Although
morphological/physiological analysis of the isolates confirmed them to be
_Bartonella_ spp., precise speciation was not possible. Observation of
motility is a useful test to apply as only two _Bartonella_ species (_B.
bacilliformis_ and _B. clarridgeae_) possess flagella. However, other
characterisation methods were required to confirm the isolates as _B.
bacilliformis_. Both immunological and PCR-based approaches were able to
achieve this objective. Rabbit polyvalent anti-_B. bacilliformis_ antibody
has been previously shown to be species specific, and the ITS sizes of
other _Bartonella_ species are known to be markedly larger than that of _B.
bacilliformis_. The procedures used for the first time in this study are
presently being refined and modified for more extended future use in
diagnosis and epidemiology of this important disease. Ongoing analysis of
the heterogeneity of _B. bacilliformis_ isolates from different regions of
Peru should permit the design of specific PCRs capable of detecting all
strains of the species and no other DNA.
