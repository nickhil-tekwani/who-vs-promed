Montana recorded its 1st confirmed case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in more than 50 years in a beef herd in Blaine County, the state veterinarian confirmed. Meat inspectors discovered a single cow with bovine TB at a processing plant in Minnesota. It was traced back to the Blaine County herd, Dr. Marty Zaluski, Montana Department of Livestock veterinarian, told the Center Square.

Bovine tuberculosis is a now-rare disease of cattle which was extensive in the 1920s and '30s, but after an expensive and diligent eradication campaign, few cases are found in the United States, he said. "It's more of a public health issue for dairy. It's why pasteurization is required on most milk," Gilles Stockton, president of the Montana Cattlemen's Association, told the Center Square.

A single cow was found with lesions during a post-mortem inspection at a Minnesota slaughter plant, he said. All cattle or their carcasses are inspected before going into the food supply. From the identification tags on the animal, it was traced back to the Blaine County herd, Zaluski said. "We conducted a whole herd test on the herd in Montana and then we found 3 additional animals confirmed with bovine tuberculosis in that herd," Zaluski said.

The herd was categorized as affected and has been quarantined. Two options exist for the herd. The 1st is depopulation. The herd would be sent to slaughter and inspected. The owner will get a salvage value for the herd. The other option is to keep the animals quarantined for probably a year while they determine if any of the remaining herd members were infected. Those remaining in the clear [testing negative] can be declared tuberculosis negative, he said. It's disruptive for this Blaine County family to have cattle with tuberculosis and Zaluski said he empathizes with that situation.

Often the Department of Livestock and the USDA never know how a cow gets infected. The USDA has performed genome sequencing on the affected animal. The closest relative to the bovine tuberculosis in it was isolated in central Mexico in 2006. But they aren't aware of any links to Mexican cattle for this animal, he said. If the herd owner didn't purchase the animal from neighboring cattle in adjacent herds, he probably bought a cow having had contact with Mexican cattle.

["Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals. Once the most prevalent infectious disease of cattle and swine in the United States, bovine TB caused more losses among US farm animals in the early part of the 20th century than all other infectious diseases combined."

"Cattle and bison usually show no clinical signs to TB unless the disease has affected multiple organ systems and is very advanced, which is quite rare. Typically, infected cattle are asymptomatic and are only detected by skin testing or at slaughter during our national slaughter surveillance program.

"TB is spread mostly either by inhalation from nose-to-nose contact between animals or by ingesting contaminated feed or water. Herds are usually affected by one of 2 ways: either by purchasing infected animals or being exposed to infected cattle or wildlife. A 3rd way of possible transmission may be human-to-animal transmission, but regulatory officials are unable to quantify this risk at this time.

"The prevalence of TB in cattle, bison, and captive cervids is extremely low in the US, occurring roughly 7 times per 1 million cattle herds on an annual basis. Producers can reduce their risk of getting the disease by adding only test negative livestock from known negative herds to their own herds. When TB is found in a herd, it is eliminated by either depopulating the affected herds or by testing and then removing reactor animals from affected herds."

"The primary source of TB surveillance is carcass inspection at all federal- and state-inspected slaughter establishments. The other main sources of TB detection are by testing animals during traces, pre-movement tests, and, finally, for accredited free herd status. Live animal testing is performed by using a screening test followed by a confirmatory test if the 1st test is positive. Contact your local accredited veterinarian for more specific information."

"In 1917, the US Bureau of Animal Industry began the national TB eradication program due to human and livestock concerns regarding bovine TB. It started out as strictly an eradication program for cattle but eventually included both bison and cervids. Benefits from the program are estimated at 12x the cost of the program due to decreased slaughter condemnations and decreased human infection. Although the program has been extremely successful in reducing livestock infection, there is still work left to do" (Source: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/cattle-disease-information/national-tuberculosis-eradication-program).

The decrease in human infections and in animal infections has been a great improvement for the health of all. Perhaps this was one of the 1st "One Health" programs, as it was started in 1917.

"Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious and communicable granulomatous disease caused by the acid-fast bacilli bacteria of _Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_). It is commonly a chronic, debilitating disease, but occasionally may assume an acute, rapidly progressive course. _M. bovis_ is a widespread zoonosis, global in magnitude, and affecting nearly all species of vertebrates (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, bison, buffalo, and camelids.) The disease is spread by direct contact, inhalation of infected droplets expelled from infected lungs, and ingestion of contaminated feed or milk. In most countries, TB is a notifiable disease. Overall, TB has an important worldwide impact on animal industries and human health. Control measures are based on prevention and eradication. Surveillance is a key element for the management of preventions and control programs.

"Surveillance for TB serves the purpose of enabling Veterinary Services to obtain an accurate picture of the scope of the disease in the US livestock populations; in the event of a disease outbreak, the course TB follows in livestock and wildlife populations for a given area over time; and permits timely intervention if the trend observed deviates from what is expected" (Source: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/tuberculosis/downloads/bovine-tb.pdf). - Mod.TG
