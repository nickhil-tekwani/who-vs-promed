Light leaf spot leaves its mark in the south
--------------------------------------------
Oilseed rape light leaf spot varietal resistance is a critical factor
for growers to consider this 2010 season. Trials suggest that
fungicides only give up to 50 percent control of the disease, which
in the 2009 season was found just about everywhere.

The black blotches on oilseed rape stubbles are next year's inoculum,
says Peter Gladders of ADAS [Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service]. The only oilseed rape disease which showed an increase in
prevalence compared with the previous season, light leaf spot has
continued its spread to areas previously unaffected, he adds. "2010
was the 2nd highest year on record for light leaf spot, with 71
percent of crops affected," he reports. "It's the 5th year in
succession that it has increased."

Although the north was the region with the highest incidence, with
90.5 percent of crops affected, the disease is now causing serious
problems further south for two reasons, believes Dr Gladders. "The
fungicides aren't doing an adequate job, and the varieties being
grown don't have good resistance." That's in marked contrast to the
varieties used in the north of England and Scotland. Trials suggest
that varietal resistance is the key to controlling light leaf spot.

"The situation is serious. There was a great deal of light leaf spot
in crops in 2010 -- it has overtaken phoma as the number one disease.
Warning bells should be ringing as levels have been rising steadily.
It can reduce yields by 1.5 t/ha."

[Light leaf spot (LLS) of _Brassica_ species is caused by the fungus
_Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. In oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_), leaves
become infected soon after sowing, but remain symptomless until
lesions appear on older leaves. Developing pods are often infected,
leading to premature ripening of seed and pod shatter. LLS is
polycyclic and survives the summer on crop debris, volunteer oilseed
rape, and vegetable brassicas. Disease management includes varieties
with decreased levels of susceptibility, disease monitoring, and
timely fungicide applications.

In the UK, LLS has caused considerable yield losses of oilseed rape
in the past estimated at GBP 40 million (USD 61.9 million) per year.
Its previously highest level was recorded during an epidemic in 1995
(ProMED-mail post 20090226.0795).

Phoma leaf spot and stem canker (blackleg) is caused by the fungus
_Leptosphaeria maculans_. It is generally considered the most serious
disease of oilseed rape with a possible yield loss of 50 percent or
more, but in the UK now appears to have been overtaken by LLS.
