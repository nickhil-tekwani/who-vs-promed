The agricultural and veterinary authorities of Mashdalala, east of the Wilaya (state) of Bouira, have sent an appeal to residents to avoid purchase and consumption of milk and any related products from unknown sources offered for sale along roads and in some shops to avoid infection with brucellosis. More than 10 confirmed cases of infection have been recorded in the population.

The announcement, published by the authorities 3 days ago [18 Apr 2021], stated that several confirmed cases of brucellosis in the municipalities of Meshdala, Al-Shorfa, Sahrij, and Aghbalo have been reported.

[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the USA and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries.

Each species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.

Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _Brucella melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis, with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications. - Mod.LL
