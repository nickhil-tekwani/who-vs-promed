Bird flu danger
----------------
The [Indian] government may have pronounced India to be free from the bird
flu virus, but the threat of its reappearance is far from over. The
declaration is indeed based on the fact that no fresh case of the highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by the deadly H5N1 virus, has
been detected anywhere in the country since the effective control and
containment of the last outbreak in February-March 2006 in the
Navapur-Jalgaon region of Maharashtra. However, past record cannot be
deemed a guarantee for the non-emergence of the dreaded disease in the
future. This is especially so because this virus still exists in India's
neighborhood, and the role of the migratory birds in their transport to
other areas has, by now, been well-established. What is more, even the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has issued a fresh
warning about the menace, pointing out that new strains of the virus have
also been detected in some places. The heightening of the risk is borne out
also by unabated outbursts of the dreaded affliction in China and its
recurrence in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. Local poultry experts, too, fear
that the fresh influx of migratory birds in the ensuing winter may pose a
real danger of resurgence of the infection in India.
What needs to be realized is that, unlike the earlier bird flu epidemic of
2003, which was confined to the East Asia-Australia flyway of the migratory
birds, the present concentration of the pathogen is in countries that lie
on the East Africa-West Asia flyway, which passes through India as well.
The lurking menace needs to be viewed all the more seriously since the
birds' flyways converge in the northern hemisphere, where they return from
various destinations, and intermingle with each other, passing on the
infection. Besides, since the virus has begun to mutate, as reflected in
several cases of human deaths, the chances of a pandemic outbreak are
increasing with time. And, should this happen in a populous country like
India, its containment will be extremely difficult, if not impossible.
In view of all this, it will be nothing short of folly if the
self-proclamation of a disease-free status lulls the government to inaction
on this front. Timely preventive and precautionary measures are a must to
ward off the hazard. The Poultry Federation of India has, in fact, been
sounding out the government on this issue for a long time. It has suggested
that poultry birds in the radius of about 20 km of all water bodies
situated on the route of the migratory birds should be compulsorily
vaccinated before the onset of the winter, when the fresh influx of
migratory birds will begin. Of course, the poultry industry, too, needs to
be vigilant and take the bio-safety measures required. But that alone will
not suffice, as the visiting birds get in touch with the wild birds and the
back-yard poultry as well. The fear that the vaccination move may send
wrong signals to importers of poultry products from India should not deter
action on this front, for exports account for less than one percent of the
country's total poultry production. The gains from these exports, thus, are
too meager to justify putting the whole poultry production in jeopardy or,
even more importantly, endangering human lives.

Sneeze at this at your own peril
-----------------------------------
Don't let the discovery of a new strain of bird flu virus be another easily
forgotten topic. The findings last week that the outbreak in Nakhon Phanom
was caused by the H5N1 strain with genetic characteristics similar to the
one affecting southern China should be a wake-up call for livestock and
public heath officials. Never before has the country seen another type of
the virus since Thailand was struck by bird flu for the 1st time in late
2003. Before the Nakhon Phanom case, the virus found here was the same as
that found in other provinces. The discovery should remind officials and
politicians of the complications in the avian flu story. Effective measures
deployed by the government must give the public confidence that they can
cope with all types of bird flu, regardless of their origin.
The most important message from what's happened in the northeastern
province and in Vientiane, the capital of neighboring Laos, which has found
the same type of virus, is that strains of bird flu virus have no respect
for borders. But one thing is for sure: the virus couldn't have come to the
2 countries by itself. It can't walk, take a bus, book a flight or
hitch-hike all the way from southern China. Chickens could be a carrier.
But it's most unlikely that they flew several hundred km. Blaming it on
migratory birds does not make sense, as this is not their time of travel.
So suspicions for bringing in the new type of virus must fall on humans.
Somebody must have brought those fowl from southern China, slipping through
checkpoints to Laos and into northeastern Thailand, for trade or whatever
reasons.
Thai officials know too well that it is impossible for the new strain to be
seen in Nakhon Phanom without valid cause. After their findings, they
didn't say it came from China; they simply said publicly that it is the
same strain as that found in the southern part of China. Their caution
comes from fears that pinpointing a country by name could make that country
upset. Thailand has learned that lesson before when finger-pointing at Laos
as a possible country causing bird flu in the Thai province bordering that
landlocked country. What they received was an angry repudiation from Vientiane.
The Food and Agriculture Organization has also learned the same lesson.
When it said simply that the virus originated in China, the UN agency was
bombarded with criticism from the Chinese Agriculture Ministry, which
slammed it for making the statement without evidence to back it up.
''Nakhon Phanom in Thailand and the Lao capital of Vientiane, where the
virus strain was detected, are both very far from the Chinese border,'' as
an official was quoted in China Daily as saying.
But China's rejection should not hamper much needed future efforts among
the 3 countries, as well as the UN agency, to find better measures to end
the spread of any new strain in the region when their officials come to
meet next time.
The Nakhon Phanom discovery also gives us another important lesson. It
shows what can happen after countries in the region open their borders
wider to improve transport links. Better road links promoted by regional
governments can bring not only trade but also diseases. Once people are
able to move from one country to another easily, they can carry diseases or
travel with animals which are disease carriers.
And now Asian countries have an agreement, which came into force last July
2005, to realize an ambitious scheme of the UN Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific to see a 41 000 km-long highway network
linking 32 countries in Asia. That includes several road development
projects linking Thailand with Laos, Cambodia, Viet Nam and China. Better
road connections will bolster tourism and commerce. Yet the trans-national
highway network can move diseases around quickly, too. In addition to
streamlined regulations to facilitate trade, investment and tourism, which
several countries are working on, strict measures on health-related issues
affecting animals and humans should not be forgotten.
Perhaps we should thank the new bird flu virus found in Nakhon Phanom. It
reminds governments in this region of the many things they need to do.

Viet Nam bans transport of poultry, cattle in bus
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam has banned transport of fowl, cattle and related products in
public transport vehicles, like buses and coaches, in a move to prevent
potential disease outbreaks, local media reported Monday [21 Aug 2006].
Under a recent instruction of the Transport Ministry, the country, besides
ensuring the enforcement of the ban nationwide, will intensify control
movements of poultry, cattle and related products in border areas, said
Viet Nam Agriculture newspaper.
The Vietnamese government on 8 Aug 2006 instructed state agencies and
localities nationwide to beef up management and inspection of transport,
slaughtering, trade and import of fowl and related products, including
placing a temporary ban on import of live poultry and related products from
countries hit by bird flu, combating poultry smuggling more fiercely,
enforcing the existing ban on raising fowl in inner areas of major cities,
and continuing bird flu vaccination.
Viet Nam, which has recently completed this year's [2006] 1st batch of bird
flu vaccination among fowl nationwide, plans to finish the 2nd batch by
late November 2006. The country has so far this year vaccinated some 134
million poultry. Testing 14 161 specimens from vaccinated chickens and
ducks indicated that more than 75 percent of the fowl have developed
capacity of not contracting bird flu virus strain H5, according to the
Department of Animal Health under the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development.
Bird flu outbreaks, starting in the country in December 2003, have killed
and led to the forced culling of dozens of millions of fowl. The last
outbreak of bird flu among poultry in Viet Nam was in December 2005, said
the department.
