For the 1st time in nearly a half-century, San Joaquin County health officials say they have confirmed a human case of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV).

Back in August [2020], county public health officials say they found SLEV in mosquitoes collected near Lodi. It was the 1st time since 1973 that officials had detected the virus in the county.

Then, on Thursday [22 Oct 2020], public health officials announced that a Stockton resident had a confirmed case of SLEV. That person becomes the 1st human case of SLEV in San Joaquin County since 1973.

The person's current condition was not stated, but health officials said they were recovering at home.

SLEV is a disease that could cause serious swelling of the brain (known and encephalitis), although most people infected either have minor symptoms or don't ever develop any.

People can be infected with the virus when they are bitten by a mosquito who was also infected, often after biting a bird with SLEV. Health officials note that SLEV cannot be spread from person to person.

Stanislaus County also recently found some mosquitos with SLEV, but no human cases have been confirmed in that area.

[This is the 2nd St. Louis encephalitis case in California that ProMED has posted so far this year (2020). The previous case was fatal but this one is recovering at home. St. Louis encephalitis virus is found nearly every year in California, sometimes in mosquitoes, sometimes causing cases in humans, as with the 2 cases this year (2020).

The USA CDC reports that most people infected with SLE virus have no apparent illness (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/). The 1% who become ill develop fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis) occurs more commonly in older adults, as was the 1st case this year (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA (02): (CA) fatal 20200905.7749005). Rarely, long-term disability or death can result. Unfortunately, there are no vaccines or medications available for human use. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
