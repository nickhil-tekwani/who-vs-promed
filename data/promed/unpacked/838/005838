Variant CJD Cases in UK Now Total 106
-------------------------------------
LONDON: The number of "definite and probable" cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in
ProMED-mail, thought to be the human form of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow" disease, has risen to 106 in the UK, the
Department of Health said on Mon 6 Aug 2001.
A monthly update on the disease from the National CJD Surveillance Unit
shows that as of 3 Aug 2001, 14 people have died and been confirmed to have
had vCJD this year. One other person thought to have the disease has died,
but the brain biopsy needed to confirm vCJD has not yet been performed.
Another 7 living people have symptoms of the fatal condition, which
classifies them as "probable" cases. That brings to 106 the overall number
of definite and probable cases of vCJD recorded by the surveillance unit
since 1995.
Earlier this year, Professor John Collinge, a member of the Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), which advises the government on
BSE, told BBC radio that the average incubation period for the disease in
humans could "well be in the region of 30 years." He said thousands or tens
of thousands more cases could emerge. Professor Robert Will, director of
the UK's National CJD Surveillance Unit, which monitors the epidemic, told
Reuters Health that the latest figures are in line with current predictions
that in the short term, the number of vCJD cases in the UK will double
every 3 years. As to what will happen in the longer term, Will said, "My
own personal view is that we can't say at the moment. We don't know for how
long these trends will be maintained."
