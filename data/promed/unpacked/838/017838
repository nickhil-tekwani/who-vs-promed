Health officials have closed all Whatcom County [Washington] beaches to recreational shellfish harvesting after tests showed unsafe levels of marine biotoxins.

The closure is for all molluscan shellfish including clams, mussels, oysters, and scallops, and all beaches, including at Larrabee State Park and Point Roberts.

The ban was put into place after unsafe levels of the toxin that causes diarrhetic shellfish poisoning [DSP] were detected in recent sampling in Bellingham Bay.

Meanwhile, paralytic shellfish poisoning biotoxin levels were still elevated in northern Whatcom County, where beaches from Sandy Point north to the Canadian Border, including Point Roberts, have been closed to recreational shellfish harvesting since early April [2016].

It is normal for biotoxin producing algae to be present in marine water, usually in low numbers that cause no problems. The algae that produces the DSP toxin has been detected in Washington's marine waters for some time, but has not produced toxin. That changed in June 2011 when the 1st confirmed DSP illnesses were reported (3 people became ill after eating recreationally harvested mussels from Sequim Bay), and testing confirmed shellfish were contaminated with the toxin.

Although DSP has been a problem in European countries for some time, this is an emerging health threat for Washington. New information will be shared as it becomes available.

Shellfish in stores and restaurants are tested for marine toxins before going to market and are safe to eat.

[Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is one type of shellfish poisoning.

Okadaic acid is a naturally occurring marine toxin, called a "biotoxin," that is produced by microscopic algae, specifically, the dinoflagellate _Dinophysis_. Shellfish eat these algae and can retain the toxin, sometimes at levels that can make people sick. Okadaic acid causes DSP in humans who eat shellfish contaminated with the toxin.

All species of shellfish including clams, mussels, oysters, geoducks, and scallops are able to accumulate DSP toxin.

Shellfish containing toxic levels of DSP do not look or taste any different from shellfish that are safe to eat. Laboratory testing of shellfish meat is the only known method of detecting DSP.

DSP causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, with diarrhea being the most commonly reported symptom. Cooking or freezing does not destroy the toxin. Anyone who eats DSP contaminated shellfish is at risk for illness. The DSP toxin is non-lethal to humans.

Other types of biotoxins found in the northwest are paralytic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning (caused by consumption of the biotoxin domoic acid). Harmful bacteria and viruses can cause intestinal upset such as vibriosis (vibrio illness) in shellfish and norovirus in shellfish. Some people can have an allergic reaction to shellfish.

If symptoms are mild, call your health care provider and your local public health agency. If symptoms are severe, call 911 or have someone take you to your family doctor.
