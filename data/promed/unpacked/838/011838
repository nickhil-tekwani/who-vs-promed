A patient at the city's [Karachi] Jinnah Hospital has been diagnosed with Congo virus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever], citing a hospital official. "A patient infected with Congo fever virus has been admitted at the Jinnah Hospital," Dr Seemi Jamali said today [1 Mar 2021]. It is the 1st patient with the Congo virus reported this year.

"The patient has been a cowherd and resident of Bilawal Chowrangi in Karachi," Dr Jamali said.

The patient was brought to Jinnah Hospital over symptoms of Congo fever. The hospital confirmed Congo virus in the patient after medical test reports. A Congo virus alert had been issued last year [2020] for the metropolis, stipulating precautionary instructions for all those people who were visiting cattle farms. The alert was issued by the KMC [Karachi Metropolitan Corporation] to hospitals, directing them to adopt special precautions for a Congo-affected patient. It had further asked hospitals to establish special wards for Congo patients, and run awareness campaigns about the virus.

The disease is caused when a tick attaches itself to the skin of [infected] cattle and when that infected tick or animal comes in contact with people, the highly contagious virus is transmitted into the human body and the person falls ill. The initial symptoms of Congo fever included headache, high fever, rashes, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting.

[The CCHF virus is tick-borne and can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. High mortality rates are observed only if there are hemorrhagic manifestations of the disease; up to 80 percent of infections are asymptomatic (https://journals.lww.com/co-infectiousdiseases/Abstract/2007/10000/Crimean_Congo_hemorrhagic_fever.9.aspx, https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever).

The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter.

The report indicates that there is a history of occupational exposure in this case. The majority of CCHF cases are reported in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, butchers, veterinarians, and on account of exposure in healthcare facilities among healthcare workers who are in contact with suspected CCHF cases.

CCHF cases in Pakistan show biannual peaks, between the months of March-May and August-October. Many factors, including poor sanitation, unhygienic transportation, and numerous animal slaughter sites, inefficient tick-control programs, post-slaughter piles of animal remains, nomadic lifestyle, and lack of general awareness, contribute to the spread of CCHF.

The health and veterinary (including entomologists/vector control) sectors need to work together on formulating awareness messages to reach the susceptible groups in the general public, especially the high-risk groups, in order to minimize exposures. - Mod.UBA
