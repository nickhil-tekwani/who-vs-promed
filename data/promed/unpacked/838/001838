More measles cases reported in Taipei
-------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) announced 3 confirmed local cases of
measles in Taipei City [22 Jun 2010], including 2 university students
and one private security guard, raising concerns of a possible outbreak.

Following investigations, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under
the DOH has estimated that the 3 individuals may have come into
contact with more than 1500 people since being infected.

CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting said that as the number of
people with whom they had contact is so high, the DOH can "only start
by trying to track down those who are at higher risk of being infected."

According to the CDC, the 2 infected students are both female and 21
years old. One of the young women studies at a national university,
while the other takes classes at a technology university in the evenings.

Lin said both students used public transportation to commute to
school and their part-time jobs before discovering that they were
infected. In addition, the public university student took a Graduate
Record Examination language test on 12 Jun 2010, coming into contact
with dozens of other students who were also taking the test.

Lin estimated that the 2 students probably came into contact with
more than 1000 people before being diagnosed with measles.

Meanwhile, the 39-year-old male security guard reportedly went to
work every day between 14-18 Jun 2010, a period during which the CDC
suspects he was already infected. As the guard rode the elevator
while patrolling the building where he works during each shift, the
center estimated that more than 500 individuals had come into contact
with the patient.

The CDC believes that the man was infected last week [week of 14 Jun
2010] when he headed to hospital to pick up some medicine. The
pharmacist on duty at the time was later announced by the DOH as
having measles.

According to CDC tallies, there have been 12 confirmed cases of
measles in Taiwan so far this year [2010], half of whom are imported
cases and rest are local.

A point of concern for the center is not only that the average age of
the infected individuals is relatively higher than in the past, but
also that the infection source of 4 of the cases has not been determined.

"This means that there were measles cases already present in the
community beforehand, otherwise the confirmed infections would not
have appeared," the center said.

Lin urged all citizens who begin displaying symptoms of measles,
including fever, rash, conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the nose
and throat with increased production of mucus, to begin wearing a
surgical mask to prevent a spread of the virus and visit the hospital
immediately.

He also called for doctors to be on increased alert when examining
patients and to report any suspected cases to authorities at once in
order to help prevent a possible outbreak.

[Measles is highly communicable, with greater than 90 percent
secondary attack rates among susceptible persons. Measles may be
transmitted from 4 days before to 4 days after rash onset. Maximum
communicability occurs from onset of prodrome through the 1st 3-4 days of rash.
