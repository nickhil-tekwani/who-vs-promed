Unknown diseases destroyed 200 bighas of paddy at Madhubhan and
Prakashpur, Sunsari district.
"The field was green before 2 weeks ago, but it suddenly turned
yellow and the plants wilted," Man Bahadur Khatri, a farmer, added,
"We are afraid of the unknown disease that destroyed our paddy."
Krishna Kumari Rai said, "We have used medicines with a hope that it
would cure the disease but it did [not] work at all."
The experts have taken specimens of the plants for investigation.
They said that the Indian variety could have caused the disease.

[Quick yellowing and wilting of large areas of rice could have a
number of causes, including some fungal or bacterial pathogens,
insect pests, or environmental factors. Without further information
it is not possible to speculate on a possible cause. Equally, it is
not clear what 'medicines' could have been used by the farmers.
Fertilisers, which would counteract yellowing due to nutrient
deficiencies, may be one possibility. If the Indian variety referred
to is the one showing symptoms it may have succumbed to a local
pathogen endemic to the region to which local cultivars have some
resistance. Alternatively, if the Indian variety is symptomless and
local varieties affected, a pathogen may have been imported to the region.
The bigha is a unit of measurement of area of land, commonly used in
Nepal, Bangladesh, and in a few states of India. The size of a bigha
may vary considerably depending on the region and ranges from 1500 to
6771 sq m about (approx. 1800-8100 sq yds). In Nepal, a bigha is
about 2603.7 sq m (3114 sq yds).
