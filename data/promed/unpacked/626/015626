Rabbit numbers across NSW [New South Wales, Australia have been
culled by more than 65 percent and in some areas by up to 90 percent
since the introduction of the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus [incorrectly
called rabbit calicivirus - Mod.THG, according to a soon to be released
report which raises concerns about the lack of impact in the wetter
and coastal zones.
The CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization says the virus will continue to have an impact for
another 10 years before its effectiveness begins to wear off.
The National Registration Authority is considering a new release
through a carrot-type bait, which may be more effective in these
wetter zones as the uptake of the virus would be more rapid than
releasing infected animals into the wild.
The virus is now considered to have been one of the most
significant factors in bringing about dramatic changes and
improvements in the environment of the arid zone.The report
claims that there is still a residual rabbit problem in wet areas but
acknowledges this was partially expected.
But there are warnings that continued control of rabbits must be
maintained.
While some critics question the effectiveness of the virus since it
was accidentally released from South Australia in 1995, the report
will claim that in the arid zone of Australia the rabbit population is
now down to 10 percent of original numbers.
One result has been the return of a wide range of native plant and
animal species -- some thought extinct -- to many parts of the State.
CSIRO's Dr Brian Cooke said rabbit numbers had been cut by
around 60 percent -- around 130 million rabbits.
Every rabbit population in the country -- apart from one -- now has
the disease, and the question is how long it will take them to
develop immunity.
"There have been some very big changes in the environment but it
may take some time before they become obvious," said Dr Cooke,
of the CSIRO's division of wildlife and ecology.
"It is still killing a high percentage of animals well into its fourth year.
It has had a big impact. And the biggest beneficiary certainly has
been the natural environment."
The other major beneficiary are farmers, with estimated savings of
$2 million a year on baits and poisons.
NSW Department of Agriculture's Graeme Eggleston said: "We
are still trying to work out why we have this variability in the wetter
areas. Perhaps there are more juvenile rabbits and a less defined
breeding season."
"In some areas it is difficult to find 20 rabbits, the number required
for forced infection, to be released back into the wild.
"One of the problems we had was when it escaped, it escaped into arid country and during the first round of euphoria people thought it would be like that everywhere."
