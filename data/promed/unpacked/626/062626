Papaya disease alert
--------------------
Papaya growers in Perak have been advised to follow good agricultural
practices recommended by the state Agriculture Department to avoid the
spreading of papaya dieback disease.

Department director Ariffin Abd Latif said among the practices was to
use healthy papaya seeds and seedlings and to check the trees
regularly. Farmers, he added, should also destroy infected trees
immediately. "Papaya dieback disease is the most serious and can cause
damage to trees, and fruit yield loss of up to 100 percent. It is a
threat to Malaysia's papaya industry."

Growers receive [compensation] for voluntarily destroying their crop
but could face a fine up to RM 10 000 [approx. USD 3200] if they fail
to destroy the infected trees under the Plant Quarantine Act. A farmer
said he lost almost RM 300 000 [approx. USD 97 000] when 5000 papaya
trees in his 4 ha [approx. 10 acres] farm had to be destroyed.

[Bacterial dieback (also called crown rot or bacterial canker) of
papaya emerged during the 1980s in different islands of the Caribbean.
Since then, it has devastated many papaya plantations in the Caribbean
and southern Asia and is of serious quarantine concern in these
regions (see ProMED-mail post 20091029.3747).

In 2004, _Erwinia papayae_ was characterised and described as a novel
species associated with the disease. Symptoms may include necrotic
areas on leaves and water-soaked lesions on petioles and stem. These
are followed by rotting of petioles and leaf drop making affected
plants stand out in the field, as well as water-soaked cankers on the
stem, which may lead to the death of the plant. Fruit symptoms include
dark blotches on the skin and water-soaked flesh. Infections may
become systemic resulting in vascular discolouration of stem, fruits,
and roots. Secondary fungal infections often follow.

Bacteria enter the host through natural openings and wounds. Disease
development is favoured by humidity and rain. Seed transmission as
well as local spread by insects, plant material, water splash, and
mechanical means are suspected. Disease management may include
phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and bactericidal (copper) sprays.
Infected plants may recover and produce productive branches during dry
conditions. Available papaya cultivars show different levels of
susceptibility.

The bacterium was first detected in Malaysia in the state of Johor in
2003 and has spread rapidly in that country since then, destroying
more than one million papaya plants. Strict quarantine measures are
needed to prevent entry of the pathogen to new areas.
