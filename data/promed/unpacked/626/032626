WHO South-East Asia Region [SEARO], home to a quarter of the world's population, was certified polio-free today [27 Mar 2014] by an independent commission under the WHO certification process. This is the 4th of 6 WHO Regions to be certified, marking an important step towards global polio eradication. With this step, 80 percent of the world's population now lives in certified polio-free regions.

An independent panel of 11 experts in public health, epidemiology, virology, clinical medicine and related specialties constituting the South-East Asia Regional Certification Commission for Polio Eradication (SEA-RCCPE) met for 2 days to review evidence from countries before reaching the decision that all 11 countries of the Region are now polio-free and have met the requirements for certification.

Before a Region can be certified polio-free, several conditions must be satisfied such as: at least 3 years of zero confirmed cases due to indigenous wild poliovirus; excellent laboratory-based surveillance for poliovirus; demonstrated capacity to detect, report, and respond to imported cases of poliomyelitis; and assurance of safe containment of polioviruses in laboratories (introduced since 2000).

"This is a momentous victory for the millions of health workers who have worked with governments, nongovernmental organizations, civil society and international partners to eradicate polio from the Region. It is a sign of what we can bequeath our children when we work together," said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director for the WHO South-East Asia Region.

Polio eradication programmes, through their networks and knowledge in reaching the "unreached," have strengthened the delivery of health services to the most vulnerable communities. "Thanks to polio eradication, we now know where these children are who were difficult to reach with vaccine. Now [that] the polio programme has successfully reached them with polio drops in every round, there is no excuse not to go back with other critical health services, from how to have a safe birth, to where to get access to tuberculosis treatment and how to prevent HIV infection," said Dr Khetrapal Singh.

Through the effort to eradicate polio, health personnel and community workers have been trained and provided with critical equipment to improve vaccination and health services for other childhood diseases. Comprehensive global laboratory and communication networks have been built and are being used for other diseases. Most recently, these networks played a critical role in responding to avian influenza.

Certification of the Region comes as countries prepare for the introduction of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization as part of the eventual phasing out of oral polio vaccines (OPV). More than 120 countries currently use only OPV. These countries will introduce a dose of IPV by the end of 2015 as part of their commitment to the global polio endgame plan which aims to ensure a polio-free world by 2018.

While celebrating the historic achievement, the WHO Regional Director also sounded a word of caution to maintain high vigilance against importation of polio. "Until polio is globally eradicated, all countries are at risk, and the Region's polio-free status remains fragile. High immunization coverage can prevent an imported virus from finding an under-immunized, susceptible population. A sensitive surveillance system, able to quickly detect and identify any importation and guide a programmatic response, is critical," she added.

WHO's South-East Asia Region comprises the following 11 Member States: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.

[This is a major milestone in the progress of the polio eradication initiative, and the countries in the region deserve recognition for the massive efforts.

Additional background information from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative website: "...vaccination campaigns that reached a cumulative total of 7.5 billion children over 17 years, in every home from the busiest city street to the remotest rural corner, with the dedication of millions of community health workers and volunteers. Between 1995 and 2012, the polio programme conducted 189 nationwide campaigns across the region and administered more than 13 billion doses of oral polio vaccine."

In addition, among positive outcomes of the polio eradication effort were: "Ending polio in these countries forged strong systems that are now being used to advance other health priorities. In Bangladesh, immunization coverage for essential vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) rose from 82 percent to 96 percent between 2000 and 2012, in a period of intense polio eradication activity; in Nepal, the rate went from 74 percent to 90 percent. Some countries have expanded their high-performing polio surveillance networks to track other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, neonatal tetanus and Japanese encephalitis."

With ongoing transmission in the Syrian Arab Republic with international spread, the polio outbreak response in the Middle East is continuing to urgently stop an outbreak affecting the region.

As of [20 Mar 2014], in the Syrian Arab Republic, a total of 37 WPV1 cases have been reported: 25 cases by the Syrian Arab Republic Ministry of Health, and 12 cases from contested areas (Aleppo, Edleb and Deir Al Zour) not yet reflected in official figures. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [17 Dec 2013], from Edleb.

Further evidence of regional spread was confirmed this week by notification of a WPV1 case from Iraq, the 1st polio case in the country since 2000. The case, a 6-month-old boy from Baghdad who had not been immunized, developed paralysis on [10 Feb 2014]. Genetic sequencing indicates the virus is most closely related to virus detected in the Syrian Arab Republic. WPV1 was also isolated from the child's 3-year-old sister, who did not develop symptoms. Prospects for rapidly controlling this event are positive, as Iraq has been part of a regional Middle East emergency outbreak response since confirmation of polio in the Syrian Arab Republic was received in October 2013. In response, all countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, in a joint resolution, declared polio eradication to be an emergency, calling for support in negotiating and establishing access to those children who are currently unreached with polio vaccination.

In Iraq, since October [2013], 2 nationwide immunization campaigns and 3 subnational campaigns have been conducted, achieving overall high quality. Approximately 95 percent of children were reported to have been reached during each campaign, though coverage has varied by area. WHO and UNICEF estimates from 2012 put routine immunization levels in Iraq at 70 percent. Routine immunization levels in Baghdad are estimated to be 81 percent.

As part of outbreak response, efforts have been ongoing to strengthen subnational surveillance sensitivity to ascertain the full extent of transmission, particularly in the Syrian Arab Republic. Subnational surveillance gaps persist, particularly in areas of Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Lattakia, Quneitra and Al Raqa. Surveillance quality has improved in other governorates of the northeastern Syrian Arab Republic, including in Deir Al Zour.

Phase 1 of the planned regional outbreak response is now being completed. Since October 2013, 24 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been conducted across the region to reach more than 22 million children with multiple doses, in:

Egypt (2 nationwide SIAs; 1 subnational SIA);
Iraq (2 nationwide SIAs; 3 subnational SIAs);
Jordan (3 nationwide SIAs);
Lebanon (3 nationwide SIAs);
Syria (5 nationwide SIAs);
Turkey (3 subnational SIAs); and
West Bank and Gaza Strip (2 SIAs).

Phase 2 is being launched on [1 Apr 2014], with nationwide campaigns in: Egypt ([1-3 Apr 2014]); Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq (both on [6-10 Apr 2014]) and Lebanon (April [2014]), to be followed by further campaigns across the region in May [2014].

In Israel, WPV1-positive samples continue to be detected through environmental surveillance. In total, 186 positive samples have been collected since [3 Feb 2013], the most recent of which was on [16 Feb 2014]. In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 3 WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance, the most recent of which was detected in January 2014. No cases of polio paralysis have been detected in Israel, West Bank or Gaza Strip; WPV1 has been isolated from sewage samples only.

A surveillance alert remains in place for the region, calling on countries to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended SIAs with OPV. The risk of further international spread across the region remains high. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

Data in WHO as of 26 Mar 2013 for 2013 data and 25 Mar 2014 for 2014 data.

Highlights of the week
----
- World's most populous region certified polio-free: the WHO South East Asia Region was certified polio-free at a ceremony in India this week, meaning that transmission of wild poliovirus has been interrupted in this bloc of 11 countries stretching from Indonesia to India. This achievement marks a significant leap forward in global eradication, with 80 percent of the world's population now living in certified polio-free regions.
- A case of polio due to wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported from Iraq this week. This is the 1st polio case in the country since 2000 and is further evidence of regional spread of the virus. The case, a 6-month-old boy from Baghdad who had not been immunized, developed paralysis on [10 Feb 2014]. Genetic sequencing indicates the virus is most closely related to virus detected in Syria. WPV1 was also isolated from the child's 3-year-old sister, who did not develop symptoms.
- The GPEI report to the upcoming World Health Assembly in May [2014] is now available online. It summarizes the status against each of the 4 objectives of the Polio Endgame Strategic Plan and presents an overview of programmatic priorities for the rest of 2014. The full report is available at http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA67/A67_38-en.pdf.

Afghanistan
- A new case of WPV1 was reported this week from Muhmand Dara district in Nangarhar province (previously without wild poliovirus in 2014) with onset of paralysis on [22 Feb 2014], bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 to 4. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 is 14.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3, with the most recent cVDPV2 case in March 2013 from Kandahar province, Southern Region.
- Nationwide SIAs using trivalent OPV are being conducted this week in the country. Nationwide SIAs using bivalent OPV are planned for late April [2014].

Nigeria
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 is one, and for 2013 is 53. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [1 Feb 2014], from Kano.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is one, and for 2013 is 4. The most recent cVDPV case had onset of paralysis on [9 Feb 2014] (from Damboa, Borno).
- Analysis of recent Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) indicates overall quality continues to improve, including in highest-risk areas. According to Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), almost 90 percent of Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the 11 high-risk states achieved coverage of at least 80 percent during the recent IPDs. This compares to less than 65 percent of LGAs in these same states achieving the same level of coverage just 12 months ago [March 2013].
- The next IPDs are planned for April [2014], using a combination of bivalent and trivalent OPV.

Pakistan
- Seven new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week, 5 from North Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas - FATA, 1 from Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and 1 from Peshawar, KP, bringing the total number of cases for 2014 to 36. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [7 Mar 2014] (WPV1 from North Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas - FATA).
- No new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 45 for 2013, and 4 for 2014. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [27 Jan 2014] (from FR Bannu, FATA).
- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in the world (both wild and cVDPV2). Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in all areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.
- The densely populated Peshawar valley is considered to be the main "engine" of poliovirus transmission, alongside North Waziristan, due to large-scale population movements through Peshawar from across this region and into other areas of Pakistan. The quality of operations must be urgently improved in Peshawar and immunizations resumed in North Waziristan.

Central Africa
- No new WPV1 cases were reported this week. Two most recent WPV1 cases were reported last week, including 1 case from Centro Sur province in Equatorial Guinea with onset of paralysis on [28 Jan 2014], and another case from Cameroon with onset of paralysis on [31 Jan 2014]. Genetic sequencing indicates that the isolated virus from Equatorial Guinea is linked to transmission in Cameroon.
- Due to continued poliovirus circulation in Cameroon, gaps in surveillance and influx of vulnerable populations from CAR, WHO is elevating the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high.
- Since confirmation of the outbreak in Cameroon in October [2013], 5 nationwide campaigns have been conducted. However, the quality of implementation varied greatly by region, and serious coverage gaps remain. As many as 40 percent of children remain under-immunized (with 30 percent having received zero doses) during SIAs.
- The recent confirmation of new cases in Cameroon has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity in April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns so that all children are reached multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.
- Immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity are also being assessed in neighbouring countries, in particular in Gabon and the Republic of Congo, and additional immunization activities are being considered in these countries.
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- NIDs with trivalent OPV were held in Chad from [28 Feb 2014 to 2 Mar 2014]. The next nationwide campaigns are planned for late March [2014], using bivalent OPV.
- In CAR, additional campaigns are currently being planned, in response to the very high risk of international spread of polio from Cameroon.

Horn of Africa
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week, from Ethiopia. It is the 1st case in the Horn of Africa in 2014, and had onset of paralysis on [5 Jan 2014], from Somali region.
- The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa is 218 since April 2013 (194 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 10 from Ethiopia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. Recommendations from the recently held Horn of Africa Technical Advisory Group (TAG) are now actively being incorporated into outbreak response planning. The TAG had underscored that the initial response to the outbreak was appropriate but expressed grave concern that gaps in SIA quality and surveillance remained in key infected areas of the region.
- In particular, the TAG expressed concern at critical quality gaps in implementation in key areas of Ethiopia. The group recommended that infected countries should focus efforts on high-risk and infected areas by conducting high-quality SIAs no more than 4 weeks apart.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance in Israel since [3 Feb 2013] and continue to be detected in 2014 (17 positive samples collected this year [2014], the most recent of which was collected on [16 Feb 2014]; in 2013, 169 positive samples were collected).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided to re-introduce OPV into the national routine immunization schedule. However, no additional supplementary campaigns with OPV are being planned.
- Positive environmental samples have also been detected in West Bank and Gaza Strip; the most recent positive sample was collected during the week of [5 Jan 2014].
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted from [8-15 Dec 2013] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
- A case of polio due to wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported from Iraq last week. This is the 1st polio case in the country since 2000 and further evidence of regional spread of the virus. The case, a 6-month-old boy from Baghdad who had not been immunized, developed paralysis on [10 Feb 2014]. Genetic sequencing indicates the virus is most closely related to virus detected in Syria. WPV1 was also isolated from the child's 3-year old sister, who did not develop symptoms.
- In Iraq, since October [2013], 2 nationwide immunization campaigns and 3 subnational campaigns have been conducted, achieving overall high quality. Approximately 95 percent of children were reported to have been reached during each campaign, though coverage has varied by area. WHO and UNICEF estimates from 2012 put routine immunization levels in Iraq at 70 percent. Routine immunization levels in Baghdad are estimated to be 81 percent.
- No new WPV1 cases were reported from Syria in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in the country is 37: 25 cases have been reported by the Ministry of Health and 12 cases from contested areas (Aleppo, Edleb and Deir Al Zour) not yet reflected in official figures. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [17 Dec 2013] and was reported from Mara, Edleb governorate.
- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccination of all children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.
- In the Middle East, a comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. Since October 2013, 23 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been conducted across the region to reach more than 22 million children with multiple doses.
- The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation.

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV2 in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- National campaigns were conducted in West Africa [22-25 Nov 2013]. Further national campaigns are planned for April and May [2014] (multi-country).

[The major achievement of the SEARO countries cannot be downplayed, especially when one considers the population size referred to. That being said, as long as there continues to be circulation of the WPV in areas with pockets of susceptibles (unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated individuals), the risk of re-importation of the WPV and renewed circulation is present, as has been seen in the Middle East, Central Africa and the Horn of Africa. In countries with no documented WPV circulation, but with cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus), it is evidence that there are pockets of susceptibles "ripe" for re-establishment of circulation of the WPV if introduced. In the past 15 months, WPV has been re-introduced into the Middle East (Egypt, Israel, West Bank and Gaza strip, where environmental/sewage samples were positive for WPV, and Syria and Iraq, where there are clinical cases of WPV associated polio), Central Africa (Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea) and the Horn of Africa (Somalia, Ethopia and Kenya). cVDPV cases have occurred in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria (the 3 residual endemic countries for polio), Chad, Niger, Somalia and Yemen. (For the table showing the cVDPV cases by country, type of cVDPV and year, see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx).
