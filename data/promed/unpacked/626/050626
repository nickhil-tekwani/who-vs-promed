The government rejected advice from its expert advisers on swine flu
[influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus], who said there was no need
for the widespread use of Tamiflu and suggested that the public
should simply be told to take paracetamol. An independent panel set
up by the Department of Health warned ministers that plans to make
the stockpiled drug widely available could do more harm than good, by
helping the flu virus to develop resistance to the drug. But
ministers pressed ahead with a policy of mass prescription, fearing
the public would not tolerate being told that the millions of doses
of Tamiflu held by the state could not be used during a pandemic, one
of the committee members has told the Guardian [newspaper]. "It was
felt ... it would simply be unacceptable to the UK population to tell
them we had a huge stockpile of drugs but they were not going to be
made available," Professor Robert Dingwall, a member of the Committee
on Ethical Aspects of Pandemic Influenza, said. Today [16 Aug 2009]
one of the country's foremost flu experts called for the national
helpline to be shut down to stop hundreds of thousands of doses of
Tamiflu going out in an unregulated way, which could render it
useless when a more dominant strain returns in the autumn.

As it became clear that the current outbreak only had mild symptoms,
the committee recommended that antivirals should only be given to
those in high risk categories, like pregnant women or people with
existing respiratory illnesses. It suggested the government explain
to people that they would not be given medicine they did not need and
should use off-the-shelf flu treatments.

"There were discussions within the Health Protection Authority and
the Department of Health, once it became clear that swine flu was a
relatively mild infection, about whether to reserve antivirals for
high-risk groups and to advise the general population to treat
themselves with paracetamol or ibuprofen," said Dingwall, director of
the Institute for Science and Society at Nottingham University. "Some
people wanted to take a long-term view of the risk of resistance
developing and to seek to preserve the effectiveness of antivirals
for the next pandemic, which may be more severe. Last month [July
2009], the government launched the national pandemic flu service,
which authorised more than 511 000 courses of Tamiflu and Relenza
treatment during its 1st fortnight in operation.

Oxford University researchers have warned that antivirals are not a
"magic bullet" against flu and that resistance to the drug could
develop, making it useless to fight any future and potentially more
serious pandemic flu strain. The concern was seconded by flu expert
Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor at Aberdeen University, who
called for the national flu line to be shut down. "I am concerned
about the vast amount of Tamiflu that is going out almost
unregulated," he told the Guardian. "We are increasing the
possibility that the flu will become resistant sooner or later. At
the moment, there is no desperate need for Tamiflu. We should be
reconsidering its issue rather than encouraging its use. I think we
should stop the national pandemic flu service. It was put there for
an outbreak of far higher mortality than we have. If you get a
resistant strain that becomes dominant in the autumn, Tamiflu will
then be useless."

A senior government adviser, Prof Peter Openshaw, said the government
was told during the early stages of the current outbreak of the
"significant side effects" that Tamiflu was causing in some people.
"I think there was, in some quarters, a slight over-optimism about
the acceptability of prophylactic medication and its effectiveness,"
said Openshaw, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for
Emergencies. "Maybe some of the less clinical scientific advisers
perhaps slightly over-inflated expectations of the ease and
efficiency of antiviral treatment. Many of us who do clinical work
and are clinically trained had a bit more of a jaundiced view of how
things may turn out." Openshaw said antivirals were effective only if
used within 36 to 48 hours of symptoms developing. "If the treatment
is delayed, they are relatively ineffective. On the other hand, we do
have this large stockpile available, and I think there is an
advantage in trying to treat cases early in order to reduce the
severity and the number of patients who end up needing hospital
care." Such a policy could "blunt" a spike of cases, reducing
pressure on health resources, he said.

The pandemic ethical committee was set up at the request of Sir Liam
Donaldson, the chief medical officer, to assist planners and policy
makers with ethical aspects of decisions they face in a pandemic,
such as how to allocate scarce drugs when many people are sick. At
its last meeting in May 2009, when it was already becoming clear that
the current H1N1 strain was causing a relatively mild disease in most
people, the committee discussed the government's antiviral strategy.
Members feared that the widespread use of antivirals in the current
outbreak was incompatible with the principle of minimising harm,
minutes from the meeting show. The current outbreak did not alter the
risk of a more serious flu pandemic developing in the future. There
would be ethical concerns if the blanket use of antivirals
compromised their effectiveness in the future. Members said it was
important to use antivirals in the most appropriate way, not just
because the government had a stockpile of the drugs. The committee
called on the government to explain to the public that they were no
cure for flu. The committee concluded that it would be appropriate to
offer antivirals as treatment only for those in risk groups or with
underlying conditions.

In a statement, the Department of Health said: "Protecting the public
is the prime concern of our strategy, which has been shaped by advice
from the most eminent specialists from the beginning. There is still
doubt about how swine flu affects people; a safety-first approach is
the best approach. This means offering antivirals when required.
However, we will keep this policy under review as we learn more about
the virus and its effects. This is in line with the views of both the
Committee on Ethical Aspects of pandemic influenza and of the
Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.

[The danger inherent in the uncontrolled dispensation of the anti-
neuraminidase antiviral Tamiflu is already evident in the sporadic
appearance of Tamiflu-resistant viruses (for example, see the
preceding report in this thread). In all cases so far, resistance has
been conferred by the same H275Y mutation in the NA gene. The spread
of Tamiflu-resistant viruses may not be long delayed if there is
restriction in the use of this drug. Fortunately, so far, all the
Tamiflu-resistant viruses have remained sensitive to the alternate
anti-neuraminidase drug Relenza (zanamivir). - Mod.CP]
