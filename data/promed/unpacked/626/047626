Herewith, we wish to report 2 cases of endemic polyarthritis caused
by Ross River virus (RRV) infections in 2 travellers returning from
Australia.

On 1 Mar 2011, 2 young women, 28 and 31 years old, were seen
simultaneously at the travel clinics in Hamburg and Munich, Germany. 2
days earlier both had returned from a joint 30 day trip to Australia.
After spending 10 days in Tasmania until 10 Feb 2011, they rented a
camper to drive from Broome to Karratha and finally flew to Perth on
17 Feb 2011. 1st symptoms including mild fever, maculopapular rash,
and subsequently arthralgias occurred on 19 Feb 2011. We assume that
the infections occurred around the city of Broome in [Western
Australia] where they started their camper tour and reported intensive
mosquito exposure. This would reflect an incubation period of 8 days.
Diagnosis was confirmed by high IgG and IgM antibody titres against
RRV by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Initially, no
cross-reactivity against other alphaviruses was present including
chikungunya, Barmah Forest, and Semliki Forest viruses. 4 weeks after
initial presentation, one patient had recovered completely while the
other still continues with arthralgia.

RRV is endemic in Australia, transmission occurs mainly in the
Northern Territory and in Queensland. Due to recent flooding and an
unusual wet weather, comparatively high incidence rates are reported
for the Southwest including the city of Perth and South Australia as
well as Victoria [see cited archives, below]. Transmission occurs
mainly via _Aedes_ (especially in coastal areas, most active during
daytime) and _Culex_ mosquitoes (especially in inland areas, most
active after sunset). RRV infection should be suspected in travellers
returning from endemic areas with the triad of fever,
arthralgia/arthritis, and rash.

Travel-related RRV infections might increase in future and it would
be useful to monitor imported infections to non-endemic countries.
Both cases were reported to GeoSentinel, the global surveillance
program of the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM).

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Cramer and his colleagues for this interesting
1st hand report. It will be of interest to travel medicine and health
advisors, as well as clinicians in other countries. This is another
illustration of the need to take complete travel histories of febrile
patients and for good laboratory support required to make the timely
diagnosis of exotic pathogens. There is no possibility that these
patients will have served as Ross River virus sources for ongoing
transmission in Germany.
