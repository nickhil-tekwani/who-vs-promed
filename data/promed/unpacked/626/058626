Viet Nam: 4 suspected human cases (one fatal) of avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
One man died of suspected avian influenza in Viet Nam over the weekend
[15-16 Jan 2005], and 3 people were hospitalized, as news reports showed
that the virus has spread across the entire country.
In neighboring Thailand, health workers have been put on alert and ordered
to conduct stringent surveillance measures, but it is Viet Nam that has
emerged as the epicenter for the deadly H5N1 virus.
A 48-year-old man, his younger brother and a 62-year-old man were
hospitalized on Sat 15 Jan 2005 with acute pneumonia, which doctors in
Hanoi suspected could be caused by avian influenza virus, the Quan Doi Nhan
Dan daily reported on Mon 17 Jan 2005. The 48-year-old man died, and the
other 2 patients were in critical condition.
If the cause of the man's death is confirmed as bird flu, it would be the
1st fatality in the north of the country from the poultry virus that has
killed 37 people in Asia: 25 in Viet Nam and 12 in Thailand.
A 4th patient, a 14-year-old boy, was taken to a Ho Chi Minh hospital with
high fever and coughing on Sun 16 Jan 2005 from the southern province of
Tra Vinh, according to the Laborer newspaper. Government officials were not
immediately available for comment.
The human victims are believed to have caught the virus from contact with
diseased poultry. The Agriculture Ministry stated that avian influenza had
spread to ducks and chickens in the Ninh Thuan and Quang Nam provinces in
Viet Nam's central region. The virus has emerged now in all of the
country's 3 regions. Officials said some 234 000 chickens, ducks and birds
have died or have been slaughtered because of the virus since the beginning
of the year [2005].
Vietnamese researchers will soon start testing a vaccine on monkeys,
chickens and mice with the hope of using it on humans and poultry, the
Laborer newspaper said. It quoted Pham Ngoc Dinh, deputy head of the
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, as saying the vaccine has been under
research since April 2004.
Last year [2004], bird flu destroyed 17 percent of Vietnam's poultry stock
of 250 million.

[As of Thu 13 Jan 2005, the World Health Organization gives the cumulative
number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection
in East Asia since 28 Jan 2004 as 48 (17 in Thailand and 31 in Viet Nam);
of these persons, 35 have died (12 in Thailand and 23 in Viet Nam).
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/en/>
The Vietnamese authorities state that the cumulative number of deaths in
Viet Nam will be increased to 25 if the death of the 48-year-old patient is
confirmed as due to avian influenza. The significant observation, however,
is that the death of this patient is the 1st to have occurred in the north
of the country, and it follows the expansion of the outbreak into northern
Viet Nam. - Mod.CP]
