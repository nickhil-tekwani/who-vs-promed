Bulgarian authorities have confirmed the spread of foot and mouth
disease (FMD) in the Burgas village of Kosti, with 37 domestic
animals reportedly infected, Bulgarian television channel bTV
announced on 10 Jan 2011.

There are other cases of FMD around the village also confirmed,
Yordan Voinov from the national veterinary service told bTV. "This is
most likely an infection in a very early phase, as only one cow from
the entire cattle herd was found to be infected. Investigations
conducted in the villages of Rezovo and Malko Turnovo proved
negative," Voinov said. "By culling the animals and disinfecting the
others, we are hoping to tackle the spread of the virus," he added.

In the course of the past few days, authorities checked 1600 animals
in the Burgas municipality and in regions near Haskovo and Yambol in
the southeast. Of those, 500 animals will be destroyed, according to
Dnevnik daily.

Last week [week of 3 Jan 2010], the regional commissions adopted
emergency measures against the spread of the virus in Haskovo,
Burgas, Varna, and Yambol.

For the 1st time in 45 years, a case of FMD was registered in the
country after a wild boar crossed the border from Turkey near the
village of Kosti. Authorities have started reconstructing the fence
along the border where it had fallen apart, to prevent any other
animals slipping in.

In turn, the European Commission took urgent protection measures on 6
Jan 2011 to increase control measures for FMD already implemented by
the Bulgarian authorities.

The Commission's measures pertain both to high-risk areas (such as
the region of Burgas) and low-risk areas (such as the provinces of
Yambol, Sliven, Shumen, and Varna) and stipulate the rules for the
safe trade of items produced before the restrictions.

The measures include "epidemiological investigation, suspension of
hunting, and a ban on feeding wild animals, placing under official
surveillance holdings keeping animals of susceptible species,
inspection by an official veterinarian of all wild animals shot or
found dead," the report said.

FMD is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of
cloven-hoofed animals, including domestic animals such as cattle,
water buffalo, sheep, goats, and pigs, as well as antelope, bison,
and other wild bovids, and deer.

[It is highly doubtful if "reconstructing the fence along the border
where it had fallen apart" will indeed "prevent any other animals
slipping in"; certainly such fence does not exclude the spread of the
virus. If the virus has indeed been circulating within the wild boar
population of neighbouring Turkish Thrace, its potential to penetrate
the border into Bulgaria, either on foot (and mouth...) or by air, is
realistic. An intact, thick security fence along the Israeli-Lebanese
border, did not prevent the spread of infection into wild boars
within Israel's territory in 1992. A report on surveillance in wild
boars in northern Israel was included in ProMED-mail archive no
20070517.1571; at least in one case (in the village Mevo Hamma, Golan
Heights), the virus activity in boar seemed to have taken place some
time before outbreaks in domestic livestock were recorded.

The circulation of FMDV serotype O in wild boars in Thrace, bordering
Bulgaria, should not be overly surprising. On 28 Feb 2007, Turkey
notified the OIE on an outbreak of FMD in cattle in Kirklareli
(Armagan, Armagan, Merkez). The reported epidemiology was "contact
with an infected boar" (see ProMED-mail 20070301.0726). This was the
background to the following commentary by ProMED-mail's moderator PC:
"The location of the outbreak in the Marmara region of Turkey, just
south of the Bulgarian border, can be seen by accessing the full OIE
report. This outbreak is in the same general region as the January
[2007] outbreak in Edirne. The epidemiology of the outbreak should
serve as a reminder that exposure to wild boar, a mode of
introduction that has been frequently associated with classical swine
fever, can also serve to introduce other disease agents."

Since porcines are not regarded as effective carriers of FMDV, the
source of their infection should be sought in a more effective
carrier animal. Sheep may be proposed as plausible candidates; see
also commentary in ProMED-mail 20070508.1480.

A thorough epidemiological surveillance in Thrace, with sheep flocks
high on the listed targets, deserves to be considered. An official
confirmation of FMDV spreading to cattle in Bulgaria, and the
serotyping/genotyping results of the samples submitted to the WRLFMD
at Pirbright, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
