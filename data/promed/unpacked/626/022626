Victorian dog owners and veterinarians have been advised to be on the lookout for a new disease spread by brown dog ticks after a case was reported at Horsham.

The Horsham detection of ehrlichiosis in a dog from the Northern Territory is the 1st case of the disease found in an Australian-born dog in Victoria.

Ehrlichiosis was found for the 1st time in an Australian dog in the Kimberley region in mid-2020. Since then, it has spread around the country and now found in most states and territories, including New South Wales and South Australia.

Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Graeme Cooke urged all Victorian dog owners and veterinarians to be on the lookout for the disease.

_Ehrlichia canis_ (_E. canis_) cannot be passed directly from dog to dog, except via infected ticks, and dogs that have been diagnosed and are undergoing veterinary treatment for ehrlichiosis do not pose a health risk in transferring the disease to other dogs.

Dr Cooke said the Horsham dog was rehomed as a pet from an infected area and has been on a tick control program since it arrived in the Wimmera city.

"The dog is very healthy and it has also received antibiotic treatment, which is a way of clearing up the disease.

"Nor has there been any reports of ticks being found on the dog." This meant the likelihood of the dog dropping any infected ticks in Victoria is "very low," he said.

"However, it is a reminder to people who are rehoming dogs or moving dogs from infected areas of Australia to have a good tick preventative treatment program and possibly if you don't know much about the history of the dog, have it tested before it leaves the area."

Dr Cooke said Agriculture Victoria had initiated a program of free testing and tick identification of dogs at veterinarians to generate data on the level of risk is, or the level of infection might be in Victoria. "That (program) has been going for some months and it was that that picked this case up."

Dr Cooke said common signs of ehrlichiosis could include fever, lethargy, eye changes such as conjunctivitis, cloudy, or red eyes; abnormal bleeding and swellings, small spots or bruising; and swellings on the body and limbs. [Owners in other countries have reported that ehrlichiosis positive animals have seemed more tired and less interested in normal daily things, such as a walk. - Mod.TG]

"When detected early, antibiotics may be used to treat the disease," Dr Cooke said.

"Prevention is crucial as there is no vaccine for the disease.

"Protect your dogs from ehrlichiosis by regularly checking them for ticks, using effective tick control, and seeking veterinary advice promptly if they become unwell," he said.

Dr Cooke said owners should regularly check their dog for ticks by running fingers through the coat, on the skin, paying attention to the head, neck, ears, chest, between their toes, and around their mouth and gums.

"Be particularly vigilant if you're taking your dog out bush and travelling interstate."

Dr Cooke said ehrlichiosis is a notifiable disease in Victoria, which means it must be reported to the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on when disease is suspected.

"If your dog is unwell or you find any abnormal bumps or ticks, make sure you promptly arrange to take your dog to your vet. Discuss with your vet the testing system in place for ehrlichiosis in Victoria.

"Put a tick in a clean resealable bag and take it to your local veterinarian to submit for identification. Freeze the bag with the tick first if you cannot take it to a vet immediately. If you are unsure about what is an appropriate tick control product to use, then consult your Veterinary advisor."

Dr Kelsey Fyffe at the Barkly Veterinary Practice at Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory said the Horsham dog would not be dropping infected ticks if it was undergoing tick prevention treatment. She advised dog owners to get their dogs on a tick prevention program, involving a tick repellent collar and/or medication available from veterinarians.

She said a dog could become infected with the disease through one bite from an infected tick.

"So the collar in some ways is better if you have a dog tolerant of it; the collar itself is adequate to stop the ticks from getting on your dog.

"In an ideal world, the perfect scenario, you would go for both," she said.

"If you've got dogs where you know you've got a tick problem, then it would be really worth having them on the tablet to kill any ticks that are coming and going because if it gets into the tick population we need to try to eliminate that tick population."

Dr Fyffe said the disease is treatable, especially if cases are identified early. She advised people moving dogs out of or into high tick zones to get them inspected for ticks.

On rare occasions, humans can become infected through the bite of an infected tick. Please seek medical advice if you feel unwell after being exposed to ticks.

["Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME) develops after a dog has become infected with _Ehrlichia canis_ bacteria, which are primarily transmitted to dogs through the bites of brown dog ticks (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_). Brown dog ticks can be found throughout the United States [and Australia] (and worldwide), but are especially problematic in warmer climates, which means that ehrlichiosis is also most frequently diagnosed in these areas.

"Dogs will [usually] appear perfectly normal for 1 to 3 weeks after being bitten by a tick carrying _E. canis_ bacteria. If the dog is unable to fight off the infection during this time, the pet will enter what is known as the acute phase of infection. During this time, the bacteria are actively reproducing within a certain type of white blood cell and are spreading throughout the body. Dogs can display a variety of symptoms during the acute phase of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, including fever, lethargy, poor appetite, lymph node enlargement, abnormal bruising and bleeding, chronic eye inflammation, neurologic abnormalities, and occasionally lameness.

"These signs will typically last for 2 to 4 weeks [occasionally longer] if left untreated. Many dogs then appear to get better on their own and enter a subclinical phase of the disease, which can last for months to years. During the subclinical phase, blood work may reveal a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), but otherwise, dogs typically appear to be perfectly normal. Some dogs never progress out of the subclinical phase of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, but others eventually enter the chronic phase of the disease. Signs are similar to those described above for the acute phase, but the longer they go on, the harder they become to treat. [Even dogs in subclinical phases, appear to have less energy, and frequently require longer or more frequent rest periods. - Mod.TG]

"Another type of ehrlichiosis, called canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis (CGE), is caused by infection with _E. ewingii_ bacteria, which are typically transmitted through the bites of lone star ticks (_Amblyomma americanum_). Lone star ticks are primarily found in the Eastern, Southeastern, and Midwestern parts of the United States.

"The typical signs of CGE are a little different than those that are seen with CME and include fever, lethargy, lameness is common and often appears as stiffness when walking, vomiting, diarrhea, and neurologic abnormalities.

"Whichever form of ehrlichiosis a dog has, it is important your pet be evaluated by a veterinarian as quickly as possible. Diagnosing ehrlichiosis can be somewhat complicated. Many of the signs of ehrlichiosis are indistinguishable from those seen with other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, lymphosarcoma, and certain immune disorders. As part of the diagnostic process, most veterinarians will collect a complete health history, perform a thorough physical exam, and then run a complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry panel, urinalysis, fecal examination, and specific lab work aimed at diagnosing ehrlichiosis.

"Keep in mind the tests commonly used to screen for ehrlichiosis only indicate whether a dog has been exposed to _Ehrlichia_ bacteria, and some dogs are exposed but don't go on to become sick. Therefore, to be definitively diagnosed with ehrlichiosis, a dog should test positive for exposure, have some of the common signs of the disease, and respond to appropriate treatment. Other types of _Ehrlichia_ tests are available to confirm a diagnosis of ehrlichiosis and can be used in complicated cases. [Don't wait to find out how your pet responds. Have the vet send blood to a veterinary diagnostic lab with specific tests available for a diagnosis. - Mod.TG]

"Veterinarians most commonly prescribe the antibiotic doxycycline to treat ehrlichiosis in dogs. It is typically given once a day for 3 to 4 weeks [or may be given twice daily depending on all conditions of the pet. - Mod.TG]. Other medications can also be used when the situation warrants.

"If a dog receives treatment in a timely manner, the condition will usually begin to improve rapidly, oftentimes within just a few days, and the prognosis for complete recovery is good. In more severe cases, additional treatments (such as intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, immunosuppressive medications, and/or pain relievers) may also be necessary.

"Ehrlichiosis is a very serious disease, and dogs having been infected once can develop it again. No vaccine is currently available to protect dogs against ehrlichiosis, although research is being done into developing one. As of now, the best way to prevent dogs from developing ehrlichiosis is to protect them from tick bites. Your veterinarian can recommend the best form of tick prevention based on your dog's health, lifestyle, and the prevalence of ticks and ehrlichiosis in your area."
