*****[This is not a continuation of the outbreak in March 2008,
reported in ProMED ref. 20080331.1194 below. This is another episode
whicb only began this month, August 2008 -- see ProMED
ref.20080811.2478 below. - Mod.JW]*****

Rural Kanpur is fighting its most frightening scourge -- a mystery
disease that has left a long line of bodies in its trail and doesn't
seem anywhere near finished.

What started from one village 2 weeks ago [week of 9 Aug 2008] has
now spread to 350 and has so far claimed 160 lives. Thousands more
are bed-ridden. On an average, 15 to 20 people have been dying every
day; Saturday [23 Aug 2008) saw the highest toll in a day: 24.

The district's health department is somewhat confused about the
nature of the disease that has struck. At the beginning, the
diagnosis was viral fever. Then doctors concluded that it was
falciparum malaria. But after 2 weeks, they have ruled out both, but
still don't have an exact answer.

"We really don't know what exactly it is; we are depending on the
finding of a team of specialists from New Delhi," said Dr RC Agarwal,
the district's new chief medical officer.

Specialists from the Infectious Disease and Surveillance Programme,
New Delhi, have collected the blood samples of a few patients. The
team will make its findings known in a few days.

But the fear of the unknown has resulted in a mass exodus of
villagers. Pulandar and Dhar villages under Malasa block are the
worst affected. About 1000 people in these 2 villages alone are
battling the disease. Dhar has taken the maximum number of
casualties. The village has lost about 30 people but only one doctor
has visited it so far. That was 15 days ago.

Dhar still remains a perfect picture of neglect and apathy. Heaps of
garbage continue to be littered all over. Houses are surrounded by
stinking filth and roads are waterlogged -- perfect breeding grounds
for diseases like malaria. The village's secondary school has been
shut down for an indefinite period. Children would wade through
knee-deep water to reach the school.

[This outbreak of undiagnosed disease has spread dramatically since
the initial report dated 11 Aug 2008 (see: Undiagnosed fatal illness
- India (02): (UP) RFI 20080811.2478). The disease has now spread to
affect some 350 villages in the Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh,
affecting thousands of people with the death toll now at 160. There
appears to have been no progress in identification of the cause of the
outbreak, other than that malaria and unspecified viral fevers have
been excluded. There is no description of the signs and symptoms of
the disease, but the suspicion of water-borne infection remains in
view of the reported neglected state of the villages and persisting
flooding and lack of adequate drainage.

The results of the analysis of diagnostic materials collected from
villagers are awaited with some impatience. The lack of medical
support for the villagers is alarming.

The Indian state of Uttar Pradesh can be located using the
