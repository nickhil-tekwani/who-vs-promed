Black Sigatoka disease (caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella
fijiensis_) was described for the first time in a Caribbean
island (Cuba) in 1991, although it had been present in countries
adjoining the Caribbean since the 1970's. It recently appeared
in Jamaica. The Caribbean banana industry is thus threatened by
this extremely destructive disease. The symptoms are described
in 6 stages from the appearance of a white or yellow streak on
the underside of the leaf until the final stage in which the
centre of the black plot becomes entirely dry and greyish-white in
colour. Control methods include cultural techniques (drainage,
weed management and the removal and burning of diseased leaves),
the use of chemicals (fungicide, mineral oils) in a prevention
system and the use of resistant plant material such as 'FHIA-01',
'FHIA-07' and 'FHIA-21' from Honduras.
