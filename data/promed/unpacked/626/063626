Ohio state health officials reported a human infection with a novel influenza A virus, according to the latest CDC FluView.

The patient was infected with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N2) variant (A(H1N2)v) virus. The patient is under 18 years of age, was not hospitalized, and has recovered from their illness.

An investigation by local public health officials found that the patient had attended an agricultural fair on the day of their illness onset. Additional investigation did not identify respiratory illness in any of the patient's household contacts.

A total of 5 human infections with variant influenza A viruses have been reported in the United States in 2022, including 3 H3N2v (West Virginia) and 2 H1N2v (Ohio, Oregon) viruses.

When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a "variant influenza virus." Most human infections with variant influenza viruses occur following close proximity to swine, but human-to-human transmission has occurred previously. It is important to note that in most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person.

[Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called "variant viruses." They also can be denoted by adding the letter "v" to the end of the virus subtype designation. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States. Most commonly, human infections with variant viruses occur in people with exposure to infected pigs (e.g., children near pigs at a fair or workers in the swine industry). This is thought to happen mainly when an infected pig coughs or sneezes and droplets with influenza virus in them spread through the air.

A total of 31 H1N2v viruses have been reported from the US since 2011 with 2 cases reported in 2022 from Oregon and Ohio [https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html].

The case reported above had an epidemiological link, with possible exposure during an agricultural fair which is the case in a large number of human infections with swine variant viruses.

The CDC recommendations in this regard for people coming in contact with pigs include;
- Don't take food or drink into pig areas; don't eat, drink or put anything in your mouth in pig areas.
- Don't take toys, pacifiers, cups, baby bottles, strollers, or similar items into pig areas.
- Avoid close contact with pigs that look or act ill.
- Wash hands with soap and running water before and after exposure to pigs or a swine barn. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
- To further reduce the risk of infection, minimize contact with pigs in the pig barns and show arenas.
- Take additional protective measures if one must come in contact with pigs that are known or suspected to be sick. This includes minimizing contact with pigs and wearing personal protective equipment like protective clothing, gloves and well-fitted masks that cover the mouth and nose when contact is required.

Anyone who is at higher risk of serious flu complications (the elderly, immuno-compromised or pregnant etc.) who are planning to attend an event or setting where pigs will be present, such as an agricultural fair, should avoid pigs and swine barns. - Mod.UBA
