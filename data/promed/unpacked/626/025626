I am writing in response to the posting on _Mycobacterium abscessus_
infections in patients who have undergone plastic surgery in the
Dominican Republic. We have seen a patient with a similar-sounding
story; she underwent liposuction in Santo Domingo in November 2003,
then presented to her primary care physician here in Boston in
February 2004 with abdominal pain. A CT scan showed collections in
the anterior abdominal wall that were felt to be hematomas but
enlarged over the course of several weeks, at which time she was sent
to interventional radiology for catheter drainage (on 1 Mar 2004).
Cultures have recently returned with a rapidly-growing mycobacterium
identified by our state lab as _M. abscessus_. Any available
information about antibiotic susceptibility testing results on
isolates suspected to be from the same source would be
much-appreciated!

[This is now the 2nd report ProMED-mail has received on the
occurrence of _Mycobacterium abscessus_ infection in individuals who
had had liposuction procedures performed in the Dominican Republic.
In the first report (see Mycobacterium abscessus - USA ex Dominican
Republic 20040501.1200) there was discussion that 4 of the 5 cases
reported had been performed at the same clinic in Santo Domingo. This
new case has been reported to the CDC for further investigation.
Information on the antibiotic susceptibility testing results on
isolates suspected to be from the same source should be sent directly
to Dr. Miriam Baron <mbaron@partners.org>.
Repeating information from the 1st posting, if there are additional
suspected cases, they should be reported to CDC.
The CDC contact is:
Arjun Srinivasan, MD
Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

It will be very important for me to known which laboratory made the
classification of this Mycobacteria since there are only two that
could made it and one of them is the one where I work in.
Thanks,

[Dr. Baron tells us that the speciation of the Boston isolate was
performed at the State Laboratory Institute of the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health. Anyone with information on the other
isolate should contact Vicente Garcia directly. - Mod.LM]
