A French company said Tuesday [23 Sep 2008] it had ordered the
withdrawal of a batch of powdered baby milk sold exclusively in
pharmacies after traces of salmonella [See moderator's comments
below. - Mod.LL] were found in 8 babies.

Stressing that there was no link to a milk scandal gripping China,
Novalac said it had taken the precautionary step on suspicion that
salmonella was present in boxes of AR Digest with the expiry date 18
Jun 2011. "Boxes corresponding to this batch number 10 must not be
used and must be returned to pharmacies," it said in a statement.

Salmonella had been observed in the feces of 8 babies, and Novalac
had been alerted to the problem on Monday [22 Sep 2008], the company
told Reuters. The batch in question consisted of some 4500 cartons
filled with boxes of the powdered milk and had been on sale since
early July 2008, it said.

[The reference to "traces of salmonella" is misleading and implies
just a little bit of bacteria of no consequence. The term "traces"
here should be placed in the same category as "just a little bit
pregnant." Salmonellosis is often a life-threatening disease in infants.

The serotype of the pathogen involved in this recall is not stated.
Earlier this year 2008, _S._ Kedougou was linked to infant formula in
Spain, and previous episodes of salmonellosis and enterbacteriosis
have been caused by powdered milk or infant formula, as seen below. - Mod.LL]
