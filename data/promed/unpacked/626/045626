A deadly new disease has emerged that is wiping out amphibians, scientists report. A number of viruses have been found in northern Spain that are killing frog, toad, and newt [salamander] species. Infected animals can suffer from ulcers on their skin and die from internal bleeding. Researchers fear the strains, which belong to the _Ranavirus_ group, have already spread to other countries. The study is published in the journal Current Biology.

Lead author Dr Stephen Price, from University College London [UCL], said: "Until the outbreaks, we didn't really know about this lineage of virus. But since these die-offs began, we've started to see them elsewhere -- in China in giant salamanders, and it looks like they are emerging in places like France and the Netherlands as well."

Dead amphibians were first spotted in the Picos de Europa National Park, in Spain, in 2005. Two of the viruses, called CMTV-like [common midwife toad-like virus] ranaviruses, were infecting large numbers of animals. What is unusual is that they can jump between a range of species, killing off frogs, toads, and newts.

Dr Price said: "In the Picos de Europa National Park, we've seen major population collapses in 3 species: the common midwife toad, the common toad, and the alpine newt. But we also found all the common amphibian species in the park were highly susceptible and experiencing disease and mortality. It is a pretty graphic disease with a high kill-rate. We've shown these viruses have caused simultaneous declines in several species of host."

The researchers believe the virus can even spread to reptiles. "We recorded a snake that had been feeding on amphibians infected with disease, and it showed signs of the virus," said Dr Price.

Conservationists are especially worried about these new viruses because 41 per cent of all amphibians already face extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Another disease, called chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world, killing off many populations. Scientists fear that if the new viruses spread, they could have a devastating effect on these already vulnerable animals. The research was carried out by scientists at UCL, the Zoological Society of London, Queen Mary University of London, the Museum of Natural Science in Madrid, and the Picos de Europa National Park.

The report describes the introduction and invasion of highly virulent viruses (genus _Ranavirus_, family _Iridoviridae_) causing mass mortality in diverse amphibian hosts in northern Spain.

A novel lineage of _Ranavirus_, called CMTV-like ranavirus, recently emerged in northern Spain and is able to cause death in all amphibian species so far studied. This pathogen may have the capacity of emerging in amphibian host communities across Europe.

Picos de Europa is a range of mountains 20 km [about 12.5 mi] inland from the northern coast of Spain, located in the Autonomous Communities of Asturias, Cantabria, and Castile and Leon, forming part of the Cantabrian Mountains (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picos_de_Europa).
