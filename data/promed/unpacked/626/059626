Foot-and-Mouth Disease: Control measures agreed for Cyprus
----------------------------------------------------------
Member States today [6 Nov 2007] backed a Commission Decision on
protection measures due to foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Cyprus.
The decision follows the confirmation of the outbreak by the Cypriot
authorities yesterday [5 Nov 2007] based on the results of tests
carried out by the Community Reference Laboratory in Pirbright (UK)
which were positive for the O type of the virus, and the detection of
clinical signs in some sheep.

The Cypriot authorities had reported suspicions of FMD in sheep in
the Larnaca District some days ago, and had on that basis already
implemented the measures which the Decision confirms. The Commission
has also sent 2 experts from the EU emergency veterinary team to
Cyprus to provide technical on-the-spot support. The Standing
Committee also endorsed a Commission proposal to amend further the
FMD restrictions in Great Britain, due to the favourable disease
situation there.

In response to the outbreak of FMD in sheep in Dromolaxia, the
Standing Committee today voted in favour of a Decision reinforcing
the precautionary measures in Cyprus. In line with EU legislation,
the Cypriot authorities culled the sheep in the affected flocks and
established a 3km [1.86-mile] protection zone and 10km [6.2-mile]
surveillance zone around the infected holding. Within these zones,
stringent movement restrictions apply, surveillance has been stepped
up and biosecurity measures have been strengthened.

Under the Decision agreed today, these measures are confirmed and
Cyprus has been categorised as a high risk zone. This means that
there is a standstill on all livestock movements and no live cattle,
sheep, goats or pigs, or products from these animals, can be
dispatched from Cyprus, and other Member States cannot send any such
live animals to Cyprus. In accordance with the provisions of EU
legislation, the Decision allows certain derogations whereby certain
safe products (including halloumi cheese, which is heat-treated
before leaving the dairy) will still be allowed to be exported.
Livestock will only be allowed to be moved to slaughterhouses so long
as strict animal health conditions are met. The Commission is working
closely with the Cypriot authorities to help them contain and
eradicate the virus, and has sent a number of EU experts to Cyprus to
assist with the situation.

The slaughter begins
--------------------
The European Commission yesterday [5 Nov 2007] banned the export of
meat and dairy products from Cyprus as the Veterinary Services
slaughtered 300 animals suspected of suffering from foot and mouth
disease (FMD).

Spyros Leventis, the head of the Sheep and Goat Farmers' Committee,
yesterday [5 Nov 2007] insisted the farmers be allowed to bring in
their own experts to test for the disease. "We don't have FMD, none
of our animals have died and there has been no scientific
documentation proving our animals are infected with this illness," he said.

The government has promised to stand by the farmers and compensate
them, not just for the animals culled or lost earnings, but also to
fund their efforts to rebuild their businesses. The Cabinet is set to
approve the compensatory measures, ordered by President Tassos
Papadopoulos, during tomorrow's meeting.

But an out-of-schedule meeting by the House Agriculture Committee
yesterday proved farmers' concerns were not just financial.

"Two hundred children and 100 grandchildren of mine were killed this
morning," a tearful Demetris Dirris, one of 2 farmers whose animals
were culled yesterday morning, told the committee.

"They have destroyed me; I haven't eaten or slept for 2 days," he
went on. "I'm 58 and unemployed. What am I going to do now? I have
been rearing and caring for these animals since I was 4 years old."

When the 1st suspected cases were spotted 2 weeks ago in Dromolaxia,
samples were sent to the European Lab in London for further testing.
They came back negative, to the great relief of all involved.
However, as the Veterinary Services checked a further 5 farms near
the Dromolaxia farm, more sheep showed signs of FMD [see comment]. In
total, 23 out of the 55 sheep initially tested positive.

"An EU official visited the farms and warned us that if he found
clinical symptoms in the animals, then it was FMD," Fotiou explained
during the parliamentary meeting, adding that the official later
confirmed the sheep were showing clinical symptoms [see comment].

"So we moved ahead with the cull straight away. We had no choice. It
wasn't easy to do," the minister added.

The joint decision by the EU Lab and the European Commission was
clear, Fotiou said: "All sheep in that flock must be killed. I
visited the farm myself and I won't forget the farmer telling me:
'Dear Minister, I don't want money, I want the animals that I lived
to bring up.' But we had to take measures; and we will take more if
it is needed."

Fotiou admitted the government was still in no position to determine
the precise dimensions of the problem and whether the disease had
spread to the rest of the island. He said the government was awaiting
the results of an expert analysis on how foot and mouth arrived in
Cyprus. He warned the public against assumptions, such as that the
infected animals may have been illegally transported from the
occupied areas, or imported illegally from Romania or Bulgaria.

"These are all guesses, nothing has been confirmed," Fotiou pointed
out. The minister said he was expecting the EU to order the slaughter
of more animals.

Charalambos Kakoyiannis, the head of the Veterinary Services,
informed deputies that there were 15 000 animals in the 3-km
[1.86-mile] zone and a staggering 150 000 animals in the 10km [6.2-mile] zone.

"What is happening is extremely sad, and catastrophic to the specific
sector but also to the state economy," he said.

[This is a rather puzzling event, yet to be satisfactorily clarified.

According to the official "immediate notification" of Cyprus to the
OIE, submitted 6 Nov 2007, the outbreak started 22 Oct 2007; it was
confirmed 1 Nov 2007; and it was a clinical disease caused by FMD
virus serotype O. Out of 324 susceptible animals, there were 19
cases, there was no mortality, and all 324 sheep were destroyed. The
notification includes the following "epidemiological comments:"

"On 22 Oct 2007, a farmer brought to a District Veterinary Office a
2-year-old ewe with redness on the tongue, lesions on the lips and
lameness. Samples were taken on 23 Oct 2007 from animals of the farm
and were sent to the State Veterinary Laboratories with the suspicion
of bluetongue. Test for bluetongue was carried out but was negative.
The samples were then examined for FMD. Eight samples out of 25 were
positive in the NSP ELISA carried out in Cyprus. Samples were
forwarded to the OIE Reference Laboratory at Pirbright. Probang
samples were also sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory. All results
of the tests carried out at the OIE Reference Laboratory on samples
of the 1st suspicion were negative. Sampling continued on flocks in a
one-km-radius zone around the 1st suspicion. A total of 3 other
flocks were found positive in the NSP ELISA at the National Reference
Laboratory. Samples from these flocks were sent to the OIE Reference
Laboratory on 1 Nov 2007. On 5 Nov 2007, the OIE Reference Laboratory
communicated the final results which confirmed the presence of FMD
virus serotype O. Protection and surveillance zones were established."

The report further specifies the tests carried out: The National
Cyprus laboratory applied ELISA 3ABC test [which is a test for NSP]
on 1 Nov 2007, found positive. The IAH Pirbright laboratory carried
out neutralisation test, completed on 5 Nov 2007, with positive results.

For the full report and a map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6436>.


From the above information it appears that the initial (23 Oct 2007)
case(s) was/were apparently clinically suspected as bluetongue (a
plausible preliminary suspicion, as apparent from the provided
description). Tested in the Cyprus laboaratory and found negative
(which test was applied?!), these sera samples were tested
serologically for NSP (Non structural protein) and found, in Cyprus,
positive. Such tests may be interpreted as indicative of past
exposure to a live FMD virus. However, Probang sample (namely
tissues derived from the oropharynx), sampled 23 Oct 2007 from the
suspected animals and sent to Pirbright, were found negative.

The current results from Pirbright are serological (Neutralisation
test). Have no tissue samples been sent from the sheep sampled 1 Nov 2007?

No clinical signs of these sheep are included in the official report.
Did they show any? These issues deserve explanation.

Demonstrating neutralising antibodies against FMDV O may be
indicative of a past exposure to FMDV O, the timing and location of
which still to be determined. Are these results indeed indicative of
a recent virus circulation in Cyprus?! Experts' view is anticipated.

Information on the nature of the laboratory test for bluetongue
which, reportedly, was found negative, will also help. Serological
testing for bluetongue in the other suspected flocks deserves
consideration as well. - Mod.AS]
