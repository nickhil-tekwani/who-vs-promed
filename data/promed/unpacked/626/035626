Cargill Meat Solutions Recalls Ground Beef Products Due To Possible _E. coli O26 Contamination
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cargill Meat Solutions, a Fort Morgan, CO establishment, is recalling approximately 132 606 pounds of ground beef products made from the chuck portion of the carcass that may be contaminated with _Escherichia coli_ O26, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, [Wed 19 Sep 2018].

The ground beef items were produced and packaged on [21 Jun 2018]. The following products are subject to recall: [see original URL - Mod.LL]. The products subject to recall bear establishment number "EST. 86R" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

On [16 Aug 2018], FSIS was notified of an investigation of _E. coli_ O26 illnesses. FSIS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state public health and agriculture partners determined that raw ground beef was the probable source of the reported illnesses. The epidemiological investigation identified 17 illnesses and 1 death with illness onset dates ranging from [5 Jul 2018] to [25 Jul 2018].

The Cargill Meat Solutions' ground beef products were identified following further investigation related to Recall 072-2018, conducted on [30 Aug 2018], where ground beef products were recalled in connection with the _E. coli_ O26 outbreak. FSIS' traceback information indicated that case-patients consumed ground beef products purchased at various retail stores that were supplied by Cargill Meat Solutions.

_E. coli_ O26, like the more common _E. coli_ O157:H7, is a serovar of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ or EHEC - Mod.LL]. People can become ill from STECs 2-8 days (average of 3-4 days) after exposure to the organism. Most people infected with EHEC O26 develop diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antimicrobial treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week, but rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure, is common with EHEC O26 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at <www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls>.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160Â°F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ. Consumers should take proper precautions when handling raw meat products. Proper hand washing after handling raw meat, poultry and eggs can greatly reduce the risk of bacterial cross-contamination to other foods and kitchen surfaces. It is important to prevent cross-contamination by washing counter tops and sinks with hot, soapy water.

[Although not specifically stated, it appears that this is related to the recent report of EHEC from ground beef in Florida (see "See Also").

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the former serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (3), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. Five (18%) of O157 infections developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); none of the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157 strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce HUS, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (4).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear.
