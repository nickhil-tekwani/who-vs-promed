Background information on Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever
------------------------------------------------------
Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever [VHF was first reported as an outbreak (15
cases, 9 fatal) in Portuguesa state during 1989. Subsequent cases were
reported from Barinas state. To date, this disease has been limited to
Venezuela. Highest rates (41 percent of cases) are reported during December
to January.
The clinical features of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever are similar to those
of Argentine hemorrhagic fever; however, pharyngitis is common in VHF. The
local reservoir appears to be the cane rat (_Zygodontomys brevicada_).
Cotton rats (_Sigmodon alstoni_) are infected by a related arenavirus
(Pirital virus) of unknown significance to humans.

Re: Moderator's Comment on the Rodent Host of Guanarito Virus
-------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think the rodents that transmit Guanarito virus would be described
as "commensal" or even "semi-commensal." There is to my knowledge no
evidence that they live within houses or are dependent on humans for their
existence. A commensal rodent would be one such as _Mus musculus_ that
exists almost exclusively in human company. I am not sure what
"semi-commensal" means. One might think of _Calomys callosus_, the
reservoir of Machupo virus [the causative agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic
fever, as a semi-commensal when extensive numbers are found within houses
of small villages and seem to show a clear dependence on human presence;
even then, most of the numbers of this species is really independent of
humans.

[My comment was based on information taken from the chapter on Arenaviruses
by M.S. Salvato and S.K. Rai in Topley and Wilson's "Microbiology and
Microbial Infections," Ninth Edition, Volume 1, pp 628-650, Arnold, 1998.
Here commensal and semi-commensal are defined as "living with humans or in
cultivated fields". - Mod.CP
