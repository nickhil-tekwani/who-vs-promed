[The outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis included in these updates have the
characteristics of "winter vomiting disease", and are presumed to be caused
by Norwalk-like viruses (caliciviruses classified in the genus
_Norovirus_), although this is rarely confirmed microbiologically. The UK
and Ireland seem to be particularly prone at present to outbreaks of
"winter-vomiting" disease in institutional settings. - Mod.CP]

Viral gastroenteritis outbreaks at hospitals in Kettering and Northampton
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Winter vomiting illness has wiped out waiting list operations in Kettering
in the past month and now the first cases have been confirmed at
Northampton General [Hospital]. Family and friends of patients in
Northampton have been told to stay away or only visit for short periods if
necessary, to limit further infection.
A spokeswoman for Northampton General Hospital said: "We have had some
cases of the winter vomiting disease virus but we are not in an outbreak
situation because so far they have been sporadic. "Infection control has
been increased and restrictions have been placed on visiting times."
This week Kettering General [Hospital] continues to turn away waiting list
patients because staff and patients are still falling ill. However the
number of new cases diagnosed is gradually dropping.
Last year winter vomiting illness shut down several hospitals in Scotland
as it spread through staff and patients. The virus can reach huge amounts
of people once it is inside a hospital. Symptoms take a few days to
manifest so visitors bring it in from the community, as do staff. Patients
are always more vulnerable to infection and many arrive with one complaint
and quickly pick up the virus. Hygiene rules like always washing hands and
wearing gloves and disposable aprons are reinforced to prevent cross infection.

Scotland: outbreak of Norwalk-like virus infection in cancer hospital
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cancer patients are the latest victims of the winter vomiting [disease
virus]. A ward at the Beatson Oncology Centre in Glasgow has been closed to
new admissions because of an outbreak of the virus infection. Eight
patients and 3 members of staff have shown symptoms of the illness, which
has struck hospitals throughout Scotland over the past few months. A
Beatson Centre spokesman said no-one was in any danger, and the 21 bed
ward, F3, would re-open when the infection had cleared. Emergency
admissions were being accommodated elsewhere in the centre, and normal
patient care was not affected, she added. She said it would be tomorrow "at
the earliest before we admit any more patients to the ward".

Scotland: viral gastroenteritis closes wards in 2 Lanarkshire hospitals
--------------------------------------------
Patients and staff at 2 hospitals in Scotland have been struck by a mystery
infection which has closed two wards. The 2 wards, both for elderly people,
one at Hairmyres Hospital and one at Wishaw General Hospital, both in
Lanarkshire, have been hit by a vomiting and diarrhea outbreak.
A spokesman for Lanarkshire Health Board said 9 patients and 2 members of
staff at Hairmyres Hospital and 8 patients and one member of staff at the
Wishaw hospital have been affected. One patient with the illness at
Hairmyres died on Fri 15 Nov 2002, but the spokesman said this was due to
"prior medical conditions". He said in both cases the infection control
team was notified, outbreak control meetings were held and the wards were
closed to admissions. "Infection control measures were put in place and
staff movement within the hospital was restricted," he said.
There are fears the infection could spread after 8 other staff members
working in various areas of the Hairmyres Hospital also reported symptoms.
The spokesman said: "The outbreak control team will continue to monitor the
position with a high degree of vigilance." "No patients are giving cause
for concern."
