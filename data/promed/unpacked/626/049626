BSE AND TRANSMISSIBLE MINK ENCEPHALOPATHY (2)

Subject: Re: BSE and Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy (TME)
Thanks to Ken Boschert for providing the citation of the paper published by
Marsh et. al. on the Wisconsin TME outbreak. The mistaken impression that
has come out of this publication is that it "proved" the existence of a
spongiform encephalopathly disease in the U.S. cattle population. This is
patently untrue. What the paper "proved" was that if you take brain material
from TME infected mink and inject it into calves you can produce a spongiform
encephalopathy in the calves which proves transmissibility of TME to calves
using this route and dose. They went on to show that the TME disease could
subsequently be transmitted back to mink by inoculation of the TME infected
calves' brain material. THIS DOES NOT "PROVE" THE EXISTENCE OF A SPONGIFORM
ENCEPHALOPATHY DISEASE IN U.S. CATTLE!!! In fact, no conclusions about the
presence or absence of a spongiform encephalopathy disease in the U.S. cattle
population can be derived from this study.

[- It is strongly recommended that members try to get a hold of Marsh's
paper and read it carefully; J General Virology (1991) 72:589-594. The
TME agent is apparently not scrapie but it can be fed to mink after passage
through calves and subsequently produce TME clinically and histopathologically;
mink are apparently not susceptible to oral exposure to scrapied sheep brains.
However TME has certain characteristics that suggest it cannot be BSE,
for example it does not affect mice; other information is provided in
the next communication in this thread. Marsh and colleagues carefully argue
that TME and BSE are separate conditions. While they comment on epidemiological
grounds that the origin of the "Stetsonville" outbreak of TME may have been
bovine, they also point out that if so it must be extremely rare as the ranch
had been feeding fallen and sick cattle for 35 years without any similar
problems. As Akey points out, this is not necessarily proof that a sporadic
form of SE occurs in US cattle. To date, throughout the USA some 2700 brains
from fallen cattle have been examined for SE-lesions and none found.
