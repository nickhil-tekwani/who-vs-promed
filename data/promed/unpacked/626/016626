Suspected Viral Diarrhea Affects 2 Primary Schools in Guangzhou
---------------------------------------------------
Guangzhou Municipal Health Bureau has reported that over the past 2 weeks
there have been numerous outbreaks of food poisoning in Guangzhou. Among
these there have been [suspected viral diarrhea outbreaks at 2 primary
schools. Most patients were young pupils. [The infection] was spread
primarily through water and food. The Guangzhou Disease Control Center
stated that according to the results of their survey, the intestinal virus
causing this type of diarrhea has never before appeared in Guangzhou.
However, the Disease Control Center is in the process of identifying the virus.
[In the afternoon of] 20 Oct 2003, several dozen students at a primary
school in the Yuexiu District [of Guangzhou] collectively experienced
fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. At the outset, relevant departments
classified the incident as food poisoning. At the outset most of the cases
were among 1st, 2nd, and 6th graders in this school's South Building. But 2
days later, cases had spread to other grades in this school's North
Building. On 21 Oct 2003, a similar situation occurred at a different
primary school in the Tianhe District [of Guangzhou]. By 24 Oct 2003
several dozen students appeared with similar symptoms at the two schools.
Of these 90 percent had fever, ill temper, vomiting, and other symptoms; 49
percent of students had abdominal pain and diarrhea .
Assistant Director Ma Lin of the Municipal Disease Control Center says this
type of illness has [the characteristics of an infectious disease] and it
primarily occurs in the autumn. Initial symptoms are vomiting, abdominal
pain, and diarrhea. A minority of people also have accompanying fever.
According to findings, 80 percent of [cases of] this illness are
transmitted in the early stage by food and water. After symptoms have set
in, [another] 20 percent can be spread by person-to-person contact such as
handshaking, contact with commonly used instruments, etc. Therefore, it was
necessary to completely disinfect the schools before cases could be totally
brought under control. Besides this, the disease control center discovered
that a sizable portion of students had eaten seafood before becoming ill.

[It is not possible to identify the nature of the infection from the
confused information provided. On the one hand, the association with
seafood suggests a bacterial infection, whereas the vomiting and sudden
onset suggest a norovirus infection. Further information would be welcomed.

Beijing: Children's Hospital Receiving 1000 Pediatric Diarrhea Cases Daily
-------------------------------------------------
Over the past 2 weeks, the clinic of Children's Hospital has seen about
2000 patient visits each day. Of these about 1000 are pediatric diarrhea
patients. What is different from normal is that this year's diarrhea virus
comes on more ferociously and the illness quickly worsens. This reporter
learned yesterday from the Beijing Municipal Children's Hospital that
experts currently are beginning to suspect that this is a new type of virus.
This afternoon, Children's Hospital will hold an urgent training session
for medical personnel to discuss prevention and treatment of this diarrhea
virus. Yesterday, when this reporter visited Beijing Municipal Children's
Hospital, loud cries continuously pierced the air in the main room of the
emergency clinic. Along 2 rows of benches sick children sat densely
packed, receiving IV therapy.
Dr. Fan of the Internal Medicine Department told this reporter that
pediatric diarrhea is a commonly seen ailment. Normally, peak occurrence is
from November to December. This year, because the temperature dropped
quickly, the diarrhea virus also came early. At the end of October, [cases
of the virus] started to appear one after the other. Last year's diarrhea
was primarily brought about by the spread of rotavirus, and occurred mostly
among children under 3, especially infants under 18 months. Now there is
already a vaccine against rotavirus, but the vaccine takes 2-3 months to
take effect.
From the perspective of this year's situation, based on an evaluation of
clinical symptoms of the diarrhea, there is a high probability that this is
a new virus. Normally it takes 5 days after diarrhea appears in small
children for dehydration, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and other critical
conditions to set in. This year children are experiencing dehydration one
to 2 days after diarrhea appears, and the disease progresses swiftly and
violently. Yesterday, Children's Hospital already started to organize
rapid viral exams of clinic and in-patient pediatric patients, but because
laboratory parameters are incomplete, they have yet to yield results.
To discuss this year's new viral diarrhea, and ensure that pediatric
diarrhea patients receive timely and effective treatment, Children's
Hospital will organize urgent training for doctors and head nurses this
afternoon. [The meeting will be] moderated by the hospital's digestion
expert[s] to research countermeasures to treat the new virus, how to
prevent spread within the hospital, isolation of seriously ill pediatric
patients and other work. Dr. Fan said the hospital is now using hydration
and methods to resolve DKA, which are proving to be effective. Parents of
ill children need not be worried, but should seek timely treatment.
Observation of inpatients [led medical staff to believe that] many worsened
their situation by mistakenly putting off a visit to the doctor. Since the
force of this year's virus is so strong, parents should be especially
observant of children. Always keep in mind body temperature, mental
attitude, the frequency and volume of bowel movements, whether or not
diarrhea is present, excessive crying, and signs of dehydration. If the
fever does not recede, temperament is [high], or diarrhea is serious; or if
the eyes appear sunken, lips are dry, crying does not produce tears, urine
output is low or none, and other symptoms of dehydration, medical
assistance should be sought immediately.
Autumn diarrhea can lead to myocarditis, meningitis, etc., so prompt
hospital care is needed. If illness suddenly occurs, the doctor will teach
small self-help techniques: During diarrhea you should not consume milk
and should consume thin rice gruel. Adding a little sugar and salt to the
rice gruel is very effective. Children with serious symptoms should not
eat for 6-24 hours. After a certain time symptoms will improve and you can
gradually restore your diet. When eating you must go from a little to a
lot, from diluted to thick. For mildly dehydrated children, oral
rehydration salts can be taken to recuperate; for severe dehydration,
intravenous infusions should be used to restore electrolyte imbalances.

[It is not possible to identify the etiologic agent on the basis of the
information available. The suggestion that a new virus is responsible for
the outbreak is unwarranted at this stage. Rotavirus infection appears to
have been discounted, but the viral nature of the illness appears not to
have been confirmed. Again, further information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
