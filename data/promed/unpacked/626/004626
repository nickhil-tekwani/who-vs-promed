[1] Cholera - Syria: fatal, alert

Cholera has broken out in Syria, with one child having already died after contracting the disease -- and the outbreak could constitute an "international threat." The break-out, which follows one in Iraq, could spread rapidly, according to Dr Ahmad Tarakji, president of the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams), the largest medical NGO still working in Syria.

Speaking to The Independent, Dr Tarakji said that Syria's already crippled medical infrastructure, and the lack of access available to aid agencies, meant the disease could spread quickly, both inside the country and across borders. "It spreads so easily. People are being displaced inside and outside, people are going to Europe," he said.

There are over 4 million registered Syrian refugees and nearly 8 million internally displaced. A 5-year-old boy who died last week [week of 19 Oct 2015] in Aleppo province was "very likely" to have been killed by cholera, Dr Tarakji said. In a memo to NGOs working in northern Syria, WHO said it was treating it as a "suspected case" of cholera and that initial tests were positive. "A huge number of people could be exposed," said Dr Tarakji, as "historically it affects people who are displaced."

The water-borne intestinal disease, which mostly affects children, can kill quickly if not treated, and is spread through unclean water and poor sanitation. Within Syria, and especially in areas outside of government control, water purification is increasingly difficult, and on the migrant trail, many Syrians may not have access to proper toilets or clean water, Dr Tarakji warned.

Dominique Legros, WHO's cholera chief, expressed concern last week [week of 19 Oct 2015] of "a spread towards the Middle East, towards Syria and refugee camps." But in Syria, any vaccination campaign would be nigh on impossible, Dr Tarakji said. While such a campaign was carried out for poliomyelitis when it emerged in Syria in late 2013, the country's medical infrastructure is now weaker.

"Cholera is treatable and preventable... but the basic right to be treated is not accessible by most people," Dr Tarakji said.

"With this constant destruction of the health infrastructure, we're paralysed," said Dr Tarakji. "We always call on the international community to act, but this [cholera] is a real threat."

[Given the disastrous situation in Syria with huge numbers of refugees and a public health infrastructure in ruins, it is not surprising that cholera would rear its ugly head. ProMED-mail awaits much of the statistical information on the scope of the outbreak. Importation of the cholera bacillus to Europe would not cause a serious issue in those countries with adequate sanitation and clean water, as the disease does not readily spread from person-to-person, but rather through contaminated food and water. - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - Iraq
Date: Thu 22 Oct 2015

Iraq's Health Ministry announced on [Wed 21 Oct 2015] that 91 new cases have been diagnosed over the past 24 hours, bringing the number of people affected in the current cholera epidemic to 1902, the Arabic-language al-Baghdadia satellite television network reported.

The report added that at least 49 new victims are from the central province of Babil. As many as 22 new people have contracted the disease in the central southern province of al-Diwaniyah, and 16 in Baghdad's al-Rusafa district, which lies on the eastern side of the river Tigris. 3 patients come from the southeastern Iraqi province of Maysan, and another one is from the oil-rich northern province of Kirkuk.

Ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium _Vibrio cholera_ causes the infection. The acute intestinal disease is fast-developing, and causes diarrhea, which can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death, if treatment is not promptly provided. Years of violence have stalled the infrastructural development of Iraq's rundown water and sewerage systems.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered a set of measures aimed at improving hygiene, among them daily water quality tests, distribution of bottled water to families internally displaced due to the conflict, and the installation of additional water purification stations.

A registered cholera outbreak in Iraq killed 4 people and infected some 300 others in the northern city of Kirkuk, situated 236 kilometers (147 miles) north of Baghdad, and the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region in 2012. 5 years before that, about 24 people died of the disease and over 4000 cases were confirmed.

Iraq faces regular threats from other water-borne and food-borne diseases due to poor public services and hygiene, according to the WHO.

The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
