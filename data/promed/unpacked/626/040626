Australia: Novel virus responsible for deaths of organ donation recipients
-----------------------------------------------
A virus unknown to medical science was behind the deaths of 3
Victorians who received organs from the one donor. The unnamed bug
has been linked to Ebola virus, [a virus] responsible for the deaths
of thousands in central Africa since the 1970s. [This is an incorrect
statement. The organ transplant-associated virus is not related to
Ebola virus; see part [2] below. - Mod.CP]. After baffling local
scientists, experts from New York's Columbia University were called
in to help solve the mystery of the multiple transplant deaths being
investigated by the coroner.
Initial investigations and tests had been unable to determine any
common link between the donor and the 3 recipients. The presence of
the virus in the recipients is thought to be a world first. One of
the New York team said: "The discovery of this virus is of national
and international significance."
The Sunday Herald Sun revealed the deaths in February 2007. A
63-year-old woman died after receiving a kidney transplant at Austin
Hospital. A 64-year-old man died after receiving a liver transplant
there. The 3rd victim received a kidney at Royal Melbourne Hospital.
The male donor whose organs carried the suspected killer bug had died
in Dandenong Hospital of a brain hemorrhage in December 2006 after
returning from overseas; it is believed most of his trip was spent in
Europe.
The virus is part of the rodent-borne arenavirus family and can cause
"old-world" diseases such as Yellow Fever, Ebola and Lymphocytic
choriomeningitis. [This statement is incorrect: yellow fever is
caused by a flavivirus and Ebola hemorrhagic fever is caused by a
filovirus; only lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is caused by an
old-world arenavirus. - Mod.CP]. Victoria's acting Chief Health
Officer, Dr John Carnie, confirmed the virus [LCM virus?] had been
detected in multiple samples from all 3 transplant patients. But
there was no evidence the virus represented a public health risk, he
said.
Health authorities are examining whether future donated organs can be
screened for [LCM?] virus. A spokesman for the Victoria Coroner's
office said families of the victims were told yesterday [21 Apr
2007]. There would be a formal inquest.
Experts from Columbia's Greene Infectious Diseases Laboratory helped
solve the mystery. Initial investigations and tests were unable to
determine any common link between the donor and the 3 recipients. Dr
Carnie said the risk to the public was minimal because "these viruses
[?] affect immunocompromised people, and it is rarely fatal in those
with normal immune systems. We have not had any indication of any
unexplained illnesses among families of the donor or recipients," he
said. "This would be the case if it was transmissible person to
person. Our supposition is it was transmitted by organ
transplantation."
Cutting edge techniques were used for the 1st time by the Greene lab
-- in collaboration with Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference
Laboratory -- to gene sequence the virus. "Our gene technology
enables unbiased sequencing of all agents present," Columbia's Prof.
Ian Lipkin said. "We found a handful (of combinations) that were
related to Lassa virus or LCM virus [both old world arenaviruses -
Mod.CP]. Using these clues we can confidently say this is a new
virus, present in the original organs and so different than anything
seen before."

Scientists Discover New Virus Responsible for Deaths of 3 Transplant
Recipients From Single Donor in Victoria, Australia
-----------------------------------------------
Knowledge of genetic sequence of virus will enable improvements in
screening to enhance transplantation safety. Scientists in the Greene
Infectious Disease Laboratory of Columbia University Mailman School
of Public Health and colleagues in the Victoria Infectious Diseases
Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia and 454 Life Sciences
have discovered a new virus that was responsible for the deaths of 3
transplant recipients who received organs from a single donor in
Victoria, Australia.
The previously unknown virus, which is related to lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), was found using rapid sequencing
technology established by 454 Life Sciences and bioinformatics
algorithms developed in the Greene Laboratory with support from the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Known strains
of LCMV have been implicated in a small number of cases of disease
transmission by organ transplantation [see references below],
however, the newly discovered virus is sufficiently different that it
could not be detected using existing screening methods.
Over 30 000 organ transplants are performed in the U.S. each year.
Knowledge of the genetic sequence of this virus will enable
improvements in screening that will enhance the safety of
transplantation.
Ian Lipkin, MD, director of the Greene Laboratory and Principal
Investigator of the Northeast Biodefense Center, emphasized the
importance of academic, public health, and industrial partnership in
this work. "This was a team effort. Drs. Mike Catton and Julian Druce
at the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory reached out
to us after a comprehensive state-of-the-art investigation failed to
turn up leads," stated Dr. Lipkin. "We succeeded in identifying the
virus responsible for the deaths by building on their work and
utilizing new tools for pathogen surveillance and discovery developed
in the Greene Laboratory and 454 Life Sciences."

[Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virtu (LCMV) is the type species of the
genus _Arenavirus_ of the _Areanviridae_ family of bipartitie genome
RNA viruses. The reservoir hosts of almost all arenaviruses are
rodents. LCMV is found in wild and laboratory mice, and other related
"old world" arenaviruses are found in African species of rodents.
Human LCMV infection may occur in rural and urban areas with high
densities of rodents. Laboratory-acquired infections occur
sporadically, and, previously, there have been a small number of
cases of LCMV transmission by organ transplantation as mentioned by
Professor Lipkin above. The virus detected by Professor Lipkin's
group appears to be an LCMV-like agent but distinct from previously
isolated strains of LCMV. It is unresolved, however, whether these
organ-transplanted viruses are merely passengers or are responsible
also for tissue-rejection illness and death. - Mod.CP]
