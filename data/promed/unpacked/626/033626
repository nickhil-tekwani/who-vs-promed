According to the Wyoming Department of Game and Fish (WDGF), a buck deer has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Deer Hunt Area 169. Although CWD has been previously confirmed in neighboring hunt areas, this is the 1st case documented in this area, which is south of Kaycee.

CWD, which is fatal to deer, moose, and elk, is a matter of great concern to the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. Deer populations in particular have been affected by the disease.

It is especially important hunters are informed, and WDGF quickly makes an announcement whenever CWD is found in a new hunt area. A map of CWD endemic areas is available on the Game and Fish website.

Recently, WDGF personnel have significantly increased their testing of CWD samples and, in 2017, they tested 3882 samples throughout the state.

Thus far, CWD has not proven to be transmittable to humans. However, in line with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control, WDGF advises that hunters should not consume any animal obviously ill or tests positive for CWD.

For more information on CWD transmission and regulations on transportation and disposal of carcasses, visit the Game and Fish website.

[Hunting season in many areas is either beginning or has been in effect for several weeks. Therefore, it is likely we will continue to see some of these positive cases filter in as the testing from hunting season continues.

This appears to be a spread of the disease as it has not been detected in this particular hunt area before. - Mod.TG
