YELLOW FEVER: TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, NEW - MALAYSIA

Malaysia no longer allows quarantine exemptions for certain persons
arriving in the country after visiting, or as residents of, countries where
yellow fever is endemic. Before action by the Malaysian Cabinet this week,
persons could avoid quarantine if their visit was invited or sponsored by
the government. Instead of quarantine these visitors were put under a
6-day medical watch. Now, all persons must have valid yellow fever
vaccination certificates upon arrival from the following countries:
Latin America - Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana,
Panama, Peru, Surinam and Venezuela.
Africa - Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad,
Congo, the Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,
Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger,
Nigeria, the Central African Republic, Rwanda, Sao Tome & Principe,
Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Somalia, Togo, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire
[The reason given for the change - that even with medical surveillance
these visitors could be bitten by mosquitoes and disease transmitted to
others - reflects the continuing problem Malaysia has had with mosquito
control over the past year, despite strict inspection and fumigation
programs. - DP]
