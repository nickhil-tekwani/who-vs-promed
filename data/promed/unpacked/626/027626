More flu cases confirmed; Kavre hit
-----------------------------------
A day after the government failed to declare bird flu emergency in Bhaktapur, the H5N1 strain of [avian influenza] was confirmed in chickens on 5 poultry farms in the district on Monday [12 Aug 2013], the day the flu was also confirmed in 3 farms in adjoining Kavre [Kavrepalanchok] district.

In Bhaktapur, chickens in farms belonging to [5 names withheld] were found to have been infected with the flu.

The government's preparations to declare Bhaktapur a bird flu emergency zone hit a roadblock on Sunday [11 Aug 2013] after the poultry sector objected to the idea. The District Avian Influenza Technical Coordination Committee of Bhaktapur, chaired by chief district officer (CDO) Himnath Dawadi had then concluded that the district will be kept under 'closer surveillance' for 3 more days before taking further steps.

Spokesperson of the Department of Livestock Services (DoLS) Dr Narayan Ghimire said they will have no option but to declare emergency and go for blanket slaughtering of the fowls if the situation does not change much after the 3-day surveillance.

However, CDO Dawadi claimed that Monday's [12 Aug 2013] confirmation was made in samples sent for tests some days ago and that they are not fresh outbreaks. "There is no need to worry. Rapid tests conducted in 19 poultry farms on Monday confirmed only one case of bird flu," he said. Government inspection teams have been visiting every farm in Bhaktapur since Thursday [8 Aug 2013] and conducting on-the-spot tests with a special kit they now have.

Meanwhile, in Kavre, over 32 000 chickens have been infected in the 3 poultry farms, according to the district veterinary office there. Dr Ghimire attributed the spread of the flu to the mobility of the owners and workers from one farm to another without adopting bio-safety measures. "One person owns many farms and labourers are shared. As such, chances of the virus spreading from one farm to another are high," he said.
