[1] Cholera - Djibouti (Tadjourah)

An outbreak of cholera that left 5 people dead in 2 villages in the
Tadjourah region of north western Djibouti has been contained, an official
with the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tue 29 May [2007].
"No new cases have been reported in the area since 18 May [2007],"
Djibouti-based WHO medical officer, Karim Djibaoui, told IRIN. Efforts to
bring the outbreak under control included setting up emergency treatment
centres in the affected areas, providing clean drinking water, and
launching a hygiene awareness campaign, he added.
About 76 cases of the disease, including the 5 fatalities, had been
reported in the area in the first 2 weeks of May 2007.
A Djibouti news agency, Agence Djiboutienne D'Information, said local
health officials had linked the latest outbreak in Hangade and Balho
localities, in Tadjourah, to the use of water from a contaminated well by
illegal immigrants.

[On 28 May 2007, local health director, Monteiro Antonio, informed ANGOP
that over the past 5 days, 5 new cholera cases have been identified in
Sambizanga district, in Luanda.] According to Antonio, the [occurrence] of
the disease in the area was caused by the constant rains that fell in the
Angolan capital (Luanda) from February to April 2007, as well as the poor
drainage in the region.
Since the start of 2007, Sambizanga district has already registered 883
cases of cholera, 18 of which have resulted in death.

Nine people have died of cholera in Busia district. The area minister of
health (MOH), Dr Silas Ayunga, says all the deaths occurred at
Port-Victoria sub-district hospital where the victims had been admitted for
treatment. He said Bukoma and Sango Islands in Port-Victoria, Budalangi
division, were the hardest hit by the outbreak.
The deaths prompted the MOH to recall all staff on leave back on duty to
deal with the situation. He also instructed the public health officers in
Budalangi division to close down eating premises that posed a health threat.
Meanwhile, at least 7 people have died of cholera in Siaya district in the
last month. The area district medical officer of health, Dr Elizabeth
Okoth, said the area recorded 50 cases of the disease over the same period,
23 of which were treated at local hospitals and discharged. She said others
are still [under observation] in the health institutions.
The doctor called residents of the area to observe proper hygiene, and
ensure that each home has a pit latrine and stop the habit of relieving
themselves in thickets as this fuels the spread of the disease.

A woman and 2 children succumbed to cholera, as health officials raised a
fresh alert over another outbreak in Northeastern Province. The deaths
bring to 17 the number of people killed by the waterborne disease since
last month [April 2007].
A mother and her daughter, aged 5, died in the Dadaab refugee camps in
Garissa District, while the other, a 10 year old, was a resident of Liboi
division at the Kenya-Somalia border. Provincial medical officer of health,
Dr Omar Ahmed, said about 60 refugees at the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camps have been admitted to hospitals
with symptoms of the disease. He said more than 118 cases had been
reported, including 10 who died in Mandera District.
Cholera was first detected early this year [2007], in the Garissa refugee
camps, at the height of influx of immigrants from volatile Somalia.
The outbreak also comes after the provincial public health officer, Dr
Ahmed Fankey, ordered the closure of the main health facility in the camps
[as a result of] poor sanitation.

Lack of appropriate health and sanitation facilities, as well as poor
sensitization of local communities have encouraged the spread of cholera in
the Bouenza area of Congo, officials said. According to an epidemiological
bulletin published by Congolese health authorities, 21 cases of the disease
have been reported in Loutete, of whom 7 died. Another 207 cases have been
reported in Loudima, of whom 8 died, since the beginning of May 2007.
The bulletin was produced by the national cholera crisis committee, headed
by Jeannine Bahou.
The most affected areas are more than 200 km (124.3 mi) south west of the
capital, Brazzaville. In January [2007], the Congolese health ministry
reported cases of cholera in Pointe-Noire, the country's 2nd-largest town,
with 800 000 people. Later, the disease spread to Brazzaville and other
southern regions of the country. At least 6480 people were affected in
Pointe-Noire, of whom 62 died. At the time, the outbreak was thought to
have been caused by heavy rains and poor hygiene conditions in
Pointe-Noire, as well as via passengers on the regular air flights that
link the cities.
"The last cases occurred in Brazzaville, on 5 Apr 2007, and in the Kouilou
Region, where Pointe-Noire is located, on 29 Apr 2007," the bulletin noted
on 15 May 2007.

Reports from Dhobley in southern Somalia indicate that cholera has severely
weakened internally displaced people in the area, who fled the continuous
fighting in Mogadishu, the Somali capital.
Dahir Ahmed, a medical officer in the Lower Jubba provincial settlement of
Dhobley, near the Kenyan border, said the infection is spreading among
families who escaped from the aftermath in Mogadishu. "The disease is
particularly increasing among children and older people who fled Mogadishu
fighting and there are no clinics or hospitals that can provide the
diarrhea-infected patients with the proper medicine," he said.
Shabelle correspondent in Dhobley, Qorane Ismail, said areas where patients
with watery diarrhea are quarantined [are overwhelmingly full] as doctors
have been working hard on the clock to cure the patients. "Patients, most
of them children, could be seen lying on the ground where a large number of
weak patients beset by the outbreak are brought in to be cured. So far,
relatives and parents of the patients said they had no money to buy
medicine for their loved ones," doctors said.

Classes at Sir Seretse Khama Junior Secondary School in Gaborone recently
came to a halt as many of the students complained of diarrhea and
headaches. The outbreak, which forced close to 200 students out of classes
on Mon 21 May 2007, started with a few students requesting to go to the
clinic after complaining of headaches and diarrhea last Fri 18 May 2007.
Deputy school head, Gloria Makhanhlela, said, "Quite a handful asked for
permission to go home complaining of headache and diarrhea. Teachers on
duty alerted us about the problem. They thought the illnesses might have
been caused by the change of weather. But in the afternoon, more students
showed signs of sickness and we phoned parents who came to take their
affected children to the clinic," said Makhanhlela.
On Mon 21 May 2007, the school alerted students of the outbreak of diarrhea
at the general assembly. "We asked those with signs of diarrhea to come
forward and about 191 students did. We used the school bus to transport
them to Block 8 and Block 6 clinics where they received medical attention.
After lunch we sent the rest of the students home."
