The arrival of spring for some of nature's 4-legged creatures means waking
from a winter slumber with a nasty case of distemper. Other animals, weak
from hibernation and in need of food, become infected shortly after heading
out from their dens.
Raccoons can acquire canine distemper, especially where their populations
are large or concentrated. Distemper is a viral disease that infects
raccoons, foxes, coyotes, skunks and unvaccinated dogs; it does not affect
humans. The disease is spread when animals have direct contact with the
body fluids or droppings from an infected animal.
Thomaston Animal Control Officer Kathy Virgie and Rockport ACO Maynard
Stanley have seen their fair share of distemper-infected raccoons and
skunks this spring. Virgie has caught at least a dozen infected raccoons in
Thomaston, while Stanley said he has caught close to 15 in his area. He has
also caught other infected animals. "I have a skunk with distemper in the
back of my truck right now," said Stanley via cell phone on Monday.
Fearing rabies, officials sent the first 2 sick animals found in Thomaston
to the state laboratory for testing, according to Thomaston Police Chief
Kevin Haj. "[They were] negative, but they tested positive for distemper,"
Haj said. "We were told that from then on, when we get any ill ones, it's
likely going to be distemper."
Stanley said that while some animals probably went into hibernation last
fall with distemper and never woke up, others aren't in good condition
coming out of winter and so are more susceptible to infection.
He is not alarmed about the rash of infected animals, pointing to nature's
way of culling out the sick and maintaining healthier populations.
"We used to hunt these animals to keep their numbers down but now that
we're not doing that as much, nature is stepping in and thinning them out
for us," Stanley said.
People are doing their part to make the problem of infected animals worse,
however. Both Haj and Stanley urged people not to feed wild animals, which
encourages greater numbers of young, lessens the fear of humans, and puts
animals in closer contact with humans and pets, thus increasing possible
exposure to disease.
"Please don't feed or befriend them, as they can turn around and bite you
and then you're faced with getting sick," Haj said.
Haj and Stanley also urged people to stay away from animals that appear
unhealthy or that are acting out of character. When someone sees one of
these animals, they should call their local police department and keep
children and pets indoors to prevent exposure to potential diseases.
Stanley said that common symptoms of distemper in animals include puffy
eyes with a yellow discharge. Animals may appear disoriented, walk in
circles or be found in unusual places such as streets or driveways in the
middle of the day. During later stages of the disease, they will appear
lethargic and weak in their hindquarters with possible ongoing diarrhea.
"These animals aren't aggressive, but they are in pain and very
uncomfortable," said Stanley. "They don't know what's happening to them and
they are in a bad way and they just want it to end. Distemper is always
fatal to wild animals."
Distemper is not the same disease as rabies, although some of the symptoms
are similar. Stanley said that so far this year, Knox County has not had a
confirmed case of rabies. In 2005 there were 2 confirmed cases, including
one in a a raccoon in Appleton and one in a a skunk in Union. This year in
Lincoln County, 4 cases of rabies in raccoons have been confirmed,
including 2 in Boothbay, one in Damariscotta and one in Nobleboro. The
Boothbay cases also led to the death in recent weeks of 5 dogs that had
been exposed to the infected raccoons.

[Distemper is somewhat common in many states. However, it is wise to be
cautious, as the primary differential is rabies, especially in raccoons. -
