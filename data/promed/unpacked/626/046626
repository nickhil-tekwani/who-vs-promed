EMOC Notice 1: Finding of Broiler Chickens Serologically Positive for Avian
Influenza in Connecticut - No Virus Isolated
-------------------------
Antibodies to the H7N2 subtype avian influenza were detected in broiler
chickens from a multi-age operation in Scotland, CT. However, *NO
influenza virus was isolated* [emphasis added - Mod.JW when the tracheal
and cloacal swabs and environmental samples were tested at the National
Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa. The H7N2 antibodies were
detected in one of 2 houses on the premises, each containing approximately
8000 birds; all 16 000 birds were destroyed because they were no longer
marketable due to the seropositivity.
On 7 Nov 2001, ProMED-mail reported that avian influenza virus was
discovered on the same Connecticut premises. This report is inaccurate.
There has been NO virus isolated from the premises.
If you have any questions, please contact the USDA, APHIS, Veterinary
Services, Emergency Programs staff at 301-734-7208, 800-940-6524, or
<EMOC@APHIS.USDA.GOV>.
Please forward this information to other Federal, State, and industry
counterparts as necessary.

[Our correspondent in the USDA writes:
"We have been inundated by requests from our trading partners about the
ProMED-mail-reported "outbreak" of AI in the US. Serologic evidence for AI
does not translate to an "outbreak." We periodically see low pathogenic AI
virus, H7N2, in the New York City live bird market. Occasionally it spills
over into commercial birds and we depopulate. The OIE rules for reporting
are very clear - isolation of virus and inoculation of susceptible chickens
(to demonstrate that the virus is highly pathogenic) are used to define a
reportable event -- so the inference that we failed to report an "outbreak"
is absolutely not true."
ProMED-mail regrets the error. - Mod.JW
