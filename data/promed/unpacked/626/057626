Two people have died in Meru from suspected anthrax outbreak that has left 9 other fighting for their lives. A statement issued by the Meru County government on [Wed 24 Apr 2019] said the [remaining] 9 are receiving treatment at the Muthara Level IV Hospital. The [11] patients were admitted with swellings that turned into wounds. Doctors said patients with the swellings on their necks also had difficulty breathing. "Two patients died due to the infection and samples have been sent to Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) in Nairobi for confirmatory tests," said Meru County's Director of Communication Purity Nkirote.

The patients are said to have told doctors they consumed the carcass of a cow that died from an unidentified disease at Muthara. The infected people also blamed the illness on insect bites. Meru County Health Chief Officer Kanana Kimonye said investigations are underway to confirm the strange disease. "We have been getting some cases from Tigania East and our public health officers are on the ground to establish whether it is an insect bite or something else. When we have the correct information, we will inform the public on how to prevent the infection," Dr. Kimonye said.

The county's Public Health Director Mutabari Inanga said they had received reports of the disease outbreak in Muthara and Karama at the onset of the Easter holiday. "We cannot say it is an insect bite or anthrax because it has mainly affected children and a few women. No men are affected. If we say it is anthrax, why are men not affected yet they slaughter animals?"

"We are now looking into insect bites and are engaging entomologists to assist us in identifying the insect that may be causing the problem. Officers are at the affected homes and will find out if there are others unreported cases," Dr. Inanga said.

Doctors have urged locals to watch out for signs and symptoms, including face inflammation, breathing problems and unexplained wounds.

[While bites from haematophagious tabanid flies can result in cutaneous anthrax lesions in humans, and is a common source of infection with livestock, the puzzler is that the cases were restricted to children and a few women. When the source of infection is a butchered sick bovine it is usual to see cutaneous lesions in the butchering team, men and boys. Women usually get infected from handling contaminated meat.

Of course the answer may lie in that the investigating team is made up of medics, not veterinarians, and therefore centered on the village community. African children are occupied looking after livestock, usually sheep and goats, and will be out with the livestock. And if more than one animal was infected they will be subjected to bites from the flies feeding on this 2nd or 3rd carcass, or even the remains of the 1st carcass. As the men were busy butchering, the women would have helped bring the livestock back to the village at the end of the day and got exposed.

Easter is a family holiday as well as a day of religious celebration and other sick cattle will have been butchered, thus explaining the other suspect events in Karama and Tigania East.
