A United Nations medical worker [originally from Sudan] who was infected with Ebola in Liberia has died despite "intensive medical procedures," authorities said Tue [14 Oct 2014]. The St. Georg hospital in Leipzig said the 56-year-old man, whose name has not been released, died overnight of the infection. It released no further details. The man tested positive for Ebola on 6 Oct 2014, prompting Liberia's UN peacekeeping mission to place 41 staff members who had possibly been in contact with him under "close medical observation." He arrived in Leipzig for treatment on 9 Oct 2014, where he was put into a special isolation unit...

"The lone person believed to have had direct contact with the Ebola [nurse] works at Fort Worth-based Alcon and was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with no symptoms," a company spokeswoman said...

Alcon is a medical company that specializes in eye care products. The Alcon employee is being hospitalized as a precaution, the statement said, adding: "The Alcon associate has not shown any signs or symptoms of the Ebola virus. After consultation with the Texas Department of Health, we are confident that there is no risk for Alcon associates. We are working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Texas Department of Health to ensure we are following proper public health measures." ...

[3] Prevention & false alarms

Belgium: No Ebola checks at Brussels Airport after flights from Liberia
-----------------------------------------------
Mon 13 Oct 2014: (NBC News) It's the classic airport scene: a man hugs his wife and 2 daughters at arrivals. But in this case, the traveler had just stepped off a plane from the Ebola-stricken Liberian capital of Monrovia, meaning that some might shy away from such embraces. "I've been screened before getting on the plane," he pointed out before heading for the exit. The twice-weekly flight from Monrovia to Brussels is now the only air link from that city to the European continent and is the route most Americans would likely travel on their way home. Thomas Eric Duncan, who died in a Dallas hospital last week, traveled to the U.S. from Liberia via Brussels... http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/no-ebola-checks-brussels-airport-after-flights-liberia-n223581

Brazil: Man suspected of carrying Ebola tested negative again.
-----------------------------------------------
Mon 13 Oct 2014: (WSJ) A man suspected of carrying the ebolavirus was tested negative for the 2nd time, Brazil's Health Ministry said Mon [13 Oct 2014]. The test eliminates the possibility of Ebola, Health Minister Arthur Chioro told reporters. The man, identified by authorities as a 47-year-old from Guinea, one of the 3 countries hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak, was isolated at a Rio de Janeiro hospital... Doctors were still monitoring for other possible diseases, even after Ebola had been ruled out... Two blood tests were made, following standard protocol to deal with the deadly virus. Dozens of people who had contact with the man were monitored, but now they are no longer under watch, he said. The minister said the case showed Brazil is ready to deal with the epidemic. He also said that the risk of contagion in the country is low. http://online.wsj.com/articles/in-brazil-man-suspected-of-carrying-ebola-tested-negative-again-1413231294

Kenya ex South Sudan: passenger dies, Ebola negative
----------------------------------------------------------------
Mon 13 Oct 2014: (Hara Ethiopia) Anxiety has gripped Kenya after a female passenger from South Sudan died on Saturday night [11 Oct 2014] from Ebola-like symptoms after arriving in the country. Health officials at Kenya's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) told Xinhua on Sun [12 Oct 2014] that the female passenger on board the Kenya Airways flight alighted at 6:45 p.m. with high fever and bleeding from the openings of her body. "We have not established what exactly caused the death, but medical officials including the director of medical services are carrying out tests to establish the cause," an official who sought anonymity told Xinhua by telephone.

The official said the female passenger who had arrived from Juba was later rushed to the hospital but died in the evening... The incident caused panic at the busy airport, which was immediately deserted for hours after the death of the passenger... Kenya is vulnerable because it is a major transport hub, with many flights from West Africa, a WHO official said...

[The passenger tested negative for Ebola virus disease: http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2000137966/suspected-ebola-case-at-jkia-tests-negative.

The Ethiopian and Kenyan governments said that they would not ban flights from the 4 countries hit by Ebola. Ethiopia's and Kenya's national carriers are major airlines connecting countries across Africa and have on their part been pursuing the usual flights into West Africa. Bole international airport [Addis Ababa] and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) [Nairobi] so far haven't any infrared thermometers or non-contact thermometers to measure body temperature of in-bound and out-bound passengers for possible Ebola symptoms. - Mod.JW]

Mon 13 Oct 2014: (BellaNaija) Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Nigeria Ebola-free, the government has been doing everything within its power to ensure that status is maintained. As a result, precautionary measures are being taken as 850 Nigerian soldiers who are on a peace-keeping mission in Liberia, where the Ebola epidemic is rampant, return to Nigeria in March 2015. Arrangements are already being made to quarantine the soldiers in Gwagwalada, Abuja for 28 days before they rejoin their respective platoons, The Stream reports. http://www.bellanaija.com/2014/10/13/ebola-850-nigerian-soldiers-returning-from-liberia-to-be-quarantined/

Sierra Leone: peacekeepers bound for Somalia quarantined over Ebola
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue 14 Oct 2014 (Reuters) A battalion of 800 Sierra Leone soldiers awaiting deployment as peacekeepers in Somalia has been placed in quarantine after one of its members tested positive for the deadly ebolavirus, military officials said on Tue [14 Oct 2014]. The soldiers were due to relieve the West African nation's contingent already deployed with Somalia's African Union peacekeeping mission, known as AMISOM. However, they will now be subject to a 21-day isolation period, a senior officer in Sierra Leone's army told Reuters, asking not to be named. Colonel Michael Samoura, spokesman of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces, confirmed that a member of the battalion had tested positive for the disease. He said the soldier was infected after leaving the military camp where the force is based without permission... http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/us-health-ebola-idUSKCN0I311420141014
