Whirling disease found at Utah's prized Strawberry Reservoir
------------------------------------------------------------
Most anglers and biologists feared that it was inevitable that
whirling disease would find its way into Strawberry Reservoir, one of
Utah's most important flat-water trout fisheries.

That inevitability occurred this week [week of 28 Nov 2011] when fish
pathologists from the Division of Wildlife Resources [DWR] tested 60
kokanee salmon collected at Strawberry and found spores from the
parasite in 2 of them.

The good news for anglers is that, while whirling disease is still a
major concern, much has been learned about how to counteract its
effects on a fishery. The disease was first discovered in Utah in 1991
in a private fish hatchery in Wayne County owned by the family of
then-Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. Whirling disease doesn't harm people. But
the disease can be fatal to small trout and salmon. The disease causes
infected fish to often swim in a whirling motion before they die, thus
giving the disease its name.

"This would have been a much different matter if it had happened in
the mid-1990s," said Roger Wilson, chief of the DWR's aquatic section.
"We know a lot more about whirling disease and what happens [to the
fish] post infection. It's still a great concern, and we would prefer
not have it. We are in a situation where we can live with this
parasite, even in a place like Strawberry."

Wilson said biologists expected to find whirling disease at Strawberry
sooner. It can be moved by anglers, boats, flowing water, or birds.
The disease was found several years ago in the West Fork of the
Duchesne River. Water from the river eventually empties into
Strawberry Reservoir through an aqueduct and collector system.

Veteran Utah angler and Fish Tech tackle shop owner Byron Gunderson
was not surprised by the discovery. "It was inevitable," he said. "It
was just a matter of time. That stuff leaks from here to there, so it
wasn't particularly unexpected." Wilson said that the disease affects
mostly small trout. Once trout grow from fry to fingerling size, the
chances of the fish developing clinical signs of the disease diminish
rapidly.

Biologists plant rainbow and cutthroat into Strawberry that are a
minimum of 8 inches [20 cm] long, a size not affected by the disease.
And most of the rainbows planted into the big reservoir are a
whirling-disease-resistant strain known as Harrison-Hoffer. Wilson
said that the agency would expand the use of the strain at Strawberry
in the future.

An audit issued to the Utah Legislature on the DWR's hatchery program
this week was somewhat critical of the agency for its hatchery
program. But Wilson said the way Strawberry is managed shows why the
state's hatchery system sometimes needs to produce bigger fish that
cost more money. All of the rainbow trout in the reservoir are stocked
by the DWR, which also stocks kokanee and cutthroat. In addition, the
Bear Lake cutthroat trout planted in Strawberry are also more
resistant than some other cutthroat strains.

"All of these things we come up with on the management end make it
more difficult on the hatchery system," he said.

Another major concern is how the disease might affect cutthroat and
kokanee trout that spawn naturally in Strawberry's tributaries. Those
fish also add to the number of fish in the reservoir. Kokanee salmon
are particularly susceptible to whirling disease.

Wilson said that 15 to 20 per cent of the adult age cutthroat [trout]
produced at Strawberry come from its tributaries, though that
percentage has been as high as 65 per cent in the past. An aggressive
stream restoration program on the Strawberry River could mean less
habitat for the parasite host that causes whirling disease. Most of
the cutthroat [trout] caught by anglers, though, are hatchery raised.

"I don't know how successful the spawn has been as far as the
cutthroats go," said Gunderson. "Few of my customers ever catch
cutthroats. Rainbow planting has been successful because they have
been raising fish to a larger size before they grow up."

[Whirling disease affects fish in the trout and salmon [Salmonidae]
family. By damaging cartilage, whirling disease can kill young fish
directly, or cause infected fish to swim in an uncontrolled whirling
motion. This can make it impossible for them to escape predators or to
effectively seek food.

Whirling disease is caused by a microscopic parasite called _Myxobolus
cerebralis_. The parasite was introduced to the United States from
Europe in the 1950s and has spread to many streams across the country.
The whirling disease parasite has been found in wild fish and fish
hatcheries in 25 states.

Once established in a stream, the parasite cannot be eradicated, nor
can its worm host, without significantly damaging the ecosystem.
Whirling disease has no known human health effects. Currently there is
no known treatment for affected fish. However, practice management in
hatcheries can reduce the risk.

The disease does not affect humans, only fish in the trout and salmon
family. The infective stage of the parasite can penetrate human skin
and tissues but it does not survive at a human's natural body
temperature. Therefore the disease is harmless to humans and even if
an infected fish is consumed, it will not affect humans.

The disease can be quite devastating to fish and is a concern for all
when it is found in a body of water. Anglers can help by disinfecting
boats, boots, lines, live-wells, and other equipment prior to arrival
at a new/different body of water.
