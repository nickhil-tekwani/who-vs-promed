The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has discovered an outbreak caused by the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. So far, the infection has been detected in 4 people.

The samples were taken between February and August this year [2022]. The 4 people are aged 50 to 90, 2 women and 2 men, and they live in Nordland, Trøndelag, Oslo, and Viken. All have been hospitalized.

Bacteria with the same genetic profile have been detected in samples from all 4 patients. In addition, there is one suspected case awaiting final clarification of the test result.

The Institute of Public Health has collaborated with the municipal health service, the microbiological laboratories, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Veterinary Institute to map whether the patients may have a common source of infection.

A total of 3 of the 4 patients have been interviewed by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. All stated to have eaten smoked salmon or smoked trout in the time before they became ill and 2 of them ate smoked salmon from the same producer. During the outbreak investigation, the outbreak bacteria was found in a low concentration in a product from this manufacturer. The sample was a routine sample taken in connection with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority's monitoring program for ready-to-eat products in 2022.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority, therefore, carried out an inspection of the manufacturer and obtained several environmental samples which were analyzed at the Veterinary Institute. The bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_ was found in the samples and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority has therefore decided that the company had to withdraw more products from the market.

Listeriosis is a rare but serious disease that mainly affects pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, and the elderly with a weakened general condition. _Listeria_ is usually transmitted through food, especially refrigerated foods with a long shelf life that are eaten without further heat treatment.

- People in risk groups, i.e. pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, and elderly people with a weakened general condition should avoid food products that can cause a risk of listeriosis, says senior advisor Heidi Lange at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

Typical food products where there may be a risk of listeriosis bacteria are smoked fish, shaved fish, soft and semi-soft cheeses, unpasteurized milk, and some sliced meats.

[Because _Listeria monocytogenes_, a Gram-positive bacterium that causes listeriosis, can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, _Listeria_-contaminated refrigerated, ready-to-eat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon or cold-cut meats (e.g., ham), are recognized as potential sources for listeriosis. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk are other frequent sources of listeriosis. However, dairy products in some outbreaks have been contaminated with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization.

Clusters of possibly related cases of listeriosis are presumed to have a common source if _Listeria_ isolated from the cases have a similar genotype, based on whole genome sequencing, as in the current cluster of cases in Norway. A food history is taken from patients to identify a particular food item eaten by most of the patients. The food item is identified as the source if the genotype of the outbreak strain matches that of the _Listeria_ isolated from the food item. In this outbreak in Norway, the outbreak strain was also found in environmental samples taken at the food-producing facility. However, we are not told of the name of the implicated food producer, nor the types of food or their lot numbers suspected to be contaminated, but apparently, multiple food items produced at the facility have been recalled.

Nordland is a county in northern Norway; Trøndelag is a county in the central part of Norway; Viken is a county in southeastern Norway; and Oslo is a county, the capital and most populous city of Norway (https://www.mappr.co/counties/norway/).
